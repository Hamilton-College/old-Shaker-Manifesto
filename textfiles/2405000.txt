HISTORY OF SOUTH UNION, KY. No. 7. T'T was on the 29th inst. that Elder John Rankin and Br. Jefferson Shannon left home in a buggy for Union Village, O. They intended to go through Green River and Hartford, and after securing a place for Elder John on the cars or in a steamboat Br. Jefferson would return with the carriage. The condition of the country, however, so frightened them, that they hesitated to go farther, through fear that Elder John could not get back. Some of the officers told them that they could go on to Louisville, but could give no assurance of getting through the lines on their return. After some further consideration they concluded it would be for the best to return to their home as soon as consistent. At Morgantown they met with a company of Union Cavalry under the command of Col. Burbage. They also met with a company of northern Infantry under Capt. McHenry, who gave them a pass on to Hartford. While on their return homeward, they met about three hundred Confederate Cavalry in pursuit of the Union soldiers. Oct. 31. Elder John Rankin and Br. Jefferson Shannon reached home in safety not far from six o'clock, p. m. Their return was a surprise, but gave us great pleasure, and we were interested to inform them of what had happened during their absence. It was on the same day they left home that our horses and wagons were taken from us. To Br. Jefferson such news was ill news and he appeared to be astonished, but Elder John accepted it very calmly, as though it was no more than he had expected. Nov. 1. Lieutenant Col. Campbell with eight pickets rode into the VilMAY 102 THE MANIFESTO. lage and asked the Brethren for a place for themselves, and one for th'ir horses over night. They were directed to the Trustees' Office, where the men were kindly cared for, while their horses were taken to the barn. Soon after and during a heavy rain storm, Capt. Level with seventy-five Cavalry calied for shelter, and then informed us that they would stop during the night. This company of seventy-five men were sent to the West family, where they could occupy the new laundry and some other buildings. A supper was furnished for both companies. For their horses they had taken the cow barn without liberty, as the herdsman was away. The cut feed that had been prepared for the cows, they fed to their horses, so that the poor cows were obliged to stay out all night in the rain, and be deprived of their supper. In the morning Capt. Level and his company appeared very grateful for the kind treatment they had received at the hands of the Brethren, especially for being so well sheltered from the storm. They remarked that on the night previous they passed through Russellville, and were obliged to pitch their tents in the dark, as the citizens would offer them no shelter. One man who had promised to let them sleep on his hay mow, securely locked his barn before they arrived and would not let them enter the building, and yet he was a strong secessionist and a pretended friend. One of these poor fellows remarked:ï¿½'I wish I was at home,' when his companion replied, 'I guess you will never see your home again.' This company was marching to Bowling Green to report to the General at that place. We now found that we were to all intents and purposes in the land of 'Dixie.' The western part of Kentucky is now under the control of the Confederates and this includes our (Society. Nov. 18. John C. Breckenridge with Ms brigade passed through our village on their way to Russellville. He had five regiments. One of Cavalry and four of Infantry. They went to Russellville to guard the Legislature that had assembled in that place to form a provisional government for Kentucky. It was sad to see so many human beings, who ought to be engaged in the service of their country, marching toward the battle fields to meet their brother man in deadly conflict. Some were under great excitement and gave wild cheers for Jefferson Davis, while others appeared very thoughtful and depressed. Not less than one hundred and ten wagons passed our home laden with tents or provisions. When the Confederate army under General S. B. Buckner, took possession of Bowling Green, one of his soldiers hauled down the United States flag and then, to express his utter contempt, stamped the flag under his feet. While engaged in this act he fell from the building and broke both of his legs. In a few days he died and, no doubt, received the reward of his works. THE MANIFESTO. 103 Dec. 9. Capt. Taylor called upon us very early in the morning and asked us to have breakfast ready at eight o'clock for two hundred and fifty Cavalry that had camped during ttie night some eight or ten miles distant. Two of our families united and prepared the breakfast as best we could in the limited time afforded us. The Brethren carried the food to the West family and spread the tables, with which the soldiers seemed to be well satisfied. We us; d Sassafras bark for tea and burned rye for coffee. We also gave them a good supply of milk, and these were probably as good for them as tea from China or coffee from Java. Soon after breakfast the whole company moved on toward Russellville. Dec. 10. Capt. McLamore with one hundred and fifty Cavalry entered one of our fields to rest and to eat their scanty allowance. The Captain called on us for forty pounds of bread for his men, and a dinner for himself and four of his officers. Most of these soldiers were poor Kentuckians. They were tired and hungry and did not seem to be reconciled to their condition. We baked more bread than was ordered and on taking it to the Captain he very gruffly remarked, 'I only ordered forty pounds.' The Brethi'en who had carried a good supply of apples to the soldiers told the Captain that they would be very modi rate in their charge. Dec. 12. John McLean, our Trustee, made a trip to the Southern States to sell some garden seeds, and to purchase a quantity of sugar with the Confederate money he had received. Prosperity attended Br. John on his journey and he returned with a good supply of sugar. Some of this he could spare for the neighbors and receive for it good U. S. money. Dec. 19. The southern pickets Cavalry, rode into the village at about seven o'clock p. m. and called for supper to be prepared for four hundred persons. The order was to have it ready by eight o'clock. We informed the officer that we were unable to^ provide for so many in so short a time. He then said we could cook for one hundred and twenty-five. All the available help was soon engaged at the family dwelling and the food was in readiness at the appointed hour. The soldiers, however, had not arrived, and we waited until the hour of midnight when, instead of one hundred and twentyfive, the company uumbered five hundred tired and hungry Cavalry men. We did the best we could under the circumstances, and all might have shared in the food if the commander had attended to his duty. After all the food which was supplied to this company had been eaten or pocketed, another company of thirty soldiers came and asked for a supper and said they had not eaten anything during the day. In pity for the poor men, the Sisters were induced to prepare a supper for this midnight company. The Captain had the soldiers enter the dooryard as carefully as they could, that others might not be disturbed and the food was carried to them as they lay on the ground. After this company had been kindly cared for, the Colonel informed the Brethren that two hundred more soldiers were coming who were just 104 THE MANIFESTO. as tired and hungry as those who came first. The Brethren, however, insisted that the Sisters were not able to do any more at the present time and after a consultation this last company went on to Bowling Green. Dec. 27. A company of iifty-h've Cavalry fYom Louisiana called and asked to be accommodated during the night. The men were provided with a supper, and in the morning with a good breakfast, and theii' horses also received kind care. Dec. 31. Six Cavalry pickets called for breakfast. This was soon provided. The company then remained near the premises till noon and a dinner was sent them. In the p. m. twenty-one more soldiers asked for accommodations during the night. A supper was furnished and then a house in which to sleep, and in the morning a breakfast was sent to them. Nine others belonging to this same company were accommodated at the railroad station. We learned that this company was sent out to guard the highway and also the railroad. (To be continued.)
