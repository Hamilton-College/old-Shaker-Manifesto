THE SHAKERS WERE IN TOWN. The quaint people who were seen on the streets yesterday were the Alfred Shakers who came on their annual picnic to the islands. The men 'wore broad-brimmed hats and plain clothes, while the women wTere quite generally dressed in plain gray dresses, with the plain skirts, short waists and shoulder capes of long ago. Almost invariably their heads were covered with the peculiar bonnets known as 'shakers.' Several young girls of the party wore hats more like the hats of the world's people. These young girls have been adopted by the Shakers, and are expected in time to become members of the order. Elder Vance had charge of the party, and late yesterday afternoon was quite conspicuous as he marched on ahead of the double file of quaintly dressed sisters who followed demurely. Their appearance excited considerable curiosity and comment, and not a few expressions of good will from those who have had dealings with the Shakers. For they are an upright people, universally respected.
