Narcoossee, Fla. April, 1899. The warm, growing weather of the past ten days begins to show us the extent of the injury to the fruit tiees and pine-apple plants, resulting from the freeze. All our little household have been very anxious about our pine apples, as they have been and still are our main dependence for an earthly subsistence. They have been carefully watched every day since the freeze, and now the report comes that we are good for seven-eights of a crop. So says Brother Egbert who is presiding chairman of the Committee. These peculiar experiences are teaching the people of Florida the value of true knowledge in horticultural as well as in agricultural cultivation. Pine-apple growers are now building tight board fences around their plants, which may be used as a protection, in case of cold weather. Small fires are also used for this same purpose. The peach trees were frost-bitten on Feb. 13th, but now they have put out new foliage and a few are in blossom. Pear trees, although young, have come through all right. The sons of Florida will not be found sleeping while the enemy is near, and they are now shedding whole orchards with tight board fences. With a fence and the fires they claim they can govern the temperature and save their orchards from harm. So do not be surprised, dear Editor, when you visit Florida should you see the state under a farmer's canopy. Andrew Barrett.
