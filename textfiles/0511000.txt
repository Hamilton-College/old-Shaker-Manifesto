THE FIRST SHOT St. Loins claims the honor of being the first to shoot a materialized spirit. We have received three numbers of the St. Louis Republican, containing a detailed account of a seance held by W. C. Clark, as medium, but exclusively under the supervision of Henry Timpkins. He had offered the medium $50 for the privilege of shooting the spirit when it became visible. He did shoot it, with a rifle, as soon as it appeared. The cabinet and all its appurtenances were improvised and arranged by Timpkins and the city reporters, the medium's clothes all changed and himself secured as best they could devise. When the seance ended, he was found just as they left him. The money was paid upon the spot, and no one breathes any suspicion of trick or fraud, except the Scientific American, hundreds of miles away in another city and State. It is accepted as one of the most wonderful and unaccountable occurrences of the day — totally inexplicable — except upon the theory of genuine spirit materialization. Here follows a letter from the medium to the editor of S. &amp; S. and his answer thereto.
