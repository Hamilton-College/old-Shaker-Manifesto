Red flannel underwear Red Flannel Underwear.â€”Winter or summer, nothing better can be worn next the skin than a loose, red woolen, flannel shirt ; red, for white flannel fulls up, mats together,, and becomes tight, heavy, and impervious ; woolen, not cotton, because that merely absorbs the moisture from the surface, while (woolen) flannel conveys it from the skin, and deposits it in drops on the outside of the shirt, where it is soon dried without injury to the body.
