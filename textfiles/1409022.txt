HOURS. GRANVILLE TEMPLE SPROAT. There is an eastern allegory of which the following is a transcript: A youth was walking on the seashore. Being overcome with fatigue, he sat down on a rock. He fell into a slumber, and the following vision passed before his eyes. The Angel of Life stood before him, and said, ' Seest thou those muffled and veiled figures in human form coining out of the mist on the distant shore of the sea?' ' I see them, ' replied the youth. ' Watch them attentively, ' said the Angel. 'They have a lesson to teach thee. It is a lesson of wisdom Be silent, and obey. ' The youth kept his eyes on the muffled and veiled figures. They approached the place where he was sitting. There were twelve of them. They said not a word; but walked silently along the shore. On their white, flowing drapery the youth saw inscriptions written in characters of light, very beautiful. They moved mysteriously along, and silently glided into the thick mist that lay stretched out before them. Tlie youth looked again; and saw twelve other figures, muffled and veiled as the first had been, approaching him. They walked silently along, with slow and pensive steps, and approached the place where the youth sat; and he saw that their drapery was also covered with inscriptions ; but they were impervious to the light; and they silently glided away, as they came into the thick darkness beyond. The youth turned to the Angel beside him, and said, ' 'Who are these muffled and veiled figures, and why are some of them clothed in bright, shining raiment, covered with characters of light; while the others are in darker raiment, and the characters on them are also dark, as they move silently and pensively away ?' ' The muffled and veiled figures, ' said the Angel, ' are the hours of mortal life. The figures in white drapery which thou sawest, are the hours which thou has spent in well-doing, and serving thy fellow men ; and they bear the record, written in letters of light, on their drapery. The dark figures are the misspent hours ; and they carry with them the record of hours spent in folly and idleness. Be not surprised that thou shouldst meet them again ; for they are the mysterious emblem of which time iï¿½ made; and they be.'.r on their garments the records of Eternity. ' ' Grod works in hours, ' says the wise old proverb. The days are made on a loom, of which the warp and the woof are present and future time. ' Time is the warp of life, he said; O! tell The gay, the young, the fair, to weave it well.' Our moments pierce into eternity; and he was a wise king who said, in those sad tones that have rung down to us through the ages, ' I have lost,' not crowns and kingdoms, but ' I have lost a day ! ' The wisest of men have always remembered that time is the warp of which life is made. 'I have always been careful of my time,' said Franklin. 'Take care of the minutes and the hours will take care of themselves. The sun does not wait for his hat and his boots, but gets up at once. ' 'You are welcome to my library, my horses, the walks on my grounds, everv thing that I have the power to bestow, ' said a wise statesman, lately departed, to his guests ; ' hut my time, you must not ask me to part with that; it is all that has made me what I am; and if I have done any good in life, it has been done by taking care of the hours, and by 'setting a trap to catch the minutes.' Washington was one of the most punctilious of men with regard to time. He once asked the French ambassador to dine with him, and said, ' Sir, will you please to remember that we dine precisely at one o'clock.' The ambassador arrived at the more fashionable hour of two; and Washington said to him, ' Sir, our dinner hour has past, and our guests are departed, f believe I told you our dinner hour was at one o'clock. I should have no other apology to make to the king himself whose ambassador you are. ' The old citizens of Philadelphia used to say that they always knew when the old clock on Liberty Hall was going to strike two; for Washington would be seen making his appearance, riding round the corner, on horseback, just at that moment, by the clock. His presence was clock enough for the whole city of Philadelphia. ' This is a picture of Sir Edward Lonsdale, ' were the oft repeated words of a woman who acted as guide to visitors to a famous country house, in England. As they walked through the portrait gallery of the mansion. ' He improved his time, was successful in business, and, by prudence and industry, amassed a large estate. Here is a picture of his son; who wasted his time, squandered his money, became a beggar, and died in the pooi- -house. ' Canaan, N. Y.
