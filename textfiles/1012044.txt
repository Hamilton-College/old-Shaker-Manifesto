Good Religion A few prominent gentlemen of New York are supporting a mis sionary among the poor of the city who first feeds and then preaches to the needy. An eye-witness of a recent meeting along the river,front says: ' There was nothing highflown about the preaching, there were no dogmas brought up or assailed, and there were no Greek or Latin quotations to be explained. The audience were of the humblest class; out at the knees and elbows, with battered hats and worn-out, shoes. There were women as well as men in the crowd, and not a few little children were among the grown people. All kept excellent order. The tenderly spoken words were such as were adapted to raise the poor listener above himself ; to excite in him an ambition to better his condition ; to be somebody ; to drop his vices and put virtue in their places; to stop despairing and begin to hope; to cease quarrelling with others, and to cultivate kindness, forbearance, and charity instead. But the meeting was not all sermon. A handsome little wagon was brought up, with a tall coffee-urn and a large hamper of bread. Men from the crowd were selected by the speaker to fill and pass around cups of steaming hot coffee and slices of the fresh, light bread. ' I tell you, this is the kind of religion a man can take stock in,' said a man who had taken his cup of coffee and a bit of bread. ' There is nothing of the priest in this, who charges us for a seat in church and pokes us back in a dark corner where our rags won't make the rich people hold their noses and keep as far away from us as they can. There is no collection taken up here, and we ain't told we'll go to hell if we don't pay to be kept out. This is the religion I want in mine ! ' Others spoke in the same way, and it was plain that the earnest worker held the affections of the people. Religious Telescope
