Shakers, N. Y.. Second. Family. Oct. 1893. We have Providence to thank for our fortunate escape from frost thus far. Here we are, October 10th, canning tomatoes and drying sweet corn and cutting ensilage. We finish sweet corn to-day. Also have our two silos filled, holding about 150 tons. Apples a light crop. ? Isaac Anstatt. North. Family. Oct. 1893. The department of Home Notes in our dear little Manifesto is a blessed source of union and social communion with gospel relation. We read with great pleasure the monthly reports of different Societies. Owing to sickness in the Church family our meetings have been held, lately, at the different families, and on the last Sunday of Sept. the Society met at the North family. The heavens were opened; many realized the presence of those blessed souls who formerly resided here, and some were seen by our clairvoyant mediums. The spiritual aroma of their presence pervaded the house and was plainly felt. The cycle of a year is about run since we made our advent in this Society, and it has been a year of spiritual blessing. We were told by a beloved Elder and Minister that we would find good Believers here, and it has been verified. We have found those who are saints of God, who are ready, both physically and spiritually, for the heavenly messenger to say, 'Come higher up.' We have also found those who have put on the whole armor of God and are valiant soldiers in maintaining the testimony of virgin purity, which is the foundation pillar of our faith. Blessed Mother, may we be worthy to commune with thy dear children; and not be a dead weight bringing tribulation on the faithful ones. In a temporal sense we have had a prosperous year. The earlier part was somewhat dry, but crops have averaged fair. To one reared in a wheat section it seems a little strange not to see any wheat growing. We understand the Second family are sowing some this autumn. Of garden vegetables we have had a good supply. Our melons were excellent, but our beloved Editor did not appear as per invitation. Hamilton DeGraiv. [Dear Br.ï¿½We read your 'Home Notes' with pleasure and enjoyed the appreciation you manifest for all that goes to make up your new home. In this spirit the great crosses will become as little crosses, and the little crosses will wholly fade away. Please do not cancel the pleasant invitation, even though the melons are gone. Other blessings will spring up 204 THE MANIFESTO. r.ud create a wonderful thanksgiving, aiid then the invitation will be just nice to take us to your beautiful home, when our revival meeting opens for new light, life and love to God.
