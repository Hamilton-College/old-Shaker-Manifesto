Beloved Elder Henry;�It is such a busy time I thought you would accept the Home Notes this time from a little girl twelve years old: and besides we have taken note of some things of interest we would like to tell you about, which perhaps older people would overlook. Having so early a spring, we thought we would write the date of the arrival of the birds as they came, that next year we might compare dates and see if the early coming of the birds denotes an early spring and then we shall know what to expect. Bluebirds were first heard the sixth of March, robins the eleventh, song sparrows the fifteenth. A pretty little brown singing bird which I have not yet learned the name of, came the second of April, phaebe birds the fourth, the hair bird or chipping sparrow the tenth, and the martins the nineteenth. The beautiful oriole came yesterday, the sixth, but the swallows, yellow birds, mocking birds and many others are yet to come. We picked the first little yellow coltsfoot flower on the eighth of April, and dandelions peeped out from among the green grass in sunny places the third week of April. Cherry trees were in blossom on the thirtieth of April and now the plum, pear, peach and even apple trees are in bloom and it is but the seventh of May; earlier, people say, than since the year 1878. On the tenth of April we had a pleasant flowery entertainment. Our family dwelling being heated by steam, plants can be kept in any of our windows without freezing, so there are flowers in the sunny windows all winter. This spring some one thought it would be pleasant to gather them together before putting them into the ground for the summer, so that all could enjoy their beauty. The young Sisters arranged them in the form 'of a bank eight feet high, nine feet wide and seven feet through. There were callas, six kinds of roses, fifteen kinds of geraniums, fuchias, oxalis, begonias, Zanzibar balsam, feverfew, ageratum, besides several foliage plants. In the evening the Brethren and Sisters gathered into the well lighted chapel where they were, and many said it seemed like heaven. We had singing, reading, and speaking of sentiments suitable for the occasion. Katie Wells. TERMS. THE MA NIFES TO. 141 North Family. May, 1894. Ix the multiplicity of cares and burdens incident to the season Brethren sometimes fail to appear with their most excellent themes in the department of 'Home Notes' as was the case last month. There is something wholesome and cheery in the intercommunication thus established between our Societies, it serves as a mental visit 'around east' and 'out west;' and in our growing relation and acquaintance, it seems suggestive of a more thoughtful and helpful means of stimulating one another to higher aims and nobler purposes along the lines of mental, moral and spiritual culture. It is so natural for us to settle down in our own cozy homes, content in the performance of our daily duties and the acquisition of creature comforts. What of our efforts in the missionary line? What of our social and ethical improvement and the giving of our minds to study the principles and doctrines of the Church to which we profess membership? Are we reaching out in prayerful aspiration, to help souls who are seeking to know and practice the truth? and are we prepared to minister to such, the power of salvation, and give them sure guidance in paths of purity and virtue? Coming in contact with the world we should let our light so shine that they may see our good works, and be convinced that we are closely following the Master, instead of being influenced by the elements that savor of the generative life. Souls are awaking to a knowledge of the benefits of association on the plane of altruistic love and purity. It is interesting to learn of the movements on the Pacific coast, in Australia and in other places which tend toward the gathering of the saints together, those who are willing to make a covenant with God and with each other, by the sacrifice of all selfish desires and worldly gains for mutual benefit and growth in the divine life. It is the religious element in human nature combined with enlightened reason, that builds up and sustains the communistic home, where equality, justice and peace are maintained. It is according to Elder Frederic's prophecy, that the next movement and awakening of the spirit would not result so much in the accession of members to the older Societies, as it would lead to the forming of new associations, with the same basic principles as a sure foundation on which to build, but with the increase and progress belonging to our own day and time. Yet when there is 'a call or cry from Macedonia, come and help us,' shall we send two or more disciples to prepare the way and make straight paths for their feet to walk in? It hardly seems probable at present, that the labors of a hundred years will be sacrificed for any great exodus of the faithful to foreign lands, or even to far off coasts of our own beloved continent, as is frequently suggested. We have only the fruits of our hard earned labors, as no funds are poured in our coffers with which to build 'The New Jerusalem,' or any other impossible venture, and above all let us not run in debt, for aught we have, or aught we attempt to do. We are interested in all that tends to ameliorate wrong conditions among mankind. In the Peace Movement we recognize a quiet but potent influence surely working for the abolition of war. In Hygienic Reform, a testimony against disease and animalism, which is sure to benefit and uplift the race. In the Land Agitation, the solution of human rights and a just settlement in the future of the claims of humanity. In the Temperance Cause, the abolition of one of earth's direst curses. In the Social Purity and White Cross associations, one of the most important leadings toward a better moral state. The 'Self-Improvement Society' in our home, has prepared papers on most of these subjects, which have given them food for mental exercise; some of them have appeared in different periodicals. 142 THE MANIFES TO. As it is an age of reading, and we want the highest toned and best literature, we can recommend as a monthly magazine, 'The Arena,' B. 0. Flower, Ed. As a spiritual paper, none can excel Lucy Mallory's 'Advance Thought.' 'Food Home and Garden,' Henry Clubb Ed. an earnest advocate of food reform. Many excellent papers come to our home, more than we have time to read, considering our busy life. Mount Lebanon is in its height of beauty and lov eliness; no drawbacks as yet, to the unusually early spring. The new pear and plum orchard has been set out and seems to be doing well; currant and raspberry slips also. The apple orchards are in fine condition, the trees having all been trimmed; they promise a fine show of bloom. Sweet cherry trees in bloom the last of April; dwarf sour cherry trees look like drifts of new fallen snow. It is marvelous what a change has been wrought, iu field, garden and door-yard in the space of three weeks; surely God's blessing attends the labor of consecrated hands. The Sisters have plenty of shirt work at present; sewing is interspersed with housecleaning. It is announced that Public meeting will be opened next Sabbath; we continue the exercises that have been a peculiar feature of Believers' religious services in times past. With renewed zeal and interest for our Zion cause, we extend loving greetings to gospel friends. Martha J. Anderson. Watervliet, N. Y. North Family. May, 1894. The history of South Union that has been published in serial articles in The Manifesto, is quite a social treat for which we are duly thankful. It enables one to niore fully understand the trying times that our dear Brethren and Sisters in the South passed through; but fortunately now can be recorded as history. The saying that the 'Lord helps those �who help themselves,' is fully proven in ;he labors of the little family at the North who, since their removal to this Society have been anxiously, and with a prayerful spirit laboring to bring order out of the seeming necessary confusion incident to moving. Thanks to willing hands and loyal souls the consummation of their desires has been largely realized. While feeling some tribulation in moving from the old home, we fully believe that there was a spiritual gift in the move, and that the closer communion of Believers will result in a fuller and deeper spiritual ministration that will go forth to those who are honestly and earnestly seeking the higher life. Labor on the farm and garden is progressing as fast as the season permits. April giving us a taste of March weather, but in the latter part of the month some real April showers that caused the pastures and meadows to put on their garments of green. We are enjoying at present a season of good health. Spiritually, we are laboring to keep alive the gifts of the Spirit, to be placing a treasure where the destructive elements of earth life can not affect them. Hamilton DeGraw. Shaker Station, Conn. May, 1894. 'Let the peace of God rule in your hearts and be ye thankful.' The peace of God, which true crossbearing brings, gives joy, even in tribulation and the deepest affliction. 'Peace like a river.' We should be thankful for virtuous companions; for the comforts of a gospel home and social life, and for religious privileges and spiritual blessings that can not be measured. Offering thanks is acceptable to God. It is befitting that we join unitedly in special thanksgiving for the blessings of peace and salvation. Wisdom's path is peaceful and safe. Let us walk therein, and we shall be free from the reigning blight of sin. 'If we do ill, the joy fades, not the '1 HE MANIFES TO. 143 pains; if well, the pain doth fade, the joy remains.' No crown without the cross. ******* The limit of the capacity of the earth is 5,203,000,000 souls, says a Scientist, and this number will be reached in less than one hundred and eighty-seven years.' 'Glass in oven doors is a new contrivance, it enables cooks to watch the food without opening the doors.' 'Various attempts have been made to measure the rate at wliich electricity travels, and observers with delicate instruments have affirmed that it was not less than 114,000 miles per second.' The Brahma is a favorite breed of fowls with some poultry men, but not so profitable when thorough-bred as it is when crossed, that is, when the raising of chickens is an object in view. A profitable cross has been found between the Brahma and Leghorn. Daniel Orcutt. East Canterbury N. H. Weather Record for March, 1804.

Agreeably to promise, seed time has come, and the gardeners and farmers have been busily employed in the work of sowing and planting. The vegetable garden is receiving all due attention from the interested laborers, and we may well look forward with hope for the blessings that the earth will send forth. Already many varieties of plants are representing themselves above ground, very much to the pleasure of the gardeners. At the North family we saw, a few days since, a bed of beautiful strawberry plants and learned that some of the varieties were as early in fruitage as are those that grow in the fields. Elder Nicholas Briggs has also a nicely arranged trellis for grape vines, and has been very successful in obtaining many beautifully large and well ripened clusters in former seasons. An extended bed of onions attracted our attention, as their tops had reached an inch or more above the ground. This was specially interesting, as in former years so much labor has been expended unsuccessfully in the cultivation of this valuable plant. The panacea has come at last, in the liberal application of tar water, and with this the onion thrives beautifully, as all its ills and enemies are wholly destroyed. That nice lot of potatoes that wei-e taken into a warm room quite early in March, have sent out sprouts from one fourth to one inch in length, and to preserve these from harm, while being cut and planted, has required the utmost care. Now if the Weather Bureau looks upon them favorably for a few weeks, a bountiful crop may be anticipated so sure as day follows day. The Post Master at this Village, (Eldv r Nicholas Briggs,) has very kindly arranged with the officers of the Weather Bureau, so that we are now furnished with daily reports giving us reliable information of what the weather may be for the forthcoming day. This is one of the wonders of the age, and the knowledge becomes of great practical value, especially to those who till the land. This scientific statement which is brought to us every day, places the 'Old Farmers' Almanac' at quite a discount, as it does a multitude of self-styled weather prophets. Our pear, plum and cherry trees are now in full bloom and this wonderful outburst of blossoms is a beautiful sight. Even the flowers in the garden are asserting their rights at this early date and rivaling in beauty the tinting of the rainbow. The great and good Creator of the beautiful flowers, evidently saw from the beginning the great pleasure which the blending of these lovely colors, would give to the mind of man. God bless the flowers! H. Enfield, N. H. May, 1894. As nature makes everything bright and new, around us at this season, so man, (or more properly speaking, woman) finds a delight in making the inside of our homes more cleanly and beautiful. As every winter brings with it a budget of witty sayings about the plumber and his bills, so the spring-time hears the voice of irony, protest against spring housecleaning; yet how many of us there are, who, after having gone through a seige of soap and water, dust and white-wash, can not find a pleasure in neater and more tidy surroundings, that more than compensates for the trouble undergone. We are in the midst of our spring cleaning just now. Painting, papering, whitewashing and plastering makes work for all. Our garden crops are all in the ground and many of them ready for the first hoeing. We are glad to report that Sr. Julia Russell's broken wrist is rapidly improving. On the 10th ult. our young Sisters gave an Organ Recital, with recitations and songs interspersed. Many fine selections were played, and some were a revelation in execution and expression. We look forward with pleasure to Recital No 2. O. H. Kirkley. North Family. May, 1894. As the new season will give new fruit, we would we had new news with which to form our Home Note. We might line off sentiments scintillating with sparks of a theoretic or poetic type, and the same be devoid of the light that would inform the unregenerate soul as to a better mode of life and what would it profit the originator? yet we can delve into nature's inexhaustible mine of knowledge and exhume truths with which to illustrate the goodness of the Creator, as well as the glory of a true Christian character. Can we look upon maturing nature and fail to learn though the seasons come and go, its fruits grow and decay, that there are ever-existing, unchangeable life-giving elements that create the bud, leaf and fruit? and with this knowledge is it not reasonable to believe that the immortal part of man will be sustained by eternal powers? If so, than how important that our lives be devoted to works that sanctify and gladden souls, that in the 'march of life' we fail not to assist the needy and give as has been given to us, thereby responding to the call 'Love the Lord'� no less our associates�'with all thy mind, might and strength.' We are being favored as we hope all are with excellent weather for growing crops of grain and vegetables. Good health prevails, and anticipated blessings cause us to be thankful and give our best in every phase of our life, thus emulating the life examples of the founders of our Church, who so nobly acted their part in life, leaving the field of their labor for their successors whom we trust are ever able to sing, 'Away with all doubting and fear! Away with all doubting and fear! While morning around us is breaking And angels are hovering near. If others have stood thro' affliction, With firmness to-day we can stand; O gladly we'll banish all weakness, United a strong happy band.' George H. Baxter. White Water, O. North Family. May 1894. The month of May is to my thinking most beautiful of the spring months. For it is at this time 'Dame Nature' awakes fully from her long winter's sleep, puts on the brightest and most fascinating garb of the year. What could be more pleasing to the eye, than to look at the woodlands the meadows and broad fields of various grains, all having that peculiar mark that distinguishes one from another. But at the same time they blend harmoniously with nature. Methinks one would have to be an Infidel not to see the hand of God in all this. THE MANIFESTO. 145 We, as an agricultural people rejoice in the prospect of a bountiful harvest, we derive most of our income from the productions of the soil. The Center family sustained quite a loss last month by the burning of one of the tenant houses. With a great deal of labor, everything inside was saved, but the building burned to the ground. They began rebuilding at once and at this writing, have a very handsome two story frame standing on the old site. Will be complete about the 15th inst. Whitewashing barns, fences etc., is being done in a very neat mannner by Br. Charles Dixon, assisted by our three boys. The old saying is,�'A thing of beauty is a joy forever.' We are trying to do the work that is intended for us, by putting our shoulder to the wheel; every one doing whatever he can. In this way and no other, can we gain that love and union that is so essential to Believers. J. O. Tyler. South. Union, Ky. Center Family. May, 1894. 'Eveu fresh the broad creation.' These the musings that work in my mind, as I look at the beautiful scenery in front of my open window. Here is the wide and grassy lawn, the tall and beautiful tries. Pines and cedars, spruce and larch, sugarmaples and queenly elms, holly and mignolia with its white, sweet scented blossoms, filling the air with delicious aroma, and rivaled only by the sweet fragrance of the fringe tree. The great, big honey locust trees are also in full bloom, and alive with honey bees, holding a royal banquet in the calm of the evening, for it is five o'clock p. m. and all creation is charmingly beautiful. The great arch above is of the clearest cerulean hue. The air too, is as soft and pure as that of the Adriatic beach, while the flora of the cosmic creation looks brilliant in its every hue of green. Here and there are big woodland pastures dotted over with sheep and lambs, five hundred and seventy-five in number; a nice flock for one family, with an abundance of other stock on luxuriant pasture, rich in its exuberance. We are ploughing the corn and setting out sweet potato plants. The strawberries are ripening very fast and are always delicious. The weather has been exceptionally good this spring, and the mercury for the last two weeks has been from 60 to 62 deg. at sun rise, to 88 and 90 deg. at 1 o'clock p. m. in the shade. The health of the Community is good, and all are busy at some vocation. James Carr.
