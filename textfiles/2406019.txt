South. Union, Ky. Center Family. May, 1894. 'Eveu fresh the broad creation.' These the musings that work in my mind, as I look at the beautiful scenery in front of my open window. Here is the wide and grassy lawn, the tall and beautiful tries. Pines and cedars, spruce and larch, sugarmaples and queenly elms, holly and mignolia with its white, sweet scented blossoms, filling the air with delicious aroma, and rivaled only by the sweet fragrance of the fringe tree. The great, big honey locust trees are also in full bloom, and alive with honey bees, holding a royal banquet in the calm of the evening, for it is five o'clock p. m. and all creation is charmingly beautiful. The great arch above is of the clearest cerulean hue. The air too, is as soft and pure as that of the Adriatic beach, while the flora of the cosmic creation looks brilliant in its every hue of green. Here and there are big woodland pastures dotted over with sheep and lambs, five hundred and seventy-five in number; a nice flock for one family, with an abundance of other stock on luxuriant pasture, rich in its exuberance. We are ploughing the corn and setting out sweet potato plants. The strawberries are ripening very fast and are always delicious. The weather has been exceptionally good this spring, and the mercury for the last two weeks has been from 60 to 62 deg. at sun rise, to 88 and 90 deg. at 1 o'clock p. m. in the shade. The health of the Community is good, and all are busy at some vocation. James Carr.
