PRAYER FOR ZION OTIS SAWYER Pour out thy spirit upon needy Zion, Sustain all thy children while humbly they plead— Help, Lord, O help them, and send faithful laborers To work in thy vineyard, for great is the need! O, God of the harvest, replenish thy garners With choicest of fruit from the mountain and plain— And fill every court in thy holy dominion, Like rich golden fruit on a well-clustered vine. Hear, we beseech Thee, Oh heavenly Father, The remnant who've passed through the flood and the fire! O God, Thee they serve, and they bow to no other, Thy word and Thy will is their whole soul's desire. Protect and preserve Thou, the holiest treasures With which in Thy temple Thy wisdom appeal's— The Ark and Shekina, that royal insignia— A witness perpetual, Jehovah is herb! God of the widow and fatherless orphan, Whose vigilant eye views each sparrow that falls, Thy mercy and favor to Zion now lengthen; Thou art her deliverer and her all hi all! Yea, here for salvation Thy name Thou hast raised, For kingdoms and people, afar off and near, The Laws of Mount Zion on tablets engraved, To which every nation on earth must give ear. Now, even now, Lord, diffuse without measure, The power of salvation and eternal life! Renew the baptism of spirit and fire, That Zion may win in this terrible strife? O send forth Thy heralds to every nation, And call, that the slumbering to judgment appear— To enter through Jordan's rich stream for salvation, O God, unto Zion, in strength do draw near! Alfred, Me.
