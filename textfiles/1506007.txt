NEVER SAY FAIL Keep pushing, 'tis wiser Than sitting aside, And dreaming and sinking And waiting the title, In life's earnest battle, They only prevail Who daily march onward And never say fail! With an eye ever open, A tongue that's not dumb, And a heart that will never To sorrow succumb You'll battle and conquer, Though thousands assail, How strong and how mighty, Who never say fail! The spirit in Angels Is active I know, As higher and higher In glory they go, Methinks, on bright pinions, From heaven they sail To cheer and encourage Who never say fail! Ahead then, keep pushing And elbow your way, All obstacles vanish, All enemies quail, In the might of their wisdom Who never say fail! In life's rosy morning, In manhood's fair pride, Let this be the motto Your footsteps to guide, In storm and in sunshine, Whatever assail! We'll onward and conquer And never say fail. Selected.
