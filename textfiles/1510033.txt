KEEP THE HOE GOING. That ' ill weeds grow apace' we cannot gainsay, For proofs of the proverb come fonh with the day; If we don't clear them thoroughly out of the ground, A plentiful crop of their seeds will be found : Making, waste of our work, without reason or gain, And changing our prospect of pleasure to pain : So the use of my motto I now would be showing__ To keep the weeds down, we must keep the hoe going. Bad temper will grow like a weed in the heart, Striking deep with its roots like a venomous dart; And they who encourage it nourish a devil, That changes whatever is good into evil; fness, Then words that should comfort give nothing but sadAnd deeds that should bless are productive of badness; The weed of ill-temper, I now would be showing, Must be struck at the rootï¿½we must keep the hoe going. Intemperance oft is a troublesome weed, Changing health to disease, and plenty to need; Embittering life, destroying all quiet, Consuming the household with wasting and riot. Avoid the temptation, keep out of the folly : Why sacrifice gladness to dark melancholy ? Go work in the garden, and soon you'll be knowing, Health and mirth may be gained if you keep the hoe going. Envy, Hatred, and Malice are virulent weeds; Where charity faileth they scatter their seeds : Bright flowers of love, and sweet fruits of kindness, Are choked by their growth and the soul in its blindness Takes evil for good, and the wrong for the right; And goes forth in darkness as hating the light. Oh! tear up such weeds ere their seeds they be sowing In the garden of life, and keep the hoe going. See Hypocrisy spreading a blight on each hand, Where Candor and Truth have no hold on the land. See Deception and Craft and Selfishness grow, Where Simplicity shrinks like a rose in the snow. Oh, such weeds are too rank in humanity's field. Too fast in their spread, too malignant their yieli; We must summon our courage to hinder their growing We must work, we must wait, we must keep the hoc going. Come back to the motto, ' 111 weeds grow apace, ' There's a clear course for all and our life is a race; The Honest and Truthful and Good make the running And loss and disgrace are the wages of cunning. Cut down the bad weed, give sunshine and air To the blooms that are sweet and the grains that are [fair: Be taught as from Heaven to see that I'm showing, One wa} to be happy is to keep the hoe going.
