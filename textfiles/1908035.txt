Juvenile. PROPER LANGUAGE. Dear Children :ï¿½Listen while I talk with you a few moments. Can any of you tell me what slang is? It is low vulgar language, often without sense in form of expression, although it conveys a meaning, coarse and base, which is generally understood by that class of persons who habitually use it; but it is never elevating to mind or morals. The English language abounds with choice words, which are capable of expressing the most beautiful thoughts and sentiments. We may judge of the refinement of people by the purity of their speech, which is an external symbol of thought and feeling. So if you would be chaste and cultivated, you must be very careful in speaking. You need not employ ambiguous words on any occasion; I mean those of uncertain or doubtful meaning; but simple, direct and truthful words that all can understand. There is another habit in speaking much to be deprecated, and that is, extravagant and equivocal expressions. You strain the smaller occurances to the proportions of awful, dreadful, terrible and shocking; when very, extremely or exceedingly would be much more appropriate; for if you use adjectives in the superlative degree for trifles, you will have no words to express great calamities or misfortunes. Now I want you to think seriously on what has been said, and see how much improvement you can make the coming week, month and year. You can all help each other to speak nicely, by a gentle reminder when any one of you are in fault. Your Friend, Martha J. Anderson. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
