Universal Obedience BY R. W. PELHAM ' He that keepeth the whole law, and yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all.' This doctrine at first view appears unjust, but close examination will show it to be strictly correct. God requires universal and perfect obedience— the whole heart. Now the intentional breach of one of his commandments, as fully proves the want of this is the neglect of all of them. God will, undoubtedly, be merciful to our frailties; but a deliberate and willful act of disobedience cannot pass for lrailty ; it sufficiently shows the state of l.he mind, and proves that the whole spirit of obedience is wanting. A servant being commanded by his master to do ten things all equally just and right, may do nine of them with great exact- ness ; but if he obstinately refuses to do the tenth, he cannot be considered an obedient servant, but a rebel. Indeed, he is just as willful and disobedient as if he had refused to obey all the commandments of his master. His spirit is a spirit of rebellion and not of obedience. There is no good reason to believe that he has done one of the commandments of his master from a pure spirit of love, and simple desire to do his will, since such a motive, would lead him to perform the tenth requirement as faithfully as any or all the rest. Hence, we may be assured that some selfish end, and not purely the love of his master— not a true spirit of obedience—prompted him to do what he did; and that, therefore, he had no true obedience, because he was destitute of true love.
