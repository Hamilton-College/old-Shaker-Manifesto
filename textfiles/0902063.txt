TEMPERANCE IN VERSE It is said, but on somewhat doubtful authority, that Sir Wilfred Lawson will contribute a teetotal ballad to an early number of The Nineteenth Century. The water-joker of the House of Commons is already known as a writer of smart epigrams, one or two specimens of which I have given in this column. I snbjoin his latest jeu d'esprit, composed in answer to Lord Sandon's statement that forty-six head of cattle have died in Lincolnshire from the effects of drinking water: ' When forty-six cattle have perished by water, To alter our system it's time to begin ; Let's feed them in future on beer or on porter, On rum, or on brandy, on whisky, or gin. ' Like beasts let them drink without stoppage or pause, Refilling their buckets again and again ; Till at last we are able to say with just cause, 'Those beasts are as wise and as worthy as men.' ' Then hail to the system promoted by San- don ! Henceforward our life will more pleasantly glide; When our flocks and our herds shall water abandon, And our cattle lie peacefully drunk by our side.' â€”English Paper.
