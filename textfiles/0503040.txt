TO OUR GOSPEL KINDRED OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH Beloved Friends. — The Society of New Gloucester, Maine, have had the misfortune, to lose, by fire, their extensive cooper-shop, with its machinery for manufacturing shook, together with a large quantity of staves. Loss, over $3,000. They have previously, at different times, suffered losses in personal estate by fraudulent agents, in amounts, large to them. They have rigorous climate, sterile, rocky soil—poor buildings, which they are unable to repair or rebuild. One dwelling-house now occupied, is almost uninhabitable from its dilapidated condition. For the last few years removal from Alfred and West Gloucester has been contemplated, but not consummated. The project is now abandoned, it being determined to remain, repair and rebuild, as they can accomplish. They need help from without. If believers will unite and contribute of their consecrated property according to ability and gifts of charity, from one dollar to two hundred dollars from each family, to the West Gloucester family, it will be highly appreciated, and the greater blessing of the giver over the receiver will rest upon the whole Order. A beginning of $ 100 made. Ministry at Mount Lebanon
