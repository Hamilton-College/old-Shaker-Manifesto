It only needs this inspiring current of thought to pass from mind to mind, through the household of faith to kindle anew a zeal for love to God and for peace and good-will toward all men. Yea, good brother we want the inspiration that has touched your soul to become as wells '' of living water springing up unto everlasting life,' that every one may drink freely of these waters and thirst no more. The water from Jacob's well may be very good for many purposes, for the children of this world and be to them God's natural blessing, so much to be desired, and so essential for health and comfort in this world. While we unite with them in giving thanks for the unbounded supply of good gifts which come to us so freely from the hand of our God, we will not forget how much we are indebted to Him for all the gifts and graces that adorn the mind and which enable us, as children of his care, to work the works of righteousness. This gives evidence of a growing interest toward goodness ; of a life above that of a mere animal existence : and a light from God that is to redeem the world. Our responsibility in this matter is one of magnitude. Neither principalities nor powers should be able to exert an influence detrimental to the prominent interest that has called us from the world. As there are no mysteries to obstruct the highway of holiness or that can ever prevent the pure in heart or the peacemakers from seeing the glory of God, so we have nothing to fear in accepting the cross of the Christ, and in presenting this before the world. It is simple, easy to be understood and affords a light so bright and clear that there need be terms no fear of losing the right path if we enter in at the strait gate. The elements of human nature are, no doubt, quite as they were 'in the beginning,' and the advancement in human progress must be the cultivation of man's moral and spiritual faculties. The fearful outbursts of passion and the revolting crimes that are so suddenly aroused in the ignorant brutal mind is a fearful reminder of what our life may be if we neglect to walk uprightly. Jesus in accepting hip mission gave testimony that he was the light of the world; that his doctrine was from God; that it was absolutely necessary for man to make strait paths in which to walk, and to repent or change his mind from that of an earthly, sensual man, to that of a spiritual man, or a child of God. This same light was and is given to all the disciples, and to them, and no less to us, Jesus has said, You are a light in the world; you are as a city upon a hill, which cannot be hid. Having received this spiritual light, you must let it shine before all men, that they may see your good works, and through these learn to glorify your Father in heaven. All who have this light in one degree or more, should let it shine. A very little of God's light in the soul is a most precious blessing. If it affords strength sufficient to conquer one bad habit it is well worth cherishing and eminently worth our Giving; thanks. Returning to the word of our brother, who has made alive the sleeping thought of many anxious souls, we would repeat,�'If Believers would only make a little more effort !'* If they will only�and we believe they will, we are assured that a blessing will attend and increasing good be established. Let light be diffused more freely in the world. If the truth as found in the testimony of the Christ, has made us free, the same truth will make others equally free, and inasmuch as it has enlarged our thankfulness for these heavenly blessings, it will effect a corresponding work in the hearts of others.
