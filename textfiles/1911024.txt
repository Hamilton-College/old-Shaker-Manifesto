Groveland, N. Y. Oct. 10. A silo, 20x24 and 23 ft. deep, was completed the past Aveek. It is our first experience with one, and we anticipate satisfactory results. About fourteen acres of sweet corn, anc fifteen of beans were destroyed by the floods of early summer. The soil to the depth ol eight or nine inches was entirely washed away and drift-wood lodged in its place. Later, five more acres of Beans were wholly ruined by continuous wet weather. Total. Thirty-four acres (of rich land badly damaged) of valuable produce, including time, labor and cash, gone where it profiteth no man. Wheat, a generous yield and ol fine quality. Other grains usually good. Apples, both fall and winter, a sad failure. Never, wiihin the history of this Society, have we known so great an apple famine. Peaches are a failure throughout Western New York. Pears, currants and raspberries very abundant and of superior quality. We have no public meetings, but parties from without frequently attend our Sabbath Service. G. D. G.
