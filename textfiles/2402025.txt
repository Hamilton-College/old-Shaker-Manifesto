White Water, O. l\orth Family. Jan. 1894 Beloved Elder Henry;ï¿½The New Year came in very pleasantly indeed, the THE MANIFESTO. weather has been exceedingly fine for some time past. More like spring than winter. Christmas-day, the Thermometer registered 10 deg. above freezing, something that has not occurred in this section for jears. In fact the writer can not recollect a similar event. We enjoyed Christmas very much and the love and good-will that was expressed was quite encouraging. In the evening a company of the young Sisters accompanied by some of the older Brethren and Sisters from the Center family came up, and we spent an enjoyable hour or two. Such social gatherings are one of the many incidents which help brighten our pathway through life. The entertainment spoken of in the last writing was held at the appointed time, and the programme that was carried out reflected great credit upon both teacher and scholars. A treat to the school closed the exercises. Education is receiving much encouragement and we are much pleased that a desire for progression exists. Health of Society quite good at this writing. Am pleased to note the handsome appearance of the last Manifesto. Our love to the editor and staff for their efforts. /. 0. Tyler.
