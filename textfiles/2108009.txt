PRAYER FOR MANIFESTO. Agnes E. Newton. God bless thee! humble instrument By which some truth may be; Presented to an honest soul, And made to clearer see,� The pathway that our Savior walked The lesson of his life; That man should love his brother man And cease from sordid strife. Reveal the meaning of the prayer 'The will of God be done; Upon earth e'en as in Heaven O let thy Kingdom come.' Thy mission�not among the great The learned of the earth; But unto such as Jesus called And taught the heavenly birth. God grant thee wisdom to reveal The truth by nature taught; That God is dual in the power That has Creation wrought. Our Father, Mother, love' divine These elements reveal; By which the soul is born again And claims the Spirit's seal. The shadow of the unseen world Its likeness must reflect; And thus the light will surely dawn Tho' seen as darkly yet. The credent forms of ancient days Have proved progression's ban; 'Neath God's true light are losing hold Upon the mind of man. The Eternal power and God-head No mystery conveys To those whose souls are lighted With truth and reason's rays. Then speed thee! humble messenger, Upon thy work of love; Reveal to souls the Higher Life Who seek its worth to prove. God bless the earnest heart and hand That holds thy interests true; Inspire the life and guide the pen The Master's work to do. Canterbury. N. H.
