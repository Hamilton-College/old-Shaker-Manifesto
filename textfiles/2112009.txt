Extracts from the Diary of Eldress Nancy E. Moore, of South Union, Ky. I was born in- - - - -Warren Co., Ky., Sept. 1, 1807. In the spring of 1811 my parents moved to South Union, and entered the Community of the Believers. The children were placed under the charge of the Elders and appointed caretakers. At this early date our accommodations were very limited, as the Society had not been able to furnish suitable dwellings for all who accepted the gospel faith. A log cabin was selected as the residence for the little girls and their caretakers, where we lived till the fall of 1812. We now moved to the Grove or to the former residence of John Rankin. Our home was now known as the 'Children's Family,' and with the adult members who had charge of the place, we at times numbered not less than one hundred and fifty. ï¿½ I remained in this place till I was ten years of age. During the summer months the girls were sent down to the Black Lick family and returned in the fall very much improved in health. As the Grove proved to be a very unhealthy location our family was moved in 1817 to the place formerly owned by Jesse McCombs. In 1822 a part of the children were moved to 'Black Lick,' and the place was known as the 'Children's Family.' The older boys and girls were accommodated with homes in the Framed and Brick House families. Black Lick was also to be my home and I was to assist in taking charge of the smaller children, and O wThat a time we had that winter in those open log cabins. For three years, three months and nine days this was my Community home, but on the fourth of Dec. 1825, I moved to the 'Center Family,' and entered a class of my own age, the companions of my infancy and childhood, and retained this privilege for eight years, when I reached the age of twenty-five. On the 7th of May 1833 I was appointed to the order of Elders, an assistant to Eldress Susan Robinson. Our home was to be in the 'Novitiate Order' which was under the direction of Elder Samuel Eads. In June, 1839, I moved to the North Family, as assistant to Eldress Maggy Nay lor, and on her removal to the Center Family in Sept., of this same year, when Eldress Prudence Houston was chosen to be the senior Eldress. In this home I remained eleven years. Eldress Prudence returned to her former home in Dec. 1843, and the writer was appointed as the senior Elder of the family and sister Clarissa Rankin was chosen to be my assistant. I accepted the cross and labored according to the best of my ability to do my duty acceptably. In Oct. 1850 I was appointed to the Order of Ministry as an associate with Eldress Betsy Smith. I had now reached the age of forty-three years, one month and twenty-nine days, and yet this change was the greatest cross of my life, and before I could make up my mind to accept the gift, I prayed fervently to know if it was really the gift of God. Not that I doubted the wisdom of my superiors, but I felt myself so unfitted for the place. My faith was in my obedience to the gift which I accepted and to which I gave my whole life. This change was demanded on account of the death of our beloved Eldress Sarah Rice. I labored to be helpful in this new calling, although it was not congenial to my mind. The office of the Ministry was a very retired position and deprived me largely of the sociability and company of the family as a whole, but as years passed on I became more reconciled to the place and rather enjoyed the freedom from the many cares and burdens of a large family. In Oct. 1864 I moved from the Order of Ministry, and was appointed to the Order of Elders. My home was to be in the 'Center Family.' I had left one good company of gospel friends, to enter another and to accept a new line of duties. I had lived with the Ministry nearly fourteen years, and I now found I was accepting a great cross to part with my dear friends, to accept the burden of family cares, at my advanced age, and especially in a time like the present, when the spirit of rebellion seemed to rule both church and state. The war of the Rebellion had forced upon us as well as upon those surrounding us, a great many very unpleasant conditions. Our little Community was by no means exempt from its baneful influences. Passing through this state of unrest we have by the blessing of God been protected so far as to be able to keep our home, and to share with our gospel relation, in the beautiful gifts and graces of the spirit.
