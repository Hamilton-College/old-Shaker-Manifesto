'HOW HAST THOU FALLEN.' Martha J. Anderson. Stars have gone out from stellar space Which once in brightness burned, Thus many souls illumed with grace, To darkness have returned. The prophet Isaiah applies this satirical sentence to the king of Babylon. 'How hast thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning ! ' And to show clearly the cause of his destruction, continues. 'Thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend unto heaven ; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ; I will ascend above the hights of the clouds ; I will be like the Most High.' The elements of that great humiliation were long ripening to fruition. Pride, arrogance and injustice surely go before destruction, and judgment comes sooner or later as a just recompense for disobedience. The mightiest of earth cannot with impunity disregard the laws of God. Ability, power and position are too often the means of lifting souls above their proper sphere of duty and action ; and the greatest gifts prove snares of temptation and ruin. Alas ! how sad the sight, 'When he who might, Have lighted up and led his age, Falls back in night.' Talents, God-given and holy, prostituted to ignoble purposes rob the soul of true glory. 'Ichabod' is clearly written on the characters of many who have fallen through plighted faith, and in disobedience to the gift of God manifested in their souls, which teaches them in humility to follow the guidance of the divine light within. 'So fallen ! so lost! the light withdrawn which once he wore,' might be said of many whose knowledge of the higher life has been clouded by sensuality and sin, until they walk in the blackness of spiritual death. There is always a blight resting upon those, who, having been blest with light have departed from grace; who, having gained eminence in spiritual things, have felt too secure in their surroundings ; and tempted by the yet un� subdued passions within have descended by degrees from morality and virtue, till, lost from God, they have become a by-word and a stigma to mankind. 'For if that light within you becomes darkness how great is that darkness.' 'When faith and honor both are lost, the soul is dead.' Better never have known the truth than disobey its teachings. Better never have been enlightened, than fall in sin and obliquity. To retrace lost steps will cause more bitterness and anguish, than a straight-forward course in self denial and obedience. Let us look to our eternal interest, and obey the promptings of conscience if we would find abiding happiness and peace. Wisely hath the heathen sage instructed, and the good poet interpreted, �'Heed how thou livest, do no act by day Which from the night shall drive thy peace [away. In months of sun so live that months of rain Shall still be happy. Evermore restrain Evil and cherish good ; so shall there be Another and a happier life for thee.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. has a voice and interest in the order and prosperity of Society is rational. We cannot see how the order of primitive purity can be sustained unless woman is fully represented. No Society is thoroughly furnished with the elements of progress until woman is permitted to exercise her God-given prerogative as the other half of humanity. Watervliet, N. Y.
