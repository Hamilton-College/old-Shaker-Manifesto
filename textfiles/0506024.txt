IF WE FORGIVE NOT, CAN WE HOPE TO BE FORGIVEN? There is no virtue more essential to the Christian character than Forgiveness. It smoothes life's journey, inspires hope in the forgiven, and shows forth nobility of character in the forgiver. The gifted Sterne, discoursing on the excellence of a forgiving spirit, said : ' The brave only, know how to forgive ; it is the most refined and generous pitch of virtue that human nature can arrive at. Cowards have done good and kind actions ; but a coward never forgave. It is not in his nature to do it. The power to do it flows from a strength and greatness of soul, conscious of its own force and security, rising above the temptation of resenting every little affront.' When Jesus taught His disciples to pray, ''Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,' how plainly he exhibited the law of justice as running parallel with mercy. Truth and Love, Righteousness and Peace, are copartners. It is not probable that any human being was ever created so perfect, in every respect, as never to have committed an error — never to have sinned in a degree to fall short of the glory of God, and of the love and confidence of some mortal being. If this be true, then all, in a greater or less degree, have felt the need of the exercise of this beautiful virtue toward them. Those who humble their spirits, and seek forgiveness, will be exalted thereby. It is a sweet boon, when attained, worth the effort. Bitter envy and strife —jealousy and hard feelings — never made any soul noble nor happy. But when we kindly take an erring, repentant brother, or sister, by the hand, breathe the spirit of forgiveness and love, speak words of kindness to them, remembering that ' to err is human, to forgive, divine,' then we feel the sweet consolation which the Christ Spirit—the Dove of Peace — alone can give.
