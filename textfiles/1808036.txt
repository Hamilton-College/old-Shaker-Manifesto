AVOID DANGER, A thoughtful man, once speaking to an old tutor of ours of an impure poem, written by one of England's geniuses, said: 'I would freely give $500 today if I could erase from my mind the recollection of that poem ' A. young man was one day riding in a steamer down one of the world's broad rivers, when he fell into a conversation with a pilot. 'How long,' he asked, ''have you been a pilot on these waters?' The old man replied, 'Twenty-five years; and I came up and down many times before I became a pilot.' 'Then,' the young man said, 'I think you should know every rock and every sand-bank in the river.' The old man smiled at his friend's simplicity, and replied, 'Oh, no! I don't; but I know where the deep water is.' It is not necessary for young men to have intimate and experimental knowledge of every sand-bank of moral danger, and every rock where character and hope may be shattered. It is enough to know where the deep waters are, the waters of purity, health, noble-mindedness, and righteousness ; and with the Pilot of Galilee on board, the vessel will be kept in the deep waters.
