A heathen philosopher disputed with the Christian Bishops... A heathen philosopher disputing with the Christian Bishops (so-called) of the counsel of Nice was so subtle he could not be overcome by them, but yet by a few words spoken by a simple old rustic was presently convinced by him and converted to the Christian faith. Being inquired of how he came to yield to that ignorant old man and not to the Bishops, he said, the Bishops contended with me in my own way and I could still give words for words ; but, from the old man came that virtue that I was not able to resist.
