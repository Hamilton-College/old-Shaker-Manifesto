I go to bed I GO TO BED. When I have lost all faith in man, Or failed to consummate some plan; When women fair are cool, unkind, And things accord not with my mind—¦ I do not rashly seize my pen, And in a flurry there and then Declare this gladsome world to be One endless round of vanity— Ah no, for this were mockery— I go to bed. When through my head there darts a pain, And life seems an increasing bane; When friends their patronage withhold, And creditors become too bold— I do not in seclusion mourn, And curse the hour when I was born — I go to bed. When direful news comes o'er the sea, Or Jones and Smith cannot agree, When bank securities decline, And spurious stuffs are sold for wine— I do not with an awful sigh Express a wish that I might die— I go to bed. When boys refuse to study Greek, Write moral essays, practice, speak, When girls of fourteen flirt and lace, And like frivolities embrace— I do not on high heaven call, For one to write our country's fall— I go to bed. When some D. D. deserts his creed, And quacks their many victims bleed; When editors write sharp replies, And moneyed men keep back supplies— I do not then in prose and verse Implore the gods mankind to curse— I go to bed. When couples marry in great haste, And servants pilfer, fret and waste; When general courts their terms prolong, In short, when things get somewhat wrong— I do not bite my lips and scowl, And at the children snap and growl— I go to bed. I go to bed and soundly sleep, While friendly angels vigils keep; But if, however, I awake Before my ailments me forsake, I do not of my life complain, But try the remedy again— And back to bed. Ye who have grief, (and who has not) ? Let past prescriptions be forgot, My panacea for old and young Is given to the English tongue. It hath to untold millions wrought Sweetest relief, nor cost them aught. And now if you like these would be, From every pain and trouble free, Light a small lamp, and come with me— I go to bed.
