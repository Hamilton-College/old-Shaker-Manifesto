Sabbathday Lake, Me. Dec. 1895. One glance at the calendar shows that the last chapter of the Old Year has come. The book is about to be closed and a New Year whose pages remain unread is before us. Will it be too late to repeat with the many 'A Merry Christmas to you all?' if so 'Glad and Happy New Year's wishes' may not come amiss at this time. It is interesting to read the many beautiful sketches of home-life from the different Societies throughout our land, also the soul-stirring testimonies from the able writers of our monthly, all of which give pleasure to its readers. We at Sabbathday Lake are astir not- withstanding the 'Summer Visitors' have gone to warmer climes. There seems to be plenty to do. The Brethren have recently ploughed nine acres of land for another year's cultivation. The cows are supplying the family with dairy products and the surplus cream is disposed of at a Butter Factory near by. Sisters are not idle. Some are engaged in household occupations, others may be found at the loom weaving rugs. So passes out the old year. Ada S. Cummings
