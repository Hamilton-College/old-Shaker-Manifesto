Let us run with patience... 'Let us run with patience the race that is set before us;'ï¿½ These were the words of the Apostle. How much happier all might be if they would learn more patience and bear all crosses and trials that they might win reward. Patience strengthens the spirit, sweetens the temper and bridles the tongue. Let us follow Christ, whose life was pure and patient. In patience let us possess our souls. No affliction nor adversity comes to us that is not for our highest good. The New Year calls aloud for workers, not idlers, not observers, but workers in God's vineyard; workers together with him who said, 'Be of good cheer I have overcome.' Those who would bring sheaves into the Master's garner must gather them without delay. The brief working hours are few and numbered. Keapers, let us bend to our toil, and win the crown. Strength for to-day is what we need, to speak a kind word and perform a good deed. A virtuous life brings lasting peace, but thousands prize it not. Enfield, Ct. Daniel Orcutt.
