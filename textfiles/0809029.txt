Selected FILL THE LUNGS Persons who take but little exercise neglect to draw the air into the lungs. This should be accomplished by taking long and full inspirations for a short time, every day, while in the open air. This practice would get the lungs into the habit of opening to the air quite down to their base, and would make the breathing much more natural, as well as effectual at all times. In the case of young persons, it would enlarge the capacity of the chest, and add to the brief years of life.
