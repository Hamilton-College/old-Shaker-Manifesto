GUARD YOUR CONVERSATION If you say any thing about a neighbor or friend, or even a stranger, say nothing ill. It is a Christian and brotherly charity to suppress our knowledge of evil of another unless a higher public duty compels us to bear accusing witness ; and if it be true charity to deep our knowledge of such evils to ourselves, much more should we refuse to spread evil report of another. Discreditable as the fact is, it is by far the commonest tendency to suppress the good we know of our neighbors and friends. We act in this matter as though we felt that by pushing our fellows down or back we were putting ourselves up or forward. We are jealous of commendation unless we get the larger share.
