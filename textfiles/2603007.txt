NEW YEAR'S PRAYER. By Ada S. Cummings. Another year is dawning, O Father, may it be Unto my soul the warning, To make my peace with Thee! Through days of toil and labor, I've shared Thy love divine; THE MANIFESTO. 45 And in return I render My all, forever Thine. This year that lies before me, With pages clean and white; To Thee, shall be devoted, By walking in Thy sight. And as I turn its pages And view them one by one, May I through future ages, Repeat: 'Thy will be done.' And should I find before me, New fields of labor spread ; O Father, from Thy fountain May my needy soul be fed! Sabbathday Lake, Me.
