The Rev. Graham Taylor, in a recent paper... The Rev. Graham Taylor, in a recent paper on the ' Heresy of Life,' gives expression to the following sentiments. They should be matters of serious thought with us. ' More heresy is lived than is written or oelieved. Although less talked of and condemned, the heresy of life is more culpable and disastrous than that of opinion. The Gospel has suffered more from the underestimate of the one than from the overrated influence of the other. * * If the church was only as orthodox in life as in faith, if it guarded as jealously against heretical living as against disbelief, surely the Word would have ' free course, and run and be glorified.''
