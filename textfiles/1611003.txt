CELESTIAL BLESSINGS. Come good angels hover round us, While with grateful hearts we sing, Heavenly blessings which surround us. Praise and bless our glorious King. Here his hand the vine hath planted, Lo the branches spread and grow ; Joys of heaven to us are granted, Here celestial fountains flow. Here we gain divine protection, All the powers of earth defeat, Where no sinful, vile affection, E'er can stain the golden street. Here the light of heaven is shining, Clear as the meridian day; Golden cords of love entwining Every heart that does obey. Here is love that cannot fail us, For it binds our souls in one ; Though affliction may assail us, Still the joyful race we rim. For we know the prize is ours, Mother's children will be crown'd; Heavenly gifts descend like showers, Sweetly flowing all around. Praiï¿½e the Lord with trie thanksgiving, Prai e his inme withheart and voice, Praise his name among the living, Praise his name, rejoice, rejoice. Holy angels give him glory, Saints with joy resound the same. Loudly singing, holy, holy, Holy, holy is his name. Harvard, Mass.
