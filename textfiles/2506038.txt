ANGELS' FOOT-PRINTS. [Contributed by John Ferryman.] Every little kindness, Every deed of love, Every little action Prompted from above: E'en a cup of water In His great name given These are angels' foot-prints Leading up to heaven. Every little sacrifice Made for others' weal, Every wounded brother That we strive to heal, E'en a word of kindness To misfortune given All are angels' foot-prints Leading up to heaven. Then let angels lead us Whereso'er they would; Even let them teach us What is for our good; May they cross our pathway When from heaven they roam, Let us follow after Foot-prints leading home. ï¿½Selected.
