Agricultural Old Cato the Roman Senator, was not only a Senator, a true republican, but also a farmer. He wrote a book upon farming. 'Our ancestors,' said Cato, ' regarded it as a grand point of husbandry not to have too much land in one farm, for they considered that more benefit came by holding little and tilling it well.' Virgil says, and this was after the empire had begun : ' The farmer may praise large estates, but let him cultivate a small one.' And Curtius, the Roman orator, went so far as to say : ' He was not to be counted a good citizen, but rather a dangerous man to the State, who could not content himself with seven acres of land.' The farmer who keeps all the stock... The farmer who keeps all the stock his farm will safely carry, and ' feeds them fat,' soon has fat acres, even if they were not originally so, from the manure returned to the soil. And the fatter the cattle are made the better the soil will become. So fat cattle make fat farmers. The Mexicans have a method of subduing fractious horses... The Mexicans have a method of subduing fractious horses and such as are inclined to run away, which might be introduced here with profit. A hood or winker is so arranged that the driver or rider can in an instant draw it directly over the eyes of the animal, effectually blindfolding him. When this is done the horse instantly becomes quiet, and a repetition of the blindfolding two or three times gradually results in his becoming permanently quiet and docile. Such an arrangement would be a valuable appendage to the headgear of such horses as are disposed to run away. The London Omnibus Company, which ten years ago fed their horses... The London Omnibus Company, which ten years ago fed their horses principally with oats and beans, with hay, now feed almost exclusively on Indian corn and hay. Put a little sulphur in the salt for sheep... Put a little sulphur in the salt for sheep, not enough to make the mess distasteful to them, and you will drive away ticks. The best time to give it is immediately after shearing, then the ticks will drop from the wool easily. In winter if the hens can be with the sheep they will pick off the ticks when thev come to the surface of the wool. Let the farmers try sulphur and leave tobacco to the tobacco worm...
