BRYANT By Sarah J. Burger Long hushed the voice that tuned the hymns of praise; Folded the hands that touched the lyre of song; The heart that hurned with inspiration strong Beats now to rhythm of immortal lays. His was the giant's strength of earlier days, He shared the joys and sorrows of life's throng, And, battling bravely 'gainst the tide of wrong He strove to lead mankind in perfect ways. Across his sunset gleamed the bars of gold, And purple fringed was every changing cloud That wove for him the royal, kindly shroud, That wrapped his noble form within its fold. A garland fair all nature for him weaves While tribute true his memory receives. 'October.' Recitation by Jennie Vinneo. 'November.' Mabel E. Lane. 'Death of the Flowers.' May Rullhausen.
