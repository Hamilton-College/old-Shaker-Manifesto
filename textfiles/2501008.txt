WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.â€”BORN NOVEMBER 3, 1794 By Martha J. Anderson A century's close dims not thy glorious fame, Thou loyal son of brave New England sires, Who at their hearth-stones kindled freedom's fires And won by valorous deeds an honored name. A noble lineage holds thee in claim; Thy soul was cradled 'neath these forest spires Where 'God's First Temples' wakened high desires, And inspiration fanned Faith's sacred flame. Thy dream of youth in 'Thanatopsis' given Into thy closing days its beauty wrought, And gave thee access to a loftier heaven Than is by creed or cringing error brought. All honor to thy blessed memory, Long live the praise of thy sweet minstrelsy. A most interesting biographical sketch was compiled and read by Lydia Staples. Then followed an original character sketch.
