The 'cry of the children'... The 'cry of the children' of the female gender in China must be vociferous indeed if, as says the Chinese Provincial Treasurer of Hupei, their parents drown them at the rate of 80 per cent. This personage has issued an edict to his people forbidding this method of thinning out the female population, and plies them with various arguments and threats to induce them to desist from the inhuman practice. Among othei convincing appeals he remarks that the children can be sent to a foundling hospital; that they will find husbands if allowed to live. He also threatens them with the vengeance of heaven, and finally with punishment for willful murder. Argus
