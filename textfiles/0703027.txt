South Lee, Mass., February, 1877 Mr. Briggsâ€”Dear Sir: I have had The Shaker sent me, I think, ever since it was first published, and cannot very well do without it. I subscribed last year at West Pittsfield, through Eliza Chapin's agency. It seems her spirit has taken its flight, and no more dear Eliza here. I have known her for many years, sweet soul! Inclosed is sixty cents, and little enough, too, for such a work. Please favor me with it another year, and as long as it is published. It is the best publication out, or that ever will be, to me. Please give us plenty of Shaker music. Respectfully, Isaac B. Webster
