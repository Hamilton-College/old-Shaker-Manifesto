Shakers, N. Y. Oct. 1898, In perusing the Notes from the Editorial diary, the closing paragraph introduced a train of thought which is thus illustrated; The conservative mind that can intelligently separate the chaff from the wheat, rejecting the ideas and practices of the past that have proven by their own record their falsity, and retaining those which are founded upon the everlasting truth; and viewing the advance of human life in its progressive march to higher ideals, can call steady, steady, be sure you are right, then go ahead, is of a type so different from that conservatism which opposes the new moon because it respects the old, that no comparison can be drawn between them. 'We are living, we are dwelling in a grand and awful time, when to be living is sublime.' The forces that are molding human thought, and changing human society, are moving with such rapidity, and displaying such tremendous energy in their operation that those who, because they do not conform to their fossilized ideals seek to check their advance had better heed the warning voice,Beware. While all change is not progress, all progress is change from the old and dying civilizations of the past, into the new and resurrecting life of the advance thought of the present. We can not view life through the same object glass as those who hold that the only ideals worthy of acceptance are those which the past has given us, and any effort to change them for something higher would only result in retrogression. Gerald Massey, in his poem 'The Coming Time,' voices an everlasting truth in the following, ' 'Tis coming up the steep of time, and this old world is daily growing brighter.' The opening days of October gave us a sample of the same weather that the preceding months dida summer temperature. At date, Oct. 8, we have had two light frosts; but nothing to injure tender vegetation. It is a season of usual health.
