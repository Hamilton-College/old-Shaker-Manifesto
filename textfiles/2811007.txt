This is the harvest season of the year as the constellation Libra or the Scales denotes, the season of gathering in the fruits of the earth. This work is now nearly accomplisht. Soon we shall be able to draw the Balance-sheet and ascertain the result of the labors of the year. Our hay crop has been excellent. Green fields and pasures have been continuous from budding Spring to the present date. The weather has been rather too wet for potatoes, consequently they have been affected with rot. Corn has been excellent; the same can be said of Hubbard squash and other culinary vegetables. Our apple crop has been medium: cherries abundant; other small fruits variable. Our temporal larder has thus far been well supplied so there is small probability that we shall perish with hunger, physically. The culture of our moral and spiritual necessities depends as much on our own wise tactics as do the temporal. Public Meetings are still held and whosoever will may come and partake of the waters of life freely. New York State has finally shaken off its lethargy and is following the good example set by Massachusetts in the improvement of the highways, so that now, without doubt, there will be a State road built between Pittsfield and Albany, thus making the passage over the Berkshire Hills easier and pleasanter. Our well tried friend Dr A. J. White we learn has past that bourne, whence no traveller returns. Our blessing rests upon the noble Doctor. We have no deaths to chronicle in our Community. All are able to do duty with slight exceptions. Calvin G. Reed. South Family. Oct. 1898. We've liad a splendid pouring rain, And liope we'll get some more, Streams were getting very dry, So well we prized the pour. It rained from north, It rained from south, It rained from east and west, 'Twas just the kind of rain to have, A rain that rains the best. The Notes by Elder Henry C. Blinn in Oct. Manifesto were decidedly interesting. The 'Home Notes' department is a pleasing feature, as it forms a link in the brotherhood from Maine to Kentucky, holding spirit communion which is most TERMS 172 THE MANIFESTO. profitable in these clays of constant financial ruin, hurry and rush. Our sweet corn drying is in full blast, and the corn could not be better. When finisht we shall have a choice lot of the best and finest stock to be found in market. Our tomato harvest was very light, but the deficiency has been cancelled by the generosity of our North family friends who liberally supplied us with a full and perfect measure which they heaped up, pressed down and filled to overflowing. The demand for Shaker chairs, foot rests, woolen dusters and many items in the fancy work department continues. Sisters Abigail Brooks and Amanda Tiffany of Enfield, Conn., made us a short call last week. The world revolves rapidly, so we must move briskly to keep pace with it all. Genevieve De Grate. Shakers, N. Y. Oct. 1898, In perusing the Notes from the Editorial diary, the closing paragraph introduced a train of thought which is thus illustrated; The conservative mind that can intelligently separate the chaff from the wheat, rejecting the ideas and practices of the past that have proven by their own record their falsity, and retaining those which are founded upon the everlasting truth; and viewing the advance of human life in its progressive march to higher ideals, can call steady, steady, be sure you are right, then go ahead, is of a type so different from that conservatism which opposes the new moon because it respects the old, that no comparison can be drawn between them. 'We are living, we are dwelling in a grand and awful time, when to be living is sublime.' The forces that are molding human thought, and changing human society, are moving with such rapidity, and displaying such tremendous energy in their operation that those who, because they do not conform to their fossilized ideals seek to check their advance had better heed the warning voice,Beware. While all change is not progress, all progress is change from the old and dying civilizations of the past, into the new and resurrecting life of the advance thought of the present. We can not view life through the same object glass as those who hold that the only ideals worthy of acceptance are those which the past has given us, and any effort to change them for something higher would only result in retrogression. Gerald Massey, in his poem 'The Coming Time,' voices an everlasting truth in the following, ' 'Tis coming up the steep of time, and this old world is daily growing brighter.' The opening days of October gave us a sample of the same weather that the preceding months dida summer temperature. At date, Oct. 8, we have had two light frosts; but nothing to injure tender vegetation. It is a season of usual health. One of the dear mothers, Sister Sophronia Dole is patiently waiting for the angel that directs the life boat to pilot her over to the evergreen shores. Hamilton DeGraw.
