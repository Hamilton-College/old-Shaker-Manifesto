'IF I BE LIFTED DP I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME.'â€”JESUS To our spiritual understanding, there are three clear, inferential statements in this remarkable and peculiar expression : Firstly, That there was a time when Jesus was not lifted up, or the thoroughly redeemed man he afterward became, else why the 'Jf I be lifted up?' Secondly, That by ' lifting up ' he meant something immeasurably more significant than the manner by which his spirit was to be released from the clay it was sojourning in. Thirdly, The immense magnetic power derived from a life lifted up above the ordinary conditions of materiality, and which induced him to believe, with the eye of faith, that he would eventually ' draw all men unto him.' That he was ' tempted on all points like as we are ' we believe, though the high Jewish discipline he had been subjected to had kept him, like Paul, ' blameless concerning the law,' still we can scarcely find any who have been more severely and continuously tempted. The apostle says a man ' is tempted when he is drawn aside by his own lust and enticed.' But as Jesus came off conqueror, he knows how to feel for, and ' succor those who are tempted, and with the temptation make a way for their escape.' The only Archimedian lever which can move the world of mankind, spiritually, and lift them up to the heights where they too may win souls to right doing, is the cross of selfdenial Jesus practiced and taught, and which yields by destroying self-love, disinterested love to God and man.
