SOMETHING INSIDE A PIG Said Edward Everett once, ' The common people will always understand a speaker who understands himself and uses simple language.' But some speakers seem to possess the incurable faculty of always shooting over the common people's heads. The story is told of aj city minister who, after preaching for a friend in the country, was told by the latter: '• You have given us a very good sermon, with one exception, and that is, you used some word our people don't understand.' The former thought the latter was certainly mistaken, and asked what single word he had vised that all could not understand. ' Why,' replied the other,'' you said ' felicity ' instead of ' happiness.' Now, all our people know what' happiness' is, but a great many of them, I am sure, do not know the meaning of ' felicity.'' As the preacher doubted this, the country minister said: 'There comes one of our plain, simple farmers ; we will ask him.' And as the farmer came up he said: ' We were just speaking about a word — the word ' felicity;' can you tell us what is its meaning !' 'Why, yes,' said the farmer; 'certainly I know what 'felicity' is; it is somethinginside a pig, though 1 don't know exactly what !'
