Harvard, Mass. April 26, 1891. Deab Editok :ï¿½On the 15th of April we were again summoned to the bedside of one of our dear mothers, to see her spirit take its flight for the heavenly spheres. It was a joyful parting; there was not a tear of sorrow shed, for she died as she had lived a sunbeam of cheer and strength to all around her. All through her sickness she manifested the spirit of gratitude and love to those who were attending to her little wants. A gleam of cheer and sunshine was always on her countenance, and after receiving the little kindnesses which so many bestowed, she would always look up with a smile of thankfulness. Thus did our dear mother pass on to the higher stage of existence. She left the primary for the higher grade where all the faculties can be brought into use and develop what they cannot here, a full, perfect womanhood. The funeral of our Sister was attended on Sunday the 19th. Quite a company of her friends were present to give in their tribute of respect. A wise Quaker wrote, says George J. Holyoke, 'I expect to pass through this world but once. If therefore, there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it for I shall not pass this way again (in the body.) Let this be my epitaph. What I spent I had. What I saved I left behind. What I gave away I took with me.' Never have our doctrinal positions needed more helpers. Never before opportunities so ample and gi*and, with hopes so inspiring and glorious, ever and steadily pointing to an early revelation of the spirit of Christ in the true principles. Never, Heaven helping us, shall its dearly purchased banner of virgin purity and consecration be lowered by our consent. Around its standard, m;ule sacred by the heroic devotion of tLc living advocates of truth, let us battle on, hand in hand, heart to heart. Young Brethren and Sisters, we will stand by the noble principles of redemption to mankind, and by its living inspirations, and our Zion shall become as a beautiful tree. If there is inspiration in anything under the sun, should it not be in living in holiness, and redeeming our time? Like the spring that is opening upon us, why not look upward and draw down a new inspiration of spiritual life and strength. Two weeks since our dear editor sent a request to me to help him do a little missionary work by sending out some of our religious publications, and so spread a further knowledge of our faith. This invitation I can readily accept. Brethren and Sisters, can we not do a little in this line to help those who are doing so much? Let our dear editor see by the next month's issue that he is not alone in his noble work. Farming has commenced, though the spring seems quite backward. A few potatoes, peas, onions and beets have been planted. A. D. B.
