Friend John Whiteley:--My attention is directed to an obituary... Chicago Ill. Feb. 5, 1891. Friend John White ley :�My attention is directed to an obituary notice of the decease of Elder Robert Aitken of your Enfield Community, as presented to the readers of the February number of the Manifesto by Thomas Stroud. In reading this, to me, painful notice, I am forcibly reminded of the very pleasant, friendly intercourse which Elder Aitken, thyself and the writer hereof had from time to time together on board the steamship Servia, during our voyage to England the past summer. I assure you that I hold him in sweet remembrance and I shall never forget, I trust, some of the words of wisdom, tempered as they seemed to be by a true Christian spirit, which fell from his lips, and in the contemplation of them and the one who gave them utterance, I am constrained to repeat the words, as penned by the gifted poet, friend, John G. Whittier to the memory of his friend Thomas Shipley. 'Gone to thy Heavenly Father's rest, The flowers of Eden round thee blowing, And on thine ear the murmurs blest, Of Siloa's waters, softly flowing! Beneath the tree of life wliich gives To all the earth its healing leaves, In the white robe of angels clad, And wandering by that sacred river, Whose streams of holiness make glad The city of our God, forever. Gentlest of spirits! not for thee� Our tears are shed, our sighs are given, Why mourn to know thou art a free Partaker of the joys of Heaven? Finished thy work and kept tliy faith, In Christian firmness unto death; And beautiful as sky and earth, When autumn's sun is downward going. The blessed memory of thy worth, Around thy place of slumber glowing.' As you will probably recollect, I communicated to you and Robert Aitken my intention to visit him and also thyself and friends during the past autumn at your respective homes, and I regret exceedingly my inability to do so, caused as it was by a change in my plans of business, which had they been executed as at first proposed, would have taken me to Boston and hence enabled me to visit you and Robert as I suggested I would do, under such circumstances. I will now assure you of my continued purpose of visiting you at Shirley Village, at some future time and if my life shall be spared until then it will most likely be during the year 1891. In the meantime I shall be pleased to hear from you by letter, to which it will give me pleasure to respond and you will please direct as previously advised. Faithfully Thy Friend, C. D. S.
