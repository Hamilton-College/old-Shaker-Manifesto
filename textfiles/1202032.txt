Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1882 C. Shaker Village, N. H. Jan. 1882 Dear Sister H. I am going to answer your pretty letter. I love my nice home, and I mean to keep it by being good. I mean to keep my heart pure. I am real pleased with my little letter. It is the first I ever had, I think a great deal of it. It had such pretty words in it. When I rise from bed in the morning and when I lie down at night I will pray to God, for He will hear me, and if I pray to Him with a right heart He will bless me. I was pleased to write you a little letter. I think I have a beautiful home. I love the little letter you wrote me. I will be a good girl for I love you very much, and I think you love me. From your little girl,
