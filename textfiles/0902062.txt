FOR PEACE While the most popular Congregational clergyman of America has just loaned himself as a chaplain to a regiment in Brooklyn we are pleased to read that ' the English Congregationalists take hold of the war question vigorously, and there is no doubt where they stand. The London Congregational Union met on the day after the speeches of Earls Beaconsfield, Salisbury, Derby, and Mr. Gladstone in Parliament. They passed a resolution, with but five dissenting voices, that ' no cause has been shown by which England would be justified in going to war.' This is a political question, perhaps ; although that may be doubted, since Mr. Forster withdrew his celebrated amendment and the Opposition decided not to ask a division. Only one or two voices were raised against this expression of opin- ion by the Union, to which the Rev. J. G. Rogers replied that if the Union could not protest against an unnecessary war, the sooner the Union was brokenup the better ; and Dr. Waddington cried out: ' Good God! am I to stand here, and when I am told on the highest authority that there is no necessity for the shedding of one drop of blood, see my fellow countrymen, who have no vote in the matter, dragged into war and slain, perishing1 body and soul, without raising my voice against it ? If to raise such a protest is out of order, then perish your order !''
