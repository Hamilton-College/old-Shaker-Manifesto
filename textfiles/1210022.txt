Try again. â€”Everybody makes mistakes. Things will not always come out just as we try to make them, because some little wrong thing is done, or something that needs to be done is overlooked. Well, what then? Shall we get discouraged and let things go as they will? Some people do, but such people have a hard life of it; they think themselves very unlucky, and complain of their hard fate. The little fellow who is at work on his example in multiplication finds he has made a mistake; what does he do? Drop his slate and go off fretting and wishing there were no such things as old bothersome figures? No; lie is puzzled, but he knows there is a mistake somewhere, and he means to find out. 'Try again' is his motto. He will begin again and go slowly and carefully through all the work. If he does not find the mistake then he will do the same again, running through all the lines of the multiplication table in his mind, or making them by additions SHAKER MANIFESTO. on his slate. He will hit on the wrong and get the right, you may be sure.
