In Memory of our Brother, DAVID RAY Jiy Hannah It. Agnew. Dear Brother, go and take your rest On the immortal shore, By all the faithful you are blest Time's toilsome march is o'er. Those worthy souls you love so well, The guardians of your youth, Who led you, we are pleased to tell, In ways of light and truth, Will greet you in that land of love And make you welcome there To join the angel host above The joys of heaven to share. We, in the varied walks of life, Will miss our brother here; His words and acts with kindness rife, Did often please and cheer. He lent a helping hand to all Who ever sought his aid, No matter whether great or small If plans were rightly laid. Here in the vineyard of the Lord, Was faithful in his day; His patient toil brings rich reward Sufficient to repay. Farewell, dear brother, till we meet Again in heaven above; Long in our memory we shall keep Your kindly acts of love. 104 THE MANIFESTO. As one by one, friends drop away, Are we prepared to go? The call will come to us some day, But when, we can not know. Again one more has gone before, And left us, toiling on; The moments fly, and passing by, Say we shall soon be gone. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
