ANN LEE-THE SEER Elizabeth Oakes Smith Written for The Manifesto. CassancIras have their fervid visions cried; Unheeded Sibyls on the unwilling air Have cast their inspirations in despair. Joan of Arc, her simple flock beside, Wept o'er her country's wrongs, nor dared to hide The Voice that bade her virgin feet repair Where slaughtering men and ruined cities were; And forth she went, truth panoplied, and died. And not the less from out the feons roll The Voice by prophet heard and ancient seer, And chastely o'er Ann Lee's inspired soul, Love, such as angels know, to angels dear, Enshrined the Gospel of the Higher Life, Symboled by Adam ere he sought a wife.
