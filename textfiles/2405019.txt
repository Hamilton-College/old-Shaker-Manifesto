Sabbathday Lake, Me. Apr., 1894. 'O friends whose hearts still keep theirpriuie Whose bright example 'warms and cheers, Ye teach us how to smile at Time, And set to music all his years!' As time seems to glide along so quickly it is good to be able to smile as we are striving to set to music all the years, by following in the footsteps of those whose lives have been pure and bright. Another month has gone and springtime is now really upon us, although the weather does not appear much like spring, for it is snowing and the wind wails mournfully without. Still we know that the brighter days will soon come, when all around us will be clothed with beauty. As I am writing I hear children's voices singing;� 'Beautiful Brethren and Sisters too Loving companions so faithful and true.' and I am reminded of the treasure and blessing which we enjoy in our gospel ki ndred. The patient mothers; the kind and true fathers; the hundredfold relation! With in our home are four aged ones who have seen more than fourscore years, namely,� Br. Samuel Kendrick, Br. Thomas Noyes, Sr. Mary Jane Jones, Sr. Lydia Mariner. These are with us, of the many who have gone before. Precious ones, while you linger may you know that you are loved, even as your love and care have been extended to us. For our aged ones we often sing the promise which is particularly theirs;� 'In my Father's house are mansions For the faithful and the true Fear ye not, beloved children, I've prepared a place for you.' We all send love to the Editor and those who assist on The Manifesto. Ada S. Curnmings.
