LIFE. Jessie M. RulJhausen. A fallen star, a withered flower. A carol hushed in leafy bower, A sighing wind in forest dim After its sweep from rim to rim. A broken wave on ocean vast, A bubble tossed not long to last, A fleecy cloud in heaven's blue, We watch its change now passed from view. A pearly drop of dew so bright, But ah, it melts in morning light. A day of joy, an evening train Of solemn thought, a night of pain. Oh! these portray our life so dear, Its friendships, joys and hopes that cheer. To-day are ours, to-morrow fled As broken buds all withered, dead. The past may die, but from its tomb A sweeter life comes forth to bloom. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
