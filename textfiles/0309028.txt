POLYGAMY A Petition for the legalizing of Polygamy in Massachusetts, numerously signed by the un- married women of Lowell, has been presented to the Legislature. It states the fact of the excess of females over males, as a principal reason for this Petition. In ancient times, Moses, agreeably with the practices of the Eastern nations, permitted Polygamy, as a secondary evil, because of man's lusts. Brigham Young assigns the same causes for its existence in Utah. Is it, or is it not, better for a nation's posterity, that it practices plurality of wives, provided that they otherwise observe natural laws in reproduction, than that they should do as do the Gentile Christians, ' who walk after the flesh ' ? is an unanswered question. Those who live in generation should cease to call themselves Christians ; and those who call themselves Christians, should cease from ' the works of the flesh,' including reproduction.
