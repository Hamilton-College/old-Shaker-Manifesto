That it requires more faith, generosity and hope than some have in possession, to see the necessity and duty of thus 'casting our bread on the waters' of humanity, with an assurance of 'its return after many days, with blessings added an hundred fold,' still we mean to live on. We will greet our friends, patrons, and at least a thousand more new readers with the beginning of volume nine—parties outside of our church having volunteered at their expense to circulate so many ! We ask a continuance of kindly remembrance in prayers ; and that these prayers may be so deep, fervent, unselfish and effectual, that they may be feelingly experienced, by cheerful givers to the support and continuance of our one little missionary, The Manifesto ; and we are confident, God will DEAL WITH ITS SUSTAINERS AS LIBERALLY. OUR ANTIDOTE FOR SIN The world do not like' Shaker testimony, nor do we think it strange. Radical Christianity never did please the world-loving. 'Even so we speak,' said the early apostles, 'not to please men, but God' by delivering what is best for them., regardless of perverted tastes. But there are thousands on thousands, who feel accordingly grate- ful for our testimony of selfdenial, in the degree they practice it. Thousands now admit, and millions more will do the same, that Selfdenial to worldly lusts, to unmanly and unwomanly perversions in worldly, unchristian pleasures, is a certain antidote to sin ; and without it, there is no Christ in us, no Savior for us, nor salvation unto higher, Christian life.
