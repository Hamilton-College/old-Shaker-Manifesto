OUR ANTIDOTE FOR SIN The world do not like' Shaker testimony, nor do we think it strange. Radical Christianity never did please the world-loving. 'Even so we speak,' said the early apostles, 'not to please men, but God' by delivering what is best for them., regardless of perverted tastes. But there are thousands on thousands, who feel accordingly grate- ful for our testimony of selfdenial, in the degree they practice it. Thousands now admit, and millions more will do the same, that Selfdenial to worldly lusts, to unmanly and unwomanly perversions in worldly, unchristian pleasures, is a certain antidote to sin ; and without it, there is no Christ in us, no Savior for us, nor salvation unto higher, Christian life.
