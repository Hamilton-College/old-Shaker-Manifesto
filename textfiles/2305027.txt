Enfield, N. H. April, 1893. With the assurance that a long and dreary winter has taken its flight, comes an added joy, that since our last contribu- 122 THE MANIFESTO. tion to the Manifesto, the harbinger of death has not invaded our home, to take from our midst either Brother or Sister; an experience unknown to us in the several months that have passed; and now we may speak only of the living whose presence we are blest daily to enjoy. Nothing of remarkable interest is moving at present date; each succeeding day brings its measure of care and burden with willing hands and hearts for needed service. We are now in the midst of the maple harvest anticipating everything sweet for a time at least. About seven hundred trees were tapped which, for the most part, have yielded quite abundantly. If the weather continues favorable we may derive some profit over and above the time and labor given. We are likewise having some repairing done incident to this season of the year. The bakers' oven is undergoing repairs; also masonry work at the laundry which required greater safety as well as convenience. Other improvements are under consideration and may receive attention in course of time adding beauty to our home and surroundings. Sisters are as ever engaged in their several occupations where duty calls, striving to keep the house in order as best they may. Health of our family quite good at present time; a blessing we know how to appreciate. Our kindest love and interest we would that all might share. Julia Russell.
