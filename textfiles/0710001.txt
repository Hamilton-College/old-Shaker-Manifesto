'I'M GLAD I FOUND THE SHAKERS.' JACOB KULP When I am asked if the Shakers are the only people that will be saved, I am only able to reply, that Jesus admitted but one door; and that none could come to the Father but by this door—his life.' We cannot make the road of Christ's life any broader ; and he that climbs up any other way, is (German text) 'a thief and a murderer!' It was Jesus who warned : 'Many false Christs shall come, etc.,' but we should be able to judge them by their fruits. W'hatever society bears the best fruits ; whatever people enjoy most salvation, these are the best—nearest to God. Although christened when a child in the Presbyterian church, I grew up a free-thinker; but was anxious to be saved from sin and carnal imperfections I read the good Book through ; becom ing alarmed at the sentence, 'He tha sinneth is of the devil!' I believec this, for naught but a wicked spiri would lead any to sin. I thought to join some church. I found none bu admitted they were sinners ; and I hesi tated, because it was the Christian lif —the saved life—that I wanted. And I found none living the life Jesus lived —elders, deacons, ministers nor bishops. I thought I was living as moral a life as any ! Yet I was not satisfied with my life ; nor could any of the pulpits give me relief; though I believed many church people were living up to the best light they knew of. Soon, I found the Shakers, who not only preached about salvation, but lived in it I Here was what I wanted. By the confession and repentance of my sins; by entering into the self-denials of Jesus, and striving to live pure as he was pure, I found saitsfaction to my soul—that 'peace' which Jesus said, 'I leave with you ! ' / am thankful, beyond expression, that I found the Shakers ; and for my gospel call and companions. In the gospel of virgin purity, peace, equality, and freedom from the flesh, I love to live.
