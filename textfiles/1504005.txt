LIGHTS AND SHADOWS. To-day, does the sunlight of comfort Shine on our gladdened hearts-- To-morrow, perchance comes the shadow, And the transient gleam departs, We knew not that, stealthily lurking, The shade lingered near, the while We welcomed the joy that cheered us, And basked in its fleeting smile. Such ever is life in its changes Of fortune and of friends, We just have begun to prize them, When their fickle friendship ends. To-day, does a flowery pathway Outspread before our view, To-morrow, it seems but a steep hill, And strewn with thorns too. And yet, to-days and to-morrows And yesterdays just passed-- Are framed by the same great Maker, Are in the same mould cast; Are sent to us wisely chequered-- Why should we feel dismayed, If the various portions He send be Alternate light and shade? Too oft are they only reflections Of restless thoughts, which lurk Within those hearts ever yearning, Ever ceaselessly at work; One day do they gild the prospect, Reflecting their own light-- Another day falls their shadow, And all seems dark as night. The purest of all earth's pleasures Bloom brightest--when and where? When found in the safe, sweet shelter Of the Cross, which screens from glare When the trusting heart, undaunted By the bitterness and pain, Tastes the joy with two-fold pleasure, Which follows in their train. Whatever the unknown future May have for me in store, The sunshine shall never dazzle, Nor the gloom affright me more, To Thy guidance---Heavenly Father! My feeble steps I trust, Thou shalt send but what is fitting-- Love reigns in all Thou dost. The Catholic.
