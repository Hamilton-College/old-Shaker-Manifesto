Alden's Cyclopedia of History A GREAT POPULAR HISTORY OF THE WORLD. The story of the world's history, is, after all the most interesting and most instructive story which has ever been told. It was probably never better presented, for general reading and reference, than in Alden's Cyclopedia of History, recently published. Every nation of the earth, ancient and modern, is treated in its alphabetical order, excepting, only, the United States, which is to form a separate work. You have ancient history as far back as B. C. 5004 and modern history down to A. D. 1892. All countries are described in their physical aspects, as well as historically, so you have the equivalent of a book of travels round the world. There are many illustrations, none for mere ornament, but all helpful for instruction. Considering the magnitude of the work, its small cost is astonishing. The entire history comprises about 800,000 wordsequivalent, you will find by comparison, to about 10 volumes of ordinary sizeand yet is issued in two handy volumes, in small but clear type, well and handsomely made, and sold in cloth binding for only $1.25 for the set, plus 20 cents for postage, if by mail. For 10 cents the publisher sends post-paid a paper-bound volume of 160 pages, containing the complete history of several nations, by which you can judge of the character of the entire work. Every home ought to have a good Universal History; this is probably the best for general use. The publisher's catalogue of choice books, over 100 pages, a rich feast for book-lovers, is sent postpaid for 2 cents. John B. Alden, Publisher, 57 Rose St., New York.
