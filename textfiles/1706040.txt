LAW. Laws, as we read in ancient sages. Have been live cobwebs in all ages. Cobwebs for little flies are spread, And laws for little folks are made; But if an insect of renown, Hornet or beetle, wasp or drone, Be caught in quest of sport and plunder, The flimsy fetter flies in sunder. James Beattie.
