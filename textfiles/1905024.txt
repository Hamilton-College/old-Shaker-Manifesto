MEN WHO CAN'T BE SPARED. A. D. Bullock. [Contributed by Elder G. B. Avery.]It is true our young men have a vast deal of advice thrust upon them, good, bad and indifferent; they are made a kind of moral target for fools and wise men to shoot at indiscriminately. But the counsel to make themselves a necessity in the calling which they pursue, is both sensible and philosophical. And anybody of average energy of character and brain-force can do this. It matters not what business you follow, whether you are tillers of the soil, blacksmiths, machinists, painters, tailors or laborers; whether you drive a dray or a coach, labor with the muscle or the mind. In your own separate spheres, wherever and whatever they may be, you may win an enviable reputation for first class workmanship, and become in some sense a necessity to your employer, or if you are your own master, to the community in which you reside. The great majority of young men lack a sufficient ambition to give them anything more than a mediocre place in the handicraft or profession which they have elected to pursue. They are perhaps amply endowed with talent, but it is of that ponderous quality which crushes because it lacks tact, agility, and force. And the consequence is, they never rise above the dead and uninspiring level where the masses are content simply to eat, toil and perpetuate their dull and stagnant existence. If there is any inherent vitality in their natures it is repressed by false views of life and its opportunities. But, on the contrary, the men of pluck and nerve, who strive to make themselves a recognized necessity in their avocations, get higher wages and better positions almost invariably. They rush by the sluggards and dolts in the exciting race of life, winning alike its honors and its gold. It is said of the late Moses Stuart, that when a young man settled over a church in New Haven, Rev. Dr. Spring of Newburyport went to hear him with a view of offering him a professorship in Andover Theological Seminary. He interrogated Rev. Dr. Dwight, President of Yale College, as to his fitness for so exalted a trust. The latter replied, 'he is just the man you want, but we cannot spare him!' 'Sir,' responded Dr. Spring, 'we don't want a man that can be spared.' This illustrates very forcibly one of the fundamental and practical principles of common life. All the vast business, educational and moral interests of community are seeking after preachers, attorneys, phyeicians, clerks, accountants and artisans that can't be spared. They don't want young men who are floating around, such as the idle and the vicious, but smart, earnest and practical men�men of ideas, of fruitful minds and vigorous muscle, who will strip themselves for the work of life, like genuine heroes. The men who can be spared just as well as not, are never fixed in their situations. If there happens to be a little financial flurry, they are set adrift, because, while they do a certain amount of hard work, they manifest for it neither aptitude nor enthusiasm. As soon as the clock strikes the hour for ceasing labor, they jump for their coats and hats with more abruptness than the machines they tend come to a close when the power is shut off. In other words, they have no impetus of any kind that can possibly carry them beyond the 'dead point' of the stipulated hours of labor, while the unthinking machine does sometimes exhibit considerable momentum. In every pursuit of life there are men who cannot be spared without a positive loss to then- employers and to society. A mechanic resolves, for instance, that he will take a foremost place in his craft. To accomplish this commendable purpose, he works early and late, and by skill and care saves his employers in the course of the week, a large per cent of the stock usually consumed. He don't slight the work; on the contrary, he comes up exactly to the standard of requirement as to weight of metal, while others overrun and thus waste a quarter of the amount of their wages every day. The employers recognized this faithfulness and the man gets what he is entitled to�the more lucrative and honorable berth of foreman. Such cases are by no means uncommon, and one has lately come under our notice in Springfield. Men can make for themselves a broad or a restricted field of operations just according to their choice. The matter of a prominent or subordinate position is entirely within their own province and control. What if your occupation be crowded? Put forth manly exertions and go up to the head of it� there is no crowding and jostling there, but room enough for your bravest endeavors. Be a somebody in your calling, and if you demand an honorable recognition by industry and talent, you will be certain to win it, for the race is always to the diligent and thoughtful. Reveal in your life-work the strength and persistency of a bold, confident and honest manhood, and rest assured society will have a place for you, and success will smile propitiously upon and eventually crown your exertions.
