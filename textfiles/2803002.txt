Remarks Made at the Funeral of Sister HANNAH P. SHEPARD. By Elderess, Joanna J. Kaime. ONE of the most prominent traits in the life and character of our dear Elderess Hannah was fidelity to principle, especially conspicuous where, her religious convictions were involved; so singularly genuine in regard to truth, that many times I have thought that no alloy could be detected in her instructions to the young, while in the exercise of her duties in the Eldership. Her rebukes were so tempered with a loving sympathy, that no erring one 'could mistake the kindly feeling from her true Mother's heart, tho no covering from the light, or daubing with untempered mortar was allowed. 38 THE MANIFESTO. Well has the poet exprest it,'Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow,' and we have been conscious for a long time that the grim Destroyer had so aimed the blow, that time, tho freighted with the prayers and earnest entreaties of loving friends, could not stay the poisonous dart. We humbly pray that those who have shared her beautiful ministrations, may treasure them in clean and honest hearts and from the pure seed so richly sown, we shall reap a bountiful harvest, which will redound to the honor and glory of God. Methinks, now freed from earth's burdens, that our Sister will exultingly sing,'I know that my Redeemer liveth, because He lives I shall live also.' And when we look for her in her accustomed places in earth-life, the Spirit voice will gently whisper,'She whom thou seekest, is not here,' she has risen to die no more. East Canterbury, N. H.
