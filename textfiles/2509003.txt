RELIANCE. By Lydia Staples. As lifts the lily's snowy cup To drink the dews of heaven, So turns the chalice of my heart For luv as freely given. 200 THE MANIFESTO. Let fall into my soul 0 Lord Refining grace and power, That every motiv be to Thee A holy fragrant flower. And every thought be at Thy feet Like pearly petals shed, And every impulse of my life To holiness be wed. And when the harvest time of life Brings its reward, the best I'll lay upon thine altar Lord Oh be my offering blest. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
