PROGRESS AND CONSERVATISM The Church is progressive, and the individual is progressive; therefore, either may be conservative toward the other. The progressive must bear and forbear, while the conservative is taking the comfort of ease. But woe to the party, whichever it may be, that in such a case is at ease in Zion. ' The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God '— does not help the sinning party out of the error of their ways ; therefore, the sword of the Spirit — of the true Reformer— must be as keen, in its edge, toward the reprover as it is toward the reproved ; toward the progressive as it is toward the conservative. Timidity. — A timorous, dictatorial person, who, when riding in a wagon, exercises constant supervision of the teamster, is broken of the habit by riding in cars where they have no voice or control over the train or its conductor. If such men can give up to the judgment and skill of others in the one case, why not in the other ? If in a wagon there be eight persons, have not each the same right of superintendence of the team ? Again, the tim- orous person will often be the most frightened when there is the least danger, and the most quiet when danger is imminent. ' 'Tis education forms the common mind. Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.' We may educate ourselves a good deal, if we cannot change constitutional proclivities.
