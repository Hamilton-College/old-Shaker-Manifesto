Sanitary How I Cured My Cold Feet Cold feet are, with a large number of persons, all the year round, and more particularly during the winter months, a source of constant discomfort and depression. Many women and children never know the satisfaction of being warm. All this is contrary to what was in. tended by nature. A good circulation of the blood t^nds to produce individual happiness and comfort. No one need suffer from cold feet, which are symptomatic of mal-distribution of the blood. It is part of the duty of the healthy nervous system to regulate the balance of the circulation and, under the vicissitudes of err' ery-day life, to ensure to every part a sufficient suppiy of blood. Whenever there is liability to derangement of the circulation, producing local congestion or depletion, it is evident the nervous tone is lowered. Such a state opens the way for a variety of diseases. Sedentary occupation, eating indigestible food, congested liver, disordered digestion, tight lacing or tight boots are all apt to cause cold feet, unless the constitutional powers are very strong. The nervous tone will be raised, and so equalize the circulation, by bracing treatment, as the morning tepid or cold bath, and short sitz each day at a corresponding temperature. The weak digestion will be improved by foments, and congestion will also be removed by their use and an occasional hot-air bath. Treatment directed specifically to the feet, will be mainly cold mustard foot-bath for five minutes; if the feet are cold to begin with, warm mustard foot-bath 102 degrees for the same time, followed at once by cold foot-bath, each finished by vigorous friction. Should the feet be persistently cold at bedtime, a pair of cotton stockings well wrung out of water, covered with a pair of warm woolen ones, may bu relied upon to restore warmth and comfort.� One Who Has Tried It. Self-culture is social... Self-culture is social; one of its great offices is to unfold and purify the affections. KEEP THE BODY ERECT An erect bodily attitude is of vastly more importance to health than most people generally imagine. Crooked bodily positions, maintained for any length of time, are always injurious, whether in the sitting, standing or lying posture, whether sleeping or waking. To sit with the body leaning forward on the stomach, or to one side,with the heels elevated on a level with the hands, is not only in bad taste, but exceedingly detrimental to health. It cramps the stomach, presses the vital organs, interrupts the free motions of the chest, and enfeebles the functions of the abdominal and thoracic organs, and, in fact, unbalances the whole muscular system. Many children become slightly humpbacked or severely round shouldered by sleeping with the head raised on a high pillow. When any person finds it easier to sit or stand or walk or sleep in a crooked position than a straight one, such person may be sure his muscular system is badly deranged, and the more careful he is to preserve a straight or upright position, and get back again, the better. How Long to Sleep A prolonged and severe exertion, whether of brain or muscle, requires a correspondingly lengthy or deep repose. Sleep is the state in which the bodily fires are damped down and the machinery has an opportunity for cooling. The bow is unstrung to recover its elasticity during the recurring periods of slumber. The great point is to secure what Bichat characterized as general sleep. The whole body should be rested, so far as any avoidable demands on its energy is concerned. The Irishman who explained that a short sleep did for him because when he slept he 'paid attention to 't,'� uttered a truth in his witticism. If sleep be thorough, then a short spell will do more good than a much longer period that is incomplete and imperfect. On general principles we may sleep all we can, unless we are lazy, then sleep less. The active, wide awake, energetic, go ahead people rarely sleep too long. We cannot tamper with the striking movement of a clock without injuring it, and we cannot tamper with orderly recurrence of sleep without impairing the very constitution of things on which the orderly performance of that function depends. DRINKING TOO MUCH Children are not apt to believe they drink too* much water, and yet they do. When you come to the house, panting and thirsty from play, you will take a tumbler of water and drink it down as fast as you can and then rush to resume play, and perhaps repeat the drink. Now the next time you feel thirsty, try this experiment: Take a goblet of water and slowly sip it; before it is half gone your thirst will be fully quenched, and you will feel better for having drank only that which you need. And again, we are all apt to acquire the habit of drinking while eating our meals. Animals don't do it, and it is hurtful to us. Nature gives us all the saliva we need; and if any one will chew his food slowly and thoroughly, and not take a swallow of drink until through eating, the desire to do so would soon leave, and he will require only a few sips of water, tea or coffee after the meal is finished. This practice, too, will do wonders in the way of keeping off indigestion, dyspepsia and sickness.
