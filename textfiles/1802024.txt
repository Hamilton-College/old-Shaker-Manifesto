DRINKING TOO MUCH Children are not apt to believe they drink too* much water, and yet they do. When you come to the house, panting and thirsty from play, you will take a tumbler of water and drink it down as fast as you can and then rush to resume play, and perhaps repeat the drink. Now the next time you feel thirsty, try this experiment: Take a goblet of water and slowly sip it; before it is half gone your thirst will be fully quenched, and you will feel better for having drank only that which you need. And again, we are all apt to acquire the habit of drinking while eating our meals. Animals don't do it, and it is hurtful to us. Nature gives us all the saliva we need; and if any one will chew his food slowly and thoroughly, and not take a swallow of drink until through eating, the desire to do so would soon leave, and he will require only a few sips of water, tea or coffee after the meal is finished. This practice, too, will do wonders in the way of keeping off indigestion, dyspepsia and sickness.
