If we wish to make a renewal of spirit... If we wish to make a renewal of spirit power, a thing to be prized, valued and truthful among the people,â€”make it so by bestowing confidence and love upon those who are and will be, targets for the scorn of the infidel and unbeliever. Accepting new truths honestly and candidly given is the path to true progression. Truth is eternal. God's truths are forever the same, but the modes of presenting them may vary somewhat with each age. Languages change, human condition changes, and while meeting these changes, the true, the pure, the good will never surrender any part oi the principles of truth. Andrew Barrett.
