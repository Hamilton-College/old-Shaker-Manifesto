Society Record Sarah Jenkins B. B. DUNLAVY Pleasant Hill,Ky., Feb. 27, 1881. Beloved Elder, Giles B. Avery : I fear that the demise of our very worthy beloved Eldress , which â€¢occurred June 12, 1880, has never been reported, by reason of the temporary suspension of correspondence. It was well understood that she was one of the choicest jewels of the Shaker-fold, having spent a long and useful life in the holy cause without a single drawback to record. She was truly a Mother in Israel, and as peaceable as a lamb, even to the day of her departure for the better land, in the 90th year of her age. Stephen Jones At Watervliet, O., Jan. 10, 1881, , aged 78 years. Joseph Sneden At Hancock, Mass., Feb. 1, , aged 88 years.
