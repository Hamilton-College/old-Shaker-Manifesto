THE STORM AT SEA CARRIE V. M'CARRELL Dark is the night o'er Galilee- - A night of storms upon the sea- - Lone in their boat the Master's band ' Toil hard in rowing to the land. ' He lingers praying on the height. No earthly succor find they near; The strong arms lose their sturdy might, The strong hearts sink in helpless fear; Then from white lips a prayer is pressed, There is a calm- -the storm's at rest- - And walking o'er the angry wave, The Master cometh- -them to save. Beyond thy shore, 0 Galilee, Still shines that pathway o'er the sea; Storm-beaten, faint and sunk in fear, We call and find the Savior near- - Yet walking o'er the angry wave, While grief and doubt our weak hearts fill Yet reaching out His arm to save, Yet softly calling, ' Peace, be still. ' The Catholic.
