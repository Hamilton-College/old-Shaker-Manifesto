Sabbathday Lake, Me. Mar. 1894. After a long silence I am once more writing an item for The Manifesto. We have had cold weather, but it has frozen neither heart nor hand. Our hearts are as devoted as ever and our hands know no idle moments. We have had plenty to do this winter fighting the enemy La Grippe, who was an unwelcome visitor, yet he entered and tarried. We hope he is now dislodged, and that he may never revisit this place. The time for our Centennial is nearing. This Society was organized one hundred years ago the 19th and 20th days of April. Our fathers and mothers on those days made a verbal consecration to God in the presence of each other of all they possessed, with every faculty of soul and body. These vows they maintained to the end of their days. We can not celebrate the anniversary in a grand way but hope to have grateful hearts to appreciate the good that has come to us through their noble and devoted lives. May we live in such a way that they can call us their children. The Brethren have been manufacturing metric dry measures the past season. Logging is over, and the wood-saw is humming. The maple trees are tapped and these fine days bid fair to make that business a success. Robins will soon be here. They appeared in Portland in Feb., earlier than ever before known. Ada S. Cummings.
