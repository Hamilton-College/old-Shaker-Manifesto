THE HOUR OF WORSHIP Ad libitum. Arranged for The Shaker by the Society at Canterbury, N. H. 1 Once more the sacred hour has come, When saints together meet, To bow be-fove Jehovah's throne, And worship at His feet. O holy spirits, do in spire Our hearts to sing His praise, And touch our lips with heavenly fire, Our minds from earth to raise. 2 We would forget its scenes and cares, With angels to commune; And offer up our fervent prayersâ€” Thy will, O God, be done. This brings the promised blessing down, And knits our souls in lore; While heart with heart in spirit joined, Still heavenward we move. 3 How strong our bond of union is! 'Tis heaven thus to share; Nothing of earth affords such bliss, Nor can with it compare. May love divine unceasing flow From Christ, the living Head; Through His Anointed here below, To make His people glad.
