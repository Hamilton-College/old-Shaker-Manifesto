A WATCH IN THE NIGHT. [Contributed by A. G. Hollister.] Oppressed by something in my troubled sleep I, with a moan, awoke in deep despair; Was it some daytime duty left undone, Or was it some forgotten kiss or prayer? ] Something it was that made my pillow hard, Something my heart around or soul within; I rose and looked across a night as dark, Yes, darker than the fearful face of sin! Close, clo: e at hand a midnight taper burned, L knew it as the lamp of my fierce foe; I leaned far outhe could not help but hear 'Friend,' forgive thee every hurt and blow! ' Down on my knees I fell and prayed for him Who wrong had done me many times and oft; And as a star shone through a rifted cloud, I sought my couch and found the pillow soft! Independent.
