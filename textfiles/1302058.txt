PEACE. MARY WHITCHER. Peace, peace my soul, commands the whole Whatever earth's commotion; The day is fair in toil and care, And joyous in devotion. When peace is won, the world moves on In peaceful, kind endeavor; And those we .meet we kindly greet As sister, friend avid brother. Hear lies the strife for human life, For peace within our border : Put sin afar, we know no war, As Christ becomes our Savior.
