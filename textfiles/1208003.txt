UNATTAINED [From Scribner's Monthly.] Tired, tired and spent, the day is almost run, And oh, so little done ! Above, and far beyond, far out, of sight, Ilight over hight, I know the distant hills I should have trod— The hills of GodLift up their airy peaks, crest over crest, Where I had prest My faltering, weary feet, had strength been given, And found my Heaven. Yet once, ah, once, the place where I now stand, The promised land Seemed to my young, rapt vision, from afar, The morning star Shone for my guidance, beckoned me along, At break of day light, The path looked strewn with flowers; in that white Each distant hight Smiled at me like a friend—a faithful friend— Sure that the end Would soon, ah, soon repay with sweet redress All weariness, But when the time wore on, and in the bright And searching light Of high noonday, I lifted up my eyes, The purple dyes Through which I had descried my mountain hight, Had vanished quite. Then, suddenly I knew that I did stand Within the promised land Of youth's fair dreams and hopes; but with a thrill, I saw that still Above and far beyond far out of sight Ilight over hight, Lifted the fairer hills I should have trod— The hills of God!
