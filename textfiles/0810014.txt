ELDER F. W. E. AT WATKINS, N. Y. We present Elder Evans' address at Watkins, N. Y. The Elder preferred that others should be presented ; but having a little advantage just now, we use it, and -present his. We may publish ours at another time, as it has been printed from direct reports elsewhere. We would say however, that Elder Frederick largely elaborated upon and extended the discourse as presented by us; but it is a valuable paper, and as such was duly appreciated by his hearers.
