KIND WORDS. Maggie Ladd. What a blessed thing is a kind word; but how few, how very few there are in this world. Kind words are just as easily spoken as cross or harsh words if we will only teach ourselves to think so. We should always have a good supply of kind words on hand, ready to fall from our lips, the minute they are needed. How many bruised hearts have been bound up for new trials, just by afew kind words, spoken at the right time and in the right spirit. The one that speaks them is blessed more than the one to whom they are spoken, for it makes him more Christlike. Every kind word that a person speaks, adds a star to his crown. Some people will have so many stars and jewels for their crowns that they will need more than one crown to contain them. The number, however, will be few to those who will not have enough even for one crown. What an example Jesus set for us. He scattered kind words everywhere, upon all, none were excepted who came within hearing. He gave his life for us that we might follow his example in loving those that 'hate us and despitefully use us.' A kind word can do more good than all the gold that ever came from the Black Hills.
