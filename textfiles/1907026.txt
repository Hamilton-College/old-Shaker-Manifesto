THE DISASTER AT SAMOA. Scene, Samoa, a lovely island in the South Pacific. The harbor is made by the outcropping of a coral reef. Christian missions had been unusually successful for many years. But war, said to be stimulated by representatives of Christian nations, broke out One king is dethroned and banished. A part of the people resist the enthronement of his successor. England, Germany and America hasten warships to the scene. A battle ensues and many natives and some Germans are killed. The ships bristling with guns are in the harbor. The thiee nations jealously watch each other with many naval growls. A commission is called to Berlin to settle the quarrel as between the three civilized nations. In the meantime and while the ships wait a signal to fight or not; while thousands of far-off friends, relatives and countrymen, strain their ears to catch the news and newspapers boast of the strong, naval forces displayed, a storm, unprecedented in fierceness sweeps the vessels from their anchors, piles one on the other, or upon the beach, drowns one hundred and fifty men and officers and extinguishes as with its breath all that represents the pomp and power of two nations and the third manages to run away ! What a commentary on man's boasted power ! It recalled the sublime lines of Henry Kirke White : Howl, winds of night, your force combine Without his high behest; Ye shall not on the mountain pine Disturb the sparrow's nest. God swept them away. The wind is his servant. Selected.
