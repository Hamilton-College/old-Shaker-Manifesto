Sabbathday Lake, Me. March 7, 1897. One week of March has already sped away, but we are still having zero weather. There is more snow on the ground now than there has been at any time this winter and the lumbering business is booming. Large loads of logs are being hauled to the saw-mill daily. We have been very fortunate in the sale of our Baldwin apples, getting over $2.00 per. barrel while our neighbors have been selling for 75 cts or less. Notwithstanding the cold weather we have two toads in the green-house, that are enjoying themselves very much. They were not observed until about a fortnight ago when one was found on the flower bench close beside the roots of a large pink where on looking closer we found he had a fine warm home and a safe retreat from the cold. Later another one has come and both must be getting a good living as they are fat and ungainly-looking. The blessing of health has been ours for some time past; a blessing we know how to appreciate as in times past we have had our share of affliction. We united with the Society at Mount Lebanon, in favor of theTreaty of Arbitration, and sent our petition to our Senator Hon. W.n. P. Frye for its speedy consummation. He has presented the petition to Congress and written us that he thinks the Treaty will be ratified by the in-coming administration. Thus the day will behasteued when the nations of the earth will learn war no more. Ada S. Cummings.
