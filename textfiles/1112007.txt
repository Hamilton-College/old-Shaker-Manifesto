PRENTISSIANA: 'In Union there is strength.' ' By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one for another.' When, on the 6th of April, 1820, I accidentally or providentially found the Shakers, at Watervliet, Albany county, N. Y., and, in answer to questions, they told me how they lived—a life of virginity and community, as sister and brother, I said, where do you get the power. Other folks can't live so. They replied, ' In union there is strength; where many minds combine together, for a certain purpose, they form a strong current and are a support to each other.' Community is society in its most compact form. As members of community, of our own volition, self-respect requires that we make some sacrifice of selfishness, to the better feelings of the community—especially the better half. ' Love must govern the world,' so said the little shepherdess. ' I believe in the communion of .saints.' In each sister and brother, I]find a saint ; with the saint, I commune. If, in any case, ego, or something lower down, be lurking about—if I have not the self-respect to let the naughty thing alone, I ought to have a Crusoedom, where I can be ' monarch of all I survey.' ' Blow ye the Trumpet in Zion.' In accord and concord the outside world, under divine influences, are this day an example for our beloved Zion. Let accord, concord, love and good-will permeate all branches of Zion; and truth-loving souls, under divine influence, will fill the waste places of Zion and extend her borders. Amen.
