The Two Reformers OLIVER PRENTISS Some years ago, when the two political parties of the Empire State had got so near on the same platform that they were stepping on each other's toes, Erastus Root, of Delaware County, spake, in the assembly, the following parables : Two Beggar Girls, in the street—one was beating the other unmercifully.
