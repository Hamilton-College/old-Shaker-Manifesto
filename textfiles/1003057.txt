GEMS FROM CONTEMPORARIES The strengthening of principle is better than a great deal of frothy emotion. The secret of walking in the light is in keeping aloof from tarnished appearances. To be a follower of Christ is to live as Christ lived ; to be a Christian is to be like Christ. The trumpet of fame will sooner or later do us all the justice we need, without giving the blast with our own breath. A colored preacher, commenting on the passage, ' Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves,' said that the mixture should be made in the proportion of a pound of dove to an ounce of serpent. How many theological wars would have been averted if the Christian charity of Mr. Emerson's latest word to preachers had prevailed : ' Always put the best interpretation on a tenet.' A good many Christians pray that the world may be converted, and then sit down and wait for God to answer their prayers. But if they are farmers, they never pray that God will plough their corn fields, and then get up on the fence and wait to see the dirt fly.
