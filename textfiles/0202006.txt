Love Omnipotent No dark'nmg frowns, no boding fears, When love confronts the foe ; But cheeks still wet with passion's tears, With friendship's smile shall glow. Hate is the moonless, starless night, Where gleams no dawn of day; Love is the morning, glowing bright, That charms dark night away. Hate dreams of lands beyond the sky. Where kindred furies are; Love tells of fairer homes on high, And waits to guide us there. Hate cannot curb the human will, When passion arms the foe; It may Love's sunny fountains still, But cannot make them flow. When human wit, and human art, Where Hate inspires are vain, Yet Love, but touch the stony heart, And foes are friends again. Then let us soothe each stubborn will, Till with our own it blend. And love our every foe, until Love makes him all our friend. E. T. Leggett
