Select HENRY VINCENT ON ELDER EVANS Henry Vincent tells us this story: 'While Elder Frederic W. Evans was holding meetings in England in 1871, one of the Christian brethren became somewhat nervously excited over some of the theological views expressed by the good elder, and called out: 'What did Jesus Christ come into this world for? / demand of you what Jesus Christ came into this world for f Elder Frederic paused in his discourse, and slightly leaning forward to get a better view of his assailant, spoke in his peculiar, clear voice: 'My friend, Jesus Christ came into this world to teach such men as you are how to govern their tempers.' ' A MINISTER OF THE OLDEN TIMES There was once a minister of the gospel Who never built a church. Who never preached in one. Who never proposed a church fair to buy the church a new carpet. Who never founded a new sect. Who never belonged to any sect. Who frequented public houses and drank wine with sinners. Who never received a salary. Who never asked for one. Who never wore a black suit, nor a white neck tie. Who never used a prayer book. Or a hymn book. Or wrote a sermon. Who never hired a cornet soloist to draw souls to hear the 'words.' Who never advertised his sermons. Who never even took a text for his sermons. Who never went through a course of theological study. Who was never ordained. Who never was even 'converted.' Who never went to conference. Who was he? Christ. N. Y. Graphic.
