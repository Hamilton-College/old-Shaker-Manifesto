A MINISTER OF THE OLDEN TIMES There was once a minister of the gospel Who never built a church. Who never preached in one. Who never proposed a church fair to buy the church a new carpet. Who never founded a new sect. Who never belonged to any sect. Who frequented public houses and drank wine with sinners. Who never received a salary. Who never asked for one. Who never wore a black suit, nor a white neck tie. Who never used a prayer book. Or a hymn book. Or wrote a sermon. Who never hired a cornet soloist to draw souls to hear the 'words.' Who never advertised his sermons. Who never even took a text for his sermons. Who never went through a course of theological study. Who was never ordained. Who never was even 'converted.' Who never went to conference. Who was he? Christ. N. Y. Graphic.
