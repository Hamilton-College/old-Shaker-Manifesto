FAITH IN GOD JAMES G. RUSSELL Enfield, N. H. 1st. Why thus fainting, why thus doubting? Let thy faith be firm in God, Though the earth is in commotion, Smitten by affliction's rod. 2nd. Let the favored ones of Israel, Zion's inmates one and all, Stand through every threat'ning peril, Faithful to their holy call. 3d. Lo, the harvest season neareth, And the laborers — though few,— Shall be clothed with strength and power, God's great work to carry through. 1st. Many souls, in darkness groping, Soon shall hear the blessed sound 2d. For as saviours on Mount Zion, With their banners wide unfurled 3d. Therefore, let thy faith be steadfast, Let thy light so shine abroad, Of salvation, sweetly rolling Through the heavens all around. Ye must waft the glorious ensign To a sorrow-stricken world. That its rays may guide the erring To the City of our God.
