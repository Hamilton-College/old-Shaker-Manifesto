BOOK TABLE The Types of Christ . THE S85 form, beautifully covered, and is being sent from this office, post paid, for seven cents. The Central Bishopric of our Church give this little work the most encouraging approval, and wish that the limited number of copies may have the widest circulation. We should be glad to receive orders for the same; and hope wherever the pamphlet goes, great good will accrue. Brethren, Friends, Inquirers, shall we hear from you?
