HOW OFTEN MAY WE EAT? It has been demonstrated that, at certain intervals, when food is received in the stomach, gastric juice is secreted to digest it, and that no more gastric juice is secreted than is required for the digestion of the proper quantity of food. If a person eats twice or thrice a day, at regular periods, the gastric juice is secreted by the stomach to digest the food it has received. If, while the food is being digested, more food is introduced into the stomach, digestion, in relation to the food already in the stomach, is arrested. For instance : a person takes, in the morning, a piece of bread and several potatoes ; now, it will take about three hours for the stomach to dispose of that food. Suppose the person, about an hour after eating this food, takes a piece of bread and an apple or two ; what would happen ? The digestion that was going on in the stomach would immediately stop, and not be resumed until the food that was received last was brought into the condition of the first. Suppose he took food every hour, what would be the consequence ? The stomach would become prematurely worn out, and could do nothing perfectly — working all the time without rest. But if the person possessed a good constitution and a large amount of vital power, he would not feel, at first, this drain upon his system, but sooner or later he would have to pay the penalty of outraged nature. Some persons have an enormous amount of vitality—good constitutions. It is said of these persons nothing hurts them ; they can eat and drink any thing with impunity. This is a fatal mistake.
