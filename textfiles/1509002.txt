THE SAW CLAD HILLS. ANNIE R. STEPHENS Bathed in a glory supernal, Eobed in a snowy shroud, That is wrought by a fairy magicOut of a fleecy cloud ; They rise in a kingly grandeur, In their coronets of snow, Standing like dauntless watchers, Over the vales below. The light of the sun breaks o'er them, Tinging their peaks with gold; While crystals, stars and diamonds, Flash forth in a brightness bold. Such beauty and earthly loveliness, My soul with rapture fills ; While with reverent heart I'm looking Up to the heavenly hills. That land where the blest, transfigured, In glory and light appear; Where never a cloud o'er-shadows, Where love dispelleth fear. Sometime to that land I'm going, Aad when my Father wills I shall stand with the loved and dear, On heaven's eternal hills. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
