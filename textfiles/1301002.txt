FAITHFULNESS MARY WHITCHER 'Do all things well,'â€”a solemn task, Till heart and soul are there; And then no greater joy we ask, Than do all things with care. The first is letter of the word, The last the spirit, where We need no law of God abroad, He's with us ever near. His will is ours with one accord, His work, our joy to do ; Our Father's business and our love To work, and to be true. Canterbury, N. H..
