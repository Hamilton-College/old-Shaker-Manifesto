'The Universal Test.' It falls in the way of the little paper called The Shaker, to define its ism in a nut-shell; and it says, ' the kernel when reached is: Confess and forsake sin; live purely, and you are a Shaker without knowing it, regardless of your theology.'' How unerringly all sincere religionists of every name and nation come to this one result at last! The great end and aim of the truly religious man is to '' live purely *'â€”to throw off the yoke of sin. The attainment of this is the Great Salvation. The best religion is that which, tried by its results, is best adapted to this end. Ought not this self-evident truth to disci-edit the prevalent a priori tests by which we are ever trying our respective theologies ? And does it not suggest, too, the cheering thought, that inasmuch as we have the Divine assurance that '' in every nation, he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him;' the field of God's mercy is wider than our fears have allowed ? That wherever (even among the heathen) the sincere effort is put forth, however mistakenly as to means, for the attainment of holiness, the Divine Love shall surely, one day, bring the consummation so devoutly wished ? Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Christian Union, N. Y.
