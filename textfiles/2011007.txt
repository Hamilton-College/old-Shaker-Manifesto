Beloved Elder Henry:--A narration of our visit... Shaker Station, Hartford Co., Ct. Oct. 1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�A narration of our visit (Eiders, Robert Aitken and John Whiteley) to England and Scotland, may be somewhat interesting to Believers, in general. It was quite a surprise to Elder John to see me on board the ship Servia, as he had not learned of my anticipated journey to England. We were fortunate in obtaining one room, and in eujoying the company of each other. We had a pleasant, smooth passage over, and both Elder John and myself vverj kept busy answering enquiries about our faith and order of religious life. We made the acquaintance of the President of the Tennessee Immigration aL d Laud Co.�C. D. Sherwood. Upon our arrival in Liverpool after a voyage of eight days, Elder John went to tluddersfield while 1 passed on to Manchester. I remaiued here about one week and then went on to Scotland with Elder John. While in Manchester I visited the Vegetarian Society whose headquarters are at 75 Princess street, and was kindly invited to take tea with the Society which I at once accepted, as I knew I should meet with a superior class of men and women. The meeting was of a very interesting character, if I am to judge from what was said upon the occasion. By invitation, I spoke of the history and experience of our religious order, and its progress in self-deniai, and also in the proper selection of food and drinks ; of the conditions most conducive to the development of a regenerative life, and the power to bear a full cross against every worldly lust. The Rev. James Clark, who preaches before the first vegetarian church on the earth, was present. His home is in Salforl, Manchester, England. He is also president of the society, which is evidently the only one left of the Concordium of which I was a member. Our object was to introduce the Law dispensation on earth, as prompted by the writings of J. P. Greaves. At Kingston I had the pleasure of seeing the widow of William Oldham who was second on the list of members in the present Vegetarian society in England. This society has produced a marked effect in London and has established no less than thirty-six vegetarian Restaurants in this city. I dined in some of them and found them well patronized. From Manchester I went to Leeds where I met Elder John. We next visit Scotland. We make a short stop at Penrith to visit some friends. I had a most interesting time at the hotel while in conversation with some of the boarders, and have reason to believe that some of the good seed of gospel truth was sown in willing hearts. On the day that we reached Edinburgh we visited the exhibition and saw many things of practical utility. On Saturday I went to Dunfermline, the home of my birth. I called at the Press Paper office, but unfortunately did not meet the editor. I next visited our very kind friend George L. an uncle of Andrew Carnegie, the great iron master of Pittsburg, Pa., in the United States. He accompanied us to the Library, the generous gift of friend Carnegie. I next visit the old Abbey, where 1 view the resting place of all that was mortal of King Robert Bruce, the liberator of Scotland. I dine with our good friend George and family, and then enjoy an interesting and profitable conversation on matters pertaining to a religious life. To-day, the Sabbath, I made a journey of about six miles. It was a long walk, but not wearisome. I attended church, after which I renewed my acquaintance with former friends. Here I may mention that I crossed the bridge Forth, a structure of vast proportions, and a wonderful victory to the science of bridge building. The Tay bridge is full as long but it could not have been so much ot au undertaking as the river was not so deep nor the spans so wide. The main incident of my visit to Dundee, was to hear the Hon. Andrew Carnegie speak on the superiority of Republican institutions over the Monarchical. His audience was composed of more than two thousand interested listeners. The eagerness with which these Republican ideas were received would indicate that the time was not far distant when England would accept this advanced form of government, and in this open the way for the gospel testimony. I tarried in Dundee only two days and then returned to Dunfermlinc. Here I was invited into the office of the Press, where my time in conversation passed very pleasantly. By solicitation I wrote an article, embodying, in brief, my life and experience, and sent the same to the office of the Press. In this place I had the pleasure of meeting the President of the Vegetarian Society, John Dava, a man of more than ninety years of age. lie was a marvel of activity and can look back on a life spent in great usefulness. He was the founder of the first '� Teetotal Society' in this world. My visit proved very interesting and very sati; factory. On Monday morning I took the cars for Edinburgh, but not finding Elder John I passed on to Huddersfield, and soon learned that he had gone on to London. After enjoying a brief visit with the brother of Elder John I took the cars for Manchester. At noon I left Manchester for London, and arrived tit the Eastern Station at 5 P. M. Here I took an omnibus for Waterloo Bridge, aud then walked to Essex Street Strand. Here I found myself again in the great city ; one in which my life was so wonderfully developed for good and evil, as to fin all &gt; laud me amon r God's people in America. I did not find Elder John till late in the evening, but took a walk along ihe embankment of the Thames as far as Black friar's Bridge. A great change has taken place since my last visit. At that date the houses were all filled with families, but these are now gone and their places occupied with offices for business purposes. One of the buildings is used as the headquarters of the Salvation Army. On returning to the house I found Elder John. We again crossed Blackfriar's Bridge, and saw much that was of interest to us. The next morning Elder John went in company with some of his relatives, while I visited the office of the London Vegetarian Society. I was cordially received by the Secretary, and proffered cards of admittance to the meetings of the International Vegetarian Congress, which was to assemble the next day. I was also invited to take breakfast at the Charing Cross Vegetarian restaurant with the delegates to the Congrvs*. I visited the Memorial Ila'l when the Congress was in session, and soon found myself among interested friends. Among the letters that were read, one was from our Beloved Elder Frederic W. Evans, aud one from the Rev. II. S. Clubb, President of the Vegetarian Society in America. I was introduced as a representative of the Shaker Society in America and requested to give information of the progress of vvgctariauisni in the United States. I told them ihaf the letters which they had heard, had already given a full statement of the progress of the work, and that our order were progressing more and more to adopt a pu'u diet, purity beiug that to which we aim in our lives. A vote of sympathy was passed For the vegetarians of the U. S. The meetings which I attended proved to be very interesting aud 1 considered my time very profitably spent. It wa~with a people who knew what it was to deny the appetite of gross, animal food ; and their countenances and actions bespoke the advanced course they had chosen to live. I visited the Kew Gardens, in company with the delegates to the Congress, aud although it was a beautiful place, I found increased enjoyment while in conversation on matters pertaining to the order of our gospel home. On Sabbath morning I took the boat for Kingston, to make a call on some vegetarian friends, whose parents were visitors to the Concordium. At this place I was introduced to the widow oi William Oldham. He was the founder of the above order. As I did not reach Kingston till 2-30 P. M., I failed to meet many of the friends who had extended invitations for me to call at their homes. On Monday I visited the Editor of the 'Medium and Day Break,' James Burns, and I will send you a statement of our meeting when published. Elder John returned to Huddersfield on the previous Friday and on the 20th. of Sept. we meet again in Liverpool and sail for home in the steamship Servia. A strong breeze was blowing as we left the port and in the night I was very sick, as were many of the other passengers. My illness continued during the whole voyage, while Elder John soon recovered and was very busily engaged in conversation. Through the kindness of our dear friend Carnegie I was provided with some choice fruit, which at this time seemed to be deeply appreciated. Our vessel reached New York on the 28th of Sept. where we were met by beloved Eldress Marion Patrick and Sister- Rhoda Strowbridge. We reached home the day following where we were received by a hearty and loving welcome, and Elder John passed on to his home in Shirley, Mass.
