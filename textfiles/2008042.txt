CARE OF THE TEETH. At a meeting in Berlin, of the German association of American Dentists, the best means of preserving the teeth were discussed, and Dr. Richter, said; 'We know that the whole method of correctly caring for the teeth can be expressed in two wordsï¿½ brush, soap. In these two things we have all that is needful for the preservation of the teeth. All the preparations not containing soap are not to be recommended, and if they contain soap all other ingredients are useless except for the purpose of making their taste agreeable. Among the soaps the white castile soap of the English market is especially to be recommended. Testing the composition of them, we find that about 90 per cent are not only unsuitable for their purpose, but that the greater part are actually harmful. All the preparations containing salicylic acid are, as the investigations of Fernier have shown, destructive to the teeth. He who will unceasingly preach to his patients to brush their teeth carefully shortly before bedtime, as a cleansing material to use castile soap, as a mouth wash of oil of peppermint in water, and to cleanse the spaces between the teeth by careful use of a silken thread, will help them in preserving their teeth, and will win the gratitude and good words of the public.
