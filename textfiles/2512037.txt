The Standard Dictionary The Standard Dictionary 'is illustrated with a number of colored (plates,a novel featureexecuted in Prang and Co.'s best style. The plate of gems and precious stones is one of the most beautiful specimens of the lithographer's art ever turned out. The two volumes of the work contain altogether about 5000 illustrations, including a number of full page pictures. Those at horse, dog, fowl, seals, sheep, and swine, and like words are practical and valuable. An important feature for the scientific reader in this connection is the exact definition of the six primary colors of the spectrum, containing the analysis of several hundred shades and tints. Many thousand samples were considered and carefully compared by Professors Hallock and Gordon of Columbia College, in perfecting the color plate and in preparing the table of some 400 formulas which accompany the spectrum plate. This beautiful and instructive color plate under Spectrum was made by LiPrang and Co. of Boston, in more than 50 separate lithographic printings and at a cost of several thousand dollars.'
