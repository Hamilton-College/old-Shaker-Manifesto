CHRIST OF THE AGES. Ad Libitum. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Thou uplifting spirit, Thou Christ of the ages! Draw near to us now, be our comforting friend. Thou hast lighted the pathway of prophets and sages ; In times of affliction, a helper did send. Now, in Zion's great need we ask thy assistance; 94 THE MANIFESTO. 95 We ask it in faith, may we not ask in vain; Give us living bread, a spiritual substance; Give us strength the cause of truth to maintain. Thine shall the honor and glory be, While the eternal years roll on! Thou uplifting spirit! Thou Christ of the ages ! Hear, O hear our prayer.
