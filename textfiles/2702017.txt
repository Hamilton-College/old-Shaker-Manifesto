LOSS BY FIRE. These items were taken from a letter received from one of the Sisters of Enfield, Conn. At 7-40 on the evening of the 12th of January our large barn was discovered to be on fire. Sixty-five head of cattle were in the barn, but the Brethren were able to unloose and drive out all except five quite young animals. As the herdsman was in the family Dwelling at the time of the alarm, the origin of the fire is not known. The barn was 124 ft. by 45 ft. Several other buildings adjoining the barn were burned at the same time. There was a loss of 150 tons of hay, 30 tons of meal, an ensilage cutter, a corn husker and several other farming tools. Elder George Wilcox says he would not have taken $20,000 for the loss. The hay and grain and also the cattle were insured some $6000. The friends from Hazardville, which is several miles distant, rendered valuable assistance in extinguishing the flames and saving the property.
