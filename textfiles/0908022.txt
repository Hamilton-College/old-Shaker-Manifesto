QUERIES-ANSWERS ' Do tlie Shakers believe Jesus was divine from birth ? ' The Shakers are a body of people made up largely from adhesions by those previously belonging to other denominations, whose early educations were from the more popular creeds; hence some Shakers do believe so, but the majority of our people believe Jesus was pretty perfectly ' made under the law,' ' not of the nature of angels, but the seed of humanity;'1 'learned obedience by sufferings,' was tempted in all points, as are other men and women. The belief. pro or con, possessses no essential to salvation. We make all welcome to believe on such matters as they please, but require of members a purely celibate, peaceable, unworldly life. We, personally, believe Jesus to have been a good Jew, who was converted or progressed to the higher laws and life of Christianity. ' Do you believe Joseph was the father of Jesus ?' It is quite immaterial who was the father of Jesus, so that Jesus is a good and more excellent example for humanity, who would be genuine Christians, and not merely nominal Christians, to follow after. If God made Jesus other and better than the rest of humanity, He broke His own laws, and was thus unjust in giving superior advantages to one sent as a pattern for us to follow. If God broke His laws then, we are confident He never will again; and we are just as confident that those who believe He did break His own laws then would not believe the repetition of the circumstance if occurring to-day. ' Do you believe Jesus Christ and the God of heaven are one person ? ' We do not so believe. Christ is an honorary appendage, indicating that Jesus was anointed for the work He was called to do. To any exact follower of Jesus the. appellation is equally applicable, whether to Daniel, Frederick, Polly or Antoinette. We believe Jesus conformed His mind and life to God's will, and thus He and His Father were (of) one mind. Let us do likewise.
