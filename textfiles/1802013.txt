Beloved ministry : After parting with our loving friends at Schenectady... Port Bay, Wayne Co., N. Y. May 23, 1826. Beloved Ministry :�After parting with our loving friends atSchenectady we met with no difficulty in getting along until we landed at Clyde on Saturday morning, at 3. 30. Here we unloaded and stored our goods in De Zengo store, (on the wharf) took breakfast at a tavern, where we found John Lockwood with his carriage and horses, and started on for this place, where we arrived at 1 o'clock P. M. in better health than we could have reasonably expected, after such a fatiguing journey � We were made comfortable in the Green Bay, the name of the canal boat. The captain, Ambrose Hill, and the hands would oblige the Shakers, although the boat was crowded with passengers ot different classes of people. All seemed to respect us and to regret our departure. They did not use vulgar nor profane language in our presence. We sensibly felt that we were blessed and protected by the prayers of our faithful and lov- ing Brethren and Sisters, whom we never, never shall forget. And, O! that we may ever be so faithful as to keep our union with them. But to return to our journal. We four.d an empty house on the east point, which the Brethren had reserved for us. The other two houses, being full of young Believers with their children. The young Believers, in general, appear zealous and sincere and seem to be thankful that we are here to help them. It is evident that Brs. Proctor Sampson and William Eeed have been faithful laborers in things spiritual and temporal and have acted wisely. They with other Brethren have performed a great deal of work on the land, fencing, clearing, plowing, sowing and planting. And all, both Brethren and Sisters, are zealous striving to get something to subsist upon ourselves, and to feed the visitors that we have from different places. There are already three calls for the Brethren to come and preach; one at Galen, one at Phelps and one at Brutus. We expect that Br. Calvin Greene and three others will go to Brutus next week, about forty miles distant, as there are some there who are very desirous to hear the gospel preached. The country, here, is new and thinly inhabited. We have very bad roads, nearly as poor as they were in Savoy. After our goods were landed at Clyde, we had to store a part of them on a boat and send them to Lyons, on account of bad roads. It was considered dangerous to bring them the way we came. This made it cost some more than it otherwise would, but we do not feel discouraged, for as long as we try to do the best we can, we do not believe our good friends will forsake us. As for provisions, it looks rather dark, sometimes, unless our cruise of oil and our measure of meal hold out beyond our expectations. Now you will doubtless say, ' O ye of little faith, ' looking on the dark side of things. So we will turn over the story and tell the best side. There are a plenty of good fish in the bay, not more than one half a mile from our home, and Brs. John Lockwood and Thaddeus Cramer went last evening and helped the fishermen draw the seine and thereby obtained one hundred pounds of good fish. The bay abounds with fish, but those that are fit for salting cannot be obtained without a seine lays enough to drag in deep water; so that we are afraid that Sister Asenath Clark will not get any till next fall. We will now give a short description of the place here. The house we live in is 36x24 ft. It has four dwelling rooms, two on each story, ten ft. wide and fifteen ft long, with fire places in each. The house was lathed and plastered. Each room has two windows as large as the windows in the dwelling at the North Family, at New Lebanon. The front room 24x21 ft. was a store. We took down the shelves and counter and made it ready for a meeting room. We met in it and enjoyed the blessings of God. We sung the 'Promised Blessing, ' and thought it must be that the good spirits were present with us as Br. Calvin spoke of Father Joseph Meacham's words, 'Ye will yet be scattered abroad in the earth. ' Br. Jeremiah Tallcott spoke of the blessings of God that were for us, which we all measurably felt. We are situated on rising ground, about forty rods from the Bay, and some one hundred feet higher than the water. When we look to the north, we can see nothing but water except once in a while a schooner comes in sight. Our house is about one and one half mile from the west house and one and one half mile from the mill. There is but one run of stone repaired at the mill, which has plenty to grind all the time when there is water. There are 140 acres of cleared land on this place. Twelve acres were sowed to wheat last fall, which looked well before the dry weather. Upland of twenty acres planted to corn, potatoes and broom corn. No flax. We regret that we have no more time to write, for if we do not close soon, as broken as it is, we shall miss the chance of sending to the Post Office. We must now close by sending our unfeigned and best love to our never failing friends at New Lebanon and Watervliet, and to the Brethren and Sisters as far as you may feel to give it, humbly requesting that you would pray for the poor children at Port Bay. Your Sister, .
