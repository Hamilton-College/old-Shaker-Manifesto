LOOK UPWARD. By Ada S. Cummings. Look upward, is the call to thee, When thou art sore oppressed; 'Tis from above, thou'lt find a balm Which calms the troubled breast. Look upward, O thou biuised tiowers! The storm hath ceased, awhile, The sun is shining on thy bower Lift up thy head and smile. Look upward, send thy fragrance forth To cheer some wearier heart. Though thou art bruised, arise again, And bid thy grief depart. Remember that thy petals pure Though crushed upon the ground, Can shed abroad a perfume rare In sweetness all around. Look upward, then for joys will be Along thy journey here; It is God's hand that's leading thee, Therefore thou need'st not fear. Then look aloft, whate'er betide, Though rough may be the way, If thou would'st reach the brighter side Above, 'tis always day. Look upward: there is still a work For each and all to do, Thy faith will show the silver cloud, The sun is shining through. What tho' thy journey seemeth long! Thy goal seems yet afar; 'Look upward,' still should be thy song Thy bright and guiding star. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
