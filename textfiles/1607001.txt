How, and to whom Prayer is Answered. GILES B. AVERT. ' If ye abide in me, and ray words ' abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will in my name, and it shall be given you.' Christ. Hereby we are taught the proper condition in which to be, in order to receive the answer to our prayers, (viz.) To abide in Christ! However, the first requisite is to come into Christ; as no soul can abide where it hath not arrived. 'If any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature.' Thus it ia those who have become new creatures in Christ, who may look for the answer of their prayers ! The apostle James, instructing those who were doubtless complaining of a lack in answer to prayers said 'Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts''�unholy desires ! To become a new creature in Christ, is to die to all the elements of that life which is sinful, that which constitutes the old creature ! It is accomplished by confessing to God, in the presence o{ living witnesses, who are also purified by confession, all sins against the laws of God, manifest to the soul.; then, to forsake sin by bearing a full cross against all worldly loves, lusts, and affections, live a clean, pure, virgin life, separate from the world and all its sinful pleasures. Souls who thus live are harmoniously united to the fountain of blessings from which they would draw by prayer ; their consecrated lives of time, talents, services, treasure and strength to a godly use, are the treasures that purchase heavenly blessings. Such souls desire pot anything of their own wills, but the will of our heavenly Father and Mother,�God, consequently, their prayers are for the accomplishment of God's purposes. When souls pray to God they should consider whether the answer to their prayers is to accomplish some selfish purpose, or to do God's will, for the good of humanity ; if the latter they are in the line of blessings for the answer of prayer. In all ages of human experience., God has had some instrumentalities of the human family as witnesses of His goodness and love to man, and examples of the answers to prayer, and as revealers of His will and purposes. These have invariably been a class of self-denying, consecrated souls, who, by the inspirations of the angelic hosts, have been ministered unto as the fruit of their prayers ; and who have been teachable enough to obey this instruction ; they have been, through their earthly pilgrimage, generally much secluded from the commotions of worldly life! The Day�Dispensation of Christ's second appearing, is the 'last day'� dispensation of God's grace to man ! It is the period so often mentioned in Scripture as 'The last days' by prophetic declaration ; it includes, and conserves the baptismal wisdom and power for development, salvation and ransom for man from all the errors and sins of humanity that have been revealed in former dispensations, and ultimating in a full present salvation and final redemption from sinful nature and its desires. It doth not confine its labors to the threshold of time, but extends through eternal ages, in an increasing travel of soul from grace to grace, and glory to glory, until the character of redeemed man is formed an entire new creature in the image of God. In these stages of progress, being a woik of trial, purification, judgment, pra\ er is the normal expression of the soul, and, if true to this soul searching, soul quickening, purifying work, it will be heard and answered ! At the present time we are living in an eventful epoch, a period when humanity's great soul, through multitudinous avenues, is praying, crying unto God for soul food ! It is inquiring into the purpose of human existence ; what the means of obtaining true and lasting happiness? The baptismal power and gifts committed to the faithful laborers in the hat vest field of humanity,�in the work of Christ's second appearing, answers these prayers to Go.1 ! The inhabitants of the gospel day of the second appearing of Christ are called to be those ' saviors' of men whom the prophet declared should come upon Mount Zion, to 'judge the Mount of Esau.' (See Obadiah 21st.) This metaphor represents that body of souls whose life is in the flesh ! Esau sold his birthright blessing for flesh ; hence the metaphor. The vitalizing power of all the great instrumental mediators,�revelators of God's will and way to man, in all ages, has struck heavy blows against the lusts of the flesh, for these lusts are the sword weapons of death to both soul and body ! .Not only thus, but even the life of the generative nature in its normal exercise, must be sacrificed by souls who would be harvested into the spiritual heavenly kingdom of God ; for '�They that are in the flesh cannot please God.' Rom. viii, . 'If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die.' Iiom. viii, 13. 'With the mind, I, myself, serve the law of God, but, with the flesh, the law of sin. Rom. vii, 25. 'For he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but, he that soweth to the spirit, shall, of the spirit reap life everlasting.' Gal. vi, 8. It is instructive to see how this idea of the necessity of crucifying the flesh in order to obtain the fruits of the spirit has pervaded the human mind in all past ages of human history. We find that the revelation of the wisdom of God to the Brahmins, as expressed, in their Bible, the sacred books called the 'Vedas' written two thousand four hundred years before the Christian era, manifests a testimony against the flesh, in order to approach God in prayer. Thus, ' Through strict veracity universal control of the mind and senses, abstinence from sexual indulgence, * * man should approach God, to whom only votaries freed from passion and desire, can approximate.' Buddha said, 'A man who cherishes lust and desire, and does not aim after (pray for) Supreme knowledge, is like a vase of dirty water, in which all sorts of beautiful objects are placed1, the water being shaken up, men can see nothing of the beautiful objec's thereia placed. So lust and desire, causingconfusion and disorder in the heart, arelike the mud in the witter, they prevent our seeing the beauty of Supreme reason,' (true religion.) 'But, if a man by the gradual process of confession and repentance, comes to the knowledge of God, then, the mud in the water being removed, all is pure and clear, and man immediately comes fo.rtk in the substantial form.' 'Menu' a Brahmimcal priest, said, ''To a man contaminated with sensuality, neither the Vedas, nor liberality, nor sacrifices, nor strict observances, nor pious austerities will produce feliciity,�true happiness, though he pray for it.' Zion dwellers have no time to be idle in spiritual servitude, since the righteousness of their lives is called to be so great as to be a tribunal of judgment, for souls in the worldly life ! Jesus declared, 'The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.' Thus, we are taught that a righteous life exercises the authority of a juror, relative to the judgment of mankind. The maelstrom of creedal religious profession, of Agnosticism, of bogus spiritualism, and of infidelity to God and true religion, is dashing its turbulent waves upon the mind of man ; the light of truth, by revelation, science, and enlightened reason, manifested in a public life of consecration to th,e works of righteousness, as judged by the Christ standard, is sitting in judgment in the citadel of the soul, to pass sentence upon the combatants; and, as ever the truth must come uppermost, and ever must justice be done, so must that system, power and authority, which, obeyed, produces the most righteous life, when judged by the divine standard of law, prevail, and obtain supremacy. Thus, every soul in Zion who has received a living faith in the testimony of Christ, in dual form revealed, and in his and her coming, which has now commenced on earth, is called so to live as to be a judgment tribunal to all souls groveling in sin's dark abodes, and to grow, prepare, and administer soul food to those hungering millions whose souls pray to God for releasemeut from the thoDgs of sin and death, and to find an open door to that kingdom which spreads heaven as a panorama of blessings.
