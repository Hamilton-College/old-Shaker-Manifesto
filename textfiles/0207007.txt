Act from Principle How few persons there are whose lives are governed entirely by principle, rather than in- clination. Even those of us who may be endeavoring to live for high purposes, come far short of our aspirations; alas, how very far short ! How often Ave find ourselves debating with our convictions of right and duty, questioning if it might not be as well for us to yield to inclination just for this time, promising our disturbed consciences that we will make up for the present indulgence by more rigorous self-denial, and strict attention to duty.— Vain, fallacious reasoning of a weak nature ! We can never make up for a neglected opportunity, one misspent hour, one wrong, selfish act. Once past, the opportunity unimproved, the hour wasted, the act committed, and it is beyond our reach—beyond recall, except in thoughts of regret. We may atone for it, but we can never change the past. Alas ! how painfully are we aware of this fact. Then should we all endeavor the more earnestly to make our lives ornaments of principle ; for we all know that after all, the path of duty, though sometimes rugged, is not without sweet pleasures; and let us never follow our inclinations, if they would lead us away from the right. Then shall we be permitted at the last to look back upon our lives with satisfaction, feeling that we have ' done what we could,' and that our Father regardeth us with smiles of approbation.—ZelVs Casket.
