How true it is that a busy life gives velocity to the wheels of time. No wonder that our worthy editor writes of the rapid ity with which we pass around the year's cycle. 'Seed time and harvest, cold and heat. summer and winter, day and night,' pass in such swift review, that each duty therein seems to overlap its predecessor without being fully accomplished. Still all that we can do is to grasp the real Now and stamp our best upon it, trusting that since in the work of the tapestry weavers, each thread adds to the beautiful pattern, though unknown at the time to the workers, so if every day finds us steadfast in duty, true in thought, word and action, we can present our life pattern to the Master workman, without fear or remorse. How wisely the times and seasons are arranged. Surely they 'builded better than they knew' who planned that the New Year should open with its spotless page so soon after the Christian celebration of the reign of the Prince of Peace, which brings a renewal of Christian love, peace and forgiveness to all whose spiritual ear has heard the gentle call 'Follow Me.' Our holidays�if they may be so termedwere fraught with blessings so serene that we trust they may long cover us as a mantle, and breathe upon us a benediction. Our school-room is filled this winter to its utmost capacity, both boys and girls attending, with interested and devoted teachers. As a family we are remarkably blest with health, considering the devastation made by 'La Grippe' and fevers in the adjacent country; and were it not that duties and requisite strength, are not always balanced, our temperate, pure and regular manner of life, would ensure us perfect health. Infirmity will accompany age; still our loved elderly people have a panacea for useless and unhappy old age, by keeping an interest to do all the good they can, by loving and blessing the efforts of surrounding friends, and by being in sympathy with the young lives about them. Thus we are all endeavoring to so wisely study Life's problem, that we shall be able to garner both time and strength with which to serve God and our neighbor. Amelia J. Calver. 42 3^in. 15%' THE MANIFESTO. 43 Center Family. Jan. 1894. Dear Editor;�We have not much to communicate at this time. We send New Year's greetings to all the dear friends who may peruse the Home Notes of the Center family. Our winter continues quite open scarcely any snow and no sleighing at present writing, our help have to draw wood on wagons; no ice has been stored as yet though the house is all ready still we expect the old Indian proverb will hold good which was, 'Winter never rots in the sky,' but we may have to wait till March as we did some years ago. Many years in the past we had a number of industries that afforded for the Brethren and Sisters an abundance of work with remunerative returns, these have all left us or ceased to yield sufficient to warrant us in keeping them going. There are none coming in among us to keep this large inheritance of the Fathers intact, and we see or think we do, that hired help is incompatible with Community life and we are driven to'the alternative of hired help or fields lying waste. We have heard for the past forty years that the people would come, in great numbers by and by and fill our houses, 'come like doves to the windows.' 'Watchman tell us of the night what its signs of promise are?' Answer. 'Traveler o'er yon mountain's height see that glorious beaming star.' We want to see the star in all its glory and beauty and we want to see Zion's ranks filled up and so full there will be no need of a hired man in all Mount Zion. Timothy D. Ray son.
