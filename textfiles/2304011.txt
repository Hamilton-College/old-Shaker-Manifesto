'AS THE LIGHT OF SEVEN DAYS.' Louisa M. Bell. 'The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound.'1'' Isa. xxx., 26. In this remarkable passage, the prophet Isaiah evidently alluded to that progressive gospel work into which we are called, and which was also foreseen in the vision of John the Revelator, when the seven cycles of spiritual increase were repeatedly alluded to in prophetic language, as the 'Seven Thunders which uttered their voices'� testimonies, each with increasing power against the man of sin. Also the ''seven seals' that were to be opened : successive revelations of divine truth that should teach the laws of a more godly life. Seven is considered a mystic number and is much used in the sacred writings of all nations, as well as in both the Old and New Testament of the Christian Bible. The above passage refers to the period of prophecy fulfilled, the Millennial state wherein a new heaven and new earth should exist. In the symbolical language of the Scriptures, the moon represents the earth or civil government, and the sun divine revelation or the Church. 'The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun,'�indicates that the civil government and every thing pertaining to the natural, or earthly life, shall be so perfectly controlled by the laws of truth and justice, so righteous in all its bearings as to belong as fully to the kingdom of God according to its nature and functions, as that portion of the human race called into the higher, resurrection order which fortns the Church. Humanity as a whole to be as a great temple of which Jerusalem was but a type ;�the earthly order, its outer courts, the spiritual order, its inner courts. 'The light of the sun shall be seven fold.' This was prophetic of a church that shall include all the truths that have been revealed in previous cycles. The seven thunders, seven seals, and seven candlesticks�churches�each having some special truth. We believe that in the gospel we are called practically to bear witness to every truth which has distinguished all the different churches, and to embody all the reforms for which the world are now working. When this is fully accomplished, Believers will be a strong united people, healed from every wound of sin, agreeably to the promise : 'In that day when the Lord shall bind up the breach of his people and heal the stroke of their wound.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
