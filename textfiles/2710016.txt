Enfield, N. H. Sept. 1897. During the month of August, Eldress Rosetta Cummings, Sisters Isabella Russell, Lizzie Curtis, with the writer spent a few days at the Spiritualist's Camp-meeting held at Lake Sunapee, N. H. The evening of August 15th the Association tendered to us the use of their Hall and choir, so that we could let shine the light of Shakerism. A flash of Eldress Rosetta's illumination cast out. The Christ spirit to us means the spirit of truth, teaching that there will ever be a divine force intelligently working in humanity to accomplish divine ends. In the year 1770, Ann Lee, while imprisoned in Manchester, England, on account of her testimony against sin, believed Jesus came to her as he came to his disciples after his resurrection and transmitted to her truths that led her to go forth with the resolution to teach as he taught humanity, a life of personal purity and fellow helpfulness and only as we come under the influences that lead from the world's corroding elements and make a personal application of his teachings, do we become the true followers of Jesus the Christ. The inspiration which the thought of this noble life gives to us is the assurance that truth will finally triumph over error, the spirit of equality aright injustice. A ray from Sister Isabella's light heralded, resurrection from death to life is the forsaking of the sins and errors of the past and the soul henceforth walking in the light of truth. Always bearing in mind that only as we forego the pleasures of a sensual, selfish life, and cultivate the falculties which constitute our spiritual nature can we become co-workers with Christ in the redemption of mankind. Years before the advent of modern Spiritualism, the light of Shakerism shed forth the fact of intercommunion between the spirit and material worlds. Also, that wicked spirits could visit their former abodes, mingle with old associates with appetites still alive and craving indulgence, but the power to satisfy those desires withdrawn. Could the drunkard conceive a hell more to be dreaded than this? Is it any wonder that those interested in the wellfare of humanity proclaim,ï¿½The Saloon must go? and that anti-tobacco societies are springing into existence to crush the evil which is threatening to destroy every prospect of a noble manhood? It is indeed a blessing to those who have been educated in a manner that brings them into harmony with the advance truths of the present day, all of which bid union of spirit with the true and good, thus create a heaven within, and escape the reapings of a misspent life, in days to come.
