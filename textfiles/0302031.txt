TRUTH OF INWARD LIFE The truth cannot be compressed into a sermon. The reply to Pilate's question, 'What is truth,' cannot be contained in any verbal form. Think you that if Christ himself could have answered that question in a certain number of sentences, he would have spent thirty years of life in witnessing to it ? Some men would compress into the limits of one reply, or one discourse, the truth it took Christ thirty years to reach, and left unfinished for the Spirit to complete. The truth is infinite as the firmament above you. In childhood both seem near and measurable; but with years they grow and grow, and seem further off and further, and grander and deeper, and vaster, as God himself; till you smile to remember how you thought you could touch the sky, and blush to recollect the proud and self-sufficient way in which you used to talk of knowing ' the truth.' Truth is made up of principles ; an inward life, not any formula of words. God's character — spiritual worship ¦— the divine life in the soul. How shall I put that into a sentence, ten or ten thousand? How could Pilate's question be answered except by a life ? The truth, then, which Pilate wanted — which you and I want — is not the boundless verities but truth of inward life. Truth for me ; truth enough to guide me in this darkling world ; enough to teach me how to live, and how to die. — F. W. Robertson
