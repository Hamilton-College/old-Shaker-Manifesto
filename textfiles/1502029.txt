PRAY WITHOUT CEASING [Contributed by Anna Granger.] PRAY WITHOUT CEASING. A number of ministers were assembled for the discussion of different questions ; and among others it was asked how the command to pray without ceasing could be complied with. Various suppositions were stated ; and at length one of the number was appointed to write an essay upon it and read it at the next meeting; which being overheard by a plain sensible girl she exclaimed, What! a whole month wanted to tell the meaning of that text, it is one of the easiest and best texts in the bible. Well said an old minister. Mary what can you say about it, let us know how you understand it, can you pray all the time. () yes sir. What when you have so many things to do. Why sir the more I have to do the more I can pray. Indeed! well Mary do let us know how it is. most people think otherwise. Well said the girl, when 1 first open my eyes in the morning I pray Lord open the eyes of my understanding. While I am dressing I pray that I may be clothed with the robe of righteousness and when I have washed me I ask for the washing of regeneration, and as I begin my work I pray that I may have strength according to my day. When I begin to kindle the fire, I pray that God's work may revive in my soul, and as I sweep the house, I pray that my heart may be cleansed from its impurities; and while preparing and partaking of breakfast, I desire to be fed with the hidden manna and the sincere milk of the word; and as I am busy with the children, I look up to God as my Father and pray for the spirit of adoption, that I may be his child ; and so on all through the day ; everything furnishes me with a thought for prayer. Enough! enough cried the divine, these things are revealed unto babes, and often hid from the wise and prudent. Go on Mary and pray without ceasing. The essay as a matter of course was not considered necessary after this little event occured. Selected.
