'I think that by far the most impudent and shameless attack I ever knew to be made in a newspaper on any man or body of men unconnected with politics, is that made in the Boston Herald on the Alfred Shakers, an attack that would justify the banishment of the Herald from every decent household in the land. Either the Herald sent no reporter to Alfred to investigate the matter, or the reporter lied when he said that his statements were founded upon information given him by reputable men. There is not a man of good repute in all the town of Alfred', doctor, or lawyer, or hotel-keeper, or of any other respectable calling, who will say that he believes the report in the Herald to be true, or that he has ever furnished a reporter with any evidence upon which to base it. There is not a man, reputable or disreputable, in that town, who has lived in it any considerable time, that puts any credence in the report. The life of the Shakers, though reserved and isolated, is pure and godly, always open to a kindly and sympathetic inspection, but not to the visits of idle and impudent curiosity. I have known the Shakers ever since I Was a child, and know them to be a kindly, charitable and God-fearing people. Without reproach, they should be protected from calumny.' Eastern Argus.
