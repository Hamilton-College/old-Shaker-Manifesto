In 'The Altruist' for July... In 'The Altruist' for July is a letter purporting to come from a Shaker correspondent who writes;'I have been in this place for some time and have learned that it is not the place for me. They are too narrow in their religious belief and they think it a great sin to marry or have a wife, but I do not.' We hope Br. Loiigley will write at once and have this fellow, who is in distress for a wife, 'hurry up' and reach the community at Mo. as soon as he can. He certainly is too narrow for the Shakers and too ignorant to understand their religious belief. The Shakers say no such thing, that it is a great sin to marry. Sin is a transgression of the law, and the law almost enforced the men and women to marry. This man who is ashamed to write his present address is evidently in the wrong place and is looking for an easy job. H. C. B.
