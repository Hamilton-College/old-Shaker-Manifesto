ONE OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES. By Martha J. Anderson. BY kind invitation of the Rev. Carl G. Horst, the liberal Unitarian minister of Pittsfield, Mass., a company of three Brethren and six Sisters of the North Family of Mt. Lebanon, held a meeting in 'Unity Church' on the evening of the 20th of February. There had been a series of Tuesday evening services, at which several prominent clergymen of various denominations had occupied the pulpit, each giving an account of the origin, progress, and good work accomplished by the societies and organizations to which they belonged. The broad-minded idea of instituting these meetings, was for better acquaintance, to strengthen the bonds of fraternal love, and awaken an interest and desire to know more of the various phases of thought and belief, that build up sectarian barriers, and separate churches from associative work along the lines of organized effort for good. The evening we occupied the platform was the seventh of the consecutive gatherings; besides ourselves, only the Salvation Army had a dual representation as speakers. 'Unity Church' is an unostentatious little edifice, erected three years ago opposite the 'Catholic Church,' which is as much more imposing in appearance as it is in ceremony and ritual. The antipathetic contrast seemed a strange paradox, but no less strange did it seem that in one hundred and eighteen years, this was the first time that our neighboring townspeople had invited 'Believers' to speak in one of their churches. THE MANIFESTO. 105 While we were waiting in the minister's study for the appointed time, we unitedly felt an impression to kneel and ask the blessing of God and the good ministering spirits, that we might be able to impart the word of life, and the spirit of the testimony which uplifts and saves. (We afterwards learned that the same gift of prayer, was simultaneously shared at home, especially by the beloved Ministry.) When we were escorted to the platform surrounding the pulpit, every seat and aisle of the sanctuary was crowded with a most respectable audience. Over five hundred persons were gathered and many stood during the entire services, while others could not gain entrance. The meeting was opened at half past seven by the pastor of the church, who is a most earnest, devout, and whole souled man. He passed through the simple preliminary exercises of their own service, consisting of congregational singing, the reading of a short chapter from the New Testament, with responsive scriptural selections, and the taking up of collections. After a few kindly and congratulatory remarks, in which our friend said that he was happy to have the honor of being the first to invite the Shakers to speak in Pittsfield, he introduced Elder Daniel Offord, who replied briefly, tendering thanks for the kind invitation extended, and appreciation of good feeling made manifest in the gathering of so large and intelligent an audience. After reading and singing the hymn, 'Conquering Legions,' Elder Daniel gave a very interesting historical and doctrinal discourse, interspersed with passages of scripture, in proof of the essential life and spirit of Christian teaching as exemplified in our Order. He spoke for half an hour. After singing 'The Savior's Promise,' Eldress Anna White stepped forward, and with her usual unassuming manner and frankness of expression, read with a resonant voice a well prepared article. Though many of the people had stood for an hour, the dropping of a pin could have been heard, so rapt was the attention. Referring to our long acquaintance with the citizens of Pittsfield and the friendly relations existing between us ; the thread of her discourse was taken up on the life, character and mission of Jesus, the 'perfect Jew,' the 'Messenger of the Covenant,' the 'Christ Anointed,' and uthe first born among many brethren whom he came to redeem ;' showing that through his travel in the regeneration he made it possible for all to attain the high estate of redemption from sin and the bondage of the flesh. 'Be ye perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect.' She spoke of the revelation of the maternal spirit in Deity, and the inspiration that guided Mother Ann Lee, the founder of our Order in her work and mission of establishing the second Pentecostal Christian Church, whose foundations were laid in righteousness and truth. In equality of the sexes in all things temporal and spiritual. The recognition of the Biunity of God, expressed in duality in every domain of life, made it possible for Believers 106 THE MANIFESTO. to work out the essential principles of Religious Communism�The Virgin Life, Community of Goods, Practical Peace, United, consecrated labor, and home centered interest. Sister Catharine Allen, the enthusiastic President of the 'Self-Improvement Society,' gave a brief sketch of the progress made by our people in things material, intellectual and spiritual during the century of our existence as a compact religious body. Her account of the organization of the home circle for individual culture, the acquisition of knowledge, and unfoldment of the spiritual faculties through encouragement, mutual assistance and continuous effort on the part of those who seek membership, was interestingly set forth. Br. Charles Greaves was introduced as the Deacon of the family, which he said, implied that he was absorbed in material things. He made some very pleasing and telling remarks. After giving them some credit, for closing the saloons, he advised them not to progress backwards. 'We are called Shakers,' said he, 'because we are shaking off old habits, sins and customs that do not tend to our progress in the spiritual life, nor enhance our happiness and peace of mind. The world needs the shaking work to rid itself of the great evils and errors, political, social and religious that are dragging the bodies and souls of humanity down to the lowest depths of degradation and crime.' � 'There was a time when a good whole souled Quaker could stir up the country for twenty miles around with his testimony of righteousness; but there came a change; a state of apathy and coldness rested upon them, and it took the people for twenty miles around to wake up a Quaker, and I fear it will be so with the Shakers if we do not arouse ourselves. Though our numbers are few, we would be all right if we are true and do not marry, as do the rest of the world.' He called upon them to investigate our principles, and then come and live, not as wage slaves, but as Brethren and Sisters, toiling unselfishly for the good of each other; there were many vacant places for willing workers in shop, field and garden. The selection, 'My Weary Heart Hath Found a Resting Place,' was then sung. Sister Cecelia De Vere, whose father was a Land Reformer and an Editor of marked ability, claimed the attention of the audience by her earnest appeal for righteousness and reform in all the departments of government, labor and social life. She spoke feelingly of the present suffering among the poor, who were landless and homeless, because of the greed and avarice of monopolists. She referred to her early experience among reformers who sacrificed fortunes and even life to ameliorate wrong conditions and the unjust rule of those who bartered honor, justice and virtue for gold. There were grave problems that must be met before long, if we would not see repeated, the revolutions of the past. 'Christian Love,' was sung, and as the time had passed beyond the limits THE MANIFESTO. 107 of two hours and a half, as the clock told the hour of ten, we concluded to withdraw an article that had been written for the occasion. The minister who had been an interested listener, spoke a few congratulatory words, expressing gratitude for all that had been so well said, also thanking the patient audience for their kind attention, and the meeting was dismissed. Many friends gathered around to speak of their appreciation of the good meeting they had enjoyed. Our company were conducted to the church parlors, where we found a table daintily spread with wholesome refreshments, prepared by the ever thoughtful Martha's of the Unitarian Society; which proved a needful repast as we had an eight miles ride to take over the Berkshire hills, and down a dangerous mountain pass, over icy places; but the bright moonlight and calm atmosphere, with the feeling of satisfaction that our meeting had made a good impression, shortened the long distance, though the clock struck one as we retired to our well warmed and lighted rooms, where loving Sisters were awaiting us.
