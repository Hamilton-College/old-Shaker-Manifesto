In Memory of SISTER ABIGAIL CROSMAN. Hannah R. Agnew. Beautiful Sister, thy work is well done; You've fought the good fight and the world The joy of the Lord enter now : [overcome, A worthy disciple art thou. Truth is thy motto in example enshrined; To God every faculty given; The rest of the saints and their glory is thine, Go join their glad chorus in heaven. But do not forget those you're leaving below, 'Mid sorrows, though sweetened by love; As sheaves well ripened they're ready you [know, To be garnered in mansions above. And now to thy home, thy heavenly home, All perfect in purity's sphere, The angek rejoicing invite thee to come; Adieu, loved one, thy rest is not here. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
