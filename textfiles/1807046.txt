A SONG OF FORTITUDE. 'Add to your faith, fortitude.'ï¿½2 Peter, i., 6. We will not fear nor sorrow, Nor heed what others say, For God will be to-morrow What He has been today. We may be independent Of want and woes and wrongs, For faith in the ascendant Turns sorrows into songs. We will not beg nor borrow, We'll suffer and we'll sing; O Life, where is thy sorrow? 0 Death, where is thy sting? R. H. S.
