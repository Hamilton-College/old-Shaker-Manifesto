Rip Van Winkle RIP VAX WINKLE AGAIN. The ever-delightful 'Rip Van Winkle' is 'waking up' lately in tens of thousands of American homes where only his fame has heretofore entered. The Useful Knowledge Publishing Company, New York, has published this and other of the famous sketches of Washington Irving in an exquisite little volume, as beautiful as often finds a place in the homes of ordinary mortals, and at a mere pittance in price,â€”15 cts. in Utility binding, 25 cts. in cloth, 35 cts. in half Russia, and 40 cts. in extra cloth, red line, gilt edges. These are being scattered broadcast as specimens of the quality of book making and of the marvellously low prices of this new publishing company; and they are winning for them the friendship of tens of thousands who delight in beautiful books as well as in cheap and good literature. Enterprising booksellers will supply their publications, and club agents and canvassers are wanted in eveiy county and town, to whom very unusual terms and facilities are given. Catalogues with specimen pages and terms will be sent upon request.
