ABNEGATION. O. C. Hampton. When I feel like airing my own wisdom and smartness by criticising the ignorance of another in an invidious and arrogant spirit, I take a lesson from the grey-headed dandelion (Leontodon Taraxacum,) or the humble pumpkin flower. The first of these is such a skillfully wrought machine that it can distribute its seeds by aerial navigation all over the countryï¿½and then consider also the inimitable ingenuity and beauty of each little parachute under which the little seed sails to its destined future home. And there is the golden flower of the pumpkin (Cucurbita Pepo,) within which are the most beautiful and gorgeous galleries and walks for the promenade of insects, with a symmetry, beauty, and glory, of which Solomon in all his glory, was not to be compared. When I look on all this, and consider my own poor and limited intelli gence, all my vainglory and concei are snuffed out in a moment; and in stead of inclining invidiously to criti cise others who may not know quiti so much as myself or may not be quite so good a Pharisee as I may be, I am constrained to cry out 'Fool! take back this unholy criticism or fault you are about to lay at the door of your brother fool, and allow both of you to grow together in peace till the Harvest.' And thus my vain pride receives a wound from which there is no recovery. But herein the vale of humility and Christian charity is reaclu d, and this yields a peace and consolation which no amount of pride and vainglory can ever confer. Union Village, Ohio.
