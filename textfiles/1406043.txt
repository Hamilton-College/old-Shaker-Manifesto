Thank you, Sister Mary, for this month's Manifesto... England, Nov. 1883. Thank you, Sister Mary, for this month's Manifesto. It is more readable than usual. I read the verses on Autumn and took the warning to myself. Ah, that Winter, that Winter, and then to have no store garnered up ! The home questions, though last in the number are by no means the least in importance. I should be very sorry if its publication were to cease. Of all the magazines which I read every month none pleases me so well or does me so much good as the Manifesto. J. H. Hartley.
