Washing Fluid. â€”Take five pounds of sal-soda, one of Borax, and one of unslacked lime. Dissolve the soda and borax in one gallon of boiling water; then pour them both into eight gallons of cold water ; stir it a little and let it stand all night. In the morning pour off the clear fluid for use. For two pails of water use a half pint of the compound ; soak your clothes over night, rubbing soap on the soiled parts. Wring them out and put them over to boil in water containing soap and fluid. After boiling fifteen minutes, take them out into cold water, and suds and rinse them. Don't be afraid to boil the clothes before they are washed; it will not hurt them.
