In what does nerve-food consist?... In what does nerve-food consist? In what do we find it? Is it meat? No. White bread? No. Potatoes? No. If it is not found in these staples, in what is it to be found? I answer, in the exterior of the white kernel, in the skin of the potato, and in milk, partially; also in eggs and fish. I answer, the chief food staples, in the present dietetic system, are almost entirely deficient in brain and nerve building material. In view of these facts, is it a result to be wondered at, that the starving nervous tissue in the overworked masses attempts to satisfy an intolerable sense of craving of physical hunger bv the use of stimulating poisons ? â€” Herald of Health.
