SHAKERISM AND WOMAN. [The following communication was taken from the Woman's Journal and we are pleased to present it to our readers as a carefully and kindly written article. Ed.] Since the appearance of ' The Undiscovered Country ' by Howells, there has been an unusual interest manifested by the ' world's people ' in the Shakers and their peculiarly spiritual life. In speaking of this novel to an Elder, he remarked that Mr. Howells had doubtless written as intelligently about his people as a person could who had drawn simply from, outside observation. It is evident that the Shakers think they might be more thoroughly understood ; and certainly any system can be better appreciated when studied sympathetically, and its purposes can be best known from its friends. In whatever light Shakerismis viewed, it should be interesting to all intelligent people as a phase in the spiritual development of mankind. And if we look beyrnd the surface, we perceive that these people did not leave the world's selfi.-h joys for a mere whim, but from convictions which sprang from the depths cf the soul and raised them above the ordinary prejudices of life. Shakerism is believed by its advocates to be the ultimate or second Christian church, its founder being Ann Lee, called by the Shakers, Mother Ann Lee, and, in imitation of the early chunk, they hold all things in common. This Shaker Church was established more than one hundred years ago, and the basis of their system is 'separation from the world, confession of sin, purity of spirit, aud a united inheritance. ' The name ' Shakers' was given them by their persecutors as a term of opprobrium, but was afterwards adopted by themselves. They are, it is seen, a strictly religious organization, and they believe that the Spirit of Christ is the same, whether revealed through a man, a woman, or a child. The gospel taught by Ann Lee is, to their minds, the manifestation of the Spirit of Christ revealed through one of the daughters of man, 'A deeper work of the Christ Spirit, which was to come without sin unto salvation. ' On hearing, a few weeks ago, a sermon on 'Chritdual' bj an able and interesting Elder,* I was immediately struck by the progressive tendency of his remarks, As shown by him, wre saw contained, in the position woman holds in the Shaker religion, an enlarged idea of faith and justice. From the worship they accord to Ann Lee, and their faith in her 'renewed revelation,' spiing.s a decided tendency to respect the higher claims of woman. This extends itself into practical life, and makes them believers in the highest development of the intellect and soul of woman, andperceivers of the need of the woman element in politics as in religion, in public as in private life. Being a comparatively new organization, they have neither the prejudices nor the infirmities of age, and their eyes are not dazzled by the new light of philosophy. * Elder John B. Vance, of Alfred, Me. ;Tha!; which is most interesting is'the fact that back of their belief in the regeneration of mankind by Mother Ann Lee rises the great shadow of progress. There may be little in the quiet life of the Shakers to furnish material for history, but to the contemplative mind their life must certainly afford food for thought. In their devotion to charities, in their renunciation or all personal claim on the world's riches, and in their life of celibacy will be seen strong aspirations towards a spiritual existence. These people endeavor to live according to the strict teachings of Christ and Aim Lee, and their life of devotion and sacrifice would seem to indicate that they come very much nearer ' practicing what they preach' than humanity has genera'ly succeeded in doing. Visiting their Sunday services, one is immediately impressed by their earnestness and fervor, so much so that their peculiar mode of worship, their dance and song, does not intrude upon your notice as you supposed so unusual a service would. On the contrary, you find yourself wondering why all worship is not conducted in this manner�such is the harmony of song, movement, and dress. A picture of a band of Shakers chanting their precious tunes while marching to the slow, devotional music, and moving their upturned hands in gentle measure, is one not soon to be forgotten. Notwithstanding their reputation as ascetics, these people are decidedly social and genial, especially when among friends or people interested in their work. They are unusually intelligent as regards the questions of the day, and exceedingly interesting in conversation. But above all, there is in the society of the more intelligent of these people an irresistible something�a powerful charm, emanating no doubt from their life of high resolve, a life where individuality is forgotten in the pursuit of .truth. For this* reason it is true, that although the Shakers may be seemingly limited in scope, local in their influence, and small as regards numbers, yet the ideas they have evoked will be inextinguishable. The seeds they have planted, the truths they have felt, must pursue and agitate mankind. They have declared in the loftiest way for the higher claims of woman, and this spirit will assert itself in spite of all reactions. No man, or school of men, can grasp all truth, but every intermediate modification supplies some link in the vast chain. The impulse the Shakers have given to the world is a spiritual impulse, and in it is contained the 'prophecy of better things.' Zuleika.
