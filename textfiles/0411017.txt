BEAMS OF LIGHT 1. When the glory of light beams over our way, From bright souls in regions above; The forms of the near, the true and the dear, Who've pass'd from our sight, ere the day turn'd to night, Are seen flitting round us in love. And when we are weary and worn with life-toil, We feel their soft presence in peace. They brighten the hours, which ever are ours, To rightly improve, as onward we move, To the land where sorrow will cease. 'Tis thus we are strengthened to journey below, O, gladly we walk by the faith of today, And bear with true pleasure each care, And banish all darkness of mind, For bright is the thought, with happiness fraught, Tor in that fair land, where the purified stand, Of communion sweet, when the hriurs shall fleet, Our faith will be sight, and in its pure light, That hold us earth-labor to share. 'We'll crave not the joys left behind.
