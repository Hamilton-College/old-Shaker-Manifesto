FAITH. FRANCES DEMPSEY Faith is a virtue which most if not all of mankind possess in some degree. While the savage whose faith is strong in revenge to his enemies, the Christian faith, leads its advocates by the tenets of Jesus, to forgive their enemies. Itsays, ' Love your enemies ; do good to those who hate you and pray for them that persecute you. ' There are no two sects or denominations who stand upon the same level of faith. And no two, seemingly, of the same faith have the same opinion, thus bringing into use the old adage, 'Vaiiety is the spice ot life, ' and I think well it is so, for without these different views life would become a monotonous panorama tedious to bear. While our opinions of the non essentials vary let us be a unit on the principles. Customs are ever changing and the old must give place to the new ; but let the principles remain firm as the mountain rock. 'Without faith it is impossible to please God, for he that cometh to Him must believe that ITï¿½ is a rewarder of them that dilligently serve Him. ' Ayer, Mass.
