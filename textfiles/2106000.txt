THE KENTUCKY REVIVAL. By Richard M'Nemar of Union Village, Ohio. Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 6. If the same visible consequences have attended this kind of light first and last, the different manifestations of it must be established or condemned together. But to obviate the question more particularly, it will be proper to observe, that divine light is first received by faith. We must first believe the report concerning things invisible, before we can see the object face to face and actually possess it; and the firm belief of a thing will produce great effects both on the mind and body. Whom having not seen, ye love, in whom believing, though now ye see him not, yet rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. This unspeakable joy was merely the fruit of faith in those who had to receive the end of their faith, even the salvation of the soul. If those called New-Lights did testify that they were dead to the world, and risen with Christ above all sin, temptation, pain and suffering, were full of glory and perfectly blessed with the fulness of God, united in heart, and beyond the possibility of a separation, they only meant that this was their situation by faith. They had full faith that such a state was attainable, and were swallowed up in the delightful contemplation of it, as though they were actually in it. That it was not their real situation, was evident from their repeated complaints of remaining darkness, and their prayers for returning light. If it is said that upon this principle, all their exercises were only the workings of imagination: I answer, that until a thing is brought present to the senses, the brightest knowledge we can have of it is a bright and clear imagination, by means of a shadow or image of the thing. But we must distinguish between a vain imagination and that which is properly founded. If we form an imagination of a thing that has no existence, that imagination is vain; but it is not so, when the image of a thing is drawn upon the mind which has actual existence. What knowledge had the Jews of the kingdom of Christ while under the ceremonial law, beyond the effect of lively images? The law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very substance of the things, could never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect, for would they not then have ceased to be offered? Observe, their imaginations were not vain, they were shadows of good things, of real substances, although they were yet to come, and absolutely necessary to come in order to their perfection. The cases are perfectly similar, for if the New-Lights had found real perfection by the aforementioned exercises, would not these exercises have ceased ? The same persons would fall again and again, and rise with the same transfigured countenance, and testify that they felt Christ in them, and were full of glory as before, and again cry out for Christ to come and pardon and save them from their sins ; so that at every meeting the same sacrifices were continually offered, which was a plain evidence that their affections were raised by an influential faith, a confident expectation of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen. If any should build upon their faith and deceive themselves with the shadow, and think it was the substance, they must blame themselves, for common sense is capable of making the distinction. Obj. 4. But if it was the true light of the spirit they were in, must not that light have secured them from any such mistake ? Ans. Why did not the light on mount Tabor show the three disciples that what they saw was only a vision, and that Jesus was not yet glorified ? Why were all the disciples so mistaken about the kingdom of Christ, both before and after their master was crucified? Why did they expect it to come writh observation, and immediately appear? Why were they so mistaken as to think that John would never die ? The light of God was never sent to those who were under no mistakes, but to such as were immersed in errors and mistakes, and willing to see and have their mistakes corrected. The first work of God is to discover errors and mistakes and have them put out of the way, and this must needs be done, before anything substantial and permanent can be built up. Hence, the work among the NewLights was intended to tear down and remove the rubbish of old systems, and therefore, the subjects of it, had practically and experimentally, to handle and prove the corrupt materials of the whole fabric. To be elected and singled out as the distinguished objects of irresistible grace, carried through even to the resurrection, and after being raised in glory, soul and body reunited, openly acknowledged and acquitted as dear children of God and made perfectly blessed, as they had supposed; yet after all, they found they were in their sins, 'exposed to all the miseries in this life, to death itself, and to the pains of hell forever.' Consequently, the whole building must be one grand mistake throughout, and therefore in obedience to that light, by which they discovered the danger of the old building, they determined to forsake it, or roll it away piece by piece, until the way was prepared for a better foundation. The disciples and followers of Jesus had his promise that they should receive the Holy Spirit, who would abide with them forever ; that he and the Father would come and make, their abode with them. Until the promise was fulfilled their old Pharisaical errors remained, and they were liable to pervert and abuse all the new light they received, by mixing it with their vain superstitions and traditions of men. The greater part gloried that such a Savior was raised to Israel, but if they had not been mistaken they would rather have gloried in such a breaker being raised to Israel. The disciples of Jesus were much more mistaken at first than his avowed enemies, for the latter evidently saw that he would be the occasion of taking away their place and nation, unless he could be defeated by superior power; whereas the former imagined that his whole design was to build them up. In the midst of all their glorying, and the exercise of such spiritual power as they had, they were often warned not to rest in what they had received. No wonder then, if many of the opposers of the late revival, in its first stages, were capable of forming a more correct judgment concerning the visible effects of it, than those who were in it, and of improving upon the admonitions given to the disciples of old in a similar case, to convince the New-Lights that all their mighty gifts did not carry them out of the reach of danger. Not every one that saith Lord, Lordï¿½For many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out demons? and in thy name done many wonderful works? and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me ye that work iniquity.
