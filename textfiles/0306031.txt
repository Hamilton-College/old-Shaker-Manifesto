RETIREMENT 1. When a lone and retir'd in the 2. 'Tis a time when the soul while in soul's silent chamber, With thoughts flx'd on heavenly treasures above, deepest emotion, Can newly aspire lor the unction of Christ, The angels endow'd with the true resurrection, Waft to our spirits the balm of sweet love. How cheering the thought, that a time for reflection Can press for the blessing, in fervent devotion, Unfolding growth, of the angelic life. Tis a season of peaceful, and holy seclusion, Will banish all sorrow and fear from the heart, Will brighten the hopes of the future before us, And unto our spirit sweet solace impart. When we for the life that's eternal prepare, Remote from the world with its strife and confusion, Blest hour of retirement, I'll spend thee in pray'r.
