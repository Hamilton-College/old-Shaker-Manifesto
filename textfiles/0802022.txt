CORRESPONDENCE Chauncy Dibble, Friend, Your letter of the 22nd. ult. is at hand... Augusta, Mich, 12th. Mo. 1877 Chauncy Dibble, Friend, Your letter of the 22nd. ult. is at hand. I see you are one of those candid seekers after truth. We are all subject to its divine laws, and must answer for our own conduct individually. Our relation to Deity is found by humble prayer, which is the key to heaven. None but the virtuous and godly can enter there. You ask my idea of the unregenerate in the other existence. If there is a condition of salvation, there is also a place of destruction to be saved from. There is a burning of soul to all who reject the truth. There is no device nor repentance in the grave. No returning to acceptance with God after death. It is casting a stigma to insinuate that our time of probation here is insufficient. It is no injustice if a soul is tormented in hell; for we all have our own choice. We make our own condemnation; we are judged according to the deeds done in the body; they that are wise are wise unto life eternal. The wicked go to everlasting punishment. The doctrine of repentance in the future was invented by man, and suits his animal nature. It prevents many from obeying the spirit of truth now. All of every nation are invited to partake at the spiritual fountain—the living Christ—the inward Teacher—the only begotten of the Father. Born in our souls this spirit enables man to comprehend things divine. A. L. Griffin
