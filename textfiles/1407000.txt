Beloved Sisters, Mary and Sarah... Ayer Junction, Mass. Beloved Sisters, Mary and Sarah ;� As you are somewhat interested in missionary labors, perhaps we may be permitted to relate a mission we once made with J. S. T. On a morning in August we started from our place, to visit a Quaker meeting, at Mass. We arrived there about 10 A. M. They are situated in a plain, retired village and employ themselves mostly by agriculture. Arriving there and seeing the numbers already gathered, and still others flocking in, we asked how the multitude were to be fed, sheltered and lodged, and how their teams were to be cared for ! Every dwelling was a house of entertainment. Every barn, with its ample store, was thrown open to the beasts of the stall. Chambers and beds were amply provided for residents, brethren and sisters from afar, and the wayfaring sojourner, who chose to tarry within their gates. As it was my first visit we were close observers. The proprietors were happy in serving ; they gladly welcomed and entertained all. We learned that such expenses are shared by all who should and do attend the meeting. As we gazed upon the beautiful scene before us, we were forcibly reminded of similar gatherings among the tribes of Israel, in other days. History informs tis, that at the Yearly Feasts of the Jewish Commonwealth, when the trumpet announced the glad tidings that the great gathering for confession, sacrifice and atonement was about to commence, all business was promptly suspended, and in the better days of this chosen people, they arrayed their spirits in the beauty of humility and devotion, to meet the God of their Fathers at his holy temple, where an army of Priests stood ready to meet the people, hear their confessions and receive the immense herd of beasts driven from all parts of the kingdom, without blemish, to be sacrificed without price, as food for Priest and people. The spirit which ran through the host at that period, brought down the aristocracy upon a level with the poorest. These very sacrifices coming from all quarters, published to beholders, where all had come short, softened all hearts, awakened contrition and brought down all exalted feelings. Every habitation throughout the kingdom, was, for the time being, turned into a house of entertainment, as they passed to and from the altars of the temple, which leveled all ranks into the beautiful spirit of consecration. Having secured our earthly resting place, we all repaired to a plain, neat meeting house, which was well rilled. J. and the Avriter were invited to be seated with the more prominent members in front. The Elders occupied a place in front of the congregation, which numbered eleven brethren and thirteen sisters. A board partition unpainted, divided the assembly in time of public service; the women occupied the left, the men the right. In private meetings, another partition is run up, which completely separates the sexes. About one hour was taken up by Elders, Eldresses and people, in exhortation and prayer. At length a preacher from the East arose and delivered a sermon, which stands second to none we ever listened to in eloquence and beauty. He dealt largely in the scriptures, and his pictorial illustrations were so life-like, lie could make the hearers almost see what he talked about. Their theology embraces the atonement for sin, washing in the blood of the Lamb for regeneration; while they claim, that Jesus had such a superabundance of righteousness, that he could furnish an outfit for the whole human family. At 8. P. M. we were dismissed, with a request that all members attend promptly to other meetings ; while outsiders present were invited still to attend, and to bring other friends with them and to take part in the worship. We now retired for dinner. We were pleased to observe that their dining rooms, tables and other fixtures were built with particular reference to these gatherings, and in simplicity, quite similar to Believers. Their bill of fare was ample. Dinner over, we passed into the sitting rooms. The one we had entered for rest was well filled ; amongthe number, was one of their most talkative ministers. He directly entered into conversation with us, and suddenly put these questions fairly :�' Please allow me to ask, how you look upon the standing of Jesus ? How is he connected with the Godhead? What was his mission to our race ? ' We wTere now fairly in for some of the most radical questions he could ask. It must be remembered, that J. is a Quaker. We came on his invitation. There were many interested listeners, but we answered as best we could under the circumstances. My friend, we came among you determined, neither to introduce our theology nor interfere with yours. He now stated, that he once met two of our brethren in the cars, while traveling in the west, who informed him that the Shakers considered Jesus as a man, a preacher with higher light. This broke the bands. We found he had an honest motive in his questions, and we replied. We consider Jesus ' as the faithful and true witness ;' but a man born of a woman, with an organization capable of receiving and teaching all that was required for the salvation of the race. If you claim that he had a miraculous birth, we shall have no controversy on it. He then introduced God as the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. We indorsed this, and asked if the Quakers did not believe that these were three males, which they did not deny, we answered ;�A father always supposes a mother, a son certainly does, and if the Scriptures are correct, there certainly is a mother. When God was ready, He said to some one connected with Him, tbLet us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, and let them have dominion over all the earth. So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him, male and female created He them, and called their name, Adam. ' (To BE CONTINUED.)
