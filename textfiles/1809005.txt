A PETITION. Prudie A. Stickney. From thy throne of grace, kind Father, Send conviction down to-night, And in every hour of danger, Lead and guide me in the right. Thorny seems the way, and tangled Is the path I walk below; Do not leave me thus to wander, Lead me where sweet waters flow. May thy angels, righteous Father, Be my guide throughout the day, And when evening shadows gather, Do not let my footsteps stray. Kneeling at thy throne of mercy, One sweet boon I crave this night; One more praj er to thee I offerï¿½ Keep my soul from sin and blight. West Gloucester, Me.
