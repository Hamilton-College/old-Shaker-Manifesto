ISSACHAR BATES.-NO. 4. BY H. C. BLINN. Persons from these places were afterwards gathered to New Lebanon. Hancock and Watervliet. Journeys were subsequently made to Guilford, N. H. and Otsego, N. Y. In 1803 Issachar was able to move -vith his family to the Society at Watervliet, as his wife had accepted the faith and was anxious to be with the Believers. In December 180-i he was called to New Lebanon, by the Ministry who conversed with him about the religious revival that for a few years had been in progress in Ohio and Kentucky, and was finally chosen one of the three brethren to go as a missionary to the then far West. The day for departure was the first day of January 1805. They were furnished with one horse to carry their baggage, while the brethren (Elder John Meacham, Elder Benjamin Youngs, and Issachar Bates) were expected to travel on foot. Their route lay through New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D. C. and Lexington Ky. They heard of the murder of Joseph Langford, and were informed of the place and that the deed was written on a tree by Eock Castle river, Issachar says 'I expected to see some shocking expression written on such an occasion, but when we came to the place we found to our surprise only these words, 'Langford's Defeat,' I shuddered. Is this the world that I am in where murder is nothing but a defeat? ' On the Sabbath they went to hear Matthew Houston preach, and were much interested with his zeal for the truth. By invitation the brethren spoke in several of the meetings and were received gladly, while the people would say, ' This is what we have been praying for and now it has come.' On March 9 1805 they went to Springfield Ohio, and attended some of the revival meetings, but in a few days passed on to Malcham Worley's where as Issachar writes, 'we found the first rest for the soles of our feet, having traveled 1,238 miles in two months and twenty two days. They met some of the leaders of the revival work and very plainly informed them of the mission upon which they had been sent. These ministers Matthew Houston, Malcham Worley, Richard McNemar, Barton Stone and others were at first very attentive and listened with pleasure till a full presentation of the cross of Christ was preached, when some of them showed their preference for a worldly life and that they chose to remain in the pleasures of sin. The Brethren now visited from house to bouse, and were gladly received. Samuel Rollins in his prayer said, ' I thank the God of heaven that salvation is come. We thank thee O God that thou hast sent a chariot of fire from the East, drawn by three white horses, to bring the everlasting gospel to this land.' To meet the urgent requests to be present at the meetings, the Brethren were obliged to separate and Issachar was chosen to go a distance of ninety miles. He says, 'On the 27th. of March I started on foot and alone, through the mud and water, and waded one creek three times where the water was two feet deep. My feet became very badly blistered so that it was with difficulty that I proceeded on my way. ' The ministers received him with many marks of outward kindness but they privately agreed, to prevent him from having a privilege to speak in the meetings. Two of the ministers even warned the people not to follow any man, and one went so far as to say, ' Don't believe what man says, don't believe me for I have told lies, but keep your Bibles in your houses and in your pockets.' The people however, demanded that Issachar should have the opportunity to speak, which was soon granted and all gave excellent attention. The people during the revival had been remarkably gifted in dreams and visions and much time was occupied in relating these, as they were accepted as lessons having a reference to their own lives or the lives of the people. One dreamed that he saw a minister standing on a stack of straw preaching; the straw caught on fire and the minister fled, but a Shaker preacher sprang upon the stack, and stood there and preached in the flames till the stack was consumed to ashes, and received no harm. Issachar now returned to Ohio, on foot and alone, and reached his destination in safety. An active revival work was still in progress and many came forward and honestly confessed their sins and devoted their souls to God and all they possessed to the maintenance of the gospel cause. In April a camp meeting was held in Warren Co., and a body of New Lights were determined to break down all before them, and the poor inoffensive Shakers were denounced as deceivers, and as false witnesses. Issachar thought that the tumult at Ephesus could not have been greater than it was in this camp meeting for about one half hour. He says, 'I was ordered to the bad place, from whence they said I came, and was at the same time called many bad names. ' The old soldier was not so easily frightened. Pie had fought too many battles amidst the whizzing of cannon balls to be frightened at this late date by a few theological shot from poor old guns. Richard McNemar preached on April 28th. and took for his text, ' God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. ' It was now a time of great confusion. People came from a great distance to hear the several ministers preach. By large numbers the Believers were kindly and affectionately received, but a few of the ministers in their unchristian zeal made free to denounce them as false prophets, seducers, liars, and wolves in sheep's clothing. Some persons are seemingly obliged to use this coarse, boorish language, as their wild zeal runs away with their good sense. In July of this same year Daniel Mosely, Elder David Darrow and Solomon King were sent from the society of New Lebanon to aid the Believers in Ohio and Kentucky and were received by them with great joy. In September 1805 Issachar returned to New Lebanon, on foot, in order to obtain funds to purchase a section of land for the future society. The distance was 776 miles and the journey occupied twenty one days. He remained at New Lebanon several weeks, obtained the money $1040, and a good treasure of gospel love and in twenty three days had walked back to Ohio where the Society of Union Village now stands. The land was purchased and the next season ' wh built a two story framed house 30x40 and moved into it.'' Issachar was a man of great faith and believed implicitly in the promises of God. He was in the Lord's work and had no fear of what man might do. It was on this journey however, that he had a test of his faith, and which at a later date he looked upon as a special spiritual notice. While on this long and tedious journey from Ohio to New Lebanon, over an unbroken country, his left foot and ankle became very much swollen and with such intense pain, that it was with great difficulty he reached the public house where he was to stop for the night. He was still two hundred miles trom the Society of New Lebanon and among entire strangers. He writes in regard to this ; 'At night I could obtain no sleep. In the morning I found my foot so large that I could not wear my shoe only partially as a cover to my foot, but I went limping along, wondering what I had better do. I thought I would get a moccasin made, but if I do I cannot walk. I will buy a horse. I can pay $20 and get trusted for the balance till I return. Well that will never do to get trusted after that manner, and I cannot bear to have my foot hang without support, I will hire a man to take me in a wagon and the Believers will pay him when I reach home, and I said aloud; that will do. Suddenly a spirit voice whispered, Where is'your faith? I was in no condition to make a good reply, but said abruptly, Faith ! I should just as quick think; of asking to have my leg cured if the bone was broken! A voice Mrhispered, 'Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, it shall be done.' I cannot describe my feelings, but it seemed to me that I gave my whole soul into the name of Christ and asked.ï¿½In a moment I realized a change, and it was all over, my foot was as well as ever. And how to express my thanks I could not tell; but I put on my shoe and ran nearly three miles, singing as well as I could while on the race. People stared at me as I passed them on the road, and no doubt they thought I was a crazy man; but I did not care for that, I was so overjoyed that I had been healed. ' (To BE CONTINUED.)
