PRAYER FOR THE DEAD BY ARTHUR WENTWORTH EATON [Contributed by G. B. Avery.] Pray for the dead! Who bids me not? Do all ray human pleadings fail, Or are the human needs forgot, When men have passed within the vail? Must my petitions never rise For those whose love I held most dear, Has Heaven sundered all the ties That bound us to each other here? Have they no conquests yet to win, Are there no heights of truth to climb, And does no lingering shade of sin Find refuge in that summer clime? Pray for the dead! No voice can say That they have lost the need of prayer; And heaven is not so far away That earth is unremembered there. The golden links that bound our love Were molded by the hand of God: And prayer drew the chain above. And fastened it to his abode. And prayer shall keep our love secure, And bind us still with sacred ties, And future intercourse insure Among the heavenly harmonies. Pray for the dead! None may repress My longings at the Throne of Grace : I love my dead ones more, not less, When I behold the Eternal Face. The Spirit's life is large and fair, Nor limited by human creed ; And none shall fix a bound to prayer, Except the common bound of need. Selected.
