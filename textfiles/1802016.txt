GATHER THE GOOD. Catherine Allen. Beautiful flowers of refined and pleasant perfume, and fruits of delicious flavor, draw the elements of nutrition from the same source that supplies the rank, inferior growth of that which frequently surrounds them even on the same turf. In this selection of the finer essences, from which that ancient and wonderful chemist, Mother Earth, produces these superior odors and aliments, the roots and leaves are merely as machines acted upon by the forces of nature. But can we not see in the fact that the rose and the poppy, the strawberry and the dock root, can both be maintained from the same sod, that we, as human beings endowed with reason and spiritual understanding, can plant in our hearts those Seeds of goodness that shall send down the fibrous roots of kindly generous feeling-, and put forth leaves of active virtue? And from heavenly spheres these shall gather the freshness of vivifying showers and geutle dews, the sweet perfumes that emanate from the hearts of the pure, and beneath the warming sunbeams of love bear fruit good and acceptable to all. How much happier and more profitable is life when its forces are thus directed, than when the thistle seeds of selfishness are sown, whose growth, supported by the bitter juice of envy, yields only smarting thorns of jealousy and hate.
