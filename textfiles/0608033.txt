DAILY DUTY Each day its duty brings. The undone task Of yesterday cannot be now fulfilled Without some current work's displacement. 'Time And tide will wait for none.' Then let us act So that they need not wait, and keep abreast With them by the discharge of each day's claim; For each new dawn, like a prolific tree, Blossoms with blessings and with duties, which So interwoven grow that he who shirks The latter fails the first. Ye cannot pick The dainty and refuse the task. To win The smile of him who did his Father's will In the great work assigned him, while 'twas day, With love self sacrificing, his high course We must with prayerful footsteps imitate; And, knowing not what one day may bring forth, Live so that Death, come when he may, shall find Us not defaulters in arrears with Time — Mourning, like Titus, ' I have lost a day! '—• But busily engaged on something which Shall cast a blessing on the world; rebound With one to our own breast, and tend to give To man some benefit, to God some praise.
