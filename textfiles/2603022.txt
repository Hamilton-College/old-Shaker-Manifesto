The old saw, 'Stuff a cold... The old saw, 'Stuff a cold and starve a fever,' has been the source of much mischief. When you have taken a cold and have some local inflamation, as a nasal catarrh or an inflamed throat, it is just as improper to eat stimulating food as when you are suffering from any other inflamation. If for example, the cold takes the form of pleurisy, no one feeds it on beef and mince pie. But I see no reason why a pleuritic stitch may not be thus fed, if lungs inflamed by a cold may be.
