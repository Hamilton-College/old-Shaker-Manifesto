TOIL ON HORTENSY HOOSER Ye weary pilgrims here below, Who're blest the way of life to know, Your peace shall like a river flow And crowns to you be given. Let all the tribes of earth rejoice And praise the Lord with heart and voice, That from all turmoil, strife and noise A rest is found in heaven. Thus ransomed from a world of sin, Thus sacrificed to be made clean, And bowed in soul the prjze to win, You're o no with the Creator. 0 happy souls who're blest to share A Father's mercy, love and care ! All glorious robes are yours to wear; .No gift in heaven is greater. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
