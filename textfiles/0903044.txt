THOUGHTS FOR TO-DAY No matter how pious men are... No matter how pious men are, the moment they place policy before principle, they become incapable of doing right, and are transformed into the most odious tools of despotism. A man may be in heaven... A man may be in heaven long before he goes there; and a man may be perfectly sure that there is a hell here, even when he is doubtful about the one hereafter.

He who can only be serious... He who can only be serious, and he who can only be merry, is but half a man. Both halves must be developed to form a real specimen. God does not pay off every Saturday night... God does not pay off every Saturday night; but he is sure to ' settle in full' some day. When a person dies... When a person dies, we never regret our tenderness toward him ; but we often do our lack of it. The devil works on mortals... The devil works on mortals through their selfishness.

Many a man thinks that it is his goodness that keeps him from crime, when it is only his full stomach. On half allowance, he would be as ugly and knavish as anybody. Don't mistake potatoes for principles. To pretend to be better than we are... To pretend to be better than we are, is hypocrisy ; to pretend to be greater than we are, is vanity and folly; to pretend to be worse than we really are, is the silliest pretense of all.
