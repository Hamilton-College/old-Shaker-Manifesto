The Pear. The Pear.â€”It is a fact well worthy of note that no matter how|poor may be the season for some one fruit or another, in Pennsylvania at least if not other States, the pear-tree always has fruit. There are of course some years when there are more than others, but it is the rarest of all events in this part of the world for a pear-tree, after it gets to a fair mature bearing age, not to have on all the pears it is fit for it to bear. The cherry may shrivel, blacken and fall, and even the apple may be full of promise and yet yield us next to nothing; but the pear seems to be always on hand. It is true that as a matter for commercial growers of fruit, the apple will always be king, as we have so often contended. They can be barreled, sliced and dried, cidered, and saved and turned to use in so many easy ways, that nothing can compete with it in general usefulness ; but as an article of luxury there is nothing to beat a good pear. As a commercial fruit we do not know that much has ever been made of it. Here and there are large pear orchards returning fair profitable results; but these are but small numbers in comparison with profitable apple orchards ; and we have an idea that this will always be. There is no one who has a piece of ground but ought to have a pear-tree or two, and more than this if he has room. The great family tree should always be the peartree. It will live for a couple of hundred years. What fruit-tree will last so long? Tribune and Farmer.
