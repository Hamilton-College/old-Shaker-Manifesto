PACIFIC POLICY OF WILLIAM PENN. The case of William Penn is perhaps the fairest and fullest illustration of pacific principles, in their bearing on the intercourse of nations. The king himself had expressly abandoned these Quakers entirely to their own resources. 'What!' said Charles II. to Penn on the eve of his departure, 'venture yourself among the savages of North America? Why, man, what security have you that you will not be in their war kettle within two hours after setting your foot on their shores?' 'The best security in the world,' said the man of Peace. 'I doubt that, friend William ; I have no idea of security against those cannibals but a regiment of good soldiers with their muskets and bayonets, and I will tell you beforehand, that with all of my good will to you and your family, to whom I am under obligations, I will not send a single soldier with you.' 'I want none of thy soldiers; I depend on something better.' 'Better, on what?' 'On the Indians themselves ; on their moral sense, and the promised protection of God.' Ah! this good man trusted in the Most High, and knew Him in whose promise he confided. He had experimental knowledge that if he trusted in Him he would never be confounded�if he stayed upon Him he would never be dismayed. 'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.' He tried 'the holy experiment,' and found it to succeed. ''He had in view the glory of God by the civilization of the poor Indians and the conversion of the Gentiles by jvst and lenient measures to Christ.' In the great treaty under the elm, 'Penn's honored tree of record,' the wanderers of the forest solemnly pledged themselves 'to live in love with 'brother Onas' and his children as long as the sun and moon should endure.' More has been said in praise of this treaty than of any other ever transmitted to posterity. Voltaire says ; 'This is the only treaty between those people and the Christians that was not ratified by an oath, and that never was broken.' Noble remarks : 'No blood was shed, and the Christian and barbarian met as brothers. Penn has thus taught us to respect the lives and properties of the most unenlightened of nations.' Robert Proud tells us 'he treated the Indians with great justice and sincere kindness. It was at this time when he first entered person�lly into that friendship with them, which ever afterwards continued, and which for the space of more than seventy years was never interrupted, or so long as the Quakers retained power in the government. His conduct in general to these people was so engaging, his justice in particular so conspicuous, and the counsel and advice which he gave them was so eminently for their advantage, that he became thereby very much endeared to them; and the sense thereof made such deep impressions on their understandings t^at his name and memory will scarcely ever be effaced while they continue a people.' No marvel is it that such a man could take leave of his friends, one of whom was his tried true, and beloved Thomas Story, with 'My love is with you; the Lord preserve you, and remember me in the everlasting covenant,' or that the testimony could be borne on his behalf that 'he had the inward appearance of the enjoyment of the Deity Himself by an almost constant communion with his Holy Spirit.'
