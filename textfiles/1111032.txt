An attractive and economical tea cake... An attractive and economical tea cake, and oue which might appropriately be called 'children's delight,' is made by taking enough white bread dough to make a small loaf ; knead into it a tablespoonful of butter or lard, two tablespoonfuls of English currants ; let it rise until it is very light, then bake in a moderately hot oven. If you have any of the tin cans in whicli tomatoes are put up, use one of them for a baking tin, and bake this cake in it. You will have a pretty round loaf, and the size and appearance of the slices are also pleasing. Graham bread seems actually to taste better if baked in one of these tins.
