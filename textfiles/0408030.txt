BEAUTY In what does real beauty consist ? There is a beauty in personal form and feature ; and there are many beauties in Nature and Art, but the highest, crowning beauty of all is, that of souls, made pure by obedience to truth, and love to holiness. Untarnished by sin — faithful in every duty — they shine with a brightness that nought but purity of life can give. The soul that has subdued, in itself, all that is evil, and is moved and governed by high and holy motives, looking beyond natural things, to the Divine Spirit, for light, life and strength; who freely consecrates time, talents and strength of body and mind, to the service of God, attains to a high degree of holiness and forms a type of soul beauty. It is not enough for us to perceive, admire, and love such beauty in others; we should labor to follow their example and unfold the true and beautiful in our own characters ; and manifest our love to God, by cheerfully sacrificing that which is self-pleasing, for the good of others. To soothe and comfort the weary — bind up the broken spirit and gently lead the erring into the path of truth and right should be our highest aim. This will make the soul beautiful!
