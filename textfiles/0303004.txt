INQUIRIES By Napoleon Brown To the Churches Universally — Let those Answer who will. Did Jesus do what he taught? Did he love his enemies, and do good to those who hated him ? Did he bless them that cursed him, and pray for them who despitefully used him? And when they smote him on the one cheek, did he turn the other, also? Did he do unto others as he would have others do unto him ? Did he loan to every one that asked him, hoping for nothing again ? When he taught to judge not! did he judge? Condemn not! did he condemn? Forgive! did he forgive? Did he cast the beam (if he had one) out of his own eye, that he might see clearly to pull the mote out of his brother's eye ? Did he forsake father, mother, brothers, and sisters, and all worldly relations with its goods and possessions? Did he crucify his carnal life? If so! Who are his followers ? — Pleasant Hill, Ky.
