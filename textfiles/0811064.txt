Advantages of a Feed-cutter 'A. D.' Du Quoin, 111., writes, that in 1871, he had h MANIFESTO. 30 acres of land, 4 cows, and a pair of mules, for which he found it difficult to provide fodder. For economy, he bought a feed cutter, and then had plenty of feed and increased his stock. This increased his manure, and that doubled the supply of feed. The stock was again added to, and at present there are 22 head of cattle and horses on the 30 acres, and more feed than can he used. He now has a steam engine attached to a large-sized cutter. His prosperity dates from the day he used a fodder cutter.
