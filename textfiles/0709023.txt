SOUL NURTURE The spiritual life thrives only when it is properly cared for. Whatever may be our theory of regeneration and of its office, facts prove that the heart keeps and increases its vigor only by attention to its necessities and the looking out for their supply. The impulse given when God's Spirit starts us heavenward at the hour of conversion, does not itself provide for our steady going onward in a straight line, and at a rapid rate of movement, to our goal. The prayer, 'Give us this day our daily bread,' is meant to teach us the necessity for constant and fresh supplies. The fuel which feeds the inward fire needs perpetual replenishing. Hope will remain on the earth with weak and folded wings if it be not set soaring frequently in prayer. God will seem to be moving farther and farther away unless we keep him consciously near us by a free and steady communion. The Bible will no more glow with heavenly luster if its lids are kept shut, and its blessed sentences are not allowed to awaken and direct meditation. The atmosphere of the prayer-room is not breathed freely, it parts with its magnetism and its fragrance, when we are willing strangers in the place. We lose the yearning for others' salvation out of the heart when we neglect to point them to the Lamb of God, and we fail to keep our power over worldly souls when we cease to gaze longingly and with beaming eye toward the celestial city.
