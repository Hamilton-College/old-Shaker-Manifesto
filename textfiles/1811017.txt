HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE. 'The history of the past and the experience of the present show that the best men and women have suffered most severely in their reputations; have been reviled, persecuted and crucified. It would seem as if these revilings and persecutions were proportioned to the purity and goodness of the individual. 'A decent respect for the opinions of others, and a proper love of approbation, stimulate us to do right; but at the same time, there is a true and noble independence which results from right actions, that lifts us above the influence of malice and slander, and the well poised mind is not moved by these, except with feelings of pity for those who indulge in them.' Henry T. Child, M. D.
