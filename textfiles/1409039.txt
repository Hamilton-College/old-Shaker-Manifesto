LIVING WATER. MARION JOHNSON. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water from the wells of salvation. Isaiah set., 3. The rapt prophet, beholding in the far distant future, the gospel work of full and free salvation to the poor fallen race of I man. and the multitudes that would finally gather to the standard of the cross and become the g'.ad recipients of its soul-saving power ; bursts forth in this rapturous strain, which like clarion tones echoing down the long vista of years, have the power even now, to thrill our hearts with their fervent inspiration. In those Oriental countries where this was spoken, a fountain of pure water, was then, and is even now considered of great value, and is prized accordingly, hence the terms in which the gospel is aptly and pertinently compared to ' living waters, ' ' river of the water of life, ' j 'a fountain of water springing up unto I everlasting life, ' Avould have a peculiar significance and force to those to whom it was addressed. Living waters, are flowing pure, clear, and sparkling in distinction from that I which is dead, stagnant and foal. This ! was a beautiful figure of the purity of the gospel. As water is a source of life, vigor and health to the body, so the gospel is the source of life to the soul and from this river, which is ever flowing with fullness, the soul that is sated with the streams of earthly pleasures, and thirsting only for the water of life, may quaff life-giving draughts to invigorate and strengthen it for its heavenward journey through the Avilderness of this Avorld.
