Together we began to tread... During the month of January, 1871, the angels said ' Come !' to two interesting young sisters—Marietta Moore and Mary J. Maffit, of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Among the treasures of the latter was found the following tribute from one of her companions—Charlotte—whose affection we here make public, without her knowledge: Together we began to tread The consecrated ground; Together entered here, the home, Where grace and truth abound. Together we have sought for faith, Conviction, power, and light; Together asked for angel's strength, To guide us in the right. Together we have toiled, to earn The love that is so pure, Which clothes the soul with patience true All sorrows to endure. But now doth sickness intervene, To part us for a time ; Still we will struggle to possess The angel-life, divine. True love and friendship shall not cease For you, my sister dear; Though you maj'enter into realms, Beyond this mortal sphere— We still will seek, as one in Christ, For purity and grace; For light and truth, our souls to guide— Our errors to erase. And / will pray, and you will pray, That we may brighter grow ; And, while you toil in yonder home, I'll toil in mine below. Now, dear companion, take my love ; I'll help to bear you through ; And spirit friends will bear you hence, To scenes of fairer view.
