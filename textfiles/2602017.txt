To the Memory of Sister RHODA BLAKE. By Hannah R. Agnew. The ocean may boast of its pearls; Peru, of her silver and gold; Those bound to the things of this world, Rejoice in their wealth, manifold. Keep silence! ye minions of earth; Your glory and boasting are vain Compared with the eternal worth, Which souls by the cross do obtain. Our Sister, the loved one now gone To a land never shadowed by night, As a rose in the blush of the morn, Or a lily of sweetest delight, May bloom on forever, in Paradise fair, Increasing the treasure, now gained; The lights, and the shades, of her life record there, Show the excellence to which she attained. Enough! we have only to say, Our Sister is one of the best; While all that is earthly is passing away, Her soul is eternally blest. Go, thou lovely one, go in sweet peace; Thy work here, is faithfully done; From youth, to old age, pure wealth you've increased, Heaven's Kingdom and crown you have won. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
