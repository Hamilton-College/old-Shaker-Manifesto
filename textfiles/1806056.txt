Cosmopolitan Ignatius Donnelly's book on the Bacon cipher is out done and anticipated by a still more startling revelation that appears in the May Cosmopolitan. The writer, Edward Gordon Clark, claims that by applying Bacon's cipher to the original Shakespeare epitaph the apparent grotesque varieties of lettering are resolved into most surprising confessions concerning the life of Bacon and Shakespeare. The traveler, Wolf Von Schierbrand, furnishes a pleasing sketch about ' Children in Persia,' and Joel Benton gives many amusing specimens of ' What Our Grandfathers Laughed at Two Hundred Years Ago.' Besides E. P. Roe's popular serial story of southern life at the end of the war ' Miss Lou,' there is a notable short stoiy of the Stevenson type, entitled 'Dr. Brendt's Wife,' which is a strong piece of work. Mathew Arnold's memory is embalmed in a sonnet by his friend Joel Benton. Other poetic gems in the same number are by Danske Dandridge, Anna Vernon Dorsey, and Edith Sessions Tupper.
