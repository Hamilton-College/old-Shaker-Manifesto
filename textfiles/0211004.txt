Our Sweet Shaker Home BY JULIA JOHNSON, HANCOCK How happy the thought, that we have a home, Where manifold beauties and blessings are strown ; Which have by the hand of industry been sown, And want bringeth never a woe. More worthy we'll walk and humble of heart, From Wisdom's high oracles never depart— Nor yet think to learn a more glorious art Than sweet Christian graces to grow. The temple within we will wall round about With Faith, Hope and Love, never darkened \yy doubt5 The gaunt, ghostly demon, despair, keeping oat, Who blighteth the soul's fairest flowers. Our steps shall be guarded with caution and care ; With friends tried and true, our interest we'll share ; More cheerfully aiding life's burdeus to bear, Thus tipping with gold, the dark hours. Our hearts' pure affection we'll trustingly twine 'Round gospel companions, sojourning in time, With whom we would rise to the regions sublime — Onr spirits cemented as one. Xo more to be parted, forever at rest, In unison joined to the righteous and blest,' With never a shadow of earth to molest Eternity's beautiful home.
