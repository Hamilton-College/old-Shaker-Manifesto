EDITORIAL NOTES A novelty, in top carriages, is the invention of E. Myrick of Harvard Shakers. An ingenious device, to protect the curtains when rolled up. They are placed in a pocket, made by means of the connection between the posts and top of the carriage, requiring no strap nor buckle,and giving a very neat and tidy appearance. It has been shown in Boston, and thought by carriage dealers and others to be a great improvement. It is now at the carriage manufactory of Brigham, McEay &amp; Co., where it can be seen, and by whom it was made, than which there are no better manufacturers of carriages in this vicinity. We understand they are to make one to exhibit in the New England Mechanics' fair. A patent has been applied for and there is a prospect of a revolution in a certain class of top carriages.
