THE WOODCHUCK. Albertis Woodchucks are very pretty creatures, although they are mischievous and we are sometimes obliged to kill them. Once we had some beans planted on the farm, and there was a company of woodchucks, that began to harvest the beans beforethey were ripe. The man who took charge of the farm put an end to their trespassing, and saved his beans, by setting traps and catching the animals. I guess after we catch all of them we shall have better crops.
