Canterbury, N. H. July 9, 1891. The praying people of N. EL, who are trying to secure their hay crop, may with propriety ask for an extra share of patience. To have the rain pour down from day to day just as the hay is ready for the barn, involving an abundance of extra work and increased expense, is not quite so agreeable as one would like to have it. But then there is another side to this subject equally interesting to saints and sinners. All the small fruits are made better by a liberal supply of rain, and those who watch the vines and the bushes are anxious for rain while the hay-makers are sitting cross-legged, for good luck to come, in fair weather. Br. Watson Andrews of North Union, O. called on us the 19th of June. Seventythree years have already been recorded in his favor, and although quite feeble at present, he has our union in adding to his life, as many and even more years than King Hezekiah obtained in answer to his prayer. Br. Watson left us on the 8th. of July for K'o. Union, expecting to call, for a short visit, at Watervliet and Groveland. John Connelly, better known as Blind John, of the salvation army, made us a visit, while on his way home, to Campton, N. H. He entertained our family with some very interesting items in his experience as a Salvationist and although blind he has been an able and industrious worker for the army. With an Autoharp he played an accom- | paniment to his singing, which reminded | us of the meeting's of the Salvationists. The hour was one of pleasant satisfaction and profit. The garden which adds so much to our physical comfort during the summer and autumn is now a joy to the eyes, not only to the manager, Br. Arthur, but to all of his friends. One can almost hear those beautiful plants, the tomatoes, potatoes and corn whispering so sweetly, day and night, 'I'm coming.' The initial visit of the peas was on the 26th of June. Quite early for this locality but very acceptable. Early peas are magnetic. The eyes are made better for seeing them and the stomach decidedly better for receiving them. I had almost forgotten the beans, but not so the gardener. He has lots and lots of them marching along in all their glory. Our welcome for the beans will be ready on the very day that the corn is ready for the table. Delicious succotash! All the Narragansetts, Mohawks, Pequots and Pennacooks may be remembered with pleasure on that day. Whoever eats a dish of siiccotash should remember the red man, with thanks. But we should not say much about eating, it savors of commonness, and our excuse now is that the foregoing plants will help to form redeeming dishes. But,�but�and it is too bad to know it, that a spiritual being, made in the image of God, should not only be a common eater but an omnivorous eater. The civilized and Christianized are as yet but a slight remove from their savage ancestors. A little more thought on this subject may do some good and need do no harm. July 10th. New potatoes are ready for digging, and the yield promises to be all that could be expected. They will average 3% oz. each.' The strawberries have all faded from sight. Br. George furnished our family with seven bushels and twenty-two quarts. The berries were large and of an excellent quality.
