TO-DAY. Cecelia De Vere. There's a cloud on the restless earth to-day, It is a cloud of war, Through it may pierce no heavenly ray Of sun, or moon, or star. There's a weight on our weary earth to-day, It is the weight of power; Oppression hath a heavy sway, And slaves beneath it cower. There's smoke on our darkened earth to-day From the bottomless pit of lust, Where human loves and hopes decay, And human treasures rust. There's a fog on our miry earth to-day, From the Antichristian fen Where Priestcraft keeps the truth at bay, And Christ is bound by men. There's frost on our hardened earth to-day, It is the frost of pride, That holds the heart in error's way, And chills its vital tide. There's a blight on our fruitless earth to-day It is the blight of sin, The buds of promise fade away, And die as they begin. There's murder abroad in our land to-day, In many a princely hall, Where blasting, cursed infanticide Prepares the mother's pall. There are mingled sounds on earth to-day Of Science and Reform, Like waves that fret their rocky way, They herald in the storm. Alone is Zion bright to-day, She gleams amid the gloom, To her shall earth its tribute pay, To her the Lord has come. Far down beneath the elements That curse the earth to-day, The angel of repentance sent With speed shall make his way. Be joyful, sorrowing heart of man Though still in nature's tomb, There are but few more shadows Before thy hope shall come. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
