WHAT WAS HIS CREED? He left a load of anthracite In front of a poor woman's door, When the deep snow, frozen and white, Wrapped street and square, mountain and moor. That was his deed; He did it well; 'What was his creed?' I cannot tell. Blessed 'in his basket and in his store,' In sitting down and rising up; When more he got he gave the more, Withholding not the crust and cup. He took the lead In each good task. 'What was his creed?' I did not ask. His charity was like the snow Soft, light and silent in its fall! Not like the noisy winds that blow From shivering trees the leaves; a pall For flowers and weed, Drooping below. 118 THE MANIFESTO. 'What was his creed?' The poor may know. He had great faith in loaves of bread For hungry people, young and old, And hope inspired, kind words he said To those he sheltered from the cold. For we must feed As well as pray. 'What was his creed?' I can not say. In words he did not put his trust; His faith in words he never writ; He loved to share his cup and crust With all mankind who needed it. In time of need A friend was he. 'What was his creed?' He told not me. He put his trust in Heaven, and he Worked well with hand and head; And what he gave in charity Sweetened his sleep and daily bread. Let us take heed, For life is brief. 'What was his creed?' 'What his belief?' ï¿½Selected.
