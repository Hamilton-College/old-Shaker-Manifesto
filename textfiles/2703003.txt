In Memory of our Beloved Eldress EMILY ROBINSON. By Nancy L. Rupe. And hast thou departed, pure angelic spirit; To fathomless regions, from whence none return, Vacated thy beautiful casket forever, The mysteries of unexplored countries to learn? We sorrow and wonder why thus unexpected, That one so exemplary, faithful and true, A pure, stainless virgin, from youth to the present, In this time of trial should bid us adieu. We'll miss thee dear Sister in life's vast transactions, In council and labor, so helpful and kind; Thy self-sacrifice and thy loving devotion To pure gospel precepts so wholly resigned. Ah well may the elements join in our sorrow, Congeal the green foliage and bright river's flow, All frozen,ï¿½depicting the gloom of our feelings As thou hast so suddenly left us below. Go rest, precious jewel, a Crown doth await thee, In mansions supernal where thieves can not come, Where all is felicity glory and honor; Blest angels convey thee to thy final home! O Father of mercy direct us in wisdom, Send angels to guide our frail footsteps, we pray, And bring us all back to the fold of our Savior, From whence we have wandered and been led astray. Thou knowest, O Lord the dark cloud that hangs o'er us, May humble contrition and pure love abound; Cement us together, a oneness in spirit, In duties unselfish, forever be found. Thy numberless blessings have showered upon us, Through all our life journey as pilgrims below, Altho so unworthy, pray, never forsake us, But guide us in wisdom, as thither we go. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
