A SWEET VOICE. There is no power of love so hard to get and keep as a kind voice. A kind hand is deaf and dumb. It may be rough in flesh and blood, yet do the work of a soft heart, and do it with a soft touch. But there is no one thing that love so much needs as a sweet voice to tell what it means and feels, and it is lard to get and keep it in the right tone. One must start in youth and be on the watch ight and day, at work, at play, to get and teep a voice that shall speak at all times the lought of a kind heart. But this is the time when a sharp voice is most apt to be got. You often hear boys and girls say words at )lay with a quick, sharp tone, as if it were le snap of a whip. When one of them gets exed you will hear a voice that sounds as if it Such as have been unwilling to repent af erjbeing sufficiently warned of consequences ' as they did not like to retain God in thei knowledge,' and 'when they knew Goc glorified him not as God, ' God gave tliei over to a reprobate' (original) injudicious undiscerning, 'mind.' HfFor though God ceases not to urge, in struct, entreat or even warn his children ac cording to need so*long as it will answer useful|purpose, man after being enlightenec as to consequences or issues, is of necessity allowed his choice in all actions for which he is responsible, -and which therefore affect the determination of the final issue, and he must of necessity, abide the consequences of his choice. If he persistently refuses to hearken to Wisdom, he is left to prove his own devices, and to learn, if he will, by what he suffers, (seeing he will not learn in any other way) until the harvest, or judgment, when will he, or not, he passes under the control of a higher law. The figurative Order, could not decide man's final or eternal status, but only the status in which he would meet the final harvest or judgment of the natural order, when Christ should be revealed, The holy seed, mentioned in Isaiah vi., 13, which was preserved in the ' grape of the cluster,' and 'plant of a, great people,'' matured its first perfect fruit in Jesus Christ who is the pattern of the only kind of character that God will ever admit to dwell in his eternal kingdom of perfect peace and righteousness, man's highest destiny. And in him was the justice and perfect righteousness of God vindicated and made manifest to all that received him. Therefore Jesus testified in the name of Christ with whose life he had become identified, 'I am the light of the world. .He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life,'' as at the beginning. Restoring the light of the beginning, termed the Ancient of Days, which represents those most ancient principles which existed before all things created, and upon which they are founded, and from whence the light of day is derivedï¿½that the whole law of God may be fulfilled, preparatory to removing the natural order, (the life of which was derived through a vail of tempo- were made up of a snarl, a whine and a bark. Such a voice often sp ;aks worse than the heart feels. It shows more ill-will in the tone than in the words. It is often in mirth that one gets a voice or a tone that is sharp, and sticks to him through life and stirs up ill-will and grief, and falls like a drop of gall on the sweet joys at home. Such as these get a sharp home voice for use, and keep their best voice for those they meet elsewhere. I would say to all boys and girls : ' Use your guest voice at home. ' Watch it by day as a pearl of great price, for it will be worth to you in days to come more than the best pearl hid in the sea. A kind voice is a lark's song to a hearth and home. It is to the heart what light is to the eye. Jewish Messenger.
