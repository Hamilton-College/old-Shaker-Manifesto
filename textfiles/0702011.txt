Ayer, Mass., Nov. 22, 1876 Beloved sisters A. and E. : I have concluded to write a few lines to you collectively. The kind communication to me of the 12th inst. is received. As ii may be doubtful about my ever attempting to write to you again, I shall try to cancel the obligations on my part as well as I can. ?rom both of you I have received bjAvriting, many kind communications, also one from J. For all words of remembrance to me, or in nehalf of the gospel cause from those who are older than you I tender my thanks, as I do in an especial manner to my three correspondents. Of the future we can know but very little in regard to ourselves and still less can we know of the order in which believers are engaged. Whatever that may be :hose now on the stage of action will evidently find their hands and hearts rilled with labor, and this accompanied with sufferings and tribulation. We hope that all they may have to pass through will serve to prepare them for the jfinal enjoyment of their long and better home. I like very much the spirit of love and blessing which is breathed through our little paper, The Shaker. It is what all believers should labor to possess and be able to administer as a true test of their goodness. Those engaged in this work find much to do to conquer that spirit Avhich is opposed to their best good. Plow beautiful, and how noble and honorable it is in any one, who will take an elevated stand above the influences of a depraved nature, and there steadfastly remain. How much a person is to be respected and admired, who through the hurry and bustle of the affairs of this life, possesses a calm, :oving and quiet spirit, and strives to make all happy and joyful. In this progressive work we must keep in possession the best of all gifts, which is charity for each other. This is the fruit of the spiritual element, which we should seek first, and the temporal will naturally bear us company. Hold, my young friends, to that which is innocent and useful. It may serve to keep your minds from that which would lead you into the broad way. Please remember me according to promise, as far as is consistent. May much blessing and strength be yours through the journey of life. Accept love from all the Elders, brethren and sisters. Your brother, Thomas Hammond
