Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 1897. The weather at this time is very warm. One would think that mid-summer was again upon us. Such hot days are a blessing to the farmers who have sweet corn for the canning factories and will ripen it in a short time. We are enjoying a very delightful season with Eldress Dorothy Durgin and four of her lovely daughters, viz.ï¿½Jennie Fish, Josephine Wilson, Helena Sarle, and Jessie Evans, who compiuse the Quartet of East Canterbury. On the eve of the 7th inst., a party of Brothers and Sisters from this place, accompanied the Canterbury Sisters to Poland Springs, where the Quartet gave a Concert in Music Hall. The guests were well pleased with the singing. Some of them said the Concert was the best entertainment that had been given in Music Hall this summer. This pleased us all very much, and we returned to our home well satisfied with their success. Not long since, two of the Brothers from the same place, gave us a call. .Like John the Baptist, they proved the forerunner of the visit which is now ours to enjoy. Br. Arthur Bruce, we have heard of many times as loyal and true, and in Br. Henry Hathaway, we have hopes of fair promise for the future. Men of faith and courage are needed in this day. Their tarry, tho short, was one which all will long remember. We are in usual health and trust the same blessing rests upon every household. Aila S. Cuminin^ s.
