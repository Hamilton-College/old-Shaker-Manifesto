Being blest�if it is a blessing�I improve this rainy opportunity for penning a few Home Notes for The Manifesto . If it does not rain every day, we hope to finish our haying this present week. Some of us are trying to mend our ways both spiritual and temporal. The spiritual is an uphill path, straight and narrow but it requires a strong, unflinching will and a firm determination to ascend continuously the rugged hill of heavenly progression, and few there be who undeviatingly and successfully make the ascent. Our temporal paths we have rectified in part, and if strength and life are continued to us, we may complete the work of leveling the pavements so that we may walk safely without stumbling. Our harvest is great but the laborers are few. Grain is under shelter, also most of our hay. The gathering of apples, pears and plums call for preservation. We pickt the first ripe tomatoes this year on the 26th day of August. We ought to have had tomatoes at least a fortnight earlier, and doubtless should, if the rain and wind had not injured them sadly. Public meetings opened July 4th and we have not missed a Sabbath since. There are several able expounders of our faith, so we are ably and honorably represented. Several novitiate members have joined the North Family. 'In love the righteous are remembered While they journey here below. Every toil and care is numbered Grief and sorrow as they flow.' Calvin G. lieed. North Family. Sept. 1897. The slanting rays of the Autumnal sun, the opaline mists that enwrap the distant hills in dreamy radiance, the gorgeous and brilliant coloring of the foliage, all remind us that we are in the month of October. Despite the golden glory of the month, we know that death and decay have replaced life and growth. But the year dies royally. And like a long and godly life that grows more beautiful towards its close, so the earth seems to enwrap herself in a soft, spiritual brightness, before the melancholy rhythm of the wintry wind-harp sighs its last requiem. The passing season has brought its usual activities. The Brethren have harvested over five hundred tons of hay, which has been secured under the most unfavorable circumstances. The heavy rains of the past season in this locality, have done considerable damage; the usually quiet, meandering mountainstreams have been swollen to impetuous torrents. We have gathered fifty-six bushels of cultivated blackberries; the greater part were sold in the Pittsfield market. Sisters Martha Anderson and Lydia Staples are spending the present week at the Chatham Fair, exhibiting the handiwork of the Sisterhood, from which they expect satisfactory sales. Several companies of the Brethren and Sisters have also visited the Fair. We should be glad to speak of our spiritual status, but things that appeal to the inner senses are more difficult to describe, than those that speak to the outer eye and ear. Our wealth consists not in houses and lands, but in the noble, uplifted lives of inspired Brethren and Sisters, who are seeking for the highest expression of truth in their daily lives, having these, we are rich in all things. Despite outward evidences to the contrary, never before was spiritual evolution in progress as to-day. It is the duty of each and all to cultivate the truth-seeing power of the soul, to follow the inner light that it may shine brighter and clearer. In doing this we may not only be able to flash its bright rays upon the pathway of others, but all errors, mistakes and seeming chains of spiritual bondage will melt away before the shining of the God light within. For are we not made to stand as sons and daughters of God holding all things under our feet? Annie R. Stephens. Shakers, N. Y. Sept. 1897. When we read the editorial comments of the 'Ave Maria' on the principles of our Communities, and coming from an organ under the jurisdiction of that powerful ecclesiastical organization, the Catholic Church, we realized the fact that the boundary line of sects and parties could not prevent the communion of kindred souls and all who love the truth were as brethren and sisters, regardless of the organization, religious or political with which they are associated. Let those who think that the testimony of truth which Believers have held forth has fallen on barren ground, because of our disparity of numbers, remove their doubts; there never was a time when the testimony was working with that fullness as at present. The more advanced minds are going deep to the foundation of the causes which are producing the discordant effects portrayed in our political and religious life. The opening years of the twentieth century will witness a quickening of the spiritual forces that have been dormant, for in the inspiring words of Gerald Massy, ''Tis coming up the steep of time, And this old world is growing brighter, We may not see its dawn sublime Hut high hopes niake the heart throb lighter.' Hamilton DeGraw. West Pittsfield, Mass. Sept. 1891. Septembek, the month which summons the army of workers from their summer's rest, has come to us and we realize that our pen, having enjoyed the universal summer vacation must now resume its duties. But what can it relate that will interest or entertain? Certainly all of our friends know of the weather, of which we have had almost 'too much' and of such variety, that there was no chance for monotony. The rain has fallen liberally and regularly, scarcely a day passing whose record does not tell of a shower. There has been a strife between the rain and the hay-makers as to which would secure the hay. No sooner would 'the hum of the reaper be heard on the hills,' than a distant mutter would resound through the valleys, signaling the approach of the opposing forces, the rain. The farmers, I believe, expect to complete harvesting the hay during the present week. The potato crop through our locality is an entire failure altho that of our home is much better owing to the favorable place of planting. The corn also yields but little. Apples and pears are plentiful. Berries were of excellent quality. So we find in balancing each day's accounts that the mercies far exceed the ills, and thus our gratitude and trust is strengthened. Our list of visitors for the summer is very short, but none the less valuable, for we were pleased with the brief visit of Sisters Mary Hazard and Hannah Ann Agnew of Lebanon, both true witnesses of the value of a long life of usefulness and true righteousness. Even now their hands and hearts are constantly employed in helping others. To such we are sure a full recompense will be awarded, for they who seek earnestly the best gifts are assured that no good thing will be withheld. With hands earnest in labor, and hearts strong and true, our part is to work and to patiently wait. Not only intellectual and spiritual gifts will insure a holy life, but a wise combining of the temporal with the spiritual, thus ennobling and beautifying daily life. We rejoice that our loved Brother Ira occupies his place in our home once more, altho we are aware that often much exertion is required in doing so. We think we can extend no better wish to our friends in parting, than that written so many years ago. ' 'And the peace of God which passeth all understanding reign in your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.' Fidelia Estabrook. East Canterbury, N. H. Sept. 1897. The measure of life seems to be largely filled with hopes and fears. A part of this may be on the religious side and a part quite its equal on the side of the mere animal nature. When we bear in mind that the righteous man shall receive the righteous man's reward we have through hope, an anticipation of a satisfactory reward, and for a season go on our way rejoicing. Trials and crosses which are sure to come, change the whole order of our being, and then we bear in mind that 'nothing that defiles or makes a lie' can enter into: the Holy City; and we wonder what will become of us in that day of reckoning. If we are so lucky as to get 'wholly saved' as some of the Christian friends express it, then we can laugh at all trials and rejoice in the midst of every burden. As the season moves along, the usual changes take place, and already the singing birds have past to warmer climes. Scarcely a bird is to be seen on the premises. A growing anxiety is felt in regard to the apple and potato crops. Both will be very light. Pears are plenty, and many of these may be kept for winter use. The Sisters who went from home to sell 'Fancy Goods' have all returned. As a whole the sales have been very satisfactory, and a markt kindness extended to them in all places. By invitation, the 'Qui Vive' Quartet are on a visit to the ' 'Poland Spring House'' and will also visit the Believers at New Gloucester. Henry C. Blinn. Narcoossee, Fla. Sept. 1897. During this month we have been so blest with showers that they have modified the heat, and even those not working under shelter ha ye been measurably comfortable. The pine-apple harvest is finisht and we are resetting more slips and shoots for the harvest of another year. We have secured five tons of good hay, which is needed for the horses and oxen. The sweet potatoes that were planted the 3rd of June, are now ripe for use. The cost of raising these, is about the same as would be the white potatoes at the North. Tomatoes furnish the best crop during the winter, and we are now preparing the land for the coming winter. Every month brings a little change for the better in our new home, and at the close of five years, the time given to us to make a home, we shall look upon the work of our hands and be satisfied. Our stationary number still holds to the mystic seven. Our beloved Sister Elizabeth Sears entered our home just five months ago. She is one of God's noble women, and our doors are open to as many as may wish to come, who can make the same sacrifice, by living the same life. In our new home we find it is a constant toil, filled with the spirit of perseverance. Decision and energy may be good in undertaking a great work, but in most cases, quiet perseverance must step in to complete the work. Our good Sister Nancy is trying to take a new lease of life by holding to the higher thought�there is no disease. Andrew Barrett. Sabbathday Lake, Me. Sept. 1897. The weather at this time is very warm. One would think that mid-summer was again upon us. Such hot days are a blessing to the farmers who have sweet corn for the canning factories and will ripen it in a short time. We are enjoying a very delightful season with Eldress Dorothy Durgin and four of her lovely daughters, viz.�Jennie Fish, Josephine Wilson, Helena Sarle, and Jessie Evans, who compiuse the Quartet of East Canterbury. On the eve of the 7th inst., a party of Brothers and Sisters from this place, accompanied the Canterbury Sisters to Poland Springs, where the Quartet gave a Concert in Music Hall. The guests were well pleased with the singing. Some of them said the Concert was the best entertainment that had been given in Music Hall this summer. This pleased us all very much, and we returned to our home well satisfied with their success. Not long since, two of the Brothers from the same place, gave us a call. .Like John the Baptist, they proved the forerunner of the visit which is now ours to enjoy. Br. Arthur Bruce, we have heard of many times as loyal and true, and in Br. Henry Hathaway, we have hopes of fair promise for the future. Men of faith and courage are needed in this day. Their tarry, tho short, was one which all will long remember. We are in usual health and trust the same blessing rests upon every household. Aila S. Cuminin^ s.
