WASH YOUR HANDS. Surgeons understand how readily disease may be carried by the hands, and under favorable circumstances, communicated to others, particularly, certain specific diseases. In referring to the subject of unclean hands, the Sanitary Era says that cases of infection, that could be accounted for in no other way, have been explained by the fingers as a vehicle In handling money, especially of paper, door knobs, banisters, c'arstraps, and a hundred things that every one must frequently touch, there are chances, innumerable, of picking up germs of typhoid, scarlatina, diphtheria, smallpox, &amp;c. Yet some persons actually put such things in their mouths, if not too large! Before eating, or touching that which is to be eaten, the hands should be immediately and scrupulously washed. We hear much about general cleanliness as 'next to godliness.' It may be added that here, in particular, it is also ahead of health and safety. The Jews made no mistake in that 'except they washed, they ate not.' It was a sanitary ordinance as well as an ordinance of decency. Sanitary Volunteer.
