Beloved Editor:ï¿½I find 'The Manifesto' so full of instructive reading matter that no other periodical can take its place on my table. I want to tell you how much I enjoy reading the 'Editorials' they are very valuable. When the April No. came I was delighted with it. It does seem as if it grows better every number. Dear Br. Alonzo Hollister, I always read your articles. Good Elder Harvey L. Eads, how I wish I could see you again ; but I presume I never shall, as my home is in 'the land of steady habits,' and yours so far away. I feel that I must shake hands with Br. Daniel Offord, for his religious views in April No. coincide with mine. I am striving for the 'one thing needful,' and am refreshed in my daily walk to and from my labor by the beauties of Grod. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
