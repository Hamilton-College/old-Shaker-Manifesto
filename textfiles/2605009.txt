East Canterbury N. H. April, 1896. With spring time comes the beginning of new life. Everything seems to understand that the time of inaction has past away. It is surprising what a change is wrought in the human mind as the snow and ice-banks fade from view and the early flowers rise from their winter beds. The winter has past but we shall remember gratefully the ice that was formed for our mid-summer comfort. 2592 cakes, 22 inches square and 16 inches thick have been secured. These cakes weigh nearly 240 lbs. each. The work at the saw mill has demanded the attention of several work men during the greater part of the winter. Some 100, 000 ft. of lumber has been hauled some four miles, and sawed into boards, shingles and lathes, and are now ready for the market. Our herdsmen have two silos of 100 tons each. These are 32 ft. deep and 11x13 ft. square. On the 1st day of April some 10 tons were still to be found in one silo. For several months nearly one ton, each day, was fed to the cattle. A late report gives 87 gallons of milk per day. Two Jersey cows have just been added to the stock and their two Jersey calves are creatures of beauty. Not many birds visit the mountains of New Hampshire during the winter. An occasional caller this year was probably the Pine Grosbeak. His head and shoulders are dull red, and he carries white wing bands. These birds are very tame. Henry C. Blinn.
