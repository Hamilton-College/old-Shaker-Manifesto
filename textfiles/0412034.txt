HOME Our Zion home is not adorned With pictured walls, or gold ; Nor in a glittering chain of pearls, Is all her glory told. She bears the substance of sweet peace, The treasure of pure love ; Her power, truth and holiness That rule the heavens above. Her walls are made of living stones, With brightness they're aglow ; They form the temple of the Lord, Where souls His truth may know. And all who come beneath this dome May work for virtue's fame, Gain the true riches through that life Which claims a blessed name. O, happy home, what joys are thine ! Who from thy courts would go, To be a slave to passions base, In wickedness to grow? My heart will keep the sacred law That holds us in one band, And feast upon the heavenly fruits, That grow in Canaan's land. With dear companions I'll unite In consecrated toil, And growing in the glorious light, Will till the gospel soil. And when we leave this mortal shore, To dwell with saints above, We'll breathe a pray'r that holiness May bless the nome we love. Sarah J. Burger, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
