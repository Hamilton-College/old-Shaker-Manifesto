Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly An important and very interesting historical paper is the leading article in Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for July. It is entitled, Heroes of the Neutral Ground, and treats of the little-known history of the patriots who protected the homes and people of the Saw Mill Valley, N. Y., from the raids of the British during the Revolution. It is written in an attractive style by John P. Ritter, and is profusely illustrated. There is an article on Syracuse University, by Jennie M. Bingham, the ninth in the excellent series on American Universities and Colleges, and beautifully illustrated with views of the buildings, Greek Letter Society houses and portraits. The markets of the Mediterranean are picturesquely described by Margaret Seymour Hall. A paper on. banana-growing, by A. James Miller, tells of. the production of that delicious fruit in Central America. Colonel Nicholas Pike, the prominent naturalist, talks entertainingly about his adventures in hunting the crocodile and alligator. The Story of a Passport, by Cecil Burleigh, describes the trials and tribulations of the career of such a document. In A Shelf of Birds' Nests, Elizabeth Nunemaker gives an interesting account of her observations among the homes of 'our feathered friends.' There are a number of good short stories. The absorbing serial, The Catspaw, is continued, and the department for young people is as attractive as usual.ï¿½Frank Leslie's Pub. House, New York.
