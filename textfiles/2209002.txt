PERFECT THROUGH SUFFERING. Annie R. Stephens. A cloud o'er-hangs my way, I cannot see, A darkening trial fills my soul with dread, And every doubting step my feet must tread, Leads but to Labyrinths,uncertainty, Where weird-like shadows flit unceasingly. O faithless heart! O blinded sight that's led Where phantom shapes their ghostly presence shed, Anoint thine eyes with faith and thou shalt see. Shalt see the cloud fringed with hope's radiance bright; Shalt see thy woe an angel sanctified, That gently leads thee on through sorrow's night, If thou but calmly trust,in faith abide. Ope wide thy soullet in the holy light, And lo! thy innermost is glorified. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
