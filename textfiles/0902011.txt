MUSIC VS. THEOLOGY F. W. EVANS The gift of music was co-eval with theology among believers called Shakers. There came a time when the singing proved to be defective, not meeting the spiritual wants of the order. A new step was taken â€” music began to be cultivated as a science, but not until, in some families, it absorbed much Christianity to endure the singing. A Quaker visitor once said of us, ' I feared they would take the roof of the house off.' Were I to say that about the same time, the Theology of our Zion was in a similarly dilapidated condition, would it be a hard saying ? Does it trench upon our infallibility any more to acknowledge our imperfection in theology than in music ? I think not. The one is as susceptible to progressive influences as the other. Coming, as did Mother Ann, from the down-trodden, laboring class in Babylon, revelation had to supply the place of education with herself and followers. I trust that science and revelation will never more be separated in either our music or theology. [As our grand, old leader in Shaker theology, Elder Evans, shows a tremendous humility, consistency and good sense, to acknowledge the evolutions and progress in our theology, we commend these ideas to the New Jerusalem Messenger.
