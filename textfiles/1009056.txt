Home Topics TOMATOES Stewed tomatoes Stewed Tomatoes. — To stew tomatoes properly they should be cooked at least two hours; pour boiling water over them and remove the skin ; then slice them into a stewpan — porcelain is the best, although new tin will answer ; allow them to boil briskly for twenty minutes, then remove to the back of the range to simmer slowly until required ; season liberally with butter, salt and pepper. They will then be cooked to a thick, creamy consistency with few lumps and a high, fine flavor, and will not, therefore, need flour or cracker crumbs, which to our taste are no improvement. When molasses is used in cooking... When molasses is used in cooking it is an improvement to boil and skim it before you use it.

Antidote to Poison .—If a person swallows any poison whatever, or has fallen into convulsions from having overloaded the stomach, an instantaneous remedy, most efficient and applicable in a large number of cases, is a heaping teaspoonful of common salt, and as much ground mustard, stirred rapidly in a teacupful of water, warm or cold, and swallowed instantly. It is scarcely down before it begins to come up, bringing with it the remaining contents of the stomach ; and lest there be any remnants of the poison, however small, let the white of an egg or a teaspoonful of strong coffee be swallowed as soon as the stomach is quiet, because these very common articles nullify a large number of virulent poisons. Cheese Pudding This is a supper dish, and costs twelve cents. Into two quarts of boiling water, containing two tablespoonfuls of salt, stir one pound of yellow Indian meal and a quarter of a pound grated cheese (cost four cents); boil it for twenty minutes, stirring it occasionally to prevent burning, then put it in a greased baking-pan; sprinkle over the top a quarter of a pound of grated cheese, and brown in a quick oven. Serve hot. If any remains, slice it cold and fry brown. The People
