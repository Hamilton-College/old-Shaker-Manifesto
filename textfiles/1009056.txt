Cheese Pudding This is a supper dish, and costs twelve cents. Into two quarts of boiling water, containing two tablespoonfuls of salt, stir one pound of yellow Indian meal and a quarter of a pound grated cheese (cost four cents); boil it for twenty minutes, stirring it occasionally to prevent burning, then put it in a greased baking-pan; sprinkle over the top a quarter of a pound of grated cheese, and brown in a quick oven. Serve hot. If any remains, slice it cold and fry brown. The People
