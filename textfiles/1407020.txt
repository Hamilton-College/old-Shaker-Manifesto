IN MEMORY OF ELDER PHIDELIO COLLINS. BY J. L. S. Our hearts all are mournful sad and lonely to-day, And vain the endeavor grief's tear to repress; For the form of our Father is turned i o cold clay Anil our deep bitter anguish words fail to express. Hushed are the throbbings of a heart once so tender, So kindly compassionate Christ-like and true, And feeble our efforts fit tribute to render As his meek Christian life we now take in view. Sweet mem'ries awake and like Autumn's rich cluster Appear countless virtues which glowingly shines And gilds the immortal with radiant lustre Tho' the earth casket rests in its narrow confines. A life-work well wrought yields the toiler sweet pleasAnd richly doth merit abundant reward; [ure. Hence he will exult in the fullness of measure And peacefully ' rest in the joy of the Lord. ' We feel, tho' afflicted and stricken with sorrow It is meet that we bow to the All-wise behest; So we'll trustingly pray that on some joyous morrow We may meet him above in the 'Land of the blest.'' Now kindly adieu thou Disciple of Jesus Thy godly examples we'll pattern with care; We'll abide by the precepts thou kindly didst teach us rill we join thee in glory in thy 'House over there.'
