New England Magazine The November number of the New England Magazine i,s a Whittier number. The frontispiece is from a rare photograph of the poet taken about 1855, and the opening article takes the reader in and about the New England country, which inspired so much of Whittier's poetry, and is so associated with him as a man. It is by William Sloane Kennedy, whose monograph of Whittier was so well received. Another article deals with Whittjer as Poet and Man, and is by Frances C. Sparhawk. Allen Eastman Cross contributes a line poem, 'The Passing of Whittier.' Mr. Edwin D. Mead, the chief editor of the magazine, deals with Whittier's life, work and influence in his Editor's Table. The articles are finely illustrated throughout.
