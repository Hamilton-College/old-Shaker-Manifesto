'Be ye Holy.' NANCY G. HANFORD. 'Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.' 'The mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top oi the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills.' By a careful study of the ancient prophecies, we learn that the work of God in the latter day, was to be a work of humiliation when every exalted feeling, or imagination of the human heart, shall be brought low, 'and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.' Now that the day has dawned and we are privileged to live in its glorious light, we can more fully understand the meaning of the prophetic language referred to above. Those who have entered the work of humiliation through confession and repentance, by this means are en. abled to ascend 'to the top of Mount Zion ' the hill of God, where all things are 'most holy.' All work is done in the spirit and with the understanding that it is for the Lord and his people, and it must be well done, that it may be an honor to the Christian name. Shs,ms or deceptions in any form are not tolerated. 'Thou slialt not commit adultery,' is a command to be observed in all the relations of life. To mix or adulterate any article for sale, in order to increase the profit, is a violation of the command, and forbidden by the conscience of the upright. Every act, every thought of life must be such as will bear the inspection of' angels. Every wrong or passionate word, defiles the temple of God wherein the spirit dwells, and nothing of this character can abide in the Holy City. Therefore the 'Shakers,' or ' Believers in Christ's Second Appearing' are striving to dwell on the mountain top of God's light and love, by coming into humility's vale and there righting all their wrongs, and then ï¿½ceasing from sin, or, in other words, after washing in the waters of judgment and repentance, to ' go and sin no more.' Not only this, but as no soul can long remain idle, all must labor to clothe themselves with the beautiful graces of the spirit, by deeds of love and kindness to all the needy children of humanity, whether friend or foe. In this way the 'limits round' God's mountain are found to be ' most holy. ' There is no secret lurking place for sin to hide from the light of God in his Anointed witnesses, for there is nothing so hidden but it shall be revealed. Canterbury, N. H.
