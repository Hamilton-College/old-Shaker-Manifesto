Books and Papers Phrenology . The time has come when people do not question the utility of Phrenology, and men in all departments of life are now applying its principles, both in self-culture, and in their dealings with others. The Phrenological Journal of New York is the only periodical devoted to the subject, and it includes with this all that relates to Human Nature, and the improvement of men physically, mentally, and morally. In the prospectus for 1882, the publishers make liberal propositions to subscribers. The price has been reduced to two dollars a year, and to each subscriber is offered a new Phrenological Bust. This Bust is a model head, made nearly life size, of plaster of Paris, and so lettered as to show the exact location of all the Phrenological Organs. It is a handsome ornament, well adapted to the centre-table, mantel-piece, library, or office. With the aid of this, and the illustrated key which accompanies it, together with the articles published in the Phrenological Journal on Practical Phrenology, each person may become quite familiar -with the location of the different Phrenological Organs, and a good judge of Human Nature. The Bust is sent by express, carefully packed, to every subscriber who sends in addition to the subscription price ($2.00), 25 cents extra for the boxing and packing; or, No- 2, a smaller size, will be sent by mail, post-paid, on the same terms, to those who have the Bust, or prefer the new Book Premium, will be sent 'The Phrenological Miscellany,' worth $1.50. Our readers cannot do better than to subscribe at once for the Phrenological Journal ; it will bn found the best possible investment for the money. Those who desire a more explicit description, together with prospectus of the Journal, should send their address on postal card, or accept the publishers' offer, and send 10 cents in stamps for sample copy of the Journal to Fowler &amp; Wells, 755 Broadway, New York. The World's Cyclopedia of History The first volume of this great cyclopedia is announced to be ready in a few days. If it reaches the standard indicated by its prospectus it will be altogether unrivaled in its magnitude, comprehensiveness, and scholarship, and at the same time will be placed easily within the reach even of any industrious laborer. Instead of being made up of brief sketches by unknown authors, as are commonly the historical portions of encyclopedias it will contain, unabridged, the great standard works of such authors as Green, Macaulay, Grote, Carlyle, Gibbon, Guizot, Mommsen, and others. A very comprehensive alphabetical topical index, covering all the works embodied in the cyclopedia, will make ready consultation upon any subject convenient, and will group together such wealth of knowledge and interest as will surprise the ordinary reader and delight the profound student. Specimen pages received at this office show handsome typography, good paper and good press work. Each volume will contain about 1000 large, double-column, octavo pages, and will be sold at the amazingly low prices of $1.25 for the cloth binding, and $1.40 for the same bound in half Russia, sprinkled edges. The amount of matter contained in each volume, and for so low a price, seems almost startling; Volume I containing, unabridged, Green's Larger History of the English People; Carlyle's History of the French lie volution; Schiller's History of The Thirty Years' War; and Creasy's Fifteen Decisive Battles of the world,â€”all for $1.25. No payment is asked in advance by the publishers, but books will be sent to any part of the United States by express, with the privilege of examination before payment is required. It will be wise for those who want to purchase, to write to the publisher immediately, as at these prices, the edition will be limited by the number of orders received before publication.
