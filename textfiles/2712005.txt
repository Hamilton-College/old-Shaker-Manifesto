PANSIES. By Cora C. Vinneo. In summer's radiant days they sweetly grow, And dance like fairies in the balmy air, Or meet us with their happy faces fair. Some, beam like sunlight in its golden glow, Some, white winged come to our dai'k world below Like spotless angels in the guise of prayer. Still others wear the robes of grief and eare Like gentle mourners with their veils drawn low ; When morning gilds the east they wake to greet The newborn messenger with smiles of love; When noontide trembles in the sultry heat With steady eye they look to worlds above ; And when the balmy breath of evening stirs Bow at day's shrine like humble worshipers.
