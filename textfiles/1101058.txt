Agricultural NOTS OF THE HORSE:. Going up hill, whip me not; Going down hill, hurry me not; On level road, spare me not; Loose in stable, forget me not; Of hay and corn rob me not; Of clean water stint me not; Of soft, dry bed deprive me not; Tired and hot, wash me not; If sick or cold, chill me not; With sponge and brush neglect me not; With bits and reins, oh, jerk me not; And when you are angry, strike me not. Measuring corn. A number of rules for measuring corn have been published. As a multiplicity of rules tends to confuse, the question arises, why can we not have one good rule. The reason is obvious. New corn will not measure as many bushels to the foot or inches as old corn, on account of shrinkage. A crib of corn measured in the fall will not yield as many bushels to the cubic foot as when measured in the spring or summer. Corn in wagon, when first put in, will not measure as much to the foot as when hauled several miles. Hence the necessity of working by different rules under different circumstances. All rules are based upon the number of cubic inches in a bushel of shelled corn, which is 2150.4. If all corn shelled out the same, under all circumstances it would be very easy to have one rule As near right as any rule I have tried is twelve cubic feet to the barrel for corn in crib in the fall of the year, eleven and a half feet in spring time and about eleven feet in summer; twelve feet as thrown in wagon in the field and eleven and a quarter hauled four or five miles.
