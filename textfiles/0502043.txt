THE BITER BIT George F. Train thus writes me : Miller's Bath Hotel, 41 W. 26 st., New York, Dec. 29. Dear Elder Evans: Shakerism continues to shake Christianity, and Spiritualism continues to demoralize Christians. After breaking up Gordon, the Hugh Boy at Apollo Hall, medium Wassen at Tammany, after exposing Katie King at Philadelphia, after fighting the Spiritualists at their meetings and through the press for years, Dr. Miller, who went to Chittenden to capture the Eddys, has himself been captured ! The biter has been bit at last; he has gone over, bait, line, hook and sinker 1 His last postal card reads : ' Prepare to meet thy God, for he is up here among the mountains.'
