'ALL IS WELL THAT ENDS WELL.' Watson Andrews. You tell me that I have been sinful, And you tell me, Alas ! too true; But sinning is followed by suff'ring, And suffering by knowledge too ; And knowledge gives rise to conviction, And this to repentance of wrong, And this to a walk in obedience, And this to the Victor's song. And the race is still not to the swiftest, Nor battle alone to the strong; But whoso toils on in obedience, Will triumph, at length, over wrong. At the root of the trees that are evil, The ax being stoutly applied Until the last fiber is severed, The battle will surely decide. The vict'ry thus being secured, The branches will wither away ; The soul be released from its bondage, And forever will end the affray. You may smile at this rattling rhyming, And smile at the author too ; But as he is gaining the vict'ry, Be assured he is smiling with you. North Union, Ohio.
