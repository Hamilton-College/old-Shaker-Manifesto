Shirley, Mass. Jan. 6, 1893. We have filled our ice-house with the best ice we have been able to gather for several years. We have already cut and sawed a large portion of our wood for the winter of 1803 and 94 and part of it housed. We have sold 590 barrels of apples. Other crops full average, giving abundant cause for thankfulness in the way of temporal blessings. We would that all the stumbling-blocks might be removed from the way to a greater increase of spiritual blessing. To this end we give our life, our all. John Whiteley.
