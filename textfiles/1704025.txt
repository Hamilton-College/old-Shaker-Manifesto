PETITIONS. LEOPOLD HOHMAN. Lighten our sorrows and tribulations Heighten the joys of our small creations Quieten unworthier aspirations Brighten the rays of our inspirations Blighten our mean little retaliations. Whiten our souls to purification Tighten resolves of determination Frighten our foes to mystification Highten each wrong to good regulation I tend you love and our adoration. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
