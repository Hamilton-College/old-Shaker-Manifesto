I will send 'Ann Lee'�a book�and if you will remit $1.00 1 will send 'Tests of Divine Inspiration,' in addition to some other matter for the $1.00. About physiology and hygiene, and many other things�Mother Ann Lee and her little company of eight, who came from England with her, did not touch or teach it. Chastity�celibacy� for the married and unmarried, she enjoined, taught, and practiced. Community of goods was also put into practical operation, and has been successfully carried out by seventeen societies�sixty families or communities. Peace principles, putting an end to wars and fightings, private and national, are incorporated into their everyday life by all Shakers, collectively and individually. Labor�industry, and economy, are equal upon all members, including all the officers of the institution. There is no exception. Land, labor, food, lodging ; care of each other in health and in sickBess, are equally enjoyed. These elements and principles constitute the foundations of the first of seven cycles, through which the Gospel will pass, before full redemption from the number of the beast�G66�is attained. There are so many forms of evil humanity are now suffering under. Would it have been wise to attack them all at once? 'No man can see God and live.' A full view of ourselves, as God sees us, would annihilate us. The children of Israel could not bear the sight of Moses, after he had been with the God of Israel for forty days. The voice of that God so frightened them, that they fled away in great haste. And if they could not stand before Moses and the God of the Jews, how could they stand before the Father and Mother of all souls in all worlds? We are just now laying the foundations of the Second Cycle of our Order. The trumpet�testimony�sounds longer and louder, warning the people to pull up the stakes and pitch their tents, to be ready to move from the old campingground to a new and more appropriate location�spiritually. The new fouudation stones will be laid upon those already laid in the first cycle. 1. There will be a limitation of the land to the needs of the people. In other words, the people will own and hold no more land than they can cultivate without hiring outside worldlings. 2. They will cease the use of all animal food, gained by killing. 'Thou shalt not kill' is a command. 3. Intoxicating drinks, with tobacco, opium, narcotics, will be entirely dispensed with. 4. All poisonous medicines and drugs will be let alone. Food will be the medicine used, in all cases of physical derangement. 5. Proper diet, with pure air, day and night, good drainage to the dwelling-house, that should be so constructed as to breathe naturally, like a great mammoth. Bed-rooms, where thorough cleansing of bed and bedding can be effected each day. And pure water, free from foreign matter. These will be amongst the good things of the coming cycle. And the gift of healing for all such as will go and sin no more, will be ever present in any time of trouble. About the book, I shall probably obtain it; but do not expect that its theory equals our practice. I have no reason to believe that there is so perfect a state of sanitation anywhere in America as exists at the North Family in Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y. Respecting Swedeuborg, we can probably give you valuable information at a proper time.; but enough for the present. Solomon says, 'If thou hast found honey, eat that which is sufficient for thee. Why shouldst thou destroy thyself?' Respectfully, F. W. Evans.
