Letters from a Gospel Father to His Gospel Daughters Enfield, N. H., March, 1877. Beloved Sister B. : Your kind favor of the 14th, containing a graphic report of your journey and mission to W., is received, for which receive my thanks. Such tokens of sisterly remembrance are always appreciated; they bear to me more than a narrative of events or the common parlance of a letter; a spirit, an influence accompanies them, which speaks to the soul and tells of home and home relations, than which no intelligence so affects the mind nor operate; so deeply. It penetrates the soul. No Subject gives ideas more inspirational--sensations more pathetic and emotional. - .Home and home friends, the pure, Christian bro~th'fcÂ¥hood and sisterhood, where confidence reposes, ,where our great interests center, where love We there find a power stronger than all other powers combined ; an affection unfathomable, knowing no limits. Here are the ministrations of the highest, here is heaven, here are our saviors. Hence, how great our obligations to beautify, to strengthen, and make everything about us peaceful, glorious, and perfect! How necessary to bring all things into harmony, ever to maintain order, heaven's first gift; never trespass upon the law of love ! Under no circumstances should we depart from principle; always true, always kind and obliging, ever ready to alleviate distress, comfort the afflicted, strengthen the weak, and forgive the erring and penitent; always open to conviction, and equally free to impart knowledge to the ignorant, and aid those who are in need of assistance. Thus, beloved sister, our path becomes that of wisdom, always pleasant, and the duties of life never unendurable tasks; thus, the yoke of Christ is easy, and his burden light. Accept my sincere love and that of my companions. Please bear this to all our dear friends in Shaker Village. Your brother, Abraham Perkins
