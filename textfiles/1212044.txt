House-hold USE 0F BORAX FOR WASHING. The washer-women of Holland and Belgium, so proverbially clean, and who get up their linen so beautifully white, use refined borax as washing-powder, instead of soda, in the proportion of one large handful of borax-powder to about ten gallons of boiling water. They save in soap nearly half. All of the large washing-establishments adopt the same plan. For laces, cambrics, and lawns an extra quantity of powder is used, and for crinolines requiring to be made stiff, a strong solution is necessary. Borax being a neutral salt, does not in the slightest degree injure the texture of the linen. Its effect is to soften the hardest water.
