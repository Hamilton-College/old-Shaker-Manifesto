To Make Currant Jelly. When making currant jelly, select freshlygathered currants which are not over-ripe; mash and squeeze them through a jelly bag. Put the juice into a porcelain-lined kettle and stand over a brisk fire; let boil for twenty minutes; add a pound of sugar for every pint of juice, and stir until it dissolves. Skim; bring to a boil; take from the fire; put in glasses anil stand aside to jelly. A little of the liquid can be tried in a glass before taking up, and if it does not jelly it may be boiled a few minutes longer. A clear, lighter-colored jelly can be made by using white and red currants. To make English currant jelly, take ripe currants; do not pick from the stems; weigh, and allow half a pound of sugar to every pound of currants. Put the fruit into a preserve kettle; mash and stir over the fire for twenty-five minutes. Take up; strain through a flannel bag. Wash the kettle, put the juice in it, let come to a boil and add the sugar; stir until dissolved; take from the fire; pour in glasses; let cool and cover. June Ladies' Home Journal.
