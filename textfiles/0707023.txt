Dear Editor: The last Shaker is received with much joy. All seem to be interested with it, and I do not know why they should not. It is a beautiful paper, and must accomplish much good in the world. The only unfortunate thing concerning it is, that we print so few to circulate. H. C. B. Canterbury, N. H.
