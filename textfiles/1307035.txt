FRUIT STAINS. In the season of fruits, the napkins used at the table, and often the handkerchiefs and other articles, will become stained. Those who have access to a good drug store can procure a bottle of Javelle water. If the stains are wet with this before the articles are put into the wash, they will be completely removed. Those who cannot get Javelle water can make a solution of chloride of lime.

The clear liquid will remove the stains as readily as Javelle water, but, in using this 164 THE MANIFESTO. one precaution must be observed. Be careful to thoroughly rinse the article to which this solution has been applied, in clear water, before bringing it in contact with soap. When Javelle water is used, this precaution is not necessary: but with the chloride of lime liquid it is, or the articles will be harsh and stiff.
