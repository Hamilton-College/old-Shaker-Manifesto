West Pittsfleld. May, 1893. Deak Editor:�So much to interest, instruct, and fill our minds with high and holy thoughts do we find on the pages of each issue of your excellent publication, that we can not fail to realize our obligation to respond occasionally to the call for Home Notes. May came to us in a tearful mood and continued to weep almost incessantly the first week of her sojourn here, but now she is radiant with smiles and appears in her true colors. Vegetation is full of life, and the earth is donning her robe of emerald green. Our live stock consisting of one hundred and fifty head of cattle and fifteen horses, have nearly consumed our large supply of hay�there will be only about twenty tons remaining. In some former seasons there have been seventyfive or a hundred tons to carry over. Water-pipes, that Rip Van Winkle like, went to sleep last Decenber, have awakened, and so far as ascertained are mostly in sound condition. Considering the backwardness of the season,'farm work is progressing finely. Fire wood is mostly prepared for another year, lumber sawed and put in condition for seasoning. Some repairs are being made; at the office the walls and woodwork of each hall have been given a new coat of paint, which brightens and improves their appearance wonderfully. The brick dwelling is being renovated by the aid of paint and varnish. The kitchen and all rooms in the basement, with some others, are being thus renewed. The floor has been relaid in the large dining room, making it seem more cosy and pleasant when the family meet there, which is one thousand and ninety-five times a year. Notwithstanding all this pressure of home cares and responsibilities, Br. Ira is also conducting repairs at the grist mill. New steel beams are being put in the basement to support the weighty machinery, in place of the large timbers which have done service there the past twenty-nine years, and had begun to decay. A new brick blacksmith's shop is to bo erected over there the present season, on the corner where the old wooden shop now stands, and is to be 30x50 feet and roofed with slate. School opened for the summer term on the 24th ult. with a lower number of pupils than usual. Julia L. Street.
