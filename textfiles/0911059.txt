Get all your ingredients ready before beginning to mix your dough, sugar, soda, milk, lard, salt flour and apples. Now make a dough as for soda biscuits, only adding a little more lard to make it shorter. Take a bit of dough out on the kneading board, and after kneading, roll this as for pie crust. Then cut in pieces long enough to cover an apple, allowing for lapping the edges. Put in two of your apple halves, sweeten according to taste, and cover apple and sugar with dough. Lay your dumplings in your bread-pan, the smooth side up, first having your pan well buttered. Proceed in this manner until you get your pan well filled (be sure it is a large-sized pan, for they will go off like hot cakes) then place a small bit of butter on the top of each dumpling, sprinkle a handful of sugar over all ; then place in a moderate oven and allow them to bake one hour. Serve (not^too hot) with pudding sauce or with cream and sugar. Dumplings made in this way are really delicious. Remedy for Warts Warts are very troublesome and disfiguring.

It may be removed in the day and put on every night in one fortnight the wart will die and peel off. The same prescription will cure corn. Turnipetts The true way to cook a beet is to bake, not boil it. Thus treated and sliced either in vinegar or in butter, it is much sweeter than when boiled, and said to be more nutritious. I saved the vinegar in which my beets were pickled for dinner, and the next day boiled a few small, young turnips, and sliced them up in the same vinegar. I added a little fresh vinegar, pepper and salt, and no one at the table knew that they were not eating white beets, until I called their attention to the fact.
