Turnipetts The true way to cook a beet is to bake, not boil it. Thus treated and sliced either in vinegar or in butter, it is much sweeter than when boiled, and said to be more nutritious. I saved the vinegar in which my beets were pickled for dinner, and the next day boiled a few small, young turnips, and sliced them up in the same vinegar. I added a little fresh vinegar, pepper and salt, and no one at the table knew that they were not eating white beets, until I called their attention to the fact.
