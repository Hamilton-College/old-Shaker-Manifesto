There are times when it may be quite justifiable to... There are times when it may be quite justifiable to speak of awful calamities ; of the fires and floods that so frightfully devastate the earth. As appalling as the recital of these conditions may be, we are led to think of the thousands upon thousands of men, women and children, who in one moment became as helpless as infants and were overwhelmed in a watery grave or gave up their lives in the devouring flames. The breaking away of the reservoir at Johnstown, Pa., has produced a scene that no language may be able to describe, nor pen fully to illustrate. That fearful exhibition of a wall of water more than thirty feet in height, whose voice was like that of rolling thunder, which went dashing along in demoniac fury, crushing every building in its path, with the swiftness and ease that one would crush the shell of an egg, can never fade from sight. Within the space of one hour that great body of water, four miles long, one mile wide and held by an embankment of one hundred feet in height, had spent its fury and thousands of souls were hurled into eternity before any voice of warning could reach them. How forcibly this should impress upon the mind, 'The uncertainty of life, and the certainty of death,' and of the feebleness of man to even contend against the natural elements. That busy throng of men, women and children, absorbed in the duties and industries of this life, and in one moment blotted out of existence forever. Has this sad catastrophe any lesson for us ? Shall we look upon it as accidental, and from uncontrollable causes? There are Christians, no doubt, who will believe it was fore-ordained to take place on that day and in that very hour, and also for that great army of souls to be hurled into eternity without thought! Was it. not the result of the breaking of some law, over which the sufferers had no direct control? Jesus very wisely and instructively brings forward an incident that occurred in the eastern country, in the falling of a tower, which unfortunately killed some eighteen persons; and draws from it a very marked lesson. 'Suppose you that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered these things ? I rr^sn-TMLSi. tell you, nay : but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.' This same remark may have a direct application to those who were dwelling in that ill-fated valley on the thirty-first of May. Do we wonder why they did not take warning, when more than once, it was clearly spoken to them ? The only answer that can be given to this, must be the one made by the prophet. 'The people were destroyed for lack of knowledge.' Had they only listened with care, and fled from the place, with the haste that Lot fled from Sodom, like Mm they might have escaped a frightful calamity. Already it is being said, 'it was wrong and almost criminal to keep such an immense body of water, three hundred feet above a populous valley, for no other purpose than to afford occasional sport and recreation for *&gt;, few rich and favored individuals.' In this case, the law, God's unchangeable law was open before the rich and the poor. They knew their danger but trifled with the warning, and permitted for the pleasure of a few rich Christians, more than eight thousand souls to be most signally and overwhelmingly blotted out of existence. The laws which God has designed shall rule the universe are, without doubt, as safe and reliable as is the Creator of those laws, and the rain cannot avoid falling to the earth, nor the dew from rising among the clouds, any more than the sun can avoid shining. While we stand appalled at the horrors which are measured out so fearfully upon an unsuspecting people, because some one or ones, in their avarice or ignorance neglected to regard an imperative law, should we not study with deepest interest the laws of God which so vitally effect us as a people, or as individuals ? Our certainty of his law can claim no excuse. For every transgression a corresponding penalty is sure to follow. Neither prayers, nor alms-giving, nor sacrifices can prevent the effects of wrong doing. Religion is not ignorance, nor asceticism nor the life of a devotee to a churchal creed. God's laws are open before us every hour of our existence, and take cognizance of our every act. Christians without a knowledge of these higher laws which should rule them in the lesser things of life as well as in the greater,ï¿½in eating, in drinking, as well as in all that pertains to the health of the body or to the life of the soul, are so far from or without God. If the wholesome advice which St. Paul so thoughtfully gave could be conscientiously acted upon, it would herald a wonderful reformation in the world, and the millennial age would be at the threshold of our door. 'Whatsoever, therefore, ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do it to the glory of God.' How much is being done every day that is far from being a glory to man, and indeed, much less a glory to God. Under this influence the earth would become a paradise, while every one would be interested in the happiness and prosperity of his neighbor, equally with that of his own.
