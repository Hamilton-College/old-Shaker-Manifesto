THE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION ILLUSTRATED, THE WORLD'S COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION ILLUSTRATED, . For September. As the date for the dedication of the Exposition draws nearer, this popular magazine grows in worth and beauty. This is the last of the monthly issues. Until the opening of the Exposition it will appear twice a month, and during the Exposition, weekly. This number contains full-page portraits of two prominent Exposition officials, namely: Hon. James W. Haines, national commissioner from Nevada, who was prominently connected with the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and Hon. Thomas Smith, national commissioner from New Jersey and member of the Board of Control. These are direct reproductions of photographs on copper plate, and the work is done with marvelous skill. A very prominent feature is the appearance of several state buildings and portraits of the prominent state board members of Nebraska, Iowa and Ohio. There is an autograph letter from the Pope pertaining to the National Catholic Educational Exhibit, and a beautiful engraving of the statue of Patriotism which will adorn the Administration building. The leading article is entitled, 'The Bible, the Sabbath, the Exposition and the Constitution of the United States.' It is an investigation of the question 'Is the Bible authority for closing the World's Columbian Exposition 'on the first day of the week, commonly called Sunday'? ' A negative reply is given very pointedly yet exhaustively. The article is bound to create discussion, but the arguments are conclusive. Price 25 cents. Publishers announce their 'Special Great Offer' including all copies from July to January, ten in number, for only 1.50. This offer will be withdrawn within a short time. They also will present each subscriber for the entire issue at $12, one of the souvenir coins appropriated by Congress for the Exposition. Address, J. B.
