Sabbathday Lake, Me. Mar. 1892. We almost know that winter is over. At the present writing we have but very little snow on the ground.' The lumbermen are having a hard time striving to get their logs out of the forests and with all they can do a greater part of them will have to remain in the woods until another winter. The time is drawing near when we shall have bright, warm days and enjoy the cultivation of our beautiful flowers, some of which we are already starting under glass for early blossoming. Sisters are busy on their sale work and whenever a stormy day presents itself the services of the Brethren are enlisted sawing out boards for boxes &amp;c. We were very much interested reading in the last Manifesto of that good meeting at Enfield, N. H. Our meetings are also profitable and we should be glad if the testimonies which are borne with such earnestness by our Brethren and Sisters could be heard by thousands and be to them the same blessing that they are to the small number who are thus privileged.
