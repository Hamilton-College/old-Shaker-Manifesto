North Family Dec. 1892. Esteemed Editor:â€”No doubt other pens have chronicled the death of our worthy Sister, Hannah Taylor, who passed to spirit life, Dec. 3rd. As her life was ebbing away, she asked those in attendance if the Dec. number of the Manifesto had come, and added, that one of the hardest things for her to leave in exchanging worlds, was the Manifesto, stating she had not failed of reading every issue of the paper since its first publication. A grand tribute of appreciation; denoting a strong love for our herald of truth. As one after another the aged throughout Zion enter the realms of immortality, reflective minds can but experience a thrill of sadness, as less of this class means less moral and intellectual strength, yet the rich legacy which the translated ones leave, a treasure of Christ-like examples, are potent factors to stimulate and encourage us to work the works of righteousness, thus fulfilling our God given mission; a life service fraught with due reverence to our fellow-beings, and activity of those qualities which cheer, bless, and forgive as we would be forgiven. From the lives of our departed, loved ones we learn the lesson that works, not personal theories, are the polishing forces of life. In that domain where we shall be known as we are, true worth is recognized at its full value, and spiritual affinity seeks its class. Here our noble, tried kindred are going, and imitating their worthy examples, we are joining this band of spiritualized characters. May the New Year unfold to us all re- newed blesings, and record to our lives greater victories over the selfishness of the human heart. We express our thanks to the Editor, and all who aid in publishing our Manifesto. G. H. B.
