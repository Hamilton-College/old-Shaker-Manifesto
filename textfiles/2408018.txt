West Pittsfield. July, 1894. The little band at Hancock send a kindly greeting to their good Editor, and to the Brothers and Sisters in each Society. We hope there is no illness, and an abundance of happiness in the several homes. What is more inspiriting than cheerfulness? How much a bright 'Good morning!' warms the heart of the recipient, and incites him to make a happy response in like manner. The terrible 'Western Railroad Strike' serves to awaken gratitude for our quiet haven. The proprietors of Meat Markets in the adjacent city of Pittsfield complain bitterly, but Br. Ira thinks we need not, as it has been the means of effecting a very advantageous sale of his beeves. On the 30th ult. we received a short, though pleasant call from Elder George Wilcox, and Eldress Sophia Copley, of Shaker Station, Ct.

The usual lively occupants of the potato field were somewhat late in taking possession, but have since made good all lost time. The pride of all is a large and flourishing field of oats, which does indeed present a fine appearance. The fence dividing the door-yard from the public road, looks much improved since being freshly painted. Our school children are looking forward Tl IE MANIFES TO. 191 to the summer vacation, after the 13th. inst. On June 14th, our teacher and the writer, visited (by invitation) one of the Pittsfield schools. It has an attendance of one hundred and fifty pupils. In the afternoon they commemorated 'Flag Day' with appropriate exercises, which could hardly fail to fill the mind of 'Young America' with loyal and patriotic impulses. The burden of the remarks in our last Sunday service 'was the need of an awakening, and a baptism of fire that will search every heart, and bind us in consecration to Zion's interest. Emoretta Belden.
