New York, July 19,1873 Dear Evans : â€” I have been asked to procure a copy of ' Ann Lee,' which please send me. The perusal of your books has proved profitable. It is, indeed, gratifying to me to find in the ' Shaker and Shakeress ' interpretation of Scripture, the key to many passages between which and myself there has long existed the relationship of novice on the one hand, and enigma on the other. Nor has this been attended with little surprise either; surprise that a mode of interpretation so simple and easy should have been overlooked or ignored, and so much ' pain of travail ' taken by commentators to bring forth that which, except it should serve sectarian ends, or to gratify mere personal vanity of research, can be of little use to any one. Truly, there are men who, by a system of wordiness, would explain both the meaning and the authority of the Scriptures entirely away! Should there be a surplus of funds you may continue my feast of tlie ' Shaker and Shakeress,' by proportionally lengthening my subscription. Believe me, dear sir, Very truly, C. H. D.
