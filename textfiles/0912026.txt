It is they who glorify Him who shall enjoy Him... It is they wlio glorify Him wlio shall enjoy Him ; tliey who deny themselves who shall not be denied; they who labor on earth who shall rest in heaven ; they who bear the cross shall wear the crown; they who seek to bless others who shall be blessed. â€” Dr. Guthrie
