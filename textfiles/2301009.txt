GENTLY J. Frank Arehart Gently speak in accents tender Of those friends ye loved of yore, Though perchance they may not render All the joys they gave before. There are few whose lives are blameless Who have nothing to regret; Then let others faults be nameless Or forgive them and forget. 'Tis no trifle that we cherish, When we find and prove a friend; One whose homage will not perish, Growing stronger to the end. But should dark clouds over shade thee And old friends grow cold, yet Think how happy once they made thee, Then forgive, but ne'er forget. Selected
