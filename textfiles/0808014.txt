EDITORIAL NOTES GEN. SHERMAN VS. JESUS In a recent speech, Gen. Sherman, testified that his profession as a soldier, was in the interest of peace ! We protest. A much more honorable personage than Gen. Sherman—Jesus Christ— made even louder and stronger protests than, we now do. His testimony made it right for Jews, heathens and brutal barbarians to fight; but not for Christians'; 'else would my servants fight.' 'IS CHRISTIANITY A FAILURE ?' That which is called Christianity by the popular churches never has been a success in the line of dispensing salvation ; and is full as much of a failure today as ever. The introduction of genuine Christianity was 'to save people from sinning;' the immense failure of salvation to the people, finds its cause in that the people demand to be saved in their sins,—an utter impossibility, even for God to enact. We ask those who want salvation from sin, to study and copy the life of Jesus, which will prove a veritable 'power of God unto salvation.'
