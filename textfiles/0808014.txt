'IS CHRISTIANITY A FAILURE ?' That which is called Christianity by the popular churches never has been a success in the line of dispensing salvation ; and is full as much of a failure today as ever. The introduction of genuine Christianity was 'to save people from sinning;' the immense failure of salvation to the people, finds its cause in that the people demand to be saved in their sins,â€”an utter impossibility, even for God to enact. We ask those who want salvation from sin, to study and copy the life of Jesus, which will prove a veritable 'power of God unto salvation.'
