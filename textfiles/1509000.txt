Considerations Concerning a Theory of Recent Origin, that Man is not a Fallen Being. GILES B. AVERY. Preliminary Observations. In order properly to treat this subject, it is first necessary to have an understanding of our terms. If, by the term 'fall' is meant ' Original Sin' that is, hereditary taint�meaning, sinful by ancestral violations of God's laws, we wish to be understood as not treating the subject in that relation. Thus considered, the question involves a very different analysis than if it be considered iii the sense of one's personal violation of known laws of God. In this article we propose to consider the subject in the latter phase. And, 1st. What constitutes rectitude? Aas. Obedience to all the laws of righteousness instituted by our Creator ! 2nd. What is a fall? Ans. A violation of known laws of righteousness ! Measured by this rule, is not man a fallen being? The Argument. If man hath never fallen, then he hath no sin, for sin premises a departure from rectitude�uprightness-; that is, a violation of known laws of God. 2nd. If there is no sin in the world, then there is no spiritual death ! Is humanities' conditions all spiritual life and light? 3rd. If there is no sin in the world, there can be no sorrow ; for sin is the cause of all sorrow known to man ! Sorrow, is sufferings, for the violations of Law ! Ts there no sorrow among mankind? 4th. Spiritual death is the consequenee of sin. Is there no spiritual death in the world? If not, then there is no resurrection from the dead, as taught by Christ! The English word 'resurrection' is from the Greek word, 'Anastasis' which means, 'to stand up again.' How that can stand up again that never hath fallen down from an upright, or standing position is a question for cavilers to answer ! If there is no fall, consequently no resurrection from the dead, then Christ is not risen, and he said untruly, 'I am the resurrection, and the life.' 5th. If there is no spiritual darkness, the fruit of sin, among men, then Jesus' testimony 'This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.' John, iii., 19, was falsehood, and nonsense ; for condemnation is alone the fruit of sin. 6th. If there is no sin and sorrow among men then all our senses belie us. 7th. If man hath not sinned, then he is not lost, and needs r:o salvation ; and Jesus Christ, as a Savior, hath vainly been sent upon earth, for, there is nothing lost to save, and Jesus uttered a falsehood in saying, 'I came to seek and save that which is lost.' The language should have been, I came to seek and save that which never hath been found, or developed. 8th. If man is not fallen, then the present work of generation among mankind is perfect, or, the scriptures belie the character of Noah. Is it the general character of mankind that they are perfect in their generations? Nay, verily, the corruption of generation is the crying sin of our whole race, in al nations ot the earth. Pth. It is impossible for man to sin without falling from his uprightness, and, if man hath not sinned, and fallen, then the whole law and the prophets, is a humbug, and of mere human institution, for, they all recognize sin in the human family, and gross sin too. And, let any one read 'Newton' on The Fulfillment of the Prophecies' and he must be convinced the Prophets were inspired from on High. 10th. If man hath not fallen then the whole Gospel plan for man's redemption from a fallen state is a farce, and God has made a great mistake of man's needs. 11th. If the testimony of Moses and the Prophets is a myth, the Gospel of Christ is a myth also, for, it is the fulfillment of the Law, and the prophecies of the Prophets. 12th. If man hath not fallen, all the testimony of Jesus concerning tares in the Gospel field is false, and the whole crop is good wheat, only not fully grown ! What does universal experience say to this? 13th. To deny the fall of man, is to deny the whole revelation of God to man, manifested in both the Old and New Testament Scriptures ! 14th. If man hath not sinned, andfallen, there is no regeneration necessary, because there is no degeneration from which to be regenerated, since, according to this theory, man hath nothing lost. 15th. If man hath not sinned andfallen, then the peaceable state of the Kingdom of Christ, anticipated by the prophet, when the lion and the lamb should lie down together, is now reigning on the earth, or, God created man in a state not good ; that is, not in harmony with creation at large! But, does universal peace now reign? lfith. If man hath not sinned and fallen, then the Brute is not fallen, and man is his lord, and the whole brute creation is his willing subject. Is it so? 17th. The Gospel testimony is, that, when man had fallen, and rebelled against God, the brute fell, and rebelled against man ! Do we not witness this rebellion? 18th. If man hath not fallen, then the testimony ot Jesus concerning taking the Kingdom of Heaven by force, is a falsehood ; because Heaven is man's pristine home ! Or, God created him in misery ; thus, there would be no need of a warfare to take it! 19th. If man hath not fallen, then, either the harvest of the world inaugurated by Jesus Christ is prematurely commenced and God had no cause to send His Son to inaugurate that dispensation, or, being inaugurated and souls, by the voice of God being called to come into it through God's Vice-gerents on earth, all souls would immediately obey the command of God, as the next step in their normal and legitimate development ; This they do not do ! 20th. If man hath not fallen, then, as do the waters form the sea, so doth the knowledge of God cover the earth ; for, it would be cruel in God to create an intelligent and accountable being, make that being punishable for not obeying His will, but not reveal to him that will until myriads of ages after his creation. But, does the knowledge of God cover the earth? Nay, man is in darkness, loss, sin, sorrow, and woe, and very much needs salvation and redemption ! To deny it, is to deny all the revelations from God to man, of which we have any manifestation. It is to make Noah, Moses, all the Jewish Prophets and historians ; John the Baptist, Jesus, and all the Apostles of the New Testament Scriptures, liars, and blasphemers ; It is also to deny all present experience ; for, there is not a living man of intelligonce, but recognizes, that in some degree, either great or small, both himself and his fellow have transgressed some known law of right, for which a degree of condemnation hath rested, or is resting upon the soul, until confessed and repented of.
