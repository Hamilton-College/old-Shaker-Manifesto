Shakers, N. Y. June, 1892. Since writing our Home Notes for June, we have had thoughts about Noah's Ark, but fortunately May had only thirty-one days. We concluded our elevation would save us from the necessity of building the second ark, but we have had rain, rain, rain. Crops are backward and we shall have to trust Providence and better weather for the result of the harvest. We had a pleasant visit from gospel kindred on the 29th. ult. from the 'Happy land of Canaan;' Sister Miriam Offord, with four young Sisters, and while at Watervliet, established head quarters at our Family. Although the reaper Death visited us twice during their short stay, we believe that they with us enjoyed a pleasant season of love and exchange of good feelings. We would say to all concerned that they honored their name and profession. Eldress Alvira Conklin of our Family started to-day on a mission of love to the little Society of Believers in the city of brotherly love; with her goes our love and prayers for the welfare of the little band who are gathered there, striving to grow and increase in the knowledge of the Lord, also for the whole household of faith. Elder Josiah Barker of the Church Family and Sisters, Anna Case and Isabella Graves of the South Family have started on a visit to the eastern Societies of Believers. Through the medium of the Manifesto, we send love to them, and we hope they may impart and also receive much good to bring home. Through the same medium, we send love and kindly greetings to all Believers east and west, and a double store to our afflicted parents Elder Daniel and Eldress Ann. May Zion have a spiritual baptism equal to the water baptism of the past month is our sincere desire and prayer. *
