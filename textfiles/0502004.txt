A NEW STANDPOINT Among the emigrants from this world to the next — of such as have figured largely in the affairs of men — I fail to find the first individual, who, if a mere wish would obtain it, would not have a sponge drawn over his past record. Underlying his patriotism, he finds, on retrospection, a large substratum of Ego, hiding, for the time being, from Ms own eyes only, the absurdity of his 'fantastic tricks before high heaven,' the absurdity of inferring, from his accidental, temporary elevation, that he was born to command ad infinitum. He now sees that some, who were unknown to fame, are largely his superiors. He sees there is a Power that over-rules in the affairs of man. He sees that, from the material lying around loose, such instruments are selected as will best subserve the present purpose. When that purpose is accomplished, or the tool becomes dull, that tool is dropped and another is picked up. In the instrumentalities selected, no new springs to action are created. The springs already there are put in motion. The reward is measured, not so much by the end accomplished, as by the motive of the instrument. O. P.
