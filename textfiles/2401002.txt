TRUTH ABOVE PERSONALITY By Daniel Offord MERE assertion never made truth, nor changed a principle. Man may discover a principle but he never can create one. The simple fact of Jesus, or Ann Lee, or any other human being asserting a truth has nothing to do with creating it. The truth existed before it was proclaimed or recorded in the Bible or any other book. The laws that control existence in this world and the transit to another sphere are impartial upon all. If there is another law by which human beings can be translated other trian the ordinary process it must be proved by actual demonstration. We can do nothing against the truth. When the truth is manifested clearly to our understanding we love it so well that we readily and heartily yield obedience thereto. Example teaches louder than precept, is a true saying and the discipline necessary to protect young people and keep them out of the lusts of the flesh is no cross or self-denial to those who have gained the victory. All such partake of the fruit of self-denial and know the joy of the cross. We enjoy the surveillance of the spirit of truth and purity, not because we are in the flesh but because we are crucifying the flesh, with its affections and lusts. Therefore, we glory in the cross, and love the laws that are as a wall of protection around all whose lives are 'hid with Christ in God.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
