MOTIVES It is the motive that, more than anything else, renders an action' good or bad. However fair the look of an action may be, if the right motive be wanting, the action is hollow ; if the motive be a bad one, the action is rotten at the core. Who cares for an outward seeming, or show of friendship or affection, unless the heart be also on the same' term%? Who does not prize a rough outside, when it covers an honest inside, more than the most fawning fondness from a heart that is cold and false? Thus it is right to insist on the principles for their own sake, because the principles give their value to the actions, not the actions to the principles, for they are but dross. The principles are the gold on which is to be placed the stamp, and if the gold is not good, the stamp, though it often deceives the people, gives it no real worth.
