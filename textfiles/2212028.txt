The last month of autumn was hardly ushered in before we were visited by a slight snow-storm which fell on the morning of the 2nd. inst. This was followed on the 5th. inst. by a storm of snow and wind, giving one the impression that it was the first of December, rather than the first of November that was upon us; the windows of the dwellings having quite the appearance of a winter morning. We finished the cutting of apples the 3rd. of present month leaving us once more free to hold our regular evening meetings for religious, social, and mental improvement. We think the social, no less than the religious life of a people should be well known to prevent misconception in the mind of any person. For this reason we value the department of 'Home Notes' in our little monthly, keeping us informed, as it does, of the events occurring in our many homes. The wise saying of Mother Ann, 'Do all your work as though you had a thousand years to live and as though you knew you were to die to-morrow,' is an excellent guide in every undertaking and one which all may safely follow. On the 12th. inst. Elder Henry C Blinn, Elder Nicholas A. Briggs, Eldress Joanna J. Kaime and Eldress Eliza A. Stratton left this place for Mount Lebanon to attend the funeral of our beloved father, Elder Daniel Boler. They returned the 17th. inst. and reported the largest gathering of Believers ever assembled at Mount Lebanon.
