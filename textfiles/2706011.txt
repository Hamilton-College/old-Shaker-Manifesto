Narcoossee, Fla. May, 1897. Beloved Editor;ï¿½We have just received a beautiful letter from Elder Abraham Perkins requesting a few items from us, as to our present standing. It is now over two years since the first two pioneer Brethren came to this place, and just two years since the Sisters came. Looking back over that time and comparing notes with the present we must say we have been greatly prospered and blest be yond expectation. We have about eight acres of land cleared and in good order for cultivation, two and one half acres to sweet potatoes, two acres to Irish potatoes and the remainder to orchard and garden and one fourth of an acre to pine apples of which we shall receive about seven hundred apples from our first planting. To our main building which is 20x30 feet two lofts and attic high has been added another small building 15x10 two lofts high. As to farming we have done but very little in the original line tho we are now keeping one hundred eighty head of cattle hoping to receive enough to compensate for expense and be able to do more farming. -We are now growing one third of an acre of Cassava root which is destined to be in the future the main crop for feeding stock. The only stock which needs feeding are the horses and milch cows. The main herd roam at large on the ranch and is driven up at night for cow penning. At 9:30 a. m. we have a general meeting every Sunday. Our friends from Order No. 2 are regular attendants this gives us a chance to compare faith with them. They are an open hearted, true and loving people, holding strongly to the principle that all difficulties will finally be settled by the spirit of love. We are resting in hope. If God has intended the building of a city here to his name and honor, we that labor will not labor in vain. Andrew Barrett.
