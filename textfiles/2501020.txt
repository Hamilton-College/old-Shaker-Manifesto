Alfred, Me. Dec. 1894. My vessel is tilled with love, My heart with affection o'eiflows, With mercy that comes from above Anr\ blessing the Gospel bestows. O Charity, best of all gifts, Never failing in casting out fear. Good friends, in the Spirit, I wish you A cheerful and happy Xew Year. As the New Year dawns upon us, what are our plans and promises? Have we resolved to be more fully consecrated and wholly devoted to the service of God? If so, let us hold steadfast to the good resolve all through the year. If we love God, we shall love our fellow creatures, and charity will abound in our hearts. I feel there is no better way to show our gratitude to God for the many blessings and mercies bestowed upon us in the past year, than by living just such lives as He would have us to live during the year that has just begun. To this end may we all strive. Winter seems to have set in, in good earnest. Our teams for a week past have been hauling cord wood. The abundant apple crop brings extra labor with it, as they have to be handled over several times. Those that would not do to sell or keep, we have made into preserves'. We have 2(30 two-quart jars filled with apple, which will be ready for use another year, should the apple crop be small. To gospel kindred far and near, we give our love and blessing as a New Year's gift. Fannie Casey
