THY BEST. Agnes E. Newton. The best thy heart can offer God Is all that He requires, The perfect living sacrifice â€¢ The off'ring He desires. Se&gt;rve God, in life's bright sunlit hours Ere evil days draw nigh; . . Bilek first the Kingdom of our Lord, The priceless jewel buy. Go sow with care the waiting field' Though other hands may reap, And as their labor may present . Thy sheaves of ripened wheat. Go in the Master's Vineyard now; The idle are unblest; Where duty mills, there nobly toil And give to God thy best. Though far removed from mortal view Reward the Father gives; How sweet the inward peace of one Who in His service lives. Then give thy best, an off'ring free, And thy reward is sure; The treasure earned-It crown of life Which ever will endure. Canterbury, N. H.
