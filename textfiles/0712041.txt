SPEAK THE TRUTH EDITH I trust that many of us have proved from experience the truth of the maxim, ' Honesty is the best policy;' and have also learned that it is the safest principle upon which to found an honorable character for life. My little friends, are we not aware that one of the greatest causes for so much sorrow and failure in this w-orld, is dishonesty? Perhaps the first error in a person's life, was the false, statement of some simple anecdote in childhood, which carelessly passed over without correction, led to greater untruths; and so by one step and another, he became habitually deceitful and dishonest. Little children, will you take this friendly warning â€”Never lie down to rest at night with the slightest misstatement unconfessed. If you have been careless, repent before it is too late; begin now to be honest. If we continue to live dishonestly we shall lose the blessing of God, the confidence of our friends, forget to pray, and finally drift away from the good and pure. Let us be wise, shun the first temptation, and thus save ourselves years of sorrow and regret. Canterbury, N. H.
