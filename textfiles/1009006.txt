Great many mistake religious sentiment... A great many mistake religious sentiment for a religious life. Because they are touched by religious truth, they fancy they are religions. Because they are susceptible to religion they think they have it. An impression is to them the same as if they obeyed it ; to appreciate right is the same as though they did the right. Weeping over a book of martyrs, they almost think it as heroic as though they died at the stake themselves. They come to take what God has planted in them as a substitute for a practical Christian life. N. J. Messenger
