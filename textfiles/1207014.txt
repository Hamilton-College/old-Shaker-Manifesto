NOT WHERE TO LAY HIS HEAD MARY WHITCHER Who understands the meaning Of what the Savior said? Left without friends, and seeming 'Not where to lay his head.' Was this the earth condition? Or did his soul repine Eor some new-born relation, Akin to the Divine? We trust he had a father And mother, as we have; Was near to sister, brother, Who held him in their love. But here we see the lesson,-â€” We must be 'born again,' To find a new relation To God, through Christ the Lamb. Old things of earth's begetting Must die and pass away ; While in the New Creation New light illumes the day. And here with Christ the Savior We ask; who are our kin? 'Tis those who love the Father, And give their life to Him. Canterbury, N. H.
