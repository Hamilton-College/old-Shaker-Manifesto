Help One Another The race of mankind would perish did they cease to aid each other. From the time that the mother binds the child's head, till the moment that some kind assistant wipes the death-damp from the brow of the dying, we cannot exist without mutual help. All, therefore, who need aid, have a right to ask it from their fellowmortals ; no one who holds the power of granting can refuse without guilt. Sir Walter Scott
