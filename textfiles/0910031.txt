Book Table Golden rule The Golden Rule, of Boston, comes to us in its old form : a handsome eight-page weekly paper, conducted by Rev. H. A. Shorey. Typographically it is almost a counterpart of its old self— the change being to a larger type for the body of the paper, making it even handsomer than before. As a literary and religious household journal The Golden Ride was a general favorite, and the new proprietors, in a modestly-worded greeting, propose to maintain its well-earned reputation. The old departments are all retained, and two or three new ones added. An entire page is given to Sunday Schools—-to be edited by Rev. R. R. Meredith and Rev. A. F. Schauffler. A story is promised for each week, the one in the present number being an admirable temperance story by W. M. F. Round. The price has been reduced to $2.00, with special rates to clubs.
