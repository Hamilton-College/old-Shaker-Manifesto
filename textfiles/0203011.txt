Community of Intellect Come down all ye high, and ye lofty in Mind, And mingle with kindred of lower pretense ; Give each one a share of your wealth, more red ed. And serve each a banquet of love and good sense. Then reach down in mercy, and lift up the lowly, And cause them to feel that you love them indeed : Your mental refreshments, then loving and holy, Will prove a sweet season, from vile passions freed, Then dwell altogether, and mingle your talents, By blessing each other, and each being blest; No one is found wanting when weighed in the balance For each, of this heavenly food is possessed. Then here is the Sisterly, Brotherly kindredâ€” Community holy, that Heaven will own ; The heights and the depths are in harmony blended, Cemented by love, to the heavenly throne. Isaac Beals, U.
