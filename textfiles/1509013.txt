GOLDEN SILENCES There is silence that saith, 'Ah me ! ' There is silence that nothing saith; One the silence of life forlorn, One the silence of death; One is, and the other shall be. One we know and have known for long, One we know not, but we shall know, All we who have ever been born; Even so, be it so,ï¿½ There is silence, despite a song. Sowing day is a silent day, Resting night is a silent night; But whoso reaps the ripened corn Shall shout in his delight, While silences vanish away. New Age.
