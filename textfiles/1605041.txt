Engrave upon your hearts... [Contributed by E. Cumings.J Engrave upon your hearts, 'Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as unto the Lord.'ï¿½ Then take up, piece by piece, the work he lays before you, and do it thoroughly. It may look little and insignificant all the way, but at the end the golden grains shall have made a shining mountain. Never fold your hands idly, and say you were madeTor better things. Prove it by doing well the task He sets. Fielding.
