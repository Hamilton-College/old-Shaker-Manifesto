From the Little Children. When working in the kitchen... When* working in the kitchen or dining room, not any more than six plates or saucers should be taken, and not more than four cups, and when we have large pitchers to take we should never take more than one, unless they are empty. When we clear off a table the food should be taken off first, then take off the dirty dishes, then take off the castors and brush the crumbs off with a brush or cloth, then get some warm water and put a little soap into the water and a cloth and wash the table clean, then sweep the floor, then set the tables neatly and shut the doors. S. P. HOW BEES MAKE HONEY. The first thing, they go and try to find a flower to get some honey from and then they call the other bees to go with them until they all get a place. Then they go to work and fill their honey bags but I never knew before that they had a honey bag. I thought that they carried it on their feet because I have seen something on their feet but that was yellow. L. G. W. Dear E; I send you my love... Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1886.

I love my teachers very much. [ love all my little companions, and will be kind to them. This is all I can think of now. So good bye. M. R. He thought some restrictions... He thought some restrictions should be put upon those who claim to heal by spirit aid. The practice of medicine was a science, and even spirits could only know what to prescribe through a medium by having acquired that knowledge on the earth plane. The laws were framed in order to secure the best talent for the sufferers. It was not a proper, a safe thing to prescribe by a spirit who did not know the value and force of prescriptions. If the mediums would try and acquire some knowledge and then call in spirit aid, and know what the spirit was prescribing, it would be better. If the mediums are prepared by study and then the spirits assist them, they would have every right to practice. The speaker was fully convinced that while there were some genuine clairvoyant mediums, that 99 out of 100 who advertised in the daily papers were frauds and impostors. Judge Bailey in R. P. Journal. Engrave upon your hearts... [Contributed by E. Cumings.J Engrave upon your hearts, 'Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as unto the Lord.'� Then take up, piece by piece, the work he lays before you, and do it thoroughly. It may look little and insignificant all the way, but at the end the golden grains shall have made a shining mountain. Never fold your hands idly, and say you were madeTor better things. Prove it by doing well the task He sets. Fielding.
