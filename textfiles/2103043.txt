Mr. Editor:--I am very much pleased with the Manifesto... Athol Center, Mass., Feb. 1891. Mr. Editor:ï¿½I am very much pleased with the Manifesto. The practical part of it is excellent. You have some very good writers that understand what true, practical religion is, and if every one would follow its teaching the Christian world would be in a better condition than it is at the present. May God bless all who write such good pieces for the instruction of all who may read them. Caroline E. Hawkes.
