THE TRIAL OF FAITH. William Leonard. We are free to admit, what none attempt to den}*, that Zion is now passing through a peculiar period of travel. Some call it a period of trial, and we also admit, that it looks and feels ver}7 much like that. When Zion prospers in numbers, in faith or in heavenly gifts, to a true heir of life and salvation, the gospel of Christ then feels precious. In seasons of severe trials, when friendship fails, when the love of many wax cold and indifferent, when the faith of many seems on the decrease, these are the commotions which bring the gifted cross-bearer, who gathers substance, life and faith, to the surface. When many who should be supporters fall by the way, and the precious few pillars in Zion, groan and iigonize beneath their burdens, these are the days of toil and meridian heat that bring out true, strong-minded men and women of God, in plain day-light, before the children of Zion and the host of heaven. In such days of adversity Such laboring spirits will show before all heaven, their faith, hope and zeal for God, for when uncertainties thicken, they stand upon the watch-tower ; when adversity heaves up like billows, to the true and strong the work of God is more precious than at any other moment. Such souls will be willing to stand at any position and cheerfully perform any labor and make any sacrifice to support the woik on which the salvation of the yvorld depends. In these days of overturning and upheaving of reforms and transforms that sweep onward like a mighty freshet, producing a commotion which is felt even to the center of Zion, we are thankful to stand as tried supporters and co-workers together with our gospel relation. In these periods of every kind of communication, called gospel faith over the earth, we are thankful to be numbered as supporters of that true saving faith once delivered to the saints. We believe in the promises, that another manifestation will open upon Zion. When the spirit of Christ in a greater fulness rolls in upon us the spirit of God will surely set fire to Zion, an,d in that period, nothing will escape the burning but the true faith and what has honestly and fpirit^i.lly grown out of it. We were promised again and again, by the inspired world that when the Believers, our parents in God passed away, that just such a period would be upon us. And the same promise repeatedly declared, that at the end of our days of humiliation, Zion would arise, put on her garments of beauty and holiness and step in to the rescue, and save many precious souls. All the true children of Mother Ann are experiencing one part of these promises, patiently and severely. Zion is tried, afflicted and sifted, many think quite sufficiently, to prove the prediction doubly true. It is stated, that Father Joseph Meacham saw the seven travels of Zion, in a gift of revelation and a united prayer goes up, that our Zion will not have much further to sojourn before she arrives a$ the end of the first travel; and with strength, power and numbers begins to enter the second travel brighter and more glorious. In this cheering promise we confidently trust, patiently laboring and waiting to receive the fulfillment. The apostle Peter when predicting the day of the Lord, uses this remarkable language: 'But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night. The heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt with fervent heat. The heavens being on fire shall be dissolved.'�2 Pet. iii., 10-13. From the days of Martin Luther, every step in the process of tearing down the old religions or heavens has been started suddenly and as unexpectedly as the visit of a thief. Luther raised the cry against popish indulgences, and God was in the voice. It was at the instant when Antichrist was slumbering, and kingdoms were prepared to hear; and when that voice was uttered, all the powers of earth and hell could not stop the word of this thief-like messenger. Every remarkable overturn in the theological world, for the last two centuries, has started in a subtle and sudden manner. Unexpected has, been every rent that has been made in the temple of Anti-christ since, down to the days of the Lebanon revival, which prepared Father Joseph Meacham and his associates. The New Lebanon revival was sudden and powerful, and deep in its work of preparation. As its fires died down, when the subjects were humbled and filled with painful anxiety to receive it, the testimony of Ann Lee that had raised her above the earth, entered that body of revivalists as suddenly and unexpectedly as a thief in the watches of midnight. So it was at the far West. The western fires had died down; they had been prepared by manifestations from their best seers, to look for Christ's messengers to meet them in the form of mediators. In that manner they received Christ, and planted their branches of his kingdom. But the heavenly messengers suddenly appeared in their midst, and the word of life reached them as suddenly and silently as a robber seizes his plunder in the shades of darkness. Our own inspired work, so remarkable, was ushered in with scarcely a prophet or seer to predict its coming. That mighty work though in part rudimental, gave us warning of the present outside, developing, preparatory work, and of the many scenes through which we are now passing. Though imperfect as a whole, it was as perfect a work as we could bring out; and friendly, heavenly messengers sounded it through our camps as a remarkable prophecy for the future. When spirit voices predicted the outside work, few really believed it; but it opened in its season, and has almost spread from the rising to the setting sun. The mediums who began the work were two young persons. One of them we have seen, and with much feeling, heard her relate the singular opening revelations then given. These infant mediums were directed to give a very striking test, dated ahead, well calculated to excite mortality ; and when it was expected, it brought out hundreds of carriages, and thousands of observers, who spread the news in every direction. This outside, rudimental work, as unreliable as it was, and as crude as it may appear to us, has done more to create a terrific outcry against the old heavens and false religion than any advent that ever preceded it, in this or any other age. It has run silently to and fro in the earth, and beyond all doubt the fire of truth is in it, for it has caused the theological fossils and old heavenly elements to begin to melt before it with fervent heat, much like the declaration of the ancient prophet, 'The mountains would melt down at the presence of the Lord.' So great has been the overturn, that it has caused a trembling among every religious body in the land, not excepting the Shakers. 'Nevertheless, every true Believer of unshaken faith, according to his (Christ's) promise, looks for an enlargement of the new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteousness.'�2 Pet. iii., 13. Another opening at the end of days and times, has been confidently predicted. Judging by the past, those declarations must be fulfilled. The next edition, we cannot doubt, will be silent and in a manner unlooked-for. It will deeply concern Believers and the more advanced minds not of- our Order, and a fire must certainly be kindled that will burn up many things among us and them. Our faith is fixed and settled in the progress of God's work. We cannot advance and enlarge as a body, without the power of God to chastise us and humble us, and to enlarge and purify. Judging by that unerring rule of Jesus, the signs of the times, the fire kindled in and out of Zion will burn brighter and grow hotter, till it does the work more effectually in the next step of progress. Many thousands now see clearly that subjects of the work in great numbers are gathering our ideas of God, Christ, heaven, the judgment, resurrection life, Community and a probation hereafter. While this light is silently stealing through the host like a thief in the night, Believers complain that there is no conviction abroad. But common philosophy teaches ; when God pours out his spirit to commence a deeper work in these enlightened minds, his spirit can kindle a fire in the elements of truth which they are now gathering, that will start a spirit of conviction as much hotter than in former days, as fire is hotter than the burning summer heat. Therefore, our work is in the present, and our unshaken hope is in the future. We must perform our daily toils, building when we can build, and blessing all that we can bless, believing that all will work for the best, and that Zion's children will surely see beautiful days.
