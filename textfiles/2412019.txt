Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1894. Time is a gentle reminder of present duties. Each flitting moment tells us there is work to do and it requires the ! combined energies of body soul and spirit, to keep pace with the present fast age. Not only in the development of the inventive, but the increasing revelation of spiritual light and truth in the religious world. The present teachings of religion are no longer a mere matter of beliefs, but selfdenying works. We look forward each month with earnest pleasure to the arrival of our dear Manifesto, for it brings us nearer to other Societies and through its influence we learn to love and be loved by all. The sudden advent of winter, or wintry weather, is a hindrance to the rapid progress in the re-building of our barn which we anticipated, but we hope for more favorable weather. With us the springs that were famished by the summer's drought, are well filled. Although the drought was severe, we did not suffer as much from it as in many places around us. Thanks for our fine water system and its good care. Farm woi'k is nearly over, so we have more leisure for spiritual communion with ourselves and loving friends. Mar da M. Bullard.
