Wintering Calves The most difficult portion of cattle kind to keep through the season of the year of farm stock that has to be fed are the calves. Every farmer possesses more or less of these, and as it is designed for them to grow up and become of large size, every possible means should be adopted to raise them to the greatest perfection. If they are not handled with great care and the strictest attention paid to their welfare, their growth is liable to be arrested, and such an injury received thereby as cannot be easily, if ever fully, repaired by the best of treatment afterwards. Cattle are like everything else; if they are stunted when young and their growth checked, they can never afterwards be made to grow so thriftily as they would have done; and, therefore, too much pains cannot be taken with them while calres to give them a good start.
