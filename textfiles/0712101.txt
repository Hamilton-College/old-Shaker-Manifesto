Dressing with plainness It would lessen the burdens of many who find it hard to maintain their place in society. It would lessen the force of the temptations which often lead men to barter honor and honesty for display. If there was less strife in dress at church, people in moderate circumstances would be more inclined to attend. Universal moderation in dress at church would improve the worship, by the removal of many wandering thoughts. It would enable all classes of people to attend church better in unfavorable weather. It would lessen, on the part of the rich, the temptation to vanity. It would lessen, on the part of the poor, the temptation to be envious and malicious. It would save valuable time on the Sabbath. It would relieve our means from a serious pressure, and thus enable us to do more for good enterprises.
