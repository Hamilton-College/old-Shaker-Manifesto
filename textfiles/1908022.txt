In referring to the subject of unclean hands, the Sanitary Era says that cases of infection, that could be accounted for in no other way, have been explained by the fingers as a vehicle In handling money, especially of paper, door knobs, banisters, c'arstraps, and a hundred things that every one must frequently touch, there are chances, innumerable, of picking up germs of typhoid, scarlatina, diphtheria, smallpox, &amp;c. Yet some persons actually put such things in their mouths, if not too large! Before eating, or touching that which is to be eaten, the hands should be immediately and scrupulously washed. We hear much about general cleanliness as 'next to godliness.' It may be added that here, in particular, it is also ahead of health and safety. The Jews made no mistake in that 'except they washed, they ate not.' It was a sanitary ordinance as well as an ordinance of decency. Sanitary Volunteer. TREATMENT OF FOREIGN BODIES IN THE STOMACH. A method of treatment for foreign bodies in the stomach, which appears to be generally known and practiced with almost uniform success in both England and the Continent, consists in the administration simply of large amounts of potatoes, to which the diet should be restricted. It is stated by Profes| sor Cameron, of Glasgow, that this plan, ' which, so for as we know', is almost unknown in this country, originated with the London i pickpockets, whose custom it is to immedi' ately swallow small articles of jewelry ac, quired in the pursuit of their profession, and ' then depend on their recovery through the i evacuation which follows the abundant use of the potato diet. Several cases art on rec- ord where this method has proved eminently successful. Thus, Dr. Salzer (Deutsche Medizinal Zeitung for January 24, 1889) repuls the case of a child who had swallowed a brass weight of three hundred grains in September, 1887, and in whom the physician was on the point of performing gastrotomy. According to Dr. Salzer's advice the child was put in bed, kept on his right side, so as to facilitate the passage through the pylorus, and then fed with as much potato, prepared in different methods to stimulate the appetite, as he could be persuaded to take. In five ï¿½Jav s the foreign body was evacuated in the faeces. He also refers to a case of a patient who had swallowed a set of artificial teeth, and another who had swallowed a breast pin one and a half inches in diameter, in both of which cases the foreign bodies were removed without difficulty. At the meeting of the Society of Physicians in Vienna, at which the above cases were reported, the discussion which they stimulated led to the report of several other cases, one especially, by Hochenegg, which is especially remarkable in that it dealt with the case of a young carpenter, who, in 1884, swallowed a long nail, which was removed by gastrotomy. Two years later the patient was so unfortunate as to swallow a second nail similar in all respects fo the first. The potato cure was employed, and the nail was secured after nine days. In the Deutsche Medizinal Zeitung for March 11, 1889, Dr. Deichmuller refers to a case of a young girl, ten years of age, who had accidentally swallowed a pin. Pain was complained of under the breastbone, and Dr. Deichmuller, acting on the suggestion acquired through the report of the above cases, restricted the patient to the potato diet. Very shortly afterward the pain disappeared from the chest and was felt in the stomach. Six days later it appeared in the right inguinal region; two days subsequently, having increased in severity, it was felt in the left inguinal region, while in the evening of this day the foreign body was evacuated with the faeces. It is hardly necessary for us to call attention to the principles upon which this method is based. Potatoes, as is well known, are composed of nearly twenty per cent, of carbohydrates, eighty per cent, of the solids being starch and cellulose. On account of this large amount of carbohydrate, a great portion will resist the action of the digestive juices. The cellulose and other carbohydrates increasing greatly in volume from imbibition witli water, lead to an accumulation of an immense amount of indigestible residue ; consequently the intestinal tube is, throughout the entire time of the administration of this food, filled with large masses of non-absorbable matter. The folds of the intestine become obliterated, ard fixation of the foreign body in the intestinal tube is thus avoided. It seems that from five to nine days, or even longer, are required for the evacuation of the foreign body, and in every ease which does not seem desperate, a trial of this simple plan of treatment should precede resort to gastrotomy. In fact, at the recent meeting of the Vienna Medical College, Prof. Billroth said that since the introduction of this procedure, gastrotomy for foreign bodies should become an obsolete operation.
