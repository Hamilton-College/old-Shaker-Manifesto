A LITTLE CHILD. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. A little child shall lead them.� Isa. xi., 6. Who? The people of God in the latter day ! How ? By a ' little child.' Not literally, but figuratively�'Not by might nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord '�which is meek and lowly. What are the characteristics of a little child ? Purity and innocence ! And where shall we find these inestimable qualities among the human race, except in a little child, or among small children? Why? Because they never committed any actual sin, they never violated any law, and were always subject to their earthly parents. So, it will be with souls who are redeemed unto God. They will not knowingly, commit any actual sin, they will not violate any law, neither human nor divine. And they will always be subject to their heavenly Parents, their heavenly Father, and Eternal Mother. See Rom. i\, 20. They will ever be intent on building up the spiritual work of God, both in their own souls, and iu those around them. They will not join hand in hand with the wicked against the ' Lord's Anointed.' They will not build up fraud and deception, under whatever garb it may assume, because such are of the world. The world loves its own, and the Lord loves his own. When ? In that day, spoken of by the ancient prophet Isaiah ; which day is already beginning to dawn upon the earth ; if any doubt this, let them look back and see, where the world stood a hundred years ago ; find compare it with what is now beginning to take place on the intellectual plane of development, and just beginning to touch the moral and spiritual element, and when that plane is fairly reached, as it surely will be, there will be a thousand living lives of purity and innocence, on the earth, where therj is one now ; and those who have been living lives of virgin celibacy, for the last one hundred years, have not lived in vain. Great will be their reward for setting this example before a licentious world, and maintaining it for so long a time. Crowns of glory await them in the 'spirit world.' In that day the world will not be governed by physical force, but by the influence which mind exerts over mind, spirit over matter, men and women will no longer be slaves to their appetites and passions, the moral and spiritual faculties will predominate over them.
