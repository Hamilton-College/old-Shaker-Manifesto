Dear Manifesto ;—I am pleased to hear from... Shaker Station, Jan. 8, 1883. Dear Manifesto ;—I am pleased to hear from so many of my Young Sisters through your columns, and thought I would try to write. I am fourteen years of age, and have lived with Believers four years; I love all my dear gospel relation, and I often wish that many more children that are without true friends to guide them in the path of purity, might he ealled into the same fold, and have the same care and instruction that I have. It makes me feel very sad when I ride away a few miles to a city, or a village, and see the children dirty and ragged, and using un. becoming language, to each other. I think I ought to be very thankful for my beautiful home, and Fathers and Mothers who take such an interest in my welfare. Cora.
