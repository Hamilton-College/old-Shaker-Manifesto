THIS ALSO VANITY? RACHAEL POMEROY I spied two drops on a clover stem, Pale jewels loosely strung ; The sun god twinkled over them, Twin spheres of flame they hung, And all the zeal of ardent day Was focused in each globule gray. An errant breeze the clover shook — Each trembled toward its brother ; Or ever I had time to look One slid into the other, And lo ! a single spark of dew, Where side by side had glimmered two. I watched the traitorous, thirsty sun, Sucking the cordial up, Till all its essence was undone, Till drained its crystal cup, And wind and cloud and blazing sky, Knew better where it was than I. So have I seen chance comrades — say — Atomies on a random spray, Idling the dewy hours away Some careless morning ; A solemn shaft of rosy frame — Unfelt its sign,unfeared its name — Quick destiny to each it came — Without a warning. The sun of love, it smote them through ; The wind of love, it blew ; it blew; They shyly guessed — they surely knew What fate was doing ; No charm could will their lives apart, Could sunder glowing heart from heart, Or chain the restless counterpart Its mate pursuing. And yet— what if — tormenting fear ! Day were so bright and earth so dear, Breath were so sweet and skies so clear, Only to snare them ? Grudging Eternity, go by. These want to live — they would not die. More life—for that they pant, they cry — Good Death, oh, spare them !
