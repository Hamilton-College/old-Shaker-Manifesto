Shakers, N. Y. North Family. June, 1896. The month of roses has arrived and is refreshed by beautiful showers, the last day of May giving us the most abundant rain that we have had since the advent of warm weather. The warble of the birds is music that to one whose interior life is rightly attuned gives tones that are free from discordant vibrations and cause us to feel that they are the earthly counterpart of the music of the spheres. As we write we hear the cheerful notes of a pair of Orioles that have nested in a tree near our window and of our summer birds they can be classed with the most useful as they are great destroyers of injurious worms and insects. We may have placed our anticipations higher than at present can be realized, but when we read of those heretical burnings we could not help asking, can it be possible that the closing years of the nineteenth century is to witness the revival of that monster of theological bigotry and it has again showed its form! The destruction of life and property that has latelj been caused by those devastating storms that have swept over different sections of our country, causes our feelings to go out in sympathy for the afflicted, and thankfulness that we have been protected. Hamilton DeOraw.
