The Sunday School Times Under the title 'Through a Glass Darkly,' Mrs. Slosson has written for The Sunday School Times of December 21 a sketch of her meeting with this strange character. 'No sermon,' she writes, no chant, no learned theological treatise, nay, not even the reading of the Gospel story itself, had ever made that lonely life of the Stranger, the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, such a real thing to me.'
