Watervliet, N. Y. North Family. May, 1894. The history of South Union that has been published in serial articles in The Manifesto, is quite a social treat for which we are duly thankful. It enables one to niore fully understand the trying times that our dear Brethren and Sisters in the South passed through; but fortunately now can be recorded as history. The saying that the 'Lord helps those ï¿½who help themselves,' is fully proven in ;he labors of the little family at the North who, since their removal to this Society have been anxiously, and with a prayerful spirit laboring to bring order out of the seeming necessary confusion incident to moving. Thanks to willing hands and loyal souls the consummation of their desires has been largely realized. While feeling some tribulation in moving from the old home, we fully believe that there was a spiritual gift in the move, and that the closer communion of Believers will result in a fuller and deeper spiritual ministration that will go forth to those who are honestly and earnestly seeking the higher life. Labor on the farm and garden is progressing as fast as the season permits. April giving us a taste of March weather, but in the latter part of the month some real April showers that caused the pastures and meadows to put on their garments of green. We are enjoying at present a season of good health. Spiritually, we are laboring to keep alive the gifts of the Spirit, to be placing a treasure where the destructive elements of earth life can not affect them. Hamilton DeGraw.
