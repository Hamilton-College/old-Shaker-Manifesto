PATIENCE. By Cora Vinneo. Not unto every one comes wealth or fame, The pomp of triumph, and the gift of pride; Not unto all comes glory's wond'rous name, Whose theme and altar have been deified. All may not wear the martyr's cloak of fire, Nor clasp with fervent hands the burning stake; All may not feel the prophet's high desire; Nor drink the cup of poison for truth's sake. 48 THE MANIFESTO. These call for courage which to few is given; But humbler martyrs meet us every day, God's patient ones who steadfastly have striven 'Gainst foes within, and kept them all at bay. Yea, all sometimes may feel the stress of toil; The disappointment that has failed to win; All may with sorrow burn the midnight oil, Alone with trouble, doubt, distrust and sin. All may be tried as never soul was tried; For so I know, no two can feel alike; No one can die the death another died; No one has struck where you and I must strike. No one has felt the triumph we may feel, The victory we gain is ours alone; No one has heard the music grand and real, That swells when life gives up its undertone. Then take new courage where before you failed, Guard well the heart with watchful faith and prayer, And when your eyes with falling tears are veiled Look o'er the cloud, the Patience-bow is there. Mt. Lebanon, 2V'. Y.
