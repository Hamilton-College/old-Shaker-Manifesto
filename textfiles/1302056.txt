AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Dec. 21, 1882. Gospel Friends ;â€”We write, at this moment to apprise you of a most sorrowful calamity which occurred at our Second Family on the eve. of the 19th. at 5.30 P. M. Our beloved sister, Ann Eliza Colburn, having been using an oil stove to heat some tea for her sick sister, put out the stove lamp and before it got cool filled it again with oil, having a lighted lamp at some distance. She unfortunately dropped a trifle of oil on the stove, it took lire at once, ran down into the stove lamp, exploded it, and set the Office on fire. The building was destroyed, but most of the goods, books and other articles were saved. Sister Ann Eliza in going back into the building, to secure some articles of value, was so dreadfully burned that she died at 11.15 A. M. on the 20th. As the supply of water was very limited, it was all that could be done to preserve the surrounding buildings. Your Brother, ' G. B. Avery.
