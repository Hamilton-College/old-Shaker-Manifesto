LIGHT IS LIFE-GIVING. Alonzo G. Hollister. There are many young and inexperienced among us who need instruction in the fundamental principles of the gospel, that they may have a right understanding and grow up and be strong both in the knowledge and practice of the truth which redeems and purifies from error, and from all cause of inharmony and disquietude. Perhaps all honest people admit that it is proper to confess sins to the person wronged, by the one doing themï¿½because this restores confidence and sympathetic relations which the wrong-doing had destroyed. Moreover this confession is a sort of pledge supported by sympathy, that the wrong will not be repeated. In this way confession is proved to be remedial, and an aid in overcoming the disposition to commit offenses. But what of our secret sins, known only to ourselves and the All-s&amp;eing Eye, but supposed to be covered from mortal gaze. They are not hid from spirit eyes. And though we may have forgotten them, not until they are taken away by the means God has appointed can we be healed of their effect. They remain in us and deteriorate our spiritual and social qualities, just as a concealed ulcer in the body deteriorates our physical health, and renders us liable to communicate disease to others. Moreover, concealed maladies are liable at any time to break out into something more serious. Evil deeds are works of darkness, and as like attracts like, while they remain concealed within, they attract spirits of darkness who thus find a cover under which to work and parry the light, or obstruct the vision, and even persuade to more evil deeds. Good and evil, light and darkness cannot combine, healthfulty and harmoniously, nor will they abide each other's presence without alternating in the government of the creature. If evil rules in permanence, good will depart. If good rules in permanence, it will use the means in the gospel provided, to utterly root out the evil, and burn all the tares, by honest confession, repentance, and daily cross bearing. The good never fears complete and thorough exposure to the light, which is of its own nature, and is a helper. It is the evil disposition which committed the act, that dreads exposure, and is wounded and weakened and finally slain by honest confession and walking ever in the light. For light is ever contrary to evil works, and will subdue all opposition in the final issue. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
