White Water, O. North Family. Oct. 1893. We have had a very dry summer, but recently have been blest with several fine rain-falls that have done an immense amount of good. Seeding is about finished in this vicinity. Wheat and oats yielded fairly well. Corn, considering the drought, looks well. Potatoes are very poor compared with the productions of other years, but we shall have enough for use during the winter, which will be a great blessing. We were favored with a visit from Watervliet in August, by Henry Fredrick, Ferdinand Buddinger, Mary McBride, and Eliza Jimason. Then on the 20th of September we were pleased to entertain a company of four Sisters from the same Society. I think if Believers would visit more among each other, the bond of union would grow stronger; and it is my belief that mutual benefit would result from an interchange of ideas. J. 0. Tyler. [We think Br. Tyler is right on the subject of visiting and would invite the dear friends of White Water to make a call at our home in New Hampshire. Ed.]
