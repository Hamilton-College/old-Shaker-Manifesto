GOD SEES ME I have heard of a little boy who was kept from committing a great sin remembering that God could see him. He was tempted to take something that did not belong to him, but he said : ' Although nobody sees me, God sees me, and I fear I should never again be good. I never could pray again to God; and what should I do when I come to die, and go away to answer God? I would rather be poor always than steal.'
