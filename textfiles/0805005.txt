MIND vs. MATTER Matter is composed of earth; Mind of God's eternal breath. Matter yields to form and word; Mind alone, can worship God. Mind is master of the man. Matter, servant of his plan. Mind retains its vigor long, Matter fails e'er mind is strong. Mind can scale the Universe ; Matter, law confines, to earth. Mind retains its vernal bloom When matter lieth in the tomb. Canterbury, N. H.
