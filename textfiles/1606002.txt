THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST. JOSEPH WOODS. The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God 'unto salvation to every one who believes and obeys it. Whoever they may be that profess to be his followers, if they do not find that power of God, which saves from sin, the reason is obvious ; they have not made the sacrifice which the gospel requires. They have not forsaken all that they had, and their own carnal lives, also, which includes their lusts, their appetites and their passions in every form. There is still a fixed determination in their minds, as there was in the case of Ana- nias, and Sapphira, to hold back a part of the price, to use for the gratification of some indulgence, in that which the gospel of Jesus Christ does not allow. Finding they are not saved from sin, they doubt the saving power of the gospel, and hold fast to their most easily besetting sin. At the same time they pray to God that He would help them to overcome those darling sins which they daily roll as a sweet morsel under their tongues with a determination to continue in them. Why should they try to deceive themselves or others? The wages of sin always was death. God is not mocked. What a man soweth, that shall he also reap. The gospel of Christ if lived, practically, always did and always will save the soul from sin. This was the mission of Jesus,ï¿½To save his people from their sins : not in their sins, as this is not the salvation of God. A sinner must reap what he has sown. The hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save all who come unto Him in the way of his appointment. Whoever lacks wisdom in these things, let him ask of God, in his appointed order, and it shall be given him, for He giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not. Canterbury, N. H.
