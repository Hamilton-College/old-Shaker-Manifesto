Enfield, N. H. Nov. 15, 1891. Dear Editok:ï¿½We have been abroad for a few days on a mission, hence this delay in writing, and one of these days very fortunately, chanced to be the first meeting of the National W. C. T. U. Convention, which we gladly attended. Noble women, not only of America but from across the great waters were there assembled in earnest prayerful work: and all among our people, who are interested in every movement that helps to evangelize the world, have no doubt, kept well informed through the daily papers. The opening prayer, the Annual Address, the White Eibbon Hymn, written for the Convention, all spoke grandly for the glorious work which is being slowly but surely accomplished by these handmaidens of the Lord. The half hour of devotional exercise at the close was impressive, during which, was shown in language plain, our great need of a prayerful spirit in daily service, corresponding or rather in divine accord, with the words of our Mother, Ann Lee, 'Hands at work, and hearts to God.'' The speaker said, 'We must all believe that we have a Heavenly Father, who knows best if our selfish prayers should be answered, just as the parent knows, when the child wants a carving knife to play with, it is not best,' very true, but here is the point which seemed a little incongruous; 'He is cleaning house now, everything is tossed up.' Now we never knew an earthly father who wished to take upon himself this responsibility, have even heard of those who sought other quarters until this distasteful but all-together needful work was entirely done; 'First that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.' Now it stands to reason that the Heavenly Mother, is at the head of this house-cleaning business, which our English sister so truthfully said was in progress, and if 'everything is tossed up' it will surely take a mother's hand to bring order out of chaos. 'O there,11 be a song of triumph When the battle clays are o'er, When the house is set in order, And the tempter conies no more. When with purity of purpose, Thy whole life to God is given, All the world cannot contain it! It will rise for joy to heaven!' This fact was so clearly apparent in her address, that we wondered if others' in the audience not of our Order, did not have a ray of conviction in this wise; we whispered it to the sister who sat next to us, who was the President of one of England's great colleges, and write these few words, hoping it may prove as seed, which perchance, may fall upon the right soil for germination, indeed, it seems the next step in the onward march of our brave sisters abroad. Next time we will write more about home affairs. Love to all from all. E. B.
