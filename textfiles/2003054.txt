A SIMPLE RELIEF FOR LUNG TROUBLES. It has long been known that pine needle pillows would alleviate persons afflicted with lung troubles, and a Florida Editor relates an incident in support of the fact as follows ï¿½ During a visit to the home of a most estimable lady living on Indian River, this editor was told of a discovery that had been made which may prove a boon to sufferers from lung or bronchial troubles. This lady having heard that there was peculiar virtue in a pillow made from pine straw, and having none of that material at hand, made one from fine, soft, pine shavings, and had the pleasure of noting immediate benefit. Soon all the members of the household had pine shavings pillows, and it was noticed that all coughs, asthmatic or bronchial troubles abated at once after sleeping a few nights on these pillows. An invalid suffering with lung troubles derived benefit from sleeping on a mattress made from pine shavings. The material is cheap and makes a very pleasant and comfortable mattress, the odor of the pine permeating the entire room and absorbing or dispelling all unpleasant odors. Sci. Amer.
