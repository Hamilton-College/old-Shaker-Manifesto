WORDS THAT STAIN. A small brush of camel's hair had been dipped into a fluid in which was some nitrate of silver, or 'caustic' as it is sometimes called. The brush was wiped upon a white sheet. Pretty soon there appeared a black stain upon a white surface. It did not look very dark at first, but the action of the light seemed to deepen the color until it was an ugly spot that could not be washed out, nor bleached out in a whole summer's sunshine A bright lad heard a vile word and an impure story. He thought them over. They became fixed in his memory, and th ;y left a stain which could not be washed out by aU the waters of this great round earth. Do not allow yourself to listen to vile ' smutty 'sto ries, or unclean words. There are persons who seem to take an evil delight in repeating such things. And those who willingly listen to them receive a stain upon their memory. To give ear to filthy talkers is to share their sin. Don't lend your ears to be filled and defiled with shameful words and vile stories. In these days of evil speech and of bad books, it is our duty to take care what we listen to and what we read. A vile story smirches and defiles the heart, pollutes the memory and inflames the fancy. Shun these things as you would poisonous vipers. Draw back from hearing them as you would shrink from the 'cancerous kiss. es ' of the crocodiles seen in DeQuincey's opium dream. If by chance you have heard any obscene words or vile stories, drive them from your thoughts as you would the blackwinged bats from your face at night. Ask God to help you. Think of the true things He has said, and study the pure and beautiful things He has made. Austin Q. Hagerman
