Watervliet, N. Y. Second Family. Mar. 1894. We have the past month realized that the weather, like humanity, is very changeable and prone to go to extremes. The thermometer ranging from 60 above to 18 and 20 below zero. We have had some sleighing the past month and we have improved it to secure our fire wood. La Grippe has afflicted many, the North Family having an extra portion. WThen I realize how frail poor humanity is, and how uncertain is life, I am reminded of the words of the poet,ï¿½'Why should the spirit of mortal be proud?' The writer enjoyed a short but pleasant visit at Enfield, N. H. Also made a call at Harvard, and would return kind thanks to all for blessings received, both temporal and spiritual. Isaac Anstatt. North Family. Mar. 1894. Aside from the Manifesto, no periodical coming to our table is read with more pleasure than the 'World's Advance Thought and Universal Republic,' published by Lucy A. Mallory, Portland, Ore. It is brimful of sound testimonies that are needed to awaken the consciences of men and women and bring them to a realization of what is necessary to lift from human society the incubus that is hanging like a death pall over our nineteenth century civilization. We have perused with pleasure the report of the proceedings of the 'World's Congress of Religions,' and it brings joy to our spirit to know that ministering angels are at work with humanity and that the divine Brother and Sisterhood of the race is a possibility. An essay was delivered by Frances E. Willard, on 'Social Purity,' which is the testimony of eternal truth and it has gone forth into the world bringing them to judgment in the natural order and Believers can send forth a fervent prayer that the testimony may be sustained as it will prepare them for the higher life. Besides our Society meetings and singing meetings we have Saturday evening meetings and Sabbath evening singing schools for our own family. It keeps an interest awakened on spiritual and social subjects which can not fail to be beneficial. By the time these notes appear, your humble contributor will be actively engaged, as far as the weather will permit, in the occupation of preparing the family garden, and our earnest prayer is that all of our Brethren and Sisters may have a prosperous year and that the tillers of the soil may have occasion to rejoice in the bountiful harvest they will reap. Hamilton DeOraw.
