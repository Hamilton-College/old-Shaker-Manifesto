ARAB HORSE MAXIMS Let your colt be domesticated and live with you from his tenderest age, and when a horse he will be simple, docile, faithful, and inured to hardship and fatigue. If you have your horse to serve you on the day of your trial, if you desire him to be a horse of truth, make him sober, accustomed to hard work, and inaccessible to fear. Do not beat your horses, nor speak to them in a loud tone of voice; do not be angry with them, but kindly reprove their faults; they will do better thereafter, for they understand the language of man and its meaning. If you have a long day's journey before you, spare your horse at the start; let him frequently walk to recover his wind. Continue this until he has sweated and dried three times, and you may ask him whatever you please, he will not leave you in difficulty. Use your horse as you do your leathern bottle; if you open it gently and gradually you can easily control the water within, but if you open it suddenly the water escapes at once, and nothing remains to quench your thirst. Observe your horse when he is drinking at a brook. If in bringing down his head he remains square, without bending his limbs, he possesses sterling qualities, and all parts of his body are built symmetrically. Four things he must have broad—front, chest, loins and limbs; four things long —neck, breast, forearm and croup; four things short — pasterns, back, ears and tail.
