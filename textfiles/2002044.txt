We read in the Bible, 'Be strong in the Lord...' Text :� ' Be strong in the Lord.' Epii. vi., 10. We read in the Bible, '� Be strung in the Lord, in the power of his might and put on the whole armor of God' that we. may be able to stand against all trials and temptations. This means that we must put all our mind and strength to doing right. We must not insist in having our own evil way, but ''live to God and die to. sin.' It teaches me that I must give my whole heart to God and try in every way to do what 1 know is right. Hancock, Mass. Frances Hall.
