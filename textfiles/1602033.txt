CHARITY. Only a drop in the bucket, But every drop will tell; The bucket would soon be empty Without the drops in the well. Only a poor little penny, It was all I had to give ; But as pennies make the guineas, It may help some cause to live. A few little bits of ribbon, And some toys�they were not new ; But they made the sick child happy, Which has made me happy, too. Only some outgrown garments� They were all I had to spare; But they'll help to clothe the needy, And the poor are everywhere. A word now and then of comfort, That costs me nothing to say ; But the poor old man died happy, And it helped him on the way. God loveth a cheerful giver, Though the gift be poor and small; What doth He think of his children When they never give at all? The Catholic.
