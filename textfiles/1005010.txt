Sonyea, April 4, 1880 My Dear Albert — The editorial remark in the April Manifesto that the number ' will be found full of grand articles from talented contributors ' is true. But among them all I assign the first place to ' Fruits of the Harvest,' by O. C. Hampton. Here there is no ' beating about the bush,' the fittest arrow is chosen from the quiver, and sent direct to the center of the target. The question — What is the gospel of Christ? is answered by a living witness in a manner that shows the priceless value of that gospel. It tallies completely with the old experiences that were published years ago. How much better is this than all the theories that theological argument has ever presented ? I don't know but theoretical speculations may be of value to some minds, but the presentation of absolute truth gained by experience seems to me a thousand fold better. But I did not commence this brief epistle for the purpose of opposing theories, but to express my high appreciation of Bro. Oliver's article, and to express the hope that other similar ones will see the light through the same monthly medium of light, love and wisdom. I congratulate you, dear Albert, on having so many valuable contributors as you have, whose articles show that the ' glory of the Lord has arisen.' We are all in fair health at the present time. Eld. Lydia is constantly improving, and will probably gain full strength as warm weather advances. As ever, in love, Wm. H. Bussell
