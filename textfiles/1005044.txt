Dutch Bolls .â€”There used to be a steam packet that went out of Amsterdam that gave first-class feeding to her passengers, and once I mixed up with the Dutch cook, as I was a Swede, and got this receipt from him for his rolls, which were very good and light, and 1 have made them since with brilliant success: Sift three quarts of flour; break three eggs into a pint of cold milk, in which put a teaspoonful of yeast and stir up ; cut a spoonful of butter up fine and work it into your flour; mix the milk and eggs and yeast with the flour ; knead thoroughly. Make into rolls, butter the pan, and stand by the stove to rise. Bake in a quick oven.
