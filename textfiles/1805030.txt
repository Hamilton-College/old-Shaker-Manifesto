THE SILENT SERMON. M. J. Tatterton. It has been truly said that a holy life is a continual sermon. Though it be silent it speaks with a force that cannot be unheeded by those who come within the range of its influence. The name of Jesus may be extolled from the Pulpit iu words of surpassing eloquence which are listened to by thousands of appreciative hearers ; but let the most humble disciple oi Christ manifest holiness, by obeying the principles which constitute the Christ life ; truly learning of the Teacher to be meek and lowly in heart and he wields an influence for Christ which all the eloquence and wisdom of this world cannot equal. Best of all sermons is the one of a holy life ; indeed without it all other preaching is useless and vain. The possessor of a spotless life and name, void of offence toward G-od and man is in possession of the true riches ; and to such the blessing of heaven comes in soul refreshing showers, as the dew and rain to the thirsty earth ; distilling joys that are enduring because descending from the wellsprings on high. Blessed beyond all other considerations or attainments is the influence of a holy life. Canterbury, N. H.
