Shakers, N. Y. Dec. 1896. By the time these Notes appear we will have past the festive seasons of Christmas and New Year. It is fitting that they should be seasons of rejoicing, especially to the little folks, for the one whose name and birth we celebrate, said 'Suffer little children to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' Our Thanksgiving Day was observed by meeting in our home chapel. The theme of the service was that we realize the causes for our thanksgiving, by comparison with those who were needy and in bonds, and to pray that they may also be the recipients of those blessings which they need. We cast in our mite of appreciation and thankfulness to those in whose care The Manifesto is placed for its excellent typographical appearance and for the testimony of truth that has been manifest in its contributions. When we see the enormous amount of literature that is being placed before the reading public on every subject that can possibly interest them; the organizations that are supported by the free contributions of members who are largely of the working class; realizing the necessity of keeping before the public their manifestos, many of them publisht weekly, our prayer is that our Manifesto may fulfill its mission and that it may be sustained in advocating the truth of higher life. To all the readers of The Manifesto we send greetings, wishing them a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Hamilton DeGraw
