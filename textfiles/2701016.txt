Enfield, N. H. Dec. 1896. A happy and a prosperous New Year to all the readers of The Manifesto. We are pleased to chronicle that we had THE MAN1FES W. 13 the honor of entertaining our esteemed fellow-laborer, Elder Calvin G. Reed, of Mt. Lebanon. He was our guest for several days during the month of November and long will the occasion be remembered, for like the vaulted heavens with its myriad of stars, were the discourses delivered by him in our Sabbath and Thanksgiving services, rich in expression and soul goodness. He went among us as a minister of light and good cheer. We have also had the pleasure of entertaining several members of the Christian Endeavor Society of East Lebanon, and through the kindness of our friend Mrs. Jennie Paddleford, listened to an interesting report of their New Hampshire State Convention, held at Portsmouth, N. H. In compliance with the Governor's suggestion, we devoted November 26th to the giving of thanks for past and present blessings. In the evening we enjoyed a pleasant and profitable season, in which the literary and musical ability of the younger members had the effect to cheer and edify the minds of all present. Freighted with blessings has been the past year, prompting us to be wisely diligent in following the example of the arisen Christ, with 'hands at work and hearts to God,' endeavor to entwine about the lives of others, laurel wreaths of love, bedewed with Heaven's spirit of purity.
