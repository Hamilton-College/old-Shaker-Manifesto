ARIST CRACY OF THE HOD This is the best country in the world for men who earn their living by manual labor. This is for all of us a subject of congratulation and pride. The majority must in every civilized community be employed in this way, and the political system which best secures their welfare, other things being equal, may be regarded as best adapted to the wants of modern society. There are men who would prefer to make their living in some other way, and find it very difficult. A lawyer advertised the other day for a clerk, requesting applicants to state age, acquirements and qualifications. He received in one day over one hundred replies to his advertisement, from men of 20 to 30 years of age, all of whom wrote fair hands, some excellent; all were acquainted with the routine business of a law office; some were attorneys already admitted to practice, graduates of colleges and universities, and in several instances the applicants were also accomplished stenographers. These men asked salaries of from eight to fifteen dollars a week, less than the strikers in front of our building were demanding for eight hours a day of the mere labor of their hands, requiring no intelligence whatever. It ought to be known everywhere, throughout the country, wherever there are young men hesitating whether they will trust to their hands or their brains for a living, that at this hour, in New York, educated men are demanding the highest and most arduous kind of clerical work at wages which a hod-carrier scorns. The men of education have no organization, no unions which Will support them in idleness. They must work or go hungry, and their labor will therefore bring only what employers find it profitable to give. It is an awkward argument to present to the advocates of compulsory education, to show them that learning to read and write drives a man into less lucrative work than carrying the hod. N. Y. Tribune
