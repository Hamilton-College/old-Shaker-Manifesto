A QUARREL. [ Contributed by G. B. Avery. ] There's a knowing little proverb, From the sunny land of Spain, But, in Northland as in Southland Is its meaning clear and plain. Lock it up within your heart, Neither lose nor lend it, Two it takes to make a quarrel, One can always end it. Try it well, in every way, Still you'll find it true, In a fight without a foe, Pray what could you do? If the wrath is yours alone, Soon you will expend it,ï¿½ Two it takes to make a quarrel One can always end it. Let's suppose that both are wroth And the strife begun, If one voice shall cry for peace, Soon it will be done ; If but one shall span the breach He will quickly mend it, Two it takes to make a quarrel, One can always end it.
