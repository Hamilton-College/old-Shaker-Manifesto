PEACE CONGRESS OF NATIONS As a war strategist, General Grant won golden opinions and the chief magistracy of the U. S. But, until a recent date, he was not even suspected of brilliancy as a statesman. Some of his recent utterances, however, touching Church and State matters, have, in the eyes of the nation, carried him to a front rank among statesmen; a large number of journals formerly opposing him — among others The N. Y. Tribune — complimenting him with delivering himself of wisdom, which the nation could not reasonably have expected for scores of years to come. The United States will not soon forget, the grand rallying cry of '' Let us have Peace. ' In the light, and unprecedented glow, of the amicable settlement of The Alabama Claims, during the service of the present Presidential incumbent, wre urge, hope and pray, for the establishment of a Peace Congress of Nations, to arbitrate the cause of justice among all nations, with a view to banish from the world the curse of War ; and consequently the expensive necessity of standing armies and navies. The time for the abolition of such old-time barbarisms seems fully ripe; and we urge the attention of our own, and all other nations, to a scheme, whose aim is the increased happiness and spirituality of all peoples. With War and its contingencies, as things of the past — with energies that have been perverted, turned into the proper, peaceful channels of agriculture, arts, sciences, literature and manufactures — none will say 'I am poor '—for the reign of universal, peaceful brotherhood will be eternally established! This is not a Utopian dream — it is possible — and we therefore raise the undying cry for a Peace Congress of Nations, whose every diplomacy will aim to ' Let us have a lasting Peace ': ' That golden age, on history's page, shall gleam in truthful lines; For even now, its dawn appears, in bright, prophetic signs.' *
