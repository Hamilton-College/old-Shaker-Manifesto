ARISTOCRACY. Aristocracy of blood, priority, the accident of birth, arrogates to itself superiority, and looks upon, and values its supposed inferiors much as it would a dog, or a horse, for their usefulness aud fidelity in doing menial service. In education it vaunts itself on its superior acquiremeuts aud capacious mind, which contains all that is worth knowing. Its wealth of knowledge is so great it can afford to be lavish, yea^ prodigal with its large fund of advice. In wealth it is proud, exacting, wearing a badly fitting superficial dignity, claims the right of way everywhere, values itself by its dollars and cents. But when considered as a man, is as worthless as a rag baby. In official position its language is; I alone am fit for this trust, subordinates all things. Not servant, but master� despot. Were it not for my high ability this thing would be a failure�a total wreck. And with a suggestive nod of the head, when I'm gone we'll see ! In religion it is piety and sycophants towards God, and impudence and tyranny towards men. Would assume partnership with the deities, aud instruct them how to deal with the lower grade of caste. Socially it is pure unmitigated caste, associates with none but its equals, and they are scarce, and jealously recognized. Is born earlier, more learned, refined, richer and superior in all things, will carry itself so that others may feel their inferiority. At home is boss, and all will be made to feel the majesty of its presence. It cares nothing lor justice, or equality ; maintains a boorish dignity, aud cares nothing for the rules of etiquette, or refined manners. Plays hog in the parlor, kitchen, and especially at table selects the food best fitted to its palate. At church it affects unalloyed devotion. Is in partnership with Jesus since he is dressed up so as to appear respectable in the company of hypocrites. It ignores the evidence of-true religion. 'To the poor the gospel is preached.' And finally comes to the cross roads where its blind-board of self-conceit prevents its seeing ou a level with its fellows, and butts its head alike against them, and a stone post, and wonders why such obstacles are in his way. Aristocracy has three distinct phases. Conceit coir eded privilege, and vanity, and falsely thinks it is dignity, when it is supreme foolishness in contrast with natural dignity. The priest and the Samaritan. Democracy lives close to nature, on the green carpet of earth, in the genial atmosphere that breathes life alike into every flower. Aristocracy is a child of the frigid zone, and freezes whatever it touches. Selected.
