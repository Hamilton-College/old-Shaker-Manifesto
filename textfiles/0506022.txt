REFLECTIONS At the close of an Autumn day, I was led to admire the beauty of the sky, and to gaze upon the azure realms on high, until their opal brightness slowly faded from my view; but the variegated clouds were held within my thoughts as by a holy magnet. I fancied that in the whole wide world, there was nothing that could compare, in beauty, with the sky of evening, as the sun slowly faded in the west. I then turned my thoughts to my Zion home, and reflected upon the glories of the self-conqueror ! And to my mind, I beheld beauties as bright, serene and peaceful, as the golden twilight. I then asked, Are the acts of my life fully controlled by Gospel principle, am I so moulded and fashioned by spiritual power that my whole being is brought into activity under rays of divine light — that the deeds which I perform may appear as stars, twinkling in the light — illuminated with tints of goodness ? Ah! there is toil for me — much labor to perform. While stirred to more fervor by these reflections, I resolve now in the morning of life, to consecrate myself anew, to be fruitful in good works — to keep my heart with all diligence — that it may be a receptacle of love and light; and that I may possess the true adorning which attends the perfection of goodness. Thus, I shall possess the treasures of holiness, the reward of consecration — the wealth that truth will give. The springtime of life, if spent in true devotion, will be fraught with glory and strength. And as years roll on, by continued growth in all that is true and good, beneath celestial rays and Angels' care — I may continue, an indwell er in the temple of God, to go no more out forever.
