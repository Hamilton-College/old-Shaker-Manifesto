SHAKER COVENANT As wre promised, some time ago, we begin the publication of The Shaker Church Covenant. It will be com Ipleted in the November number. We ask kind attention to it, by Believers and 'those not of our faith.' It is the guardian of our rights and privileges ; our duties and obligations, under Christ Â¦ rule. It teaches, aye, demands, an ex1 ceeding purity, self-denial, equal1 1TY, JUSTICE, PEACE, UNSPOTTEDNESS &gt; I from the world! Wrho would truly t know this, let them try its discipline. t And yet, we do not claim perfection for ; it. We know wherein it can be imlj proved by amendments ; for the greater JI justice, comfort and satisfaction of its i' I subscribers. Such amendments are f already under consideration by the 2 Central Bishopric. But we do claim 1 that whoever lives up to its present re- 80 THE SHAKER. quirements, will curb human nature from making a tyrant or usurper of any one ; and teach that he or she that is greatest, must be so by becoming the servant of the brethren, at the expense of personal selfishness. Brethren, it is sufficiently perfect to guard it with all possible care, from even small breaches, which never of themselves incline to grow smaller ; and as we would defend our homes, hearthstones, associations and faith, so let us engage in all spiritual patriotism, and jealously watch the safety of our covenant.
