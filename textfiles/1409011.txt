MORNING THOUGHT. ELIZAETTE SUTTON. These are with kind wishes to all, and a glad welcome to the whole household of faith. The leaf that we are about to trace our thoughts and actions upon, lies, unwritten before ns, and presents a volume of chaste appearance. It is a [K'ge dee ed in clean apparel without a blemish or stain, to mar its character or deface its beauty. If we could close this volume,, with a .record of good deeds only, a history of human kindness and good will to all. Would we not think that the Millennium had really dawned, or the era of Millennial virtues had covered the earth, and wrought a needful change'!' By'cry new leaf that we turn should bear the'inscription of Hope, which is always resolute and accompanied by power to make it of greater merit in trustworthiness and noble deeds. From this, springs a world of pleasure. It is an angel at our side blessing each enterpris-j tending to moral or spiritual worth; gilding its pages with bright and encouraging things of God's forming and character. Yea, we are writing' a history for our present, or future comfort, or pain. Would it not be wise to be mindful of this that every step be taken with firm purpose towards the Millennial dispensation? Faith is a support and will prompt us to a well spent life and clear record. It will aid us on the unknown, the untrodden path before us as we gather hopeful visions of success. Love, that thinks no ill of its neighbor nor vaunteth itself, should be a prominant good with us, I wish to apply thes beautiful truths to my daily conduct, and be one with my loving Elders, Brethren and Sisters in the bright hope of Eternal life.
