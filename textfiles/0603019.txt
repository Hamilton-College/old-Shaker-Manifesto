CRITICISM—APPLE GRAFTING, TRIMMING, ETC. A. Leavens, Amateur Nurseryman, Concord, N. H., writes substantially as follows: 'Dear friend Briggs: Your article in Jan. Shaker on ' Starting a Nursery ' interested me much. Thinning the young trees, one-half as much as you suggested, is advisable. Root-grafting, is found by us to be as good as the ckoUar-graftlng which you recommend, and its advantages are, you get several grafts from each seedling—using only a few inches of the root for a graft. ' Whip-grafting is generally employed; but any splice that makes a perfect joint of the inner barks, is just as well. Grafts should be set so that the upper bud will just touch the surface, to prevent the graft drying before cohering. I mulch with saw-dust as an additional protection. 'FJder Evans is mistaken about trimming trees in the fall — the majority of best pomologists prefer late spring, or June! The wound heals quickly, while trimming in the fall, the rot is more apt to set in. (How these doctors differ! Ed.) 'Again: Hen manure and ashes are inferior as top dressing for onions, to plaster and hen manure—the ashes tending to neutralization.'
