IDOLATRY. Jessie Evans. The book of Judges, in our estimation, is of double interest to the Bible student. First, it contains a very interesting account of the Children of Israel, and second, because the iravels and experiences of the twelve tribes, in journeying from Egypt to Canaan, are typical of Christian progress from error to right, in this day. Many lessons given to them by their leader Moses, are worthy of attention from professing Christians now. The Ten Commandments embodying the Moral Law, is one of the wonderful revelations of that period. The first one reads, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me,' and the sicond emphasizes it, 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth,' inducing the opinion that idolatry was one of the besetting sins of the Children of Israel, and was therefore forbidden first by their divine teacher. And so it afterward proved. Each time that the people were deprived of their leader, we read that 'they remembered not the Lord, but turned again to serving false gods.' Judges viii., 33, 34. Some writers are of the opinion that the journey of the Israelites through the Wilderness is but an allegory, portraying the opposition of thf human heart then as now, to the divine hand that would direct and guide to the spiritual Land of Promise. Whether taken in this light or otherwise, the history of their strange wanderings is a wonderful lesson. The condition of society in the days of the Children of Israel necessitated the commandment referred to ; but to-day there is no need of its literal injunction, for civilization has done away with the graven images and false gods of ancient days; but the words, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before me,'ï¿½are they not applicable to our lives? Where is our God, when fame, wealth or intellectual attainments claim the first and last consideration? When we deem ourselves and selfish interests, wherever centered, worthy of the best efforts of mind, might and strength, are we not guilty of idolatry, and in its most degrading form? The gods of the heathen, we think, are almost incomparable with the varied, yet none the less adored gods of to-day, at whose shrines so many 'bow down and worship.' If we live in conformity with the first of the ten commandments given so many years ago, we may understand the words of Jesus, when he said, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with ail thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength,' for this can be made a reality only where the soul is free from the sin of idolatry.
