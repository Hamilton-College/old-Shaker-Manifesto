A CONSECRATED LIFE. Andrew Barrett. A consecrated life means a life void of all selfishness ; devoted to the cause the individual has espoused, either on the spiritual or material plane. As we are connected together, no' for the cultivation of the sensual, but for the moral aul .spiritual, the former must be denied by a rigid self-denial, to give place for the growth of the higher faculties. One of the first commands of the spirit to the children of earth, was, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy faculties and thy neighbor as thyself.' To do this, must require of the individual a deep coasecration of spirit in every part of their being. Watch as well as labor, pray as well as think. It brings upon them a constant struggle to have the spiritual or higher faculties, the governing power. And what will give to man or woman a more angelic, dignified character. This love to man is the love of the Savior. It has for its neighbor no jealous eye, no prejudiced heart. It leudeth a hand to the weak and feeble. It speaketh a word of courage to the drooping spirit. It is ever strong and valiant for the right. When a man or woman has traveled to the state of consecration that their property, small or great, is immerged into the divine interest, and their purposes into the divine purpose, then their individual labors will be immerged into the labors of Christ's kingdom. Into whatever place we may be called to act, we should feel the necessity of self-devotion to the cause in which we have enlisted, and thus feel the same interest to build up an earthly home as we do our spiritual. True consecration is selling self for the good of our brother or sister. It looks with charity upon the erring and judges them as thej wish to be judged. It is when the brother is borne down by the burdens of life ; a loving voice spoken in teuderest of feeling; Brother, can we assist you in your heavy burdens? It has the spirit to come up boldly and take part in the duties of life. It ever feels for the public good and never can and never will see any useful article, however small, wasted. The summing up of this noble virtue is, 'ï¿½ Hands to work and heart to God.' Harvard, Mass.
