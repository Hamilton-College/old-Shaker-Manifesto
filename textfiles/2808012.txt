West Pittsfield, Mass. July, 1898. We come once more from the Berkshire Hills with a greeting of love for our friends in other homes. We are enjoying the fulness of active, growing summer. It seems to us that we can faintly hear the mysterious forces so busily at work, forming the material for the growth of each tree and plant or flower. Every morning we realize the progression constantly at work about us, and at evening can trace the result of sun or shower by the growth toward maturity of fruit or grain. Potatoes promise an excellent harvest, and the hay crop we think, will exceed that of last year in abundance. While truly grateful for the many blessings which are ours and recognizing the benefit of so peaceful a home, our hearts are filled/vvith sympathy for the brave ones, who beneath the tropical suns of Cuba, are fighting so courageously for a poor and opprest people. Never before in the history of any country has the spirit of unselfishness and courage so actuated THE MANIFESTO. 125 the people, and while we desire the advancement of peace, we pray for the coming of the day when man shall acknowledge the universal brotherhood of man; when the cry of the slave and cruelty of the master shall cease. There came to our family a few days since two Sisters from the 'Canaan-Enfield' family, Hannah Wilson and Eliza Brown. They are traveling toward the west in life's journey and the radiance from a golden setting sun even now brightens their faces, as they impart messages of courage and strength to those whom they meet. They attended meeting with us benefiting all thereby. Sister Annie Case, of Watervliet, also paid us a flying visit, but as the good things of life are best appreciated when not too freely bestowed, we will look forward to a repetition ojf the hurried call.
