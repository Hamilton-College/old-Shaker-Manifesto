Sanitary. PURIFYING A ROOM'S AIR. The air of a room may be puxified in two hours by setting inside of it a widemouthed pitcher filled with pure cold water. In three hours at most it will have absorbed all the respired gases in the room, leaving the air purer by that much, but the water will be too filthy to use, if one but knew and see what it has taken in. It is estimated that a common pailfull of ice cold water will absorb in six hours one quart of carbonic acid, and several pints of ammonia from the air. For the purpose of purifying the air the water is all right, but do not use it to wash in or to drink. For those purposes use fresh water just drawn, or use from vessels that are already covered either by metal or china or by several folds of cloth, like a clean towel. Care in the use of drinking water would avert many calamities as typhoid and other malarial fever. Washington Star. THE CARE OF CHILDREN'S TEETH. The care of the teeth can not be begun too early. If a child loses those of the first set prematurely the jaw contracts, there being nothing to prevent it from so doing; the second teeth have not space to stand properly and are crowded. Particles of food lodging between the teeth cause them to decay early. It is a wise precaution to teach a child to pass a thread of silk or dental floss between the teeth after eating, as well as to brush them regularly. Salt and water is a good antiseptic, and answers for a dentifrice as many more elaborate and more expensive preparations. Ladies' Home Journal.

The same space of land, we are told, if devoted to wheat culture would feed 42 people; if to oats 88: potatoes Indian corn and rice, 176, and if to the plantian or bread-tree over 6000 people. [What a sad commentary on the use of meat for food.ï¿½D. C Brainard.]
