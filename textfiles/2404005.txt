GOD OUR TRUST. ' Thou art my hope, O Lord, God; thou art my trust from my youth. Psalms, lxx, 5. Mr. Lebanon, N. Y. God is our trust tho' the stormclouds assail us, Shineth His love thro' our darkness and tears; God is our hope tho'our bright joy may fail us, God is our strength thro' our weakness and fears. Yea, to the Arms Ever lasting we're clinging, Yea, 'neath the Rock of our shelter we hide, All of our doubts to the altar we're bringing,Knowing full well where his love doth abide.
