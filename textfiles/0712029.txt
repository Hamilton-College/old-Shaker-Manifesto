Look pleasant, be pleasant If people will only notice, they will be amazed to find how much a really enjoj'able evening owes to smiles. But very few consider what an important symbol of fine intellect and of fine feeling they are. Yet all smiles, after childhood, are things of education. Savages do not smile; coarse, brutal, cruel men may laugh, but they seldom smile. It is painful to reflect how seldom the poor smile. The affluence, the benediction, the radiance, which 'fill the silence like a speech'â€”the smile of a full, appreciative heart. The face grows finer as it listens, and then breaks into sunshine instead of words, has a subtle, charming influence universally felt, though seldom understood or acknowledged. Lord Bacon tells of a nobleman whom he knew; a man who gave lordly entertainments, but always suffered some sarcastic personality to 'mar a good dinner,' adding, 'Discretion of speech is more than eloquence, and to speak agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good words; for he that hath a satirical vein, making others afraid of his wit, hath need to be afraid of others memory.'
