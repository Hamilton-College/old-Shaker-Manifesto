'BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY.' [Selected.] In speaking of others' faults Pray don't forget your own ; Remember those in house of glass, Seldom should throw a stone. If we have nothing else to do But talk of those who sin, 'Tis better we commence at home, And from that point begin. We have no right to judge a man Until he's fairly tried; Should we not like his company, We know the world is wide. Some may have faults—and who has not? The old as well as young. Perhaps we may, for aught we know, Have fifty to their one. I'll tell you of a better plan; I find it works full well, To try my own defects to cure — Before of others tell. And though I sometimes hope to be No worse than some I know, My own short-comings bid me let The faults of others go. Then let us all when we commence To slander friend or foe, Think of the harm one word may do, To those we little know.
