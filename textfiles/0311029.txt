PROMISE 1. We'll breathe the words of holy joy, To spirits who are cast 2. We'll guide you to the glad some sphere, Where purest toils abound, 3. And you shall see we are not bound By selfishness or pride, Up on the And show to But self de sorrow'd waves of life, Where bitterness doth last; you the heavenly truth Our pilgrimage hath found; ni al is the power In which our souls abide; We'll tell We'll ope That all you the we of a happy home secret of our joys, have is spent for God, Beyond the strife of care, Where love is reigning in each heart, And deeds are wrought in prayer. The pleasures of our day, And give you from our treasury, Till grief shall pass away. To aid the fallen race, And make this earth, on which we live, A paradise of grace.
