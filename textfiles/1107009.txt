Correspondence Adamsville, May 28,1881 J. Warren Burrington Adamsville, May 28,1881 Mr. F. W'Evans: Dear Sir:—Through the courtesy of Mr. Q. H. Philips, I learn that your people have brought the culinary art — the selection of food and preparation thereof--to a fine science. Being myself a sensitive,and having to adopt rules different from the people around me in order to live at all (in the body), I would like to get a little light on how your people prepare their food, and the kinds you use in every-day life, for my own benefit and health. If not asking too much, would like to have you write me whatever you feel disposed to concerning the matter. I eat no meats, and find superfine flour injurious ; live principally on fruits and cereals ; find it hard to get the whole grain and save the necessary chemicals — properties contained therein. Now, if you will give me a little light on the choice of food and the preparation for use, you will confer to me a great favor. Yours in spirit and in truth, Adamsville, Franklin Co., Mass.
