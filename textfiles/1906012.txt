PRAYER FOR THE YOUTH. Eunice Wythe. God of love and life eternal, Power and wisdom, peace and truth; From that nature vile and carnal, In thy mercy save the youth. Blooming branches, young and tender, Springing from the holy vine; Let not sin nor satan hinder, Nor the smallest bough disjoin. We behold the youth with pleasure, And rejoice to see them grow; They are mother's precious treasure, 'Tis the seed her hands did sow. Let the faithful, first Believer Cry to God with all his might, Never let the old deciever Rob the youth of their birthright. Ye to whom all power is given, Both in heaven and on earth; Raise your piercing cry to heaven, Labor for your children's birth. Father, in Thy mercy save them, Keep them from the wolves around; In Thy arms, kind Shepherd, bear them, Keep them from polluted ground. How the precious work advances, Fast increasing in the youth; Heavenly songs and joyful dances, Powerful in the word of truth. They adorn God's sanctuary, While they strengthen Zion's wall; Let them run and not be weary, Let them walk and never fall Harvard, Mass.
