The balm in cy, And shows the Gilead glorious Still joyfully the burden With kindred hearts I'll found; It cheers life's pilgrim journey, As upward I am bound, way That leads to blissful mansions In everlasting day. bear, Till with the ransomed number The crown of peace I'll wear. Oh, I know the shining portals Will open unto me, When I lay aside the casket Of frail mortality.
