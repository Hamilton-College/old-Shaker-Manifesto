My dear young friend; Your letter gave me... Shaker Village, N. H. Aug. 22, 1880. J$1y Dear Young Friend ;ï¿½Your letter gave me a little surprise but by no means an unpleasant one. Not being properly directed it failed to reach me as soon as it otherwise would. I am pleased to be reminded that you have not entirely forgotten your old friends. I know of no better way of expressing my regard and interested feelings for you than by proffering a little friendly advice. This I trust you will accept and consider as from one who desires your prosperity morally as well as materially. Firstly, let me urge upon you the paramount importance of industry as a foundation pillar for success and happiness. Squander not a moment. Every fragment of time should be utilized for your improvement. From your description of your present, employment, I should not think it calculated to encourage industrious habits. I have reference to the unseasonable hours of its duration rather than the character of it. However it may be the best you can do at present. A very large part of the day is left you to dispose of in cue way or another. It is in the disposal of this that I am concerned. Your business has one point to recommend it. Obliging you to rise early, the keeping of late hours is prevented. You can use your leisure time to no better advantage than to devote it to reading. Select some good reading matter and establish a taste for reading by every means you cau command. Discard all sensational matter, sr.ch as novels of the yellow covered variety, love stories etc. Such fictitious reading distorts the mind, unfitting it for that of a substantial nature. There is an abundance of good literature, the perusal of which will develop and expand the mind and aid in moulding a respectable and lovable character. Were I to pursue the tenor of my feelings I would counsel you to be particularly careful in your choice of companions. Bad companions and bad books are alike pernicious in their influence. Shun them both as the emissaries of the devil. Let the sphere of your acquaintanceship be small and, select, rather than large and promiscuous. Turn a deaf ear to the pleadings of either internal or external influences to engage in anything which your conscience condemns. Be honest in word and deed. Be economical in your expenditures. No matter how much you earn, spend no more than your necessities require. You cannot begin too soon to save for a 'rainy day.' When you cau and desire to, come and see me and perhaps you will want to live with me. Hoping to hear nothing but good from and of you. I am pleased to subscribe myself, your sincere friend, Arthur Bruce.
