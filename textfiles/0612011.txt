A CHARACTERISTIC PRAYER O, Divine presence, Thou whom we call Godâ€” Oh, angels and ministering spirits! Oh, common instincts of a divine humanity, grant to regenerate badly generated Spiritualists ; grant to revivify and quicken their religious faculties; to expand their selfish natures, and warm their cold stoical hearts with heavenly love, and especially grant, Oh, Immortalized Intelligences, to so touch and inspire the souls of all the stingy, niggardly, pennypinching Spiritualists of the land, that they shall cheerfully open their pocket-books and liberally support such genuine mediums, such trance and inspirational speakers as the heavenly hosts have raised up to demonstrate future existence, to heal the sick, comfort the afflicted, and wipe away the tears from the mourners' eyes. Amen. Thus, our dear, noble, self-sacrificing and ever benevolent Brother, J. M. Peebles, prays for Spiritualists. Are there not some other persuasions that would be benefited by employing his generous spirit to pray for them ? Let us reflect.
