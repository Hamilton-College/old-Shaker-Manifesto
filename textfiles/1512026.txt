Dear Editor; I never read the... Dear editor Hancock, Mass. Oct, 1885. Dear Editor ;�I never read the Manifesto without rendering grateful thanks to all who are taking an active interest in sustaining our good and precious messenger of glad tidings. We know that many dear souls with faithful labors and untiring zeal are consecrating their lives to God. This is manifested by the spirit of God and by the testimonies of truth that come to us from month to month on the pages of our beautiful little Olive Branch. May God and all holy Angels Mess those who have the immediate charge �f the evangelizing work. Your Gospel Sister. H. R. Agnew.
