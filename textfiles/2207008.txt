A CHILD'S HYMN. [Contributed by D. Orcutt.] Six Hundred Years Old. Guard, my child, thy tongue, That it speak no wrong! Let no evil word pass o'er it; Set the watch of truth before it, That it speak no wrong. Guard, my child, thy tongue. Guard, my child, thine eyes; Prying is not wise; Let them look on what is right; From all evil turn their sight; Prying is not wise. Guard, my child, thine eyes. Guard, my child, thine ear; Wicked words will sear; Let no evil word come in That may cause the soul to sin; Wicked words will sear; Guard, my child, thine ear. Ear, and eye and tongue, Guard while tliou art young; For, alas! these busy three Can unruly members be; Guard, while thou art young, Ear, and eye, and tongue.
