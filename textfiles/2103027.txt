DIVINE EXPERIENCE. [Contributed by Marion Patrick.] Master Eckhakd relates: 'I ardently desired for eight years that God in his mercy would send a man to point out the way of truth to me. And as I was one day full of anxious desire, there came a voice from God saying Go to the porch of the church and thou shalt find a man who can show thoe the way of truth. And I went and found a man there who was dusty and foot-sore and clothed in rags. I saluted him and said, uGod give thee a good diiy.' The beggar replied, 'I verily never had a bad day.' Whereupon I said, 'May God give tbee good fortune.' He answered 'I never had bad fortune.' Then I said 'Mayest thou be happy.' To which the beggar replied, 'I am never unhappy.' Thereupon I concluded, 'Ma}7 God bless thee, instruct me in this, for I do not understand.' He replied, 'willingly; thou sayest, may God give me a good day. I replied, I verily never had a bad day. For when I hunger, I praise God, when I am cold, when it hails, snows or rains, be the weather fair or foul I praise God. Am I wretched or despised, I praise God. Therefore I never have a bad day. Thou saye.st, may God give me good fortune, and J tell thee I never have bad fortune, for I know to live with God, and know whatsoever He does is for the best, and what God gives unto me, or has destined for me, be it weal or woe, bitter or sweet, I accept joyfully from God as the very best thing, therefore I never have bad fortune. Thou sayest also God make me happy, and I tell thee I am never unhappy, for I desire only to be united with God's will, and I have thus wholly reconciled my own will for God's will, that whatsoever God wills I will, therefore I am never unhappy, for I desire only to be at one with God's will, and I have utterly surrendered my will to his will.' Whereupon I demanded of the man, should God cast thee into hell what wouldst thou say then! He replied, 'cast me into hell? If he were to cast me into hell I have two arms to clasp Him. One arm is true humility, that I place beneath Him and therewith I am united with his holy humanity, and with the right arm of love thereby I am united with his holy divinity and embrace Him that He needs must go with me into hell. Therefore I would rather be in hell having God than I would be in heaven without God.' 'Thereupon I understood' says Eckhard, 'that true tranquility with true humility, is the direct way to God.' I demanded further of the man 'Whence art thou?' He answered, 'from God ;' I questioned, 'Where hast thou found God?' He replied, 'as I left all creatures.' I asked, 'Where hast thou left God?' 'In the pure heart and in the good-willed man.' Again I questioned, 'What art thou?' He said, 'I am a king.' 'Where is thy kingdom ?' 'That is in my soul, for I can thus control my internal and external senses, that all my desires and soul forces fully obey me. And this realm is far greater than any kingdom on earth.' I asked, 'Then what has brought thee to such perfection ?' and he replied, 'It was done by my silence, my exalted thoughts and my union with God. For I could no more rest in anything that was less than God. Now I have found God, and have rest and peace forever in God.'ï¿½ Mysteries of the Ages.
