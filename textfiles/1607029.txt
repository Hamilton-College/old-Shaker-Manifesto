POLITENESS. Tins subject should be well considered by the young. The habits we now form will be ours in riper years. If they are refined and polite they will be to our credit, if coarse and impolite to our discredit. Thus it is of importance that we strive to cultivate ourselves and have our manners such that we can always practice them whether at home or abroad. It is doubtless the case that most persons habitually practice some forms of manners at home that they would not abroad, but I think it should not be so. We can reflect and see what our impressions are of those who are coarse, rough and awkward in their manners and address. I do not believe in an affected way of politeness, but graceful and lovely ways without affectation. I consider politeness nothing more or less than good manners. Let us all therefore study to know what true politeness is, and practice one set of manners at home and abroad. I. B. L.
