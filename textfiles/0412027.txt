OUR SPHERE Labor is the sphere assigned us, And our time we will employ, That a harvest we may gather. Yielding peace and endless joy. In the light that's ever dawning, We will toil with fervent will, With the loved and faithful number, Who the law of truth fulfill. While we're young our souls will gather To our kindred pure and true, And with holiness of purpose, Seek the inner realm to view. Upward to the sphere of angels Shall our aspirations tend, Where the power of love can reach us, Where our hearts with good can blend. And along life's daily pathway, We will cull celestial flowers, Bind them with the cords of virtue, Found within fair Zion's bowers. 'Round our hearts we will entwine them. Till there is no room for wrong, Till our souls can join the chorus Of the victors' happy song. While we rise on faith's strong pinions, From earth's elements away, Where no blight nor sin can tarnish, Where no treasure fades away. What though adverse clouds may lower, Beams of hope our course will light, Till they guide us to the portals, Far beyond the shades of night. Mary C. Barnum, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
