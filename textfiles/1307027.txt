LIVER COMPLAINT For your torpid liver go without grease in your food, bathe your skin every morning on rising and follow the bathing with sharp friction with the roughest towel, and, if you can bear it, with a flesh-brush also. Beating the body in the region of the liver with the flat of the hand or with the fist is excellent. General gymnastic exercises are always advisable in what is known as liver complaint. Attacks of bilious colic would be prevented, I believe, by a little care in eating. I think an avoidance of all desserts, and eating but two meals a day, the last one somewhere in the middle of the day, would prevent all return of the trouble.-â€”Dio Lewis.
