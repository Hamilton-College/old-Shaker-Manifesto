FAITH. By Sarah J. Burger. Bright star that lights the firmament of thought, Sending a genial warmth through the deep blue, The golden arch-way where each pilgrim true Must pause to know the wonders God hath wrought, Must learn the glad refrain by angels taught, The song so sweet which as the morning dew Ascends through all our life with rapture new; The culmination which all souls have sought, Oh, light divine that gleams through sun and shade May thy bright beams pierce through the veil of care, And bring a hope for sacrifices made For those who trust and suffer, do and dare, When death shall close the evening of life's day Be thou the guide to light their upward way. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. dThis
