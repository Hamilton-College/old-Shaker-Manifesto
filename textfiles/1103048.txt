FEAR OF DISEASE It is said that while the plague was raging in Buenos Ayres, the grave-diggers bore charmed lives. Of the three hundred men so employed, not one died of the disease. It has often been noticed that during the prevalence of pestilential diseases, physicians, undertakers, nurses, and grave-diggers, whose business compelled constant liability to infection, have usually escaped in a far greater ratio than their numbers would warrant. The 'charm' of this immunity from the prevailing scourge is very simple. They are not scared. They are positive to the disease, and repel its attacks. Fear is a great ally of death. Whoever is afraid of disease is in a negative condition and really invites its approach. And thus it is the world over. The brave die but once, while cowards die many times. Much unnecessary alarm exists in every community in regard to many diseases. We are, it is true, all liable to sickness and death. But if we are all sober, cleanly, and brave of heart, we need have no fear of disease of body or mind.
