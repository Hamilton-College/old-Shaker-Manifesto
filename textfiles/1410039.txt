THE BEATTY ORGAN AND PIANO CO. A n'ondi-rl'ul .I*u.�i�ii�&gt;*.� Ot�-ji� enat�*cl and S:�.�;jl�li�li��l. From Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. The name of Daniel F. Beatty, of Washington, New Jersey, is tolerably well known to the majority of the people of the United States in connection with the manufacture and sale of musical instruments. By liberal and wide-spread advertising, and by dealing direct with the purchaser, he built up a most extensive business in organs and piaiios. It was his ambition to erect and own the largest organ factory in the world, and he succeeded! in so doing. Bin: the hindrances and losses incident to a disastrous fire in 1881, and the want of adequate capital, combined with a lack of business method, led to a serious entanglement in his affairs. Although he made and sold over seventeen thousand (17,000) organs last year, his embarrassments, which dated their origin years before, became so serious that he finally sold his business to a corporation composed of his creditors. It is understood that this company, with ample capital, has undertaken to make good as far as possible all the obligations of Mr. Beatty, giving preference to the purchasers of organsand pianos whose goods arc still undelivered and to whom it is shipping daily their instruments. The company is under the presidency of Mr. I. W. England, of ISew York, his manager being Mr. W. 1'. Hadwen; and the gentlemen composing the directors and stockholders are among the best known and most responsible business men in the country. All new orders, we, are assured, are filled on receipt with instruments of the best quality; while arrearages arebeing manufactured and shipped at the i ate f not less than 100 a week. On such a, basis, supplying a superior article at a moderate price, free of agent's commissions, the new c &gt;ncern ought to achieve a great sue..'ess.
