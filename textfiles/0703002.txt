Gifts ALONZO G. HOLLISTER gratification of the animal passions ?| Forsaken willingly the ways of death? The greatest spiritual gifts make the least external show. 'Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' That kingdom which is to break in pieces and subdue all other kingdoms, and become a great mountain and fill the whole earth, cometh not with outward show, and will never be seen by material eyes. A gift to see ourselves in that light of God which is brought by the messengers of Christ, who are sent to reap the world, is the greatest gift of vision. A gift of faith in the anointing power with which Christ clothes his true messengers, and in the gospel light and testimony which they bring, confers a greater power than that which moves material substances without the contact of visible hands. A gift which liberates and purifie the soul from sin and sinful desires i the greatest gift of freedom. A gift that removes all spiritual diseases and all soul blemishes and imperfections, and restores access to the tree of life, is the greatest gift of healing. A gift to keep all the commandment of God revealed in the everlasting gospel of Christ is the greatest gift of power. Therefore, beloved doers of the work, let us covet the best gifts. For every good and every perfect gift cometh down from above, from the Father of light, with whom there is no variableness, neither shade of turning. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
