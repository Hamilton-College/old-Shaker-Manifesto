Editor Manifesto;--It is Christmas evening... Cekno Island, Mexico. Dec. 25, 1895. Editor Manifesto ;It is Christmas evening and I want to give a happy greeting to all the faithful workers and readers of The Manifesto. Although many thousand miles divide us we are one in spirit. I would like to say to all the Brothers and Sisters just a word. In 1854, it was predicted, when the ranks were well tilled, that man}' of them would be sent out into the world to spread the gospel. The word' was,-Do not think of them as wanderers but as your missionary workers. Even though some make mistakes it is better to be illy spoken of than not at all. When I was quite a young girl, I stepped into the railroad station to wait for the train for Troy, N. Y. There was a woman there sewing over and over and I remarked how rapidly she did it and she answered, 'Oh yes I learned to do this at the Shakers.' I asked her about them and her answer was, 'their belief is all right, but they do not all live up to it.' I could not believe what she told me so I wrent to try it myself and found that the wrong was within herself and not with the Shakers. I believe the time is not far distant when the fruit will be gathered home to Zion from the seeds that have been scattered. I feel that there is a great and mighty power working in the world for good although it seems like an age of disbelief and I believe that Mother's gospel will spread over the land. I, for one, will do what little I can to live according to the teaching of the gospel, precept and example. I never miss an opportunity of spreading the teachings of the gospel. Your Sister, Cornelia R. Powers.
