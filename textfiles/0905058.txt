Agricultural Carding Cattle ' Whilst horses are carefully groomed and brushed,' says the London Agricultural Gazette, ' cattle are entirely neglected; and in such a state they cannot thrive or do as well as they would in a state of cleanliness. Look at a lot of cattle when released from their bonds, and they find a rubbing post, or, when they approach each other, and in bucolic language say: ' Lick me and I'll lick you. The offer is seldom declined. When they are bound their efforts to get something to rub against and allay the itching are something pitiable to see. I remember the case of a bull which, for some time, would not permit me to approach him in his stall. Beginning with a rub and a scratch on the rump, I at each visit extended the scratching, and now if I omit the operation he shows unmistakably his disapprobation.

Keep Them Clean The Maryland Farmer (Baltimore) reminds farmers that ' a good rubbing, brushing and cleaning of the hair of cattle, horses and even hogs is equal to or better than a hearty meal. Keep all stock free from dirt and filth. Rub or wash off all mud from horses' legs before going into the stable for the night. Keep the cattle dry and free from the mire and muck of the barnyard. To do this the yard should be well littered, and thereby the manure-pile will accumulate.'
