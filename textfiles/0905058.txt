Keep Them Clean The Maryland Farmer (Baltimore) reminds farmers that ' a good rubbing, brushing and cleaning of the hair of cattle, horses and even hogs is equal to or better than a hearty meal. Keep all stock free from dirt and filth. Rub or wash off all mud from horses' legs before going into the stable for the night. Keep the cattle dry and free from the mire and muck of the barnyard. To do this the yard should be well littered, and thereby the manure-pile will accumulate.'
