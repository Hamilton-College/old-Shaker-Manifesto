DAY AND NIGHT. Lydia Staples. One mass of gems the arching dome, One mellow twilight way, A burst of morn's effulgent light, And night is lost in day. The lengthening shadows circle round, The sunbeams slide from sight, Far westward spreads a lake of gold, And day is lost in night. An opening budï¿½a full blown rose, The sands of life are run; Death clasps time and eternity, And day and night are one. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
