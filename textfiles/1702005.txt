CHRISTIAN VIRTUES. SARAH J. BURGER. Truth to the heart in love reveals The way from error's night, And gilds the life with noble deeds, Cho'ice gems of heavenly light. Hope lifts the curtain of the mind, Till virtue's dawn is seen; Her glow is like the morning sun Upon the meadows green. Love is the light-house to the soul, 'Lumed with the lamp of Peace, Where joy and lasting happiness Bid gloom and sorrow cease. Mercy her purple clusters yield A harvest rich and rare, Inviting souls to drink the wine Of life abounding there. Humility where art thou found? Close by some lowly stream, Where fancy ne'er would hie for rest, Or cast a shadowy dream. And Meekness by her side is found, With Charity and Prayer, And these combined will stay the hand Of sordid want and care. Uniting these with Faith and works, What noble gifts appear Wkhin the temple of the soul, Ripe fruit of toiling years ; And cherished in the heart for good, They'll bear the victor's palm, While angel joy shall flood the soul, And heaven's holy calm.
