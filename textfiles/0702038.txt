Drying-off Cows Cows cannot be dried of their milk at once, and some cows continue to secrete milk in small quantities for a long time. But in all cases where the animal has ceased to give milk, or is what is termed ' dry,' she should have her udder examined from time to time, and the teats tried, to see if any milk can be drawn. At first the trial should be made at intervals of two or three days, and if there is a particle of milk in the bag it should be all thoroughly drawn. Then the trial may be made at longer intervals. When cows are supposed to be completely dry, the rule should be to go through lie herd every week, making trial of the teats to see if any milk can be drawn. And this work cannot safely be intrusted to 'hired help,' but must be performed under the ' eye of the master.' Many persons are not aware of the importance of drying cows, and hired help often think it a piece of folly to try to draw milk from a dry cow. Many have lost the use of valuable cows by intrusting this to persons in their employ, and there is scarcely a dairyman in New York who cannot trace trouble in his herd to either his own neglect or that of others. Indeed, so large is the loss every year from improperly drying cows, that there is scarcely a subject connected with dairy management of more vital importance than this. We urge it, therefore, upon the attention of dairymen, and we say to them : Be sure that the work is done properlyâ€”trust no eye but your own, and when your herd comes in milk next spring you will realize the value of this advice.
