PARABLES. SIMON MABEE. Jesus many times in his day, spoke to the people in parables. When his disciples asked him why he did so, he answered ; '' To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them that are without, it is not given.' Doubtless there were other reasons, but this is sufficient for our present purpose. Jesus explained some of them, and some were left to be explained at his Second Appearing ; of the latter class is the following. He said: 'The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened. ' Part of a loaf of bread leavened and part of it unleavened would render it unfit for use. The meal represented the people that were prepared to receive the leaven, which was the word of God, to be administered to the world by a woman. Mother Ann, and all who received the leaven or word which she spoke, became one in the spirit of love, and one in interest, and purposeï¿½and they all unite in supporting the testimony of Jesus and Ann. If it was right for the Apostles to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven in that day, why not for those who in this day are strictly living up to Christ and Mother's testimony. The requirements being the same, those who fulfill them by perfect obedience must be entitled to the same blessings. Hancock, Mass.
