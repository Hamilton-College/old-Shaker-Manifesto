PRESENTED ON A CARD IN FORM OF A HEART I'll write upon my heart the words Of chastity and love, And gather home, unto their strength, The 'pure, white-breasted Dove.' 'T is this shall be my golden theme, To strengthen all my toil: To weaken every act of sin That round Its life would coil. The fire of purity and truth Shall glow with radiance there, And stir anew the life of faith To consecrated care. And, when the angel fingers touch The golden chords of love, The sweetest notes within my heart Shall thrill with theirs above. Through holy efforts, thus I'll form A resting place for truth, And grow into the life of God, In everlasting youth. This is my off'ring, simple, true, An emblem of a heart ; And every promise traced thereon Shall strength to me impart. Charlotte Byrdsall
