SPIRIT OF THE FARM Tomatoes versus Insects A correspondent of the Rural New Yorker says : ' Set a tomato plant into each hill of cucumbers, melons and squashes, and you will have no trouble from the striped bugs that are so destructive to these plants.

A few dried quinces improves its flavor. Sarah A. Van Wyck
