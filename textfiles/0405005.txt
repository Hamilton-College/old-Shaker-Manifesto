HARVEST HOME Then gather up the useless tares, Convicting Angels bind, And cast them in the Gospel fire, And thus release your mind. For now the reaping time has come, And Angels shout the Harvest Home. Now if this work you truly do. And are indeed sincere, Then Gospel peace will freely flow, And you will have good cheer. For now the reaping time has come, And Angels shout the Harvest Home. F. Vam, Watervliet, O.
