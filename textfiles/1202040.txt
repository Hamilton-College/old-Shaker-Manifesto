BAREFOOTED HORSES The question of driving horses barefoot is being seriously agitated in England, and the papers call upon some public-spirited horse-owner to try comparative experiments of the ordinary plan of driving nails into the living substance of the horse's hoof, of the Charlier method of using clamps, and, lastly, of the hoof in natural condition. That iron shoes have been so long used does not necessarily prove them to be indispensable, more than in the case of blinders, without which the last generation scarcely ventured to drive at all. To be sure the weight of experience and custom entitle the existing practice to the benefit of the doubt; but the matter is of sufficient importance to be worth investigating, and it might not inaptly come under the attention of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.â€”Our Dumb Animals.
