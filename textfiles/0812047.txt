Why The World Hates Christians It is an utter delusion to suppose that there is any innate response to the perfect moral purity, or any innate admiration of ' 'the true, the pure, the just, the kind, the good, and the beautiful,' in the heart of man. God gave man, 1,800 years ago, a perfect pattern of purity, truth, and love, in the person of our Lord while he was upon earth. And yet we are told he was 'hated.' True Christians must never be surprised if they are 'hated' like their Lord. 'The disciple is not above his Master.'â€”'Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.' (Matt. x. 24; John iii. 13.) In fact, the more like Christ they are, the more likely to be 'hated.' Moreover, they must not be cast down, and make themselves miserable, under the idea that it is their inconsistencies the world hates, and that if they were more consistent and lovely in life, the world would like them better. This is a complete mistake, and a common delusion of the devil. What the world hates about Christians is neither their doctrines nor their faults, but their holy lives. Their lives are a constant testimony against the world, which makes the men of the world feel uncomfortable, and therefore the world hates them. Let us note, that unpopularity among men is no proof that a Christian is wrong, either in faith or practice. The common notion of many, that it is a good sign of a person's character to be well-spoken of by everybody, is a great error. When we ^see how our Lord was regarded by the wicked and worldly of His day, we may well conclude that it is a very poor compliment to be told that we are liked by everybody. Montreal Star.
