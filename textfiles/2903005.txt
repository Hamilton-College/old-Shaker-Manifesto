KIND REMEMBRANCE. By Andrew D. Barrett. AN atmosphere of love promotes harmony and favors health of body and mind. It fills the soul with peace ; it encourages every ennobling function ; it carries with it the dignity, gentleness and refinement of true culture. In the ebb and flow of the ever moving tide we see a lesson of human life . We see that love must be the magnet in winning souls to God. When the soul is so filled with love that it can go out to help the needy, it has reached a degree of true culture far more exalting than all intellectual training. These thoughts have been pressed upon my mind on hearing of the demise of our beloved Eldress Joanna J. Kahne. As I was a resident of Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., for some twenty-five years I became acquainted with Eldress Joanna, as she quite frequently visited that Society in the capacity of a minister. Her Christian kindness made a permanent impression on my mind, and increased my love toward goodness and truth. Now the voice says, Go and do likewise. Olive Branch, Fla.
