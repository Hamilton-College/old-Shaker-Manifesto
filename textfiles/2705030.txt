The Ladies' Home Journal Ex-President Harrison, whose articles in The Ladies' Home Journal are creating such widespread interest, will write about 'The Social Life of the President,' in the April issue of that magazine. The ex-President will tell of the dinners, receptions etc., that are given by the Chief Executive, and detail the great social demands made upon him. He gives a peep into the White House dining room and silver closet, and notes the beauty of the service used for State dinners, which was bought at second hand. It is said that he also pays heed to the oft-repeated question, 'How much of his salary can a President lay aside?'
