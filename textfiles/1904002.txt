A THOUGHT. M. J. Tatterton. If the soul of man is to live throughout the enduring ages of eternity, does it not become us at all times, while making our record here, to so live in harmony with the powers of good that when we shall have passed to the higher sphere of existence, ours shall not be a page of regrets to review ? The subject is indeed a vital one and may the time be not far distant when mankind guided by higher intelligences shall rise above earthly, sensual appetites, and even while clothed with mortality, merit the blessing of Divine love. Then indeed man will become a law unto himself and be prepared to continue in the other sphere, the higher life, so wisely commenced in t! is. Guided by the truth that, 'Time is eteruity begun, how carefully should the Christian live, that the introductory pages of Life's Volume, be such as will give satisfaction in the Land beyond.
