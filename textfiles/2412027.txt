The Bible Defended The Bible Defended, by R. 8; Webber, is a work of 339 pages, and the author has thrown his whole soul into this great subject. Possibly he fears the influence that may be circulated by that class -who have written or spoken against this time-honored book,the Bible. In ,his work the author makes an extended review of Thomas Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and of Col. Ingersoll's 'Mistakes of Moses.' It is wonderfully interesting and Christians and Infidels will take pleasure in its perusal, and we are assured that the reader who reaches the end of th&amp;first page will be quite likely to keep fellowship with the book till he closes with the 339th page.
