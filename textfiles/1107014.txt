THE REVISION We are glad our remarks in June No. concerning the revision of the New Testament are having such a far and wide consideration. Our article upon that question — righteous revising or otherwise— is having the desired effect. The general opinion is that the revision will work detrimentally to the commonly paid, idolatry toward the Bible. That detriment will work but very little permanent harm. It will hasten the day when men and women will learn, that Testament or no Testament, the life of Christ, and THOSE WHO FOLLOW IT CLOSELY*, ARE THE BEST TESTAMENT BEFORE THE WORLD.
