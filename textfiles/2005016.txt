Editorial. In the presentation of our religious views... In the presentation of our religious views, and the order of life which the acceptance of those views has wrought out, we think we are doing only our reasonable duty. As God has blessed us in the choice manifestation of his holy spirit to see a 'better way' by which we may, as his children, accomplish more good upon the earth by living in harmony with this revealed light, our duty is clearly set forth. The simplicity of religion becomes, at once, the beauty of religion, and presents that spiritual adorning which one may honorably covet, and to obtain it may with propriety 'sell all' and purchase the treasure, which moth and rust cannot corrupt. We need not enter into controversy upon the right way or even the best way to maintain a relation with God, or upon what may or may not belong to the Christian church. A satisfactory solution to the point in question would be very difficult to reach if sought for in this manner, as it is quite likely to open those 'gates' tlirough which even the worldly-wise would not elect to pass. Do we think that those are condemned who do not choose to accept our religious belief? It is not our province to condemn anyone. Condemnation arises from neglect of duty. If God gives us light that we may walk more uprightly, that we may have a better government over our language, or that we may be better able to help the erring, we must fall under the condemnation of our own conscience if we fail to accept God's gift and use it to our best advantage. In this as in everything that pertains to this life, we must have time to learn, righteousness does not fly tlirough the air as does the pappus of the thistle in mid-summer, it is something to be wrought out in the life. It was a special mission of the prophet to his people, as he would save them from falling into wrong, to urge them to 'learn to do well,' and an essential preliminary step to this commendable condition was to 'cease to do evil.' Those who do not accept and live to their highest possibilities as representatives of moral attainment are quite unworthy of the name of man, and must be placed in that class to whom Jesus referred when he said they are 'condemned already.' It may be very commendable to regard the advice of Paul as he says, 'ï¿½Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind,' and 'Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not. Rom., xiv. The same rule is quite as applicable to those who think they have a possession a a phase of religious truth. If they are fully persuaded that it is of God and that it is leading them from wrong to right, it is certainly worthy of their whole interest and care. Are we saved ? A person is saved only so far as he enters into the life of Christ. An essential test was given to the disciples, 'If ye love me ye will keep my commandments,' and the willing obedience in keeping these commandments, determines, at once, how much one is saved from the sins of the world, from the sins of his own life, and the course that must be adopted in order to secure the promised inheritance. To talk of salvation before one has even turned his face toward the Kingdom of God is quite like those who cried, Lord, Lord, and for that amount of outward demonstration, anticipated a reward in the Kingdom of God.
