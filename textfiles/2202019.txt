Shirley, Mass. Jan. 1892. Beloved Eldek Hesry:Well, there are still a few souls striving to keep alive to the duties incumbent upon them, not for their own sakes alone, not from the hope of reward that will surely result from the faithful adherance to those duties ; but rather that the gospel testimony be kept before the people; that faith fully lived out in daily life is a panacea for very many, if not all, the ills of which we hear so much said outside, Socialists, Nationalists, Knights of Labor and others. Truly many are called but few are chosen, or are willing to choose for themselves the 'self-denying way,' which yields so much in return of peace and inward justification. The year that has just passed out has been marked by much temporal blessing and bountiful crops. Steam has just been introduced into our laundry which will materially reduce the burdens of the Sisterhood. Large additions of new fence have been made. Further improvements of stock provided for. Seemingly what is most needed is a greater appreciation of the good we have by those now here, and of honest faithful souls to assist, who are willing to put their hands to work and their hearts to God. J. W.
