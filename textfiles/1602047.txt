Elder Peter II. Long, Dec. 21), 1885, at Groveland, N. Y. Age 6!) yrs. 7 mo. and 13 days. Euth Darrow, Jan. 2, at Union Village, Ohio. Age 79 yrs. 2 mo. and 25 days. She united with Believers Mar. 27, 1821and for twenty-five years has led a pure virgin life, and has always been an orderly, faithful and good sister. She was very industrious with her hands and entirely unselfish. One beautiful trait of her character was particular attention and kindness to any one young or old whom she thought likely to be slighted in any way. She was able to be about her usual employment till within a very few days previous to her departure, and has left a stainless and beautiful career for us who remain, to walk in and copy after. Her funeral was well attended and many good and comforting exhortations and solemn admonitions were delivered by divers of the Brethren and Sisters. O. C. H.
