[The following reasonings, by our revered Elder Evans, are ideas peculiar to him, and with all the truths they may contain, are not yet the accepted ideas of the leading authorities of Shakerdom, It may be that we have not yet sufficiently progressed to make their adoption orthodox, but at present, but little is known amongusof a Christ sphere or heavens; nor of the pre-existence of Christ; nor whether there are three, seven or eleven heavens ; nor of tutelary divinities forthis or other worlds. We therefore present the Elder's opinions that any who choose to adopt them may do so, while we are still content to find a sufficiency of theological food in the simplicity of Jesus' life and testimony.] Ed.
