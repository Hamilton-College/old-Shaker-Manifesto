NEEDY BUT BELIEVING. MARIA WITHAM. Weak and helpless, yet believing, In the living power of God, Poor and needy yet receiving, From the promises of God. Weak and helpless, yet relying, On the arm none can withstand ; Poor and needy, yet supplying, All my wants from His full hand. Faint and weary, yet pursuing, Still the promis'd boon of rest; Fill'd with hope I now am longing, For a union with the blest. Sometimes weary, yet unwilling, In the Christian race to fail; Here would ever be fulfilling; Duties crown'd within the vail. Enfield, Conn.
