How to Cook Potatoes .—There are two ways of boiling potatoes — both are good. The first fashion is to put them into well salted cold water : having let them boil until they are nearly done, pour off nearly all the water, set them back on the fire, cover, and let them steam until thoroughly done. Take off the cover, and let them stay a moment or two to evaporate the moisture. The other way is to drop the potatoes into enough boiling water to cover them, and as soon as they are done pour off the water entirely and put back on the range to evaporate the moisture ; put the cover on the ket tie so that about a quarter of the mouth is left open to the air. When boiled in their skins a tiny piece should be cut from the end of each potato. They must boil from thirty to thirty-five minutes. Always select potatoes as nearly of a size as possibe. New potatoes, with delicate skins, should not be pared for boiling. Take a sharp, thin knife and scrape off the skins. In the country new potatoes, just brought in from the garden, do not even need scraping; a few smart turns with a rough-textured cloth take off the' fine skin in a twinkling. But the dwellers in towns don't get these ideal pota. toes. For perfect mashed potatoes, pare and boil them as above, and after every trace of the water has evaporated, mash them with your pestal still in the kettle over the fire; they are naught if not kept hot. Get out every suggestion of a lump, and as you mash put in a generous qnantity of fresh butter, and, if you have it, some cream — if not cream, enough milk to make the potato rich and moist. Salt it to taste, and serve fresh and hot piled up and smoothed over in a hot dish with a little black pepper sifted on top. Mashed potato which has stood on the stove for a while before serving is poor stuff. If you want the top brown, hold over it a salamander or a very hot stove lid — don't push the dish into the oven ; that only makes the contents watery.—Exchange.
