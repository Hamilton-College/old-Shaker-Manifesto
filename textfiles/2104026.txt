A LITTLE STORY WITH A LARGE MORAL. [Contributed by I. Anstatt.] It is an old story, and, as it can possibly have no local application, this is a good time to retell it. It is told of the famous author of the famous tract entitled 'Come to Jesus,' who was something of a controversialist as well as eloquent pleader for souls. He was at one time engaged in a theological dispute with some reverend opponent, and grew more than usually heated during the controversy. At last he sat down and wrote an answer to some publication of his opponent's, an answer bristling with sarcasm and invective, an answer sharp and cutting as a razor, an answer he felt sure his opponent would wince under as if he had received a succession of rapier thrusts. Reading it to a friend before sending it for publication he asked: 'What do you think of it?' 'It is a masterpiece of invective,' was the reply. 'You fairly flay him alive. By the way, what have you decided to call it?' 'I have not thought of a title,' answered the clergyman. 'Can you suggest one?' 'Well,' came the response, slowly and thoughtfully, 'how would it do to call it, 'Go to the Devil, by the author of Come to Jesus?''' That was all. The biting and sarcastic and cutting invective went into the fire; it was never even offered to a publisher. Norwich Bulletin.
