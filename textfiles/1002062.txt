Seven Bibles of the World The are the Koran of the Mohammedans, the Eddas of the Scandinavians, the Try Pitikes of the Buddhists, the five Kings of the Chinese, the three Vedas of the Hindoos, the Zendavesta, and the Scriptures of the Christians. The Koran is the most recent of these seven Bibles, and not older than the seventh century of our era. It is a compound of quotations from the Old and New Testaments, the Talmud and the Gospel of St. Barnabas The Eddas of the Scandinavians were first published in the fourteenth century. The Pitikes of the Buddhists contain sublime morals and pure aspirations, but their author lived and died in the sixth century before Christ. The sacred writings of the Chinese are called the five Kings, king meaning web of cloth, or the warp that keeps the threads in their place. They contain the best sayings of the best sages on the ethico-political duties of life. These sayings cannot be traced to a period higher than the eleventh century B. C. The three Vedas are the most ancient books of the Hindoos, and it is the opinion of Max Muller, Wilson, Johnson, and our own Whitney, that they are not older than eleven centuries B. C. The Zendavesta of the Persians is the grandest of all the sacred books next to our Bible. Zoroaster, whose sayings it contains, was born in Bactria in the twelfth century B. C. Moses lived and wrote his Pentateuch, fifteen centuries B. C., and therefore has a clear margin of three hundred years older than the most ancient of the other sacred writings.â€”Age to Gome.
