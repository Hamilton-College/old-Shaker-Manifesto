STARTLING TRUTHS Words of Faith, a lovely little paper, published monthly in Philadelphia, is doing a grand work by insisting that professors and followers of Christ ought to live sinless, as did Christ. As a specimen of its teachings, and which teaching ought to awaken the Christian professor to his or her proper senses, we quote the following : If man who is a sincere Christian, and who believes that God has washed away his sins, sings these lines : ' I am all unrighteousness, False and full of sin I am,' does he not thereby call in question the purifying work of the Spirit in his heart, and rank himself with the vilest of sinners? If the confessions which we hear from many Christians are true, if they are as great sinners as they say they are, if they are really guilty of the wickedness which they say they are guilty of, they ought neither to profess the Christian name nor make any pretensions to religion. Sin and holiness are directly contrary to each other. There is no blending of the two things, no agreement between the two states. If a man is sinning daily, he is not a holy man ; if a man is holy he is not daily sinning. The piety, devotion and usefulness of the church are injured by their untruthful confessions of sin. They are imperceptibly and unconsciously led to think less of the work of Christ than they ought to do ; they give encouragement to world-loving professors to think less of the evil of sin, by making the impression that religion consists in a great degree in daily confession of deprav. ity and vileness ; and they also encourage some of little or-no piety to join the church.
