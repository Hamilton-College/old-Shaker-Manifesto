Respected friend Charles Law; Your acceptable favor... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. May, 1884. Respected Fulexd Charles Law ;� Your acceptable favor of the 18th, came duly. The collision which involved your lamented Friend Bain, is one of the most terrible on record. By his selfpossession, and self-sacrifice, he is already a historical character. No doubt in the unseen world he will be met by friends who will do him honor. On his visit here, with yourself, he impressed me that there was force in him. Should he turn to the right or to the left, something would be done. Under that impression, I spoke a few words to him. A visit from yourself, will be very acceptable. With this 1 will mail a Number of our paper. It contains an article 'Eternal Life.' Our young friend Bain, is gone ; by and by, it will be said of us, ' gone too. ' Life is an invisible force. Force, is eternal, and also invisible. Even steam is, till it becomes vapor. All creative forces are invisible. Our own persDuality is also so. The steam engine is the creation of the unseen man. It can do a thousand fold more work, and with greater precision than can the animal who is said to be the person who made it. The real personality of man is like his Creator. Indeed all the forces of life are invisible. The Strawberry for instance ; there is in it a living invisible force, commissioned by i',s Creator to manipulate the inorganic elements to suit its own wants, as does the Cocoauut tree. Why is a Cocoanut not a Strawberry ? The answer is ; Why is an apple parer not a locomotive�They are the products of unseen intelligent personalities ; causing these plants, and ma- chines, to accomplish special designs and to meet specific conditions. The sphere of thought, of man's invisible personality, widens as he thinks when unlimited by earthly conditions, the possibilities involved in his destiny are beyond comprehension. Therefore, to die, is to live. The article alluded to, is based upon, 'The Problem of Individual Life.' the last chapter of that wonderful book, 'Poverty and Progress. ' It is a Revelation. And like all other :evelations, it appeared when most needed. I feel assured that the Author, has been led on and supported by unseen intelligencies, to justify the ways of God to man, and to upset the materialistic theories of modern political economists. Desiring that a just civilization may supersede the one we now have�of force and fraud ; and that a divine Order of human society may find shelter under its wings. I have the happiness to be, respectfully, your friend, D. Fraser.
