TRIBUTE to Eldress BETSEY SMITH. By Nancy L. Rupe. A Mother in Israel hath flown from our midst, A star of effulgence and grace; [wore, For over four score Christ's mantle she Thus found in the kingdom a place. Her peerless example and trials, untold, Are found in the great Book of Life. With charity crowrned she ever was found A pure, valliant soul in the strife. When war did rage and darkness prevailed She stood as a pillar of light; She silenced the foe by love, at a blow, Who sought our fair Zion to blight. Horrid our feelings when soldiers rusht in By hundreds, by fifties, by scores; [pride She was our safe guide, our pilot and We felt in her counsel secure. We firmly united, an innocent band, So helpless against this great foe, But trusting in prayer, the angels were near To seal our protection, we know. [true With such a brave Mother and comrades We faced every danger; and when [store The conflict was o'er, scant baskets and The Lord soon replenisht again. Sad recollection! Depart from our minds, We're musing on themes more sublime, Our Mother, our friend has past from our sphere, No more shall we meet her in time. Pray come from that mystical, fathomless realm And tell us of dear kindred, there; Do they talk, act and move,ï¿½Is hatred and love The same as in this mundane sphere? Pleasant Hill, Ky.
