WATCH AND PRAY. ELSIE B. YORK 'Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation.' Jesus said this to his disciples, -when he found them sleeping. If this injunction of our Savior was regarded more than it is, there would be less sin in the world ; tor in our own strength we can do little or nothing. We need to pray to a higher power, and watch ourselves in order to guard against wrong. It is supposed that all Christians pray, but do we pray sincerely and earnestly r Kneeling for prayer in a custom in all Christian countries, but form and custom avail nothing if the soul is not there. We should pray in joy as well as in sorrow, and really regard the injunction to 'Pray without ceasing.' When engaged in our secular duties, we should remember the counsel of Mother Ann Lee 'Hands at work and hearts to God.' Canterbury, N. H.
