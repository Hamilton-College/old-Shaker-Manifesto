Mt. Lebanon F. W. EVANS Lebanon-its beauty is incomparable; sunshine, in its pristine glory; air and water fresh and sweet; landscape varied and extensive ; valleys, mountains arid little hills in every direction; vegetation, from the forest to the flower, in full uniform: orchards and gardens and meadows, with abundance of scattering fruit-trees of choice variety: ever greens, berry-bushes, and white willow around ponds and beside the water-brooks go to make up the pleasing diversity of OUR home, in its outward external aspect. The plagues of Egypt are known only by hear-say mosquitoes, flies, gnats, poisonous serpents, and injurious plants are the exceptions and not the rule. Health a good, sickness an evil. Of the moral virtues and spiritual privileges--the gifts from above and the grace: from beneath-that adorn our holy Mount they are innumerable. as seen by the pure of heart. Is not all this good, these beautie and blessings-this God manifested in humanity a beginning of heaven upon earth: When all the thorns and briars-the vice: and vile passions of human beings- are eradicated, and all thought is in the light; who shall bear the glory ?
