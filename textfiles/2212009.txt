CHRISTMAS GREETING. Anna B. Goepper. 'Unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, and his name shall be calledThe Prince of Peace.' Thrice hail Merry Christmas ! Another year is before us. Grant that I may begin this New Year with new resolutions, and if through infidelity or negligence I forget these good purposes, may my guardian angel awaken in me a sense of my danger. I thank Thee, Father, for the gift of life though life at most bringeth less mirth than sorrow, less rest than labor. Dear Lord, I strike the chord of praise and thanks for all thy fair works ! To me it is joy to listen from trembling throats the silvery notes of the little birds and to see the sunshine on the green earth. I thank Thee, Lord, for joys that have been mine, sunbeams that have pierced through clouds, flinging a mellow radiance over my path ; sweet fragrant flowers twining around my cross, making the burden less wearisome. I thank Thee for my sorrows, tooshadows that over my life have fallen and for the heart wounds. I might grow weary of a waveless sea, yet Lord I would be comforted, with tears unshed my eyes are dim, voices that now are silent, in other days were wont to join me in the family prayer. Of the promise of the rest that is to be and for the hope of death I am thankful. When my tired feet falter it singe th in my soul like a fragrant breath coming from cool shady groves. Teach me to question not, but thankful be while my life's years come and go, for life and death, for joy and sorrow. 'O bells! sweet bells of Christmas! King out your gladsome mirth! King peace to sad hearts burdened Ring joy to all the earth!' Union Village, Ohio.
