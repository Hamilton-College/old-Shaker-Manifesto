PAY AS YOU GO. A word of good counsel we ne'er should forget, Is that which forewarns us to keep out of debt; For half of life's burdens that man overthrows Who starts out determined to pay as lie goes. 'Tis folly io listen to those who assert That a system of credit does good and not hurt; For many have squandered their incomes away, And hearts have been wrecked by a promise to pay. A man to be honest as merchant or friend, In order to have must be willing to spend. Is it love or affection, or faith they bestow? Keturn their full value, and pay as you go. He loses the sweetness life can impart Who locks up a treasure of wealth in his heart, To reap a rich harvest of pain and regret, When too late he discovers how great was his debt. No loss like the losing that comes of delay In binding the wounds that are bleeding to-day! For where is the comfort of tears that are shed A word of good counsel we ne'er should forget; And to keep out of danger is to keep out of debt! If peace and contentment and joy you would know, Don't live upon credit, but pay as you go ! Selected.
