Every soul that bears itself nobly through the individual experience... Every soul that bears itself nobly through the individual experience of earth life, bequeaths to humanity the enriching treasures of goodness, truth and undying love; such are the imperishable fruits of the tree of life. Races may come and go through successive generations, as the evolving cycles of time course onward, yet from the human personality that peoples our globe, is transmitted a spiritual power and energy that endures, and etherealizes the grosser elements of existence; making it possible for humanity to obey the ever-echoing call to 'come up higher.' Truly, there is no death, but 'life is life forevermore.' M. J. Anderson.
