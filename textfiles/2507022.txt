The Editor of 'Times of Restitution' in making reference to himself, says,'We spend no money for luxuries, we dress plain, chew no tobacco, take no medicine, drink no tea or coffee, eat the plainest food, attend no theatres, take no pleasure trips, and work from 5.30 in the morning till 9.30 at night. Kemember our work in your prayers.' A record of this order is certainly commendable, and many a Christian might read it with profit to both soul and body.
