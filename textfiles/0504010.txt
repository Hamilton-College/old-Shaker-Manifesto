Danbury, Ct., Jan. 12, '75 Elder Evans — Dear sir : Inclosed, find sixty cents, the subscription price of your excellent monthly,' The Shaker and Shakeress.' I have taken it the past year, and can hardly get along without it. Its voice against sin, in its many forms, has no uncertain sound. Its representations of the Gentile Christian church, are in almost perfect harmony with my theory of Christianity. Whether I shall ever come any nearer to 28 your order than a general acceptance of your theory, I am unable to say, at present. In many respects, we are the creatures of circumstances. As far as in me lies, with my surroundings, I am denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts. I am crucified with Christ. Perhaps you think no one ought to say so much and, at the same time, consent to remain in Babylon. Are these not times when we must choose between two evils ? At least, ought we not to wait for the time remedy ? The Christ-spirit has certainly been leading me onward. I have been in Egypt — have come forth and wandered in the wilderness. Have been content to go down into Babylon, not knowing any better way. But I pee the new Jerusalem. Its light cheers my soul. Still I am traveling. I hear the voice, ' Fear not, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.' Would be pleased to hear from you. Yours, truly, J. L. Peck
