EXALTATION MARY WHITCHER First learn our possession, Then, need of progression, And ply ourselves ear:y and late ; In childhood if told it, And youth should unfold it, Through manhood no labor abate. All those who love beauty Should also love duty, Keep diligent march with the sun,â€” At morn in its brightness, At noon in uprightness, Till evening, when labor is done. Each day thus resuming And all sloth consuming, Most godlike the being will grow ; A (id earth will inherit 'j. iiat manhood and spirit Which constitute heaven below. What joy in pains taking ! What sadness in making A havoc of talents and time; Why should we turn traitor To God our Creator, And place ourselves lower than swine? Arise to the hearing, The love and God fearing Which rational man should embrace ; While heaven is holy And wisdom is lowly We'll gain and retain our true place. Canterbury, N. H.
