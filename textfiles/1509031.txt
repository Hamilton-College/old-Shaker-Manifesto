We lay us down in peace... We lay us down in peace, Thy touch divine Our eyelids closing; [shrine Darkness�Thy secret place�becomes the Of our reposing; Gently we breathe our souls into Thy care, So glad to be One day more near to that home rest of thine, Which we may share With saints and thee. M. J. Genevieve.
