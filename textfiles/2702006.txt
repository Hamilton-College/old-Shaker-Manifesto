THE IDEAL LIFE. By Hamilton DeGraw. THAT it shall be superior to the external, is not merely desirable but necessary, if, as every intelligent person is supposed to admit, that life is progressive ; for if not, it would be a contradiction of terms and not be life. The present ideal, when attained, only finds the vision extended and the possibilities greater for a further advancement. Reasoning from these premises, the reply to the question,�Can we attain unto the perfect ideal? must be answered in the negative. This is eternal progression. The environments which, dependent upon education and temperament, have given the limit, beyond which our comprehension does not extend, are only removed by the operation in our lives,- of a superior force which we may term the higher will power, which is inherent in every soul, however undevelopt; but ready to respond when the proper conditions exist for its growth. The experience of missionaries among the lowest types of humanity, is evidence that in the majority of cases, the presentation of advanced ideas, finds conditions ready for their acceptance. This ideal life is at times personified in individuals who, having attained unto that exalted state which enables them to understand truths, that to the masses, are a sealed volume; and being placed where they can point the way that must be traveled to reach the higher vantage ground that is seen beyond. The worshipful faculty in the soul, that causes it to deify the being who has made these attainments, is a legitimate one, being the most powerful incentive known, to stimulate its progress. The good old adage that 'a contented mind is a continual feast,' does not imply a state of lethargy. There is a nobler discontent; and the races which to-day lead the world in all that pertains to true progress, were the ones tluit dissatisfied with present conditions, and perceiving the truth with less mixture of error boldly proclaimed their independence of antiquated forms, and moved forward in the increasing light. The restless condition of modern thought, in its religious, scientific and miscellaneous departments, indicates not a fevered condition of an ebbing tide, whose mighty flow has borne it upward to its present position; but that the current of its life forces is strong, and will carry forward human life to that exalted ideal which the most advanced minds have given it illustrations. The danger lies not in the quickening into more life the latent forces that dwell there, but in their suppression. The upheavals, that in the past have overthrown governments and destroyed civilizations, were the result of efforts to suppress investigation and compel the mind to wear garments that were outgrown and only adapted to the infancy of the race. When the advocates of that infernal system of chattle slavery, undertook to prop it up, by striving to suppress the efforts to enlighten, the words of the Divine Teacher be- came appropriate, 'For men love darkn ss rather than light, because their deeds are evil.' That testimony can be applied to every phase of human existence. 1 he powers that for ages have claimed the divine right to rule, are being disturbed by the quickening of that divinity in the soul which has so long slumbered but is now asking, Are not those fountains of living waters whereof if a soul driuketh it shall never die, also for us? That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This ideal, illustrated in that immortal document, the Declaration of Independence, must be actualized before that day which is reasonably expected will dawn,�The Millennium. Class distinctions and all the artificial barriers that at present disintegrate society would disappear, 'for the knowledge of the Lord would cover the earth as the waters cover the sea.' It has been truly said, that human life is better than its creeds ; proving the fact that the interior or soul life, no matter how much encumbered by externalities can not be effectually hindered in its upward march. That every action which is in accord with the ideal, is a force which helps to realize the truth 'that each to-morrow finds us farther than to-day.' Looking down the dim vistas that separate the present from even the historic past, we see that progress has been made. Looking forward, we see greater attainments to be realized. For whoever seeks to place limits to the development of the soul, is in danger of being crusht in its onward march. For like an army with banners, are the hosts that have been marshaled to aid in the uplifting of human life above the mists and shadows, and where can be seen the glorious ideal of a perfected humanity.
