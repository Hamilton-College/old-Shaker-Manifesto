Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1897. Summer has ended, the harvest is past, but among all the daily duties we look within and find gratitude in our hearts for the measure of prosperity we enjoy. We haryested about a hundred tons of hay; raised about three hundred bushels of corn and a large crop of herbs. Potatoes not so good; were troubled with rot. Think we have enough for the winter. Apples a failure, especially winter fruit. We gathered five barrels tho very poor. This month came in with a.fine rain which was very much needed. Water was very low in the springs and ponds. Our milk keeps up to the mark having a good quantity for market. We have leased our Rural Home to Dr. Watkins for a Sanatarium, and he is now putting in the necessary appliances. Eldress Eliza Abbott is smart and carries her ninety years with grace. Health of Society good at present. While we are laboring for and enjoying the material things of this life, we do not forget the necessity of laboring for spiritual blessings which our souls need, as much as we need the perishable things of earth.
