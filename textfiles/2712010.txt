To be logical it should be named December instead of October. To be Astronomical, its proper name according to number should be Uni-december; but it does seem the more unnatural statements are made, the better people in general are suited. Theological creeds and dogma's evidence this. For example; The Trinity, Vicarious atonements, heaven, hell, the fall of man, etc. Well, notwithstanding all the inconsistencies of names, October has been quite a favorable month. It has given us but one rainy day, so we have had an opportunity to prepare for the oncoming cold winter. It has also f urnisht us some pleasant associations. We have had gospel relation from Watervliet, N. Y., Harvard, Mass, and Union Village, Ohio. Oct. 14th our lawsuit terminated in our favor, for which we thank kind Providence. Oct. 31st we had an unusual meeting. We assembled in the Meeting House and listened to a lecture by Ernest H. Crosby of Brooklyn, N. Y. The subject; 'Single Tax' as advocated and promulgated by Henry George, lately deceased. The lecture was given by request. It occupied an entire hour, and was very interesting. This closes public meeting for this year, In the evening we had a meeting composed of the Church and North families. Ernest H. Crosby was present and was deeply affected by the spirit of the meeting which was truly inspirational. The Angel bands were with us. We felt their heavenly influence. Meeting occupied at least one and a half hours. Our visitor thought we did not do right in not spreading our doctrines through the aid of missionaries of our faith. Elder Joseph sent me a note stating that the Ministry would leave Enfield on Nov. 4th for Hancock. The probability is that befora-many months an electric R. R. will run from Greenbush through our place to Pittsfield, Mass. Work has commenced on it already. No death to report this month. It is a time of usual health in the Community. Calvin O. Heed. North Family. Nov. 1897. Among the list of visitors we had the pleasure of entertaining the past month is the name of E. H. Crosby, an earnest worker in the social as well as political movements of the day. Spending the Sabbath with us, he was invited to address the assembly on the 'Moral and Religious aspect of Single Tax.' As it was Sunday he took (as he usually does on such occasions) his text from the Bible. 'The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's, but the earth hath he given to the children of men.'�Psa. cxv., 16. While he does not believe that the Single Tax movement is the beginning and end of all things, yet he recognizes the fact that the taxes should be placed on the valuation of the land instead of the individual labor of improving the homestead, which necessarily raises the taxes, to the discouragement of the laboring classes. The land belonging to the Lord who has a right to monopolize it! They who own the land also own the people who live on it, proving his statement by quoting from Gen. xlvii., 23. 'Then Joseph said unto the people, behold have I bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; lo, here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land,' showing forth the fact that the command of tlie landlord requires obedience or expulsion. In the course of his very interesting discouse he alluded to Elder F. W. Evans1 writing. 'The practical principle which Christ instructed Jesus, was brotherhood, to love his neighbor as himself, and not to appropriate to his own selfish uses to the exclusion of those on the same plane, either of the life elements�earth, air, fire or water.' Roger W. Montgomery a traveler and writer, also spent a week with us. With the many opportunities of giving as well as receiving we find our measure filled with the good things of God. Sarah J. Burger. Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1897. As we read in the Nov. Manifesto the testimony of Aaron Wood, that dear Father in the New Creation, we thought of many of those blessed saints who have past on before and we askt; Are they still interested in us, their children, to help ns by their heavenly influence, giving strength to the weak and encouraging the faint-hearted? In the silence of our meditations the answer came; 'We are still with you and our influence is growing stronger as the years roll on.' When we read of what they suffered for the Truth's sake we are ashamed even to think of crying the burden of the Lord. As we see the portends of the coming upheavals in social and religious life we feel that strong souls are needed to meet those conditions with a courage befitting the times. The testimony of the new life is not dead neither doth it slumber, for like a mighty army with banners cometh those sainted souls from the summer land with love and power and their march is one of triumphant victory. In conjunction with our singing school Sunday afternoon, an effort is being made to establish a school for moral and intellectual development, on the lines of original thinking. A subject is announced at one meeting and essays are written or spoken upon that topic the succeeding Sunday; the object being to develop the latent powers of the young by providing that which is both interesting and instructive. Hope that success will crown the effort. Hamilton DeGraw. Harvard, Mass. Nov. 1897. Summer has ended, the harvest is past, but among all the daily duties we look within and find gratitude in our hearts for the measure of prosperity we enjoy. We haryested about a hundred tons of hay; raised about three hundred bushels of corn and a large crop of herbs. Potatoes not so good; were troubled with rot. Think we have enough for the winter. Apples a failure, especially winter fruit. We gathered five barrels tho very poor. This month came in with a.fine rain which was very much needed. Water was very low in the springs and ponds. Our milk keeps up to the mark having a good quantity for market. We have leased our Rural Home to Dr. Watkins for a Sanatarium, and he is now putting in the necessary appliances. Eldress Eliza Abbott is smart and carries her ninety years with grace. Health of Society good at present. While we are laboring for and enjoying the material things of this life, we do not forget the necessity of laboring for spiritual blessings which our souls need, as much as we need the perishable things of earth.
