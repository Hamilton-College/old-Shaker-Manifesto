The trials of life are apt to be more imagined than real... The trials of life are apt to be more imagined than real; this is owing chiefly to mental conditions, or external influences. Trials either great or small are for the souls unfoldment and advancement, if patiently endured. A character untried is uncertain, and the person possessing it is not to be depended on. Gold tried in the fire is of great value; so is the soul when purified in the furnace of affliction. A. W.
