An Intra-Mural View An Intra-Mural View,' a very artistic brochure, has been received from The Curtis Publishing Company, Philadelphia, publishers of The Ladies' Home Journal. As the title indicates, the booklet gives us glimpses of the interiors of the Journal's offices, and some idea of the work carried on there. The main building, entirely occupied by the editorial and business offices, was designed by Mr. Hardenberg, the architect of the Hotel Waldorf, New York, and was completed in January, 1893. The exterior is attractive and the interior elegantly appointed and admirably planned. The numerous illustrations, showing the commodious and well-fitted offices, and the accompanying text, giving us some insight into the work in the different bureaus, requiring a force approximating four hundred employes, indicate the wonderful success which The Ladies' Home Journal has achieved in an almost incredibly short time. The first number was issued in December, 1883, so that less than eleven years have elapsed since Mr. Curtis conceived the idea which has developed into so vast an enterprise. In this short time its merit and steady improvement in all departments have received such recognition that its circulation has reached the enormous average of about 700,000, the largest magazine output in the world. The brochure also describes at some length the work of printing and binding the Journal, which is carried on in a separate building. 'An Intra-Mural View' will be sent to any one who will address The Curtis Publishing Company, and inclose four cents in stamps for postage.
