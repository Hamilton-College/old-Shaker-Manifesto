THE REAPERS' CALL 'Thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe:'â€”Rev. 14,15. Alfred, Mb. Allegro. Sing, sing O Virgin of Israel, Tune your harps with the chorus of angels The bright dawn of day is approaching, The armies of heaven in glory descend. See the fields already ripening And the angel Reapers calling; Come bear your sheaves with joy and gladness Home to the garners of our God.
