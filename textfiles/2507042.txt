The Separated Nation The Separated Nation by H. L. Hastings is a work of some 225 pages. This separated nation is a brief historical account of the Jewish people and written largely from a religious standpoint, with the leading thought that they were at one time a race especially favored of God. The object of the writer is to prove that God was the direct counselor of this nation and that under this inspiration, Moses and other anointed officers directed the people by divine commandment, and that their history throughout the whole earth is the most wonderful, in every respect, of any nation that ever has or that now exists. To all biblical students this little work will prove to be very interesting and equally as instructive. Published at 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
