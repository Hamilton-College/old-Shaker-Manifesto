Wood Stains — A Carpenter — I want to stain some wood work in imitation of walnut and cherry, please give directions? Ans.— Dissolve asphalt in spirits of turpentine and thin it down until when tried on a sample it gives the right walnut shade. If a reddish tinge is desired add a little dragon's blood by degrees until the color suits. One coat is enough. For cherry, make a saturated solution of bi-chromate of potash in hot water, and when cold brush this over the work, which should be of clear pine. Set the work in the light until the shade darkens sufficiently, when it should be covered. The watery solution will raise the grain of the wood. This should be sandpapered down and a coat of oil be given.
