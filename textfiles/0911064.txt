ILL TEMPER A single person of sour, sullen temper — what a dreadful thing it is to have such a one in a house ! There is not myrrh and aloes and chloride of lime enough in the world to disinfect a single home of such a nuisance as that; no riches, no elegance of mien, no beauty of face can ever screen such persons from utter vulgarity. Ill temper is the most vulgar thing that the lowest born and illest bred can ever bring to his home. It is one of the worst forms of impiety. Peevishness in a home is not only a sin against the Holy Ghost, but sin against the Holy Ghost in the very temple of love. — Theodore Parker
