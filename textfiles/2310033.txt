Dear Elder Henry:--the weather out here... Union Village, O. July, 1893. Dear Elder Henry :�The weather out here is ver,y warm indeed, and very dry. Our crops are scarcely an average. Fruits^ none. Prices low, and taxes high. I am inclined to view all this apparent disaster as a depleting process directly for our benefit ; 'upon wbom the ends of the world are come' THE MANIFESTO. 245 (or should have come before this.) It looks like a scheme on the part of Divine Wisdom to force our attention to healthier and more economical modes and methods of living. Jesus said, 'Man shall not live by bread alone.' And for fear some epicure might think meat or some other external ingredient should be added to his diet he goes on to say 'but by every word that proceedetb out of the mouth of God.' If a good Shaker knows that fleshmeat is dearer 40 to 1, than vegetables, fruits and farinacea, can he be justified in living at such an enormous premium over his brethren and sisters by nature, who inhabit the sweat shops, the streets and the slums of cities and other indigent neighborhoods, hundreds and thousands of whom never know where their next meal is to come from? This immense disparity must be accounted for, arbitrated, and oscillate into equilibrium sooner or later; and in that day Almighty Love and Justice will not be unmindful of those willing to live with less, that others might have more, and inward peace will be their rich harvest. I consider Theology of very little, perhaps no account�(so far in the world's history, worse than nothing) but practical Religion, to me, is of Almighty moment, that is, this article I am now writing. Elder Richard W. Pelham used to say, 'Some presume to say that what or how much they devoured was no part of Religion, but if not I should like to know what Religion does consist in. Goldsmith beautifully says,� 'Then Pilgrim these thy cares forego, For earth-born cares are wrong; Man wants but little here below, Nor wants that little long.' Let us ask ourselves in the spirit of Elder Anstatt in his recent earnest appeal ;�Are we, or are we not holding foremost in our interest and esteem spiritual themes and spiritual travel? If so, and we are really 'seeking first the Kingdom of Heaven and its Righteousness' how is it that good sincere persons who come among us are moved to say, 'I thought the Shakers were a religious people and that they conversed upon religious topics and abounded in spiritual gifts. But I can hear scarcely anything at all on the subject. So much is said about all manner of temporalities and so very little about spiritual travel and experience. I am surprised beyond measure to find this state of things.' This is the language used here by more than one of our new comers. And then I think of the solemn monition of the rapt seer 'Be admonished O Jerusalem, lest my spirit depart from thee and thou become desolate ;� a city wi hout inhabitant.' Jer. vi., 8. So let us take warning and see if we cannot be a little more spiritual. There is an intelligent medium between extreme Conservatism and extreme Radicalism. In avoiding Scylla why be wrecked on Charybdis. Sometimes would it not be well to listen to the Inspiration for a moment which says, 'And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying, this is the way walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left.'�Isaiah xxx,, 21.
