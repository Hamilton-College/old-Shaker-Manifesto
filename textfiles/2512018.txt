Nov. 1895. Little has transpired in our peaceful mountain home that would gratify the external mind, but much has been granted to us from the Giver of all good, that would nourish and uplift mind and soul. The 4th ult. we received a pleasant call from Elder George Wilcox and Elder Thomas Stroud, who enriched us with the love of true hearts. For a short period we had to use a steam motor for shirt work, but upon the 12th the long looked for rain refreshed the earth and enabled us to again use water power. October 14th the District school opened. The school house had previously undergone repairs and re-arrangements to better adapt it for the accommodation of boys and girls in separate class rooms. Following carpenter and painter, Sister Amelia Calver's deft fingers added many appreciated touches in preparation for the new teachers, Ezra J. Stewart, Grace Ada Brown and Annie R. Stephens. Sister Grace Ada Brown, recently from Long Island has had large experience as principal in public schools and is well qualified to instruct advanced classes. Courteous manners and sound morality are a part of the lessons daily inculcated. The long expected volume of poems entitled 'Mount Lebanon Cedar Boughs,' has just come from the press, it is a neat and handsomely bound book of three hundred and sixteen pages and well represents the work of many gifted persons. We have already had many subscribers and hope to have the patronage of many more. We are more than pleased to say that although we are now entering upon the severe winter season, yet we feel we are in the spring of our hopefulness. We believe that a new age is dawning wherein we shall see the spirit of brotherly love rule the hearts of mankind, 'Mercy and truth meet and righteousness and peace kiss each other.' Belle Rullhausen. Shakers, N. Y. Nov. 1895. We have lately been much interested in the perusal of 'Emerson's Essays.' The thoughts given and the style of expression prove him to be an illuminated soul, a true prophet that had already caught a 280 TERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 28 L glimpse of the dawning day. His essays would make interesting and instructive reading for lyceums and self-improvement societies for the coming winter. The past season witli all its drawbacks has been generally a prosperous one. The crop of apples was fair but not as large as the previous season. Hay very light crop, but potatoes the best for several years; corn good. So we can with grateful hearts render thanksgiving for the blessing we are under and to remember the poor and needy. We have an occasional visit from the 'Little Sisters of the Poor,' a charitable institution located in Albany; their work is commendable as it is given free depending upon contributions for support. Of the new varieties of sweet corn that we have tested the past season, we have not found one that equaled' in quality the 'Country Gentlemen,' a variety introduced the past season. It is a late variety and for a family garden can not be surpassed. The Burpee's Dwarf Lima Bean still proves a valuable acquisition, being a true Lima, enormously productive and of excellent flavor. We are at present enjoying beautiful autumn weather very desirable for the completion of fall work, but are needing rain. At present date Nov. 3rd we have had but one slight flurry of snow. Hamilton DeGraio. Shaker Station, Ct. Nov. 1895. The Apostle says, 'Praying always with all prayer.' Prayer and watchfulness is the armor for the battle of life. It is well to pray but better still to watch and work and remember that 'God helps those who help themselves.' Prayer and watching is a safeguard each hour. When we pray to our heavenly Father, it is an acknowledgement of our dependence upon Him. How blessed is the thought that we can pray while performing our daily duties. Our supplication can ascend to God without moving our lips. Without watchfulness we shall be overcome by the adversary of souls. Let us strive to attain to this watchful spirit, and commit all our burdens and trials to One, who has promised to protect those who trust in Him. We can never pray too often, 'Leave us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.' October 16th, a company of five Sisters from Hancock, Mass, came to visit iis. We have been greatly blest by such peaceful messengers, who have been numerous during the year; they come none too often however. At this season of the year we have no time to lose; there are so many things to be done to prepare for winter. Cayenne peppers when mixed with soft feed are an excellent stimulant for hens. It is proper care and food that hastens early laying. Hens should have all the milk they can drink; no kind of food is better adapted to egg production. Hens should be supplied in winter with what they can pick up in summer. A hen at large supplies herself with grit in the shape of sharp flinty substance. Dtmiel Orcult. South Family. Nov. 1895. The beautiful October is past, leaving its place to drear November with its cold, bleak winds. Snow has already made its appearance; on the 5th inst. the ground was well covered, but it soon entirely vanished under the rays of the warm sun. Preparations for winter are neai'ly completed. Our garners are well filled; and with so many blessings we have naught to fear. The prospect for our winter garden is encouraging; tomatoes and cucumbers are growing finely at this date, and other vegetables will be ready for the table in due season. Time will prove the success of any new enterprise; thus we say when thinking of our Brethren and Sisters in Florida. Our sympathies are with them, and we hope health and prosperity may attend them. 282 THE MANIFESTO. The addition to our family of two Sisters from the Society at Canterbury is a great biessing to us. One in faith and one in interest, seeking to do good wherever duty calls us is the beauty of our order of life. The faithful Christian may truly expect a blessing through this life as well as in the great hereafter. Maria Witham.
