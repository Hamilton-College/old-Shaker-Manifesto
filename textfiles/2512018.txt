Shaker Station, Ct. Nov. 1895. The Apostle says, 'Praying always with all prayer.' Prayer and watchfulness is the armor for the battle of life. It is well to pray but better still to watch and work and remember that 'God helps those who help themselves.' Prayer and watching is a safeguard each hour. When we pray to our heavenly Father, it is an acknowledgement of our dependence upon Him. How blessed is the thought that we can pray while performing our daily duties. Our supplication can ascend to God without moving our lips. Without watchfulness we shall be overcome by the adversary of souls. Let us strive to attain to this watchful spirit, and commit all our burdens and trials to One, who has promised to protect those who trust in Him. We can never pray too often, 'Leave us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.' October 16th, a company of five Sisters from Hancock, Mass, came to visit iis. We have been greatly blest by such peaceful messengers, who have been numerous during the year; they come none too often however. At this season of the year we have no time to lose; there are so many things to be done to prepare for winter. Cayenne peppers when mixed with soft feed are an excellent stimulant for hens. It is proper care and food that hastens early laying. Hens should have all the milk they can drink; no kind of food is better adapted to egg production. Hens should be supplied in winter with what they can pick up in summer. A hen at large supplies herself with grit in the shape of sharp flinty substance. Dtmiel Orcult. South Family. Nov. 1895. The beautiful October is past, leaving its place to drear November with its cold, bleak winds. Snow has already made its appearance; on the 5th inst. the ground was well covered, but it soon entirely vanished under the rays of the warm sun. Preparations for winter are neai'ly completed. Our garners are well filled; and with so many blessings we have naught to fear. The prospect for our winter garden is encouraging; tomatoes and cucumbers are growing finely at this date, and other vegetables will be ready for the table in due season. Time will prove the success of any new enterprise; thus we say when thinking of our Brethren and Sisters in Florida. Our sympathies are with them, and we hope health and prosperity may attend them. 282 THE MANIFESTO. The addition to our family of two Sisters from the Society at Canterbury is a great biessing to us. One in faith and one in interest, seeking to do good wherever duty calls us is the beauty of our order of life. The faithful Christian may truly expect a blessing through this life as well as in the great hereafter. Maria Witham.
