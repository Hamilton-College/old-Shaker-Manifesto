PETITION O Lord, my God, I love thee With all my heart and soul! Do in thy loving mercy, My mind and thoughts control. Thy power alone can raise me, Above the shades of death; Therefore, O God, I'll praise thee, So long as I have breath! May I, to Thee, come nigher — My Light, my Life and Stay; With truths, my soul inspire, O hear me when I pray! And may thy blessing, Father, Descend like heavenly dew; Thy promises remember — Thy Covenants renew. Lydia Lewis, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
