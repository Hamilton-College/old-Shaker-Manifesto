While every part of the gospel testimony may need to be presented... While every part of the gospel testimony may need to be presented over and over again, to the end that it may be established in the heart, there are some things that being less understood than others, demand more attention through extended illustrations. Some of these may appeal so directly to the order of mind that exists at the present time among men, that the thought of controversy on the subject may never be entertained. The commandment which says,'Thou shalt not kill,' has become so thoroughly engrafted into the life of the civilized and religious classes that a trespass on this point shocks our whole being, as something awful, and a crime against both God and man. Less depth of thought may hold us in contemplation, on the growth of acquisitiveness; and the order, 'Thou shalt not steal,' grows so dim in the eyes of the majority that they often lose sight of the command and accept it as a mere suggestion, convenient under certain circumstances, but of no especial value. Jesus, however, was very explicit on these subjects, and gave his disciples to understand that all these moral precepts were essential, and should become a part of the life of those who wished to grow into the spirit of righteousness. He spoke of the Law and of the necessity of keeping it as it was given through God's ministers, that it might be fulfilled in the lives of those who professed to be his disciples. Although the Law was the life saving work to those who accepted it, yet 'a more excellent way' was being revealed in this jnew dispensation, having in it more of the blessings of humanity, with the added, crowning grace of an inspiring spirituality. The disciples were instructed to regard these moral precepts of an earlier age, while at the same time they were urged to love their neighbors TERMS. THE MANIFESTO. 117 and to care for them as they did for themselves. Jesus brought forward, very carefully, some remarkable instances of self sacrifice, by which to illustrate this Christian principle, but through the selfishness of the human heart they have failed, to a large extent, in becoming permanently interwoven into the interests of life, and even at this date the saints and sinners are equally at a loss to determine who may or who may not be a neighbor, while there are about as many shades of conjecture on the point as there are individuals. A more familiar acquaintance with the spirit of the gospel of the New Testament, may lead us into new, and better relations with mankind, and be to us a Teacher of righteousness. On some of the lines of gospel teaching, either through ignorance or by willfully perverting the text, more or less obscurity is found to exist and the truth is sometimes glossed over to that extent that it is made to present a very different aspect. Jesus through his faithfulness in obeying the voice of God, was early called a son of God, and pre-eminently occupies that position, although others who have accepted and been led by the spirit of God have received the same honorable name. His life so wrought out in righteousness, so consecrated to God and to the good of humanity, was to all others who should love him, and believe on him, an example, a pattern, a spiritual physician. To follow him into the many duties of life, will insure success. To emulate his wise and powerful course as we walk among men would, indeed, lead us on to become the sons of God. His life was a life in God or a life in regeneration. It was a new, spiritual life, made so by the renewing of the Holy Spirit. As was his life, so should be the life of his discipleGeneration, so closely allied to what some love to denominate 'the first, great command,' belonged to the teachers of another order. The Mosaic Law recognized the generative relation and encouraged it, and in God's name surrounded it with laws and ordinances to keep it, if possible, within the boundaries of propriety as understood in that age of the world. If by any means Moses can be denominated a Messiah, then he was the Messiah of generation, while Jesus being educated under a very different ministration was the Messiah of regeneration, or the Messiah of a 'new and living; way.' By many who enjoy the name of Christens or of antichristians, this seems to be one of the mist obscured subjects, and they seem determined to make Jesus a teacher of generation, the same as was Moses. Occupying, themselves, a low, sensual plane, they are far more anxious to 118 THE MANIFESTO. draw the Son of God down to their own level, and to their works of darkness, than to take up their crosses and rise to the plane on which Jesus the Christ has laid the foundation of his church. Dunlavy with characteristic plainness says:ï¿½'Marriage and the order of the flesh have neither part nor lot in Christ, as is proved by the doctrine of Christ.' Paul, through force of circumstances, felt obliged, no doubt, to lower the standard of the cross of Christ, as he preached to the Mormons of Corinth, through the hope of saving some to a higher spiritual work. And many Christians of the present day, seemingly enjoy the idea of making generation and generative Christianity of superlative value in the redemption of the world. Generation may be all well enough for the class to whom it belongs, and under the rule of God's laws for man, it may still be the 'very good' of Genesis, but it can not be called Christian nor in any way be after the example of Jesus the Christ.
