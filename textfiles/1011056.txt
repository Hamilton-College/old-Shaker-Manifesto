TRUE COURAGE 'Tis easy to stand on a vessel's deck, On a vessel snug and trim, And watch the foam from her flashing wake, And the rainbow bubbles swim ; 'Tis easy enough to climb the mast When hushed the billows war, And zephyrs play With the pennon gay That floats from the highest spar. 'Tis another thing in the murky night, Â¦ By the snaky lightning's glare, To climb and to stand on the dizzy height, When the tempest's arm is bare ; When the masts are bending low with the strain, And the canvas all is riven, And the angry blast Goes whirling past, And the flying clouds of heaven. 'Tis easy enough to be brave and true, With nothing to set us wrong ; 'When the sky above is a cloudless blue, And the heart is full of song ; 'Tis another thing when the stormy clouds Are darkening overhead, When the angel of wrath Stoops o'er our path, And all about is lead.
