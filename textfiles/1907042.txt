KIND WORDS. Respected Friend;--I send you a short contribution... North Union, 0. May, 1889. Respected Friend ;ï¿½I send you a short contribution for the 'Manifesto,' with sincere wishes for its long continuance and unceasing prosperity. Respectfully, W. L. Lincoln. My present feelings lead me to say a word of appreciation... Shaker Station, Ct., May, 1889. My present feelings lead me to say a word of appreciation of the Manifesto. I think it an excellent exponent of our resurrection life, to the world. I appreciate the Editorials which maintain a protest against the worldly element in the so-called Christian churches. I feel like saying, God speed the Manifesto on its mission. Thomas Stroud.
