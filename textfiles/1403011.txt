'Whatsoever thy Hand findeth to do, do it with thy Might.' AGNES E. NEWTON. One by one the golden moments of our lives are passing, each having its portion of duty to be performed ; which if neglected will remain forever undone. Regret and repentance, however deeply felt, cannot atone for past neglect. The faithfulness of to-day, simply meets the demand of the present. Amid the multiplicity of earthly cares, the hurry and bustle of daily life, we often lose sight of the injunction, ' One by one life's duties wait thee Let thy whole strength go to each.' Unmindful of some essential duties, in point of Christian discipline, we give to those of a non-spiritual character more time and attention than is rightfully their due. The seasons devoted to prayer should claim our undivided attention, our whole strength, so to speak, should be given in the petition for divine guidance, which we present at the throne of the Eternal; but how often do temporal calls and selfish interests engage the mind, even when the attitude of prayer is assumed. It is well to bear in mind, in the minor duties of life, that whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well. Concentration of thought to the subject, or duty at hand, when guided by a religious principle, brings the most satisfactory results ; writing '' Holiness unto the Lord,' upon each act of our lives ; making perfect, 'even as our Father in heaven is perfect.' Canterbury, N. H.
