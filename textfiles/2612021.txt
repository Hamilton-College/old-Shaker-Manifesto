WHY IS IT? Father Ryan. Some find work where some find rest, And so the weary world goes on. I sometimes wonder which is best. The answer comes when life is gone. Some eyes sleep when some eyes wake, And so the dreary hours go. Some hearts beat where others break. I often wonder why 'tis so. Some will faint where some will fight; Some love the tent and some the field. I often wonder who are right The ones who strive or those who yield. Some hands fold where other hands Are lifted bravely in the strife, And so through ages and through lands Move on the two extremes of life. Some feet halt where some feet tread, In tireless march, a thorny way; Some struggle on where some have fled; Some seek when others shun the fray. Some swords rust where others clash; Some fall back where some move on; Some flags furl where others flash Until the battle has been won. Some sleep on while others keep The vigils of the true and brave. They will not rest till roses creep Around their name above a grave.
