VISITING On the 5th instant, a company, of eight young Sisters, from the North, spent the day, at the Second Family. With faces beaming with satisfaction, they report a good time. And that their dinner was so rational, and simple its digestion did not, in the least, interfere with their social and spiritual love feast — their soul enjoyment. They feel honored by the confidence reposed — their bodily wants being considered subordinate to sweet Gospel Union and Communion. F. W. Evans
