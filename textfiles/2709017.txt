The editor of our Shaker contemporary, The Manifesto, explains how... [It is with a peculiar sense of regard and appreciation we publish for the benefit of ail the readers of The Manifesto, the following notice taken from a recent issue of the Ave Maria one of the most popular, and most extensively circulated magazines in the Catholic Church. In this day of trashy, frivilous literature, it is like a breath of pure air stealing into a noisome room, to come in contact with the chaste and wholesome reading which fills the pages of the Ave Maria. As Shakers, interested in every movement that conduces to advance the kingdom of God among men by fighting the cursed vice of sensuality which is the chief cause of so much misery in the world, we never depreciate the movement because it comes from this or that particular creed or sect, we are only glad that it conies, only glad to help it on by our prayers and support. We are thoroughly acquainted with the high standard of moral training which prevails in Catholic schools and colleges. The pupils are taught to regard the holy virtue of purity as a thing divine, before which angels prostrate in adoring love. They are taught to believe that its observance constitutes the no. blest manhood or womanhood that this world has to offer. It is not surprising that such a magazine as the Ave Maria should issue from such a source. While we may differ from the Ave Maria in our views of the eternal truths of Christianity, yet we are one in our belief that sin is detestable, that it is man's worst enemy, and that the only power that can conquer it is the pure gospel of Jesus Christ. These being our sentiments we can say with all sincerity, God speed the good work of the Ave Maria. The following is the note referred to The editor of our Shaker contemporary, The Manifesto, explains how the United Society of Believers came to be called Shakers, a nickname they have since adopted. The founders of this sect were God-fearing men, who dwelt much on the severity of the divine judgments. One of their most familiar quotations was from the prophet Aggeus, and from it their name is derived. In the Protestant version of the Scriptures it runs; 'Thus saith the Lord: It is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory.' The Anglican sect used to be known as King Henry's Church; the Methodists were called Ranters, and the Baptists were called Dippers; but the Shakers were the only sect, we believe, who meekly accepted a nickname invented in ridicule We wish we could share with our readers the pleasure derived from a letter lately received from the editor of The Manifesto, asking an exchange with the Ave Mariaï¿½a letter breathing a beautiful spirit of Christian charity. It affords another proof that God's flowers bloom upon every soil, and that many who are geographically outside the Church are not culpably outside of it. If all Shakers are like the pious, prayerful, peaceful, Godloving, sin-hating Community from which The Manifesto emanates, they can not be far from the Kingdom of God.
