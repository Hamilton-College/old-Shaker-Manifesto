A LIVING FAITH. Larz Erickson. uHe that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his life shall flow rivers of living water.'1''�John vii, 38. A living faith rests on Christ only. The words he spoke are full of life and. light. Happy and blest is every one that believes in our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ. Faith is the only ship that will carry us safely over the stormy ocean. No wave nor hurricane nor tornado be it ever so strong, can hurt or destroy. We move on straight through. Sure the world may trouble us for a while, but we will soon be beyond its reach, and then it will trouble us no more. THE MANIFESTO. 209 Oh, blessed power! the true, livingfaith, that brings joy and gladness to the weary, and opens the gate that we can enter into the rest of God. Oh, blessed power, the word of God, that brought redemption to fallen man, to help him out of his sinful state, and brought us home to our Father's house. For such redemption we give thanks, and will give the news to our fallen brother man. The gates are open, and, if we will, we are welcome to enter. Come, eat and drink from the spring of life. Do not refuse�you are welcome here. You will be bkst from the streams of life, so you can give and bless again. The love of God is exceeding deep. He gave the Savior to us. He trod the wine-press alone. He did not tread it in vain. Because we feel that our love increases when we believe as the Scripture saith. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
