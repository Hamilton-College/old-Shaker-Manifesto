REPLY. Shaker Station, Conn., Dec. 1888. Peter Sidebotham, Dear Friend :ï¿½Press of business has prevented me answering your welcome letter sooner. I am thankful for your appreciation of the correspondence in the November number of the Manifesto ; I shall feel amply repaid if a little good has been done by it. George Jacob Holyoake I never was personally acquainted with, further than as a lecturer at the Branch Tottenham Court Road, John St., London. I was a member then of the Branch, and I appreciated him, as well as other lecturers on socialism very highly, being then an ardent admirer and advocate of the principles of socialism. George, when in this country, lectured in the town of Holyoke, twenty miles from here, and I went to hear him. | I was theu introduced, and had a pleasant interview with him. It was very interesting to hear him tell how cooperation took its rise in England. After the wreck of all our efforts at Community-building, cooperation is evidently all the practical outcome of socialism; i. e., the phase of it up to 1845. Previous to my joining Shakerism, I became i convert to the theosophy of J. P. Greaves as practiced at Ham Common, in the neighborhood of Richmond, Surrey. Greaves affirmed above and beyond mere physical socialism, because his views were higher and embraced more truth. If you are not acquainted with its theory, I may, at some future time, give you au insight into it. It touched somewhat elaborately on the question of spirit regeneration, as a prime essential to give the socialist power to obtain a nature that would enable him to practice his principles. It completely showed up the unfitness of Robert Owen's philosophy to found a new state of society ; as far as mere theory went it was an advance from Owen's basis but it was equally impracticable. Finding myself baffled in all my efforts, my attention was next directed to the Shahers. I found in them all the substance of what&gt;Owen and Greaves had put forth, and nothing was then left for me but to close in with Shakerism and thus realize all the good I had a conception of; and I can assure you, my friend, there has been no barren results in pursuing this end. I united with this Society in the year 1845, and have not yet seen the moment I had cause to regret doing so. I see no reason why all socialists may not finally arrive at the same if they would ouly be true to their best light giveu iu that movement. I thank you kindly for the portrait of G. J. Holyoake; he is a veteran, the most practical of all socialists, and lias been more successful than Lloyd Jones, who died of a brokeu heart caused by the failure of his plans of cooperat:on. It would be pleasing to us to hear from you again at your convenience. You do not inform us if you are a socialist, yet I should judge you to be friendly to the cause, although not of the modern stamp, which, from repeated failure, and because the light of socialism is as yet only related to the Animal Intellectual has become the hot-bed of all vain attempts to force a new state of society into existence. The Shakers have stood because they deny self, the socialists fail because they do not. Wishing you much happiness in all good, I am, Yours, Robert Aitken.
