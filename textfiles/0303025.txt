GENTLE DEEDS Andante. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Gentle deeds are 2. It is ours to 3. O, it is a ever forming Verdant spots within each heart; Whence shall spring the plants of virtue, Flow'rs that incense sweet impart; be progressing, And to toil with ardent thought, That our lives may mer it blessing, And with hoIiness be fraught, blessed haven. Where no blighted pow'rs remain; Where unholy strife is banish'd, And pure love our souls enchain. Such shall wa ken thoughts most holy; Bring to life some germ of love; Cause as pir ings true and lasting, For the powers that lift above. Morn shall ope with new desires; Evening shall their strength increase; While the angels find our spirits Eesting in the realms of peace. Here in union we are leaving All the glit'ring dust of earth; Seeking only the immortal, Which will give us angel birth.
