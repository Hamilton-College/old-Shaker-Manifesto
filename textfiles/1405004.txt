EDUCATION. No. 6. Its Source and Course. CALVIN G. REED. 'O wad some pow'r the gifite gie us To see ourselves as ithers see us ! It wad frae monie a blunder free us And foolish notion ; What airs in dress and eait wad lea'e us And e'en devotion. ' Thoughtful Reader ; ï¿½We are living in an eventful era. The opinions and philosophies that have ruled mankind for ages, are smitten with transition and decay, and are passing away. New ones are demanding an audience in the interests of humanity. The times call imperatively for nerve and spirit, perception and wisdom, and devoted intelligent pioneers in the vanguard of the invincible army of the onward mighty march of Mind. The pulse of a new inspiration is beating in the life channels of the thoughtFill contemplative world. The errors, inconsistencies, and imperfections of past systems and methods, resting like an incubus upon the republic of intelligence, binding its energies, crushing its aspirations, and dwarfing its healthy growth, by an iron-bound conservatism are being repelled by restive spirits Avho are putting forth their god-like energies to liberate themselves aud the race, from the dominion and influence of their paralyzing, deathly coils. People are becoming, more and moi-e, alienated from speculative creeds and dogmas, whether in theology or philosophy. The churches and clergy of all denominations, are losing their hold on the confidence and affections of the masses. People are wearying of seeking in the fanciful, baseless idealism of Utopia for substantial goodness and perfection. Mankind are becoming independent in thought aud judgment, and arc assuming the prerogative to decide for themselves, in matters pertaining to their present and eternal welfare. Dictation is distasteful, and coercion repulsive to them. But these were the rules of the past: 'Do it if you will, if not, we will compel you. ' Now compulsion is opposed, and coercion discountenanced by progressive minds, and incentive is preferred as the motive power to draw and hold the human heart to the right. This is God's plan, and why should man reverse it? The aim of enlightened reason is, to discover the basic principles on which rest the development and success of the human mind, and to use the processes emanating from these principles in the culture and education of the immortal soul. Partial aims and narrow conceptions, do not answer the demands. Those who endeavor to build systems on such a basis will surely fail, as they surely ought. A sound system of education includes the entire requisitions of intelligent immortal beings, and these should be placed at their command as soon as individuals become sufficiently matured in mind to appreciate their advantage and use. In the brief period of our earth life, we can master but little more, if any, than the rudiments of the encyclopedia of knowledge, but how many endeavor to take even the initiatory degrees ? And how few there are who encourage the acquisition of knowledge at all. Our first steps taken in the domain of intelligence, were in the nursery and home of our infancy. Our garnered stock of valuable ideas, we gleaned from the objective world, and not from books, luring the first years of childhood. We saw the accumulated furniture, finish, and tapestry, the inmates and associates of our father's and mother's hou;e. Our parents taught us to lisp the names of the objects and persons that had become our familiar associates, and eventually to notice their forms, qualities, and differences, and to name them. We had learned to express our thoughts according to the model of our exemplars and fireside teachers, long before we took our seat in Pedagogue Hall. We had made some progress in studying the lessons and the problems in the grand volume of God's handy works, spread out before us on the beautiful pages of the attractive book of Nature, artistically illustrated by the skillful Designer and Omniscient Creator of the universe of worlds. We had become familiar with our native brook and rivers ; vales and dells ; hills and mountains ; fields and forests ; beasts and birds ; flowers and fruits ; and the starry realm within the boundary of our horizon and scope of vision ; before we knew that the alphabet and books possessed any significance, contained an item of information, or were of any practical benefit. Man in his pristine state, had not even the advantage of the fireside education. Living, undoubtedly, like the animals, (who were but a trifle his inferiors,) without shelter save what the grand majestic forests, awning rocks, mountain caves, overhanging cliffs, and vine-embowered dells afforded him; and clad only in his native dress ; all the knowledge he gained came from the silentteachers of his daily surroundings, and his imperative demands, which were few and simple.
