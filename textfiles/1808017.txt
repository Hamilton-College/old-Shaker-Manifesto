DISCIPLINE THE THOUGHTS. Those who are interested in the promotion of peace and happiness among their fellow men, will willingly exercise a little care for the benefit of their own cultivation and as anxiously assist, so far as they are able, in establishing a love for the the truth and no less an interest for a thorough discipline over the thoughts. Idle and impure words are the legitimate offspring of a class of thoughts of corresponding character. The Psalmist was, without doubt, dwelling with solicitude upon this subject when he penned that worthy, godly admonition. 'Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile.' So essential is this in the preserving of peace among mankind, that to be doubly sure of success in selfgovernment, we make this petition, 'Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth : keep thou the door of my lips.' Certainly, the sons of God should have a pure language, as this would go far to establish the truthfulness of their heavenly origin. Indeed, we may suppose this was the case, as a deviation so marked as to have every imagination evil, met with a severe rebuke in the early history of the race. 'And G-od saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the heart was evil continually.' Such a state of the mind was a great departure from God's law, and culminated as we might have supposed it would, in the ruin of nearly all of the human family. A discipline of the thoughts has been a subject which many of the inspirational writers of the Bible have kept, in all clearness, before the people. 'Let the unrighteous man forsake his [unrighteous] thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord.' He had gone from God. In all probability he had made friends of the wicked, and his thoughts were like the company he kept. The advice of the prophet, '' Forsake your wicked ways, change your thoughts and return to the Lord,' was the only sure road to success. To justify the indulgence in thinking', having for a plea that a person cannot control the thoughts may have some force in a crude, vulgar mind, as the habit of drinking, gives a plea to the man that keeps company with social tipplers and is a constant visitor to the sample room. If Jesus was correct, and we think he was, he knew quite well what he was anxious to cultivate among those who came to hear him. He said, ' The good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things.' It is quite evident that such a man must 'delight in the law of the Lord,' and take pleasure in having a strict discipline over the mind. Books or conversation suggestive of evil or impure thoughts may so far corrupt the miud, as to change the whole course of a person's life, and like the fires of the hidden volcano, break out at a time and place when least expected. The indifference assumed by some persons in the remark,�'It does me no harm,' may not terminate even so well as it did with honest old Tray, that was found in bad company. There is great danger in becoming familiar with any form of wrong doing. It may not seem particularly unpleasant at first, and may possibly elicit the approbative smile, but so certain as the influence has a tendency toward error, it will by farther development lead to ruin. The vivid illustration of this subject by the poet, is the very embodiment of truth. 'Vice is a monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs only to be seen; Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace.' St. Paul in his advice to the church of Corinth, recommended the Brethren ' to bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.' Could he have spoken more directly to the point ? His knowledge of the treatment of the Roman captives, gave great power to his form of speech. He had, in all probability, witnessed the triumphal processions where captive kings and queens, loaded with chains or with halters around their necks, were marched abjectly behind the car of the victorious monarch. These were brought into captivity, and so thoroughly subdued that they had not the least power to act. The apostle would have the thoughts as thoroughly under the control cf the mind as these captives were under the conqueror. It was a forcible representation of the power of the victor and of the hopeless state of the captive. Corinthian soldiers of the cross of Christ who were engaged in the spiritual warfare, might with honor treat their evil thoughts as the victors treated their captives. St. Paul says, secure every thought and allow those only to go from you that are in obedience to the spirit of Christ. If the teachers of two thousand years ago were so earnest in their endeavor to establish a careful regard for the thoughts, lest they corrupt the mind, we certainly should be stimulated to a much greater faithfulness in this respect. It is with pleasure that we notice the agitation of this subject, and the formation of a society that can glory in this beautiful, evangelical motto,�'Keep thyself pure.' Gathering under the protection of the ' White Cross' they can pledge, in all fidelity, with a promising hope of victory. They agree to abstain, carefully and persistently, from all rude or impure language and from all coarse and vulgar jests. They not only promise to make this a special work for themselves, but also to assist all others in accomplishing the same. That an abundance of good fruit may be gathered by this society of benevolent, moral workers, will be the fervent prayer of every Christian mind.
