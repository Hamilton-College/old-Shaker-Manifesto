Beloved Elder Henry Blinn... Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., July, 1893. Beloved Eldek Heney Blinn;ï¿½In the 'Cultivator and Country Gentleman,' (June 22) of which I send you a copy, by same mail you will find an article under the heading, 'Shall We Eat Meat?' If you have room for its reprint in the Manifesto ; it may again claim the attention of some of our people to prepare their minds for that mode of life which will prove to be the best for the present and of necessary acceptance in days to come. With kind love. Kespectfully yours, Ernest Pick.
