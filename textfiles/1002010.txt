BEGIN THE NEW YEAR RIGHT DANIEL ORCUTT In entering upon the new year, the important truth should be remembered, that in the struggle for eternal life, we must work if we would win. If we would end the year with spiritual prosperity, we must commence it with self-denial and self-discipline; these are necessary prerequisites for the kingdom of heaven. It is the cross bearing work that makes life noble. ' No cross no crown.' In vain are all our efforts if truth and purity form no part of our characters. Suppose that we make these virtues none of our familiar acquaintances; we are sure to find life miserable. None are safe and wise,but the honest and pure. Be true; love and practice virtue. There is 'a still small voice,' that is a reminder of these things. We need to work up to a high plane of spiritual life, to gain immortal riches, and just here, at the ' gateway of the new year,' is the place to begin; and to 32 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. obtain them, truth and purity must be cultivated, for these habits imply a whole train of noble virtues, which insure real happiness to all their votaries. ' Virtue alone is happiness below.' The true and virtuous are angelic â€” childlike ; and Christ said of little children, ' of such is the kingdom of heaven.' We cannot be too honest nor virtuous. Virtue is a bright jewel, richer than gold, rubies, or precious gems. To obtain it, our hearts, which are the seat of principles, must be right, clean, pure. Who hesitates to enlist on the side of purity ? We would all find heaven; why not make it a point to be honest and virtuous, thus fitting ourselves for the home where we wish to go ? Enfield, Conn.
