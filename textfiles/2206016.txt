Canaan, N. Y. Apr. 1892. Beloved Elder Henry;It gives us great pleasure to read the 'Home Notes' ia the Manifesto and so we thought we would add our mite also. A little practical common sense is much more interacting and instructive than dry theology. The former contains the essence of true religion and whenever brought into activity, has always benefited humanity; while the latter has caused bitter strife and angry contests and consequently great suffering. / We are a little band few in number and young in years, enjoying a beautiful home In the lovely land of Canaan. We think and study, and are trying to learn and comprehend truth in its simplicity and reduce it to practice. We are trying to solve the problem of getting a living minus hirelings, as the hired element is antagonistic to pure Christianity. It savors too much of the master and slave principle to be tolerated by a religious Community, and we hope that in the march of progress mechanics will be developed and educated in our institution that we may be entirely relieved of this great evil, which like a canker worm is sapping the life out of the best fruit of our Order. Our three good Brethren and six boys have labored indefatigably the past winter. They have procured a good supply of ice, chopped down trees, hauled the logs home, sawed, split and piled wrood for home consumption, and made brooms, besides attending to all other duties peculiar to farming without any hired help. The Sisters also heartily co-operate, all are determined to maintain the principle, though it cramps our acquisitiveness and even deprives us of some of this world's goods which we now deem indispensable; the oss of which however might redound to our advantage in the ultimate. The sacrifice would seem trifling when compared with the great spiritual benefits consequently derived, resulting from a lively growth and development of a Community reared on the divine base of justice mercy and love. Forming a paradise, a home whose attractions would be so strong, whose internal influence so potent, as to be clearly seen and felt by truth- loving souls. School for both boys and girls has been ably taught by one of our Sisters the proof of which is seen in the improvement of the pupils. E. O.
