The Making of Pictures. By Mrs. Sarah W. Whitman. Boston and Chicago: The Interstate Publishing Co. Price GO cents. The. Making of Pictures is the title of twelve short talks upon art with young people,.by Mrs. Sarah W. Whitman. They deal with the principles which underlie the various branches and processes of art�oil and water-color painting, etching, engraving, photography and the reproductive processes. This instruction is prefaced by a chapter upon 'The Beginnings of Art Training,' and supplemented by �ne upon ' Exhibitions and Sales. ' Although the volume is not a large one, it contains more sound, practical sense regarding art than most of the elaborate and costly works that have been written upon the same subject. Its author is an artist and understands fully what she is writing about. She has ,-i direct, straightforward style, opinions based on study and experience, and competent reasons for them. She insists that in art, as well as in morals or in mathematics, there are great laws to go by, and that without a knowledge of these laws one cannot speak of pictures intelligently. Art is not mere imitation ; it is the expression upon canvas or paper, not only of what the artist sees, but of what he feels and thinks, and this is done in accordance with the laws of composition, of form, of color, and of light and shade. However simple a picture may seem to be, the making of it involves careful and obedient intelligence to all these laws. In the chapters upon the processes, Mrs. Whitman docs not attempt to instruct farther than the broad, underlying principles of each, so that the book is not in any sense a ' handbook.' To the young reader with a taste for art in any of its forms it will afford valuable assistance .
