LIFE ARGUMENT One of the strongest arguments favoring Christianity has been that no one has regretted its practice on the death-bed. We present a stronger and strongest: No one having lived it, and enjoyed the purity and excellence of its radical features, ever wished to live or die by any other life doctrine. The half-way, hybrid, hypocritical and Pharisaical profession of Christianity which bears the name but evades the requirements, is sufficiently odious to make a respectable lower animal sick of it, and to long for a creed that teaches annihilation as a substitute. The death-bed is no place to create a criterion, but the active, healthy, good-sensed man or woman can tell the truth more effectually.
