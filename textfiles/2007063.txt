The Two Sides of the School Question The Two Sides of the School Question, by Cardinal Gibbous and P.i,-hop Keane on the one side, and Edwin D. Mead and ITon. John Jay on the other. From the Arnold Pub. Co., of Boton, Mass. Pi ice 10 cents. The careful perusal of this litt'e ] amphlet will lichly repay any observant reader, as it embodies the beautifully chosen language of i'oar eminent scholars, who in their awakened zeal are contendiii�- for the best inte � ests of their chosen party. As this has become one of the vital questions of the day, it crosses the threshold of nearly every family and awakens more or less active thought for the present and future welfare of our country, and indeed of our homes. When our public schools become the subject of denominational controversy and the contestants are Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians, it is at once circumscribed within the narrow limits of ereeda.l churches, and immediately assumes the character of a leligious or holy (?) war. In those countries where the civil power acts in concert with the religious power, they form the dominant party and rule all others, agreeably to their own will, and the people can neither- learl), preach, pray nor sing only as they receive permission. In these schools a governmental religion is taught and all minor sects are ignored. From this sectarian influence arises the trouble that has grown in the public schools of the [J. 8. As our government rests on civil or judicial foundation, it should S:&gt;hinx-like, neither smile nor frown on the leligious faith of any class; and our publicschools like our government is for the civil education of the pupils and should not be open to the promulgation of the ;eligious dogmas of an / sect. The churches being the a -kiio-.vledgeJ educators of the multiplied �h.a'es of religious belief, can ius-irurt their chiYlien in the catechism, agreeably t &gt; their own peculiar notions, and no one need to be disturbed, but a doaiaiint Teiigious body that carries the s.vord, whether ru'ed by the creed of the Catholic or of the Pi otestant, points unerringly, the renal.-itrant, to the fires of Smithfield and to the loathsome dungeons of Salem. Do not fail to send for the pamphlet, and see what may be said about the -publicschools.
