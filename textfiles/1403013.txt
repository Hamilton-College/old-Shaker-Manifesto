BIBLICAL. NO. 2. BY H. C. BLINN. In the revision of the New Testament, several changes have been made that are well worthy of a careful perusal. All would wish to use the best word and especially one that may be clearly defined according to our present understanding. Wherever the term Holy Ghost occurs, it should be changed to Holy Spirit; as Matt, iii., 11. ' He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, (Holy Spirit) and with fire. ' A decided improvement is also made in other places and the reader or speaker can now have a choice of words. For devil, read demon. ' damnation, ' condemnation, judgment, justice. ' tempting, trying. ' hell, hades. ' miracles, signs ' Master, Teacher. It is really curious to noie the large number of variations and alterations that have been made, both by the addition and the erasure of words and sentences. Nearly every chapter, throughout the whole New Testament, has been more or less changed. It had become pretty thoroughly riveted in the minds of all Protestant denominations that the book was written by direct inspiration from God, and hence not one word could be changed or erased without committing a very great trespass against the Holy Spirit. Some have even maintained that every word from the first of Genesis to the last of Revelation was the work of full inspiration of God, and in proof of this referred to 2 Tim. iii., 16. 'All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. ' This the revisers have thought best to change and it now reads, 'Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness. ' No one would suppose that the Christian revisers took much burden on account of these traditions, when we see the thorough pruning which they have given to some of the passages, as Matt, iv., 24. 'And his fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those that were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. ' This verse now reads, 'And the report of him went forth into all Syria; and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons and epileptic and palsied; and he healed them.' As might be expected the text is very much improved, and yet all that is essential to a correct understanding is retained. In the sixth chapter, ninth verse they have changed, 'children of God' to 'sons of God. ' We prefer the old form as that included both son? and daughters, while the revised text has the masculine, dominating sense which so thoroughly fills the old Testament. In Matt, v., 22, two essential changes are made. ' Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. ' Those who wrote the Testament for King James in 1611, took the liberty to add a few words as a paliation to their own consciences. They probably wanted the scriptures to sanction their anger and hatred toward their brethren, and so added to the text,�' without a cause, ' which would make their inquisitions and persecutions, justifiable. Those who �ay,�'Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire, ' but we must now think that he will be in danger of the Gehenna of fire, or of being cast into the valley of Hinnom, a place near the city of Jerusalem where ' all refuse of the city was cast, and where the combustible portions of that refuse were consumed by fire.' Kitto says that 'we are so little acquainted with the state in which we shall be hereafter, and with the nature of our future body, that no strictly, literal representation of punishment could be made intelligible to us.' Matt, v., 44. 'But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you. ' More than one half of this verse, as good as it was, did not belong to the sayings of Jesus, and on this account is not in the revision. It now reads : ' But I say unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you. ' The Lord's prayer, Matt, vi., has several changes, and now is in this form :�'Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we have also forgiven our debtors. And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. ' To lead us or bring us into temptation seems very much alike, and as though God did really intend to lead or bring us into places of temptation. There are other forms of translation which, for us, read better than the above. ' Abandon us not, or give us not up unto temptation. '�Shaker. ' Abandon us not to trial, but preserve us from evil.'�Emphatic Diaglott. Paul in 1 Cor. x., 13, says 'There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man ; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.' To lead one into temptation and then provide a way for them to escape would seem rather tantalizing. In the epistle of James i., 14, the matter is fully and clearly seated, so that no one need be in doubt in regard to the source of temptations. The closing words of the prayer; 'For thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever, Amen.' are now thrown out as spurious. Dean Alford says they are not found in any of the most ancient Mss., and were not noticed by the Greek or Latin fathers. Shall we ask, Who inserted them? (TO BE CONTINUED.)
