Pleasant Hill, Ky. Nov. 1896. Providence has dealt graciously with us the past season. Since early May until October we have had a bountiful supply of fruits and vegetables. Strawberries, cherries and peaches have been very plentiful and a daily supply of peaches from the first of June till the first of Oct. Apples have been a limited crop. The beautiful green grass is now supplemented by the various tints of the autumnal leaves which the eye is not tired of seeing. The potato crop, both sweet and northern has been of the best quality. The roofs of several of our dwellings have been painted and beside the preservation of the buildings it adds very much to the beauty of our gospel home. N. L. Rupe.
