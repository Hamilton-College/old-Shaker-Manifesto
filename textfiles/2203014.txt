East Canterbury, N. H Weather Record, for Jan. 1892. Highest Temp, during the mo. 48. Lowest ' ' Mean ' ' Total Precipitation Total Snowfall, 1ST. 8. ' 18.4 3.78 in. ' 10 in. A. BEiaGs. Feb. 5, 1892. Just now we are rejoicing through hope of having a few days for good sleighing. Up to this date the farmers have indulged largely in speculations about the woi'k that must be done on runners before spring. Now the horses and oxen may be used to advantage in the hauling of wood and timber. One paper says: 'Now is the time for revivals;' and the sleepy boy says at an early hour,'Now is the time to go to bed,' and the last remark is about as spiritual as the first. The ice harvest has been secured and it is said to be of excellent quality. It was fifteen inches thick, but being cut into cakes with the aid of horses, it made the work comparatively easy, and at the end of the second day the house was well filled, and 150 tons had been secured for the warm season of 1892. Even this quantity of ice is insufficient to supply the demand. Referring to an old record we find that in 1840 a boy with a wheelbarrow could take the needed supply of ice to the kitchens and dairy, while at the present date it requires one or two men and a span of horses several hours during the day and this not less than twice each week. The drinking of iced water becomes a habit the same as does the drinking of tea and coffee and is probably quite as injurious to the system.
