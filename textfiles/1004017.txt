This Number Of the Manifesto will be found full of grand articles from talented contributors. Could we present such an array of truths invariably, we would willingly lay our pen down. We call especial attention to articles from Elders A very, Fraser, Eads and Evans. Barring the antique style of pronouns.

That ' Lizzie Morton ' we more than suspect is the same who answered Charlotte Cushman more than forty years ago, and the conclusion of which verily seemed to be always in Charlotte's mind: ' And when some flattering knaves around your pathway tread, Just think of what a Shaker girl has said!' We have no apologies to make for the music, it is simply splendid and beautiful.
