BRYANT CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATION By Martha J. Anderson THE centennial birthday of William Cullen Bryant was commemorated by the 'Self-Improvement Society' of the North family of Shakers at Mt. Lebanon in their last weekly meeting. There was a nicely formed circle of twenty members; a large bouquet of the last flowers of summer was placed on a circular stand in the centre and added brightness and cheerfulness to the well-lighted room.

The following sonnet was written in the centre of a large sheet of white paper, artistically embellished with birds, and encircled with beautiful Ampdopsis leaves, rich in color and varied as the hues of autumn : WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT.â€”BORN NOVEMBER 3, 1794 By Martha J. Anderson A century's close dims not thy glorious fame, Thou loyal son of brave New England sires, Who at their hearth-stones kindled freedom's fires And won by valorous deeds an honored name. A noble lineage holds thee in claim; Thy soul was cradled 'neath these forest spires Where 'God's First Temples' wakened high desires, And inspiration fanned Faith's sacred flame. Thy dream of youth in 'Thanatopsis' given Into thy closing days its beauty wrought, And gave thee access to a loftier heaven Than is by creed or cringing error brought. All honor to thy blessed memory, Long live the praise of thy sweet minstrelsy. A most interesting biographical sketch was compiled and read by Lydia Staples. Then followed an original character sketch.
