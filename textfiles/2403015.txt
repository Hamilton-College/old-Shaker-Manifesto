NOW. If you have a kind word, say it; Throbbing hearts soon sink to rest; If you owe a kindness, pay it; Life's sun hurries to the west. Can you do a kind deed, do it, From despair some soul to save; Bless each day as you pass through it, Marching onward to the grave. If some grand thing for to-morrow You are dreaming, do it now; From the future do not borrow; Frost soon gathers on the brow. Speak thy word, perform thy duty ; Night is coming deep with rest; Stars will gleam in fadeless beauty, Grasses whisper o'er thy breast. Days for deeds are few, my brother; Then to-day fulfill thy vow; If you mean to help another, Do not dream it, do it now. ï¿½Selected.
