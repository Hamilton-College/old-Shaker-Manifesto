AGE. MARY WHITCHER. 'We're growing old,' How strange is life and fate ! We're born, we live, and soon are told We must be gone, 'tis growing late. How stealthily the seasons pass; And yet how slow, through toil and xjain We count the ill, the good, alas, Moves on without a thought or name. Let even measure take the stand, The debt and credit of this life ;â€” We've nought to hold and nought to hand, As over balance through the strife. Canterbury, N. H.
