COURAGE. 'Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'John, viii., 32. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. We see it! oh we see it! The dawning red and gold, The promise of the 2. We see it! oh we see it! The gates of sunlight ope, And morning writes with altar flame that coming clays enfold,Tho' throbbing darkness circles the rainbow tints new messages of hope, Wide floats the snowy banner for tempest's mighty form, Tho light of Revelation will dissipate the storm, all the earth unfurled,Truth lifts her standard heavenward that will redeem the world. We see it! oh we see it! As harbingers of light, We lift our voices to proclaim, That God will speed the right.
