IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THE SKIN Looking at the complicated mechanism of our bodies from a popular standpoint, we should say, perhaps, that the brain is the most important part of us ; but that would be a mistake; not only the brain, but the stomach and kidneys are less necessary to life than our skin. Reflect upon the matter for a moment ; you can go without food for several days and not suffer serious injury; your liver may cease to act for a week, and you can attend to your business as usual; the brain may be paralyzed for months, and life goes on ; but if the functions of the skin are suspended for two hours, death follows. Take a dog or cat, and dip the animal into melted parafflne or tallow, so that the skin excretions and secretions are suspended,and the animal will die almost as quickly as if ten grains of strychnine had been administered. The skin is a most important auxiliary to the lungs in the process of aeration of the blood, and so intimate the connection, or so similar and important are its functions, that when death ensues from skin obstructions, all the conditions resemble those occasioned by cutting off air from the lungs. More deaths from consumption are caused primarily by skin obstructions than from any original weakness or disease in the lungs. The lungs are the first of the important organs to be influenced by derangements of the skin, and they often become congested or disorganized through secondary causes.
