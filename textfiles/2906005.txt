In Memory of Eldress ELIZA R. SMITH. By Mary Ann Walker. 'In the midst of life, ice are in death.' A sheaf fully ripened for the house of the Lord. The Harvest Angel has . gathered it home. Our loved mother has entered her heavenly home, bearing palms of victory, and rejoicing in the conquest won. She counted no sacrifice too great that would enable her to h'lp other sou s toward God. Hers has been a long life of usefulness in the gospel cause. We loved her for h.?r many noble, Christian virtues. lier kin I and charitable disposition toward all, won for her many friends. Those who were privileged to live under her blessed ministration, know that she was a safe counselor, true and faithful in every duty. How we shall miss her cheerful smile and her kind words ! For us she has toiled with unselfish devotion, that we might gain an inheritance in the kingdom of God. Dearest mother, words can not express the love and gratitude which we feel for the parental love and care you have bestowed upon us. You have been to us a wall of protection, through the days of youth, and guided our feet in the path that leads to peace. Still be with us, to cheer and comfort us while on the journey of life. Take our pledge that we will wo.k tor the principles of truth. Alfred, Me.
