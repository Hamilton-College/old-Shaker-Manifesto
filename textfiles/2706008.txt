Shakers, N. Y. May, 1897. Action is the watchword at present in the agricultural and horticultural domain. The tillers of the soil are preparing it for the reception of the good seed and will anxiously watch its growth and defend it against its many foes in the shape of weeds and injurious insects. We hope that the harvest will be one that will gladden their hearts. That nature abhors a vacuum is proven by the fact that whatever the preparations may be for sowing the good seed if it is not placed in the ground where it can receive warmth and moisture to cause its latent powers to come forth into a more advanct life, its place will be filled by he tares which will be a hindrance to its development. The harmony that exists in the forces that are denominated the material and the spiritual is such that the line can not be drawn which is to decide where one ends and the other begins. In both there are the seasons of seed-time and harvest, and also the silent winter of rest waiting for the resurrection of the spring-time. May not the present be that season in which our spiritual forces are being strengthened for the coming compaign? The prospect at present is looking favorable for all kinds of fruit. We would just whisper to our good Editor that we planted some melon seeds a few days ago and will guard their growth very carefully, hoping the Editor will make his appearance when they are ripe.
