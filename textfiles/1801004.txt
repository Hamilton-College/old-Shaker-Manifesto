THE NEW YEAR Agnes E. Newton We've finished the page and turned the leaf To begin another year; We've reviewed the same, balanced account, Our credit and debt made clear. We've written the lines we thought to write With earnest and soulful care; When the New Year dawned with snowy page And our hearts were bowed in prayer. The record is there, never erased, The false nor the true can be ; 'Tis written we know for more than time, It stands for eternity. Yet we find our hearts are striving today With purpose still firm and true ; To profit by truths the past has taught And gladly accept the new. Unchanging the law of perfect growth, The new shall succeed the old; E'en the blighted fields and barren waste Shall verdure and bloom unfold. Then welcome the cross and life of Christ, Creating all things anew; We pray that its light, our souls, may guide And inspire the whole year through. The sorrows or joys the New Year brings, The Christian heart can meet; Where Christ is enthroned, in vain the storms And tempests of life may beat. Ah! hidden with Christ, a safe retreat, His mission and law our guide; The tempter may come but nothing find As we in the Vine abide. Canterbury, N. H.
