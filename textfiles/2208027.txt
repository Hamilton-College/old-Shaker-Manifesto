Union Village, Ohio. July, 1892. The 4th. of July is passed and the ordinary amount of powder burning, firecrackers, broken limbs and loss of eyes has transpired, and this morning all who have not been killed or wounded can reassume their wonted avocations. The Believers at Union Tillage do not meddle with such things, so we were quietly engaged hoeing and replanting our beet field, cleaning the yard, cutting our wheat, mowing weeds in the street, each side of which was plowed during the winter for our ten miles of hedge which was set out this spring by the Dayton Hedge Co. Among those who visit us there seems to be more inquirers among men and even more who enter the Society than are to be found among the women visitors. This scarcity makes it very hard on the Sisters, who nevertheless are all the time doing their level best to keep up their side of the cause, and their zeal and faithfulness are absolutely above all praise. We have now about two thousand seven hundred young fruit trees, but this season there is scarcely any fruit of any kind in our Society and in fact in southwestern Ohio. Crops likely to be good, except wheat, which is badly rusted in some fields. Health and peace prevail at Union Village. Elder Joseph came West because he could not stand the severe Xew England winter, but if he does not take care of himself better than he has so far, he will not stand this nor any other climate long, unless it is the one beyond the silent river. Our office is gradually nearing completion of repairs and we hope to be able to occupy it before many weeks. There seems to be but little inspiration or conviction among mankind, but we keep sending out tracts, leaflets and pamphlets, to direct their attention toward our gospel home. This is our instruction, and the Bible says; 'Be thou instructed O Jerusalem, lest my spirit depart from thee and thou become desolate, a City not inhabited.' Jer. vi., 8. O. C. H.
