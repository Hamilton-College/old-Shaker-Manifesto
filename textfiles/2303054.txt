Books and Papers. Phrenological Journal and Science of Health In the Phrenological Journa l and Science of Health for February, fresh and notable features claim attention. Among them an appreciative sketch of President Diaz, of Mexico, a personal 'Phrenograph' of the Rev. Dr. McGlynn (now so conspicuous in Roman Catholic affairs,) which has, we understand, received the approval of the clerical champion of the poor. A concise yet very graphic account of the late General Butler, is contributed by a new and skillful hand in observing character. In the department of Practical Phrenology, the fresh installments in 'Heads and Faces,' and 'Human Pursuits' are very interesting. So much may be said also of Mrs. C. F. Wells' Reminiscences in Early Phrenological Biography. In Science of Health the editor gives a second installment of the very valuable article on the use of rectal infections. A million copies of the number should be taken by the people for this article alone. The editorial and correspondent departments are more than usually rich in suggestions. This magazine is issued at the popular price of $1.50 a year or 15 cents a number. Address, Fowler &amp; Wells Co., Publishers, 27 East 21st St., New York.
