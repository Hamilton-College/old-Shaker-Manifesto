YOUTHFUL EXPERIENCE. MARGARETTE DAVIS. Although quite young we Avish to answer some of the many questions we have been asked by friends and strangers who visit our Community and are often taken into our Schools and places of business. Q. Are you happy? Do you love your home? Do you think you will always stay with the Shakers? Ans. We are early instructed to use good manners, to treat every one with politeness giving a civil answer to all civil questions; but to our childish mind this manner of questioning, by strangers, hardly seemed polite. We could see no reason why we should not love and be happy with the friends who had been more to us than natural parents could have been, for they not only provided physical comforts and mental culture but also labored with an enduring patience to inspire our young minds with a love for the beautiful life of our Savior. When younger we did not know as we now do that children, educated in this Community are considered somewhat as are those who have been placed in Charitable institutions, and persons not understanding the religious principle which prompts Believers to receive children into their homes might think it possible for the little ones to suffer from a lack of love and kind treatment as they sometimes might in those places. TVe. however, have only a youthful evidence to give, and to give this truthfully must first admit that we have been faulty. More than seventy times seven we have asked the forgiveness of our friends and up to the present hour have never met a refusal; nay,ï¿½more than this, the perfect kindness with which this blessing has ever been granted fully, assured us that the hasty word or unkind action was forgiven and forgotten by our friends. Encircled with so much love and Christian solicitude could any ordinary child be other than happy? Could she picture in her mind an ideal home, or associations that could be better? We think not, and although this parental care often fails to make reliable and permanent members of all the children who have shared this blessing, still, they continue to sow with Christian goodness the precious seed in every little heart that is drawn by the Father, even though they may be no more promising than those who have already gone out; 'For they know not which shall perish nor which shall be spared to bloom.'' In answer to the question, Do you think you will always stay with the Shakers? we can say, 'As the twig is bent the tree is inclined. ' If childhood is impressed with the beauty of the Christian life, as taught by this people, and are able to be baptized with the spirit of the same, we will abide very naturally within the percincts of its principles, and in growing older our ambition Avill be to establish a Christian character and to become trustworthy members of Society.
