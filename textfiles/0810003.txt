What HAS Been Done MAY Be MARY WHITCHER The old expression, long so true, What man has done, same man may do, The other tide we now would view 'What not, then how can we? We have a thought on married lifeâ€” Where long has been the earnest strife For purest joys with pleasures rife, Which never yet we see. We do not think we could outvie, Showing the past has been a lie, A.nd should succeed, if we should try, But fail, as others have. What never has beneath the sun, Been a success by any one ; We will not think, we could have done, And mid the sunshine live. But we believe that just the shade, Which has our betters overspread, 242 THE SHAKER Would all have been upon our head, If Peasant, King or Queen. And we should had the sour, the miff, Our food without and season with, And all our life as full of if As ever has been seen. Canterbury, N. H.
