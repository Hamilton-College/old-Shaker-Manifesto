BE KIND. Mary Whitcher. Ne'er turn away for one misstep That's taken by a friend, But patient wait and give them time To see their fault and mend. Hold out in love and blessing too, For such is gospel grace, The erring swiftly turn from you, The righteous still embrace And hold you kindly in their care As God doth hold his own, And through their fervency and prayer Will bring you safely home. Canterbury, N. H.
