WAIT TILL TO-MORROW. [ Contributed by Lydia Dole, Sonyea, N. Y. ] An old lady, noted for her shrewd insight into the characters of young people, said lately : ' I owe much of the content and happiness in my life to a trifling incident which oc- curred in my girlhood. Like many ugly girls of sixteen I was morbid and jealous, craving sympathy, longing for a change, certain that a lonely future lay before me. There were, too, circumstances in our family relations that made me miserable. This misery I felt would last forever. One day I was in a boat in a wide river with my mother. The water was full of small boats which passed and repassed us, moving to and fro, darting from bank to bank. ' 'Helen,' my mother said, after I had poured out some of my misery to her, 'you leave wholly out of your ideas of life, its change. You will go through this world just as you do through this river. 'The people near you will fall back or shoot ahead of you, but they will never occupy again the position to you which they do now. The ban s and scenery will never be the same to you one hour as they will be the next. You find those who are cruel and foolish now ; but five years hence they and you will both have changed your base and grown into different persons. ' Lay aside your hates and your sorrows for a year or two, put them out of your mind, and you will find that the cause for them has disappeared.' 'The idea pleased my fancy. I remembered it. If I found acquaintances disagreeable or malicious, I deferred my hate for them for a year or two ; and lo ! they were gone out of my way or had altered into friendly, pleasant members. If I tugged at some root of monstrous evil to no purpose, I bided God's time, and it crumbled away. In short, I have learned to depend on tomorrow as a cure for all of to-day's ills.' This kind of teaching seems like the most hackneyed platitude to middle-aged people, who have seen the strange revenges brought on by the whirligig of time; who know that characters of men and women do alter, and that the sharpest grief will wear out. But if the young could be made to believe it, how much pain they would avoid, passing by on the other side. They are so sure of their convictions ! Their unpleasant neighbor is a villain of deepest dye, their loneliness of soul will last till death, their grief is immortal. Perhaps only time itself can teach them the healing quality of time, or that ï¿½' The darkest day, Wait till to-morrow, will have passed away.' Selected.
