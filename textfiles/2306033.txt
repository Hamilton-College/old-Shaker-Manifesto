Union Village, O. May, 1893. We have not yet planted one hill of corn on account of rain, rain, rain. But if we are favored with a warm, dry, late fall, there is time enough yet for a crop of corn. *ï¿½ School is still in session. I like to write Home Notes because I feel a little relief from the surveillance of conventional propriety which haunts me when writing on more abstruse subjects. We have three quite intelligent inquirers here at present, and may they conclude to sell all and 'buy that field.' Everything that can grow without being planted is fresh and green, and as we raise many cattle and horses for sale, our pastures are in a very propitious condition, which is a thing to be thankful for, amid a thousand other blessings which we are daily and hourly in receipt of. We are trying to insist on more cleanliness in regard to houses, floors, stairs, steps, walks and dooryards. As to the person, it ought to be a matter of supererogation to insist on cleanliness in that, to any one called to purity of life as Believers all are. I am going to plant a little Okra (Abelmoschus Esculentus) and when ripe mix it half and half with store coffee to see if it will be about as good and half as dear as the genuine article. We would do better to quit the coffee altogether, but 'all men can not receive this saying.' So in this as in most other things, as we can not rise perpendicularly, we have to move up to better conditions on an inclined plane. Our good Sisters, Eldress Clymena Miner, Eldress Temperance Devan, and Sister Kebecca Armstrong are on a short visit to Watervliet, Ohio. Elder Lafayette Parker and Br. George Bushman are here from Whitewater on a short visit. Eldress Adaline Wells expects to return with them to her former home, after spending many years at Watervliet as first in care; afterwards at Union Village as a member of the board of Ministry, then Eldress of the South family, and lastly, as first in care at Pleasant Hill for two or three years. All these offices of burden and care she has occupied with the utmost fidelity and efficiency, and now we think she has earned a period of rest from these arduous toils and cares. Sheep shearing will soon be in order, and the continual wet weather is like to push all our spring and summer work up into a heap. But we will have to thank God it is no worse and do the best we can with it. We are always glad to receive the Manifesto, and it seems to lose nothing of its wonted interest and entertainment as well as spiritual edification. Some weeks ago we had a visit, heard a lecture, and enjoyed quite a protracted conversation with Dr. Cyrus Teed, shepherd of the Koreshan church. We were highly interested in all he had to say. He seems to be wide awake and full of spiritual zeal. Whether he will be able fully to assimilate with Believers in all things, THE MANIFESTO. lol especially in non-essentials, time alone will determine. But what if he does not? Jesus's disciples found certain persons casting out devils not in his name and forbade them, but Jesus said, Let them go ahead, and so I say. Now when are we going to have that meeting spoken of by Elder Louis Basting to formulate our bed-rock principles and set forth our system of ethics and spiritual whereabouts in the definite and specific manner required in this remarkable era of universal evolution and progress in all things. Principles are eternal, they must not, can not alter. But forms are as evanescent as the tinted cloud of sunset. Every single step in invention, discovery, science, reform in whatever direction necessitates a new form in which to express itself. And let us not hang reverently upon the neck of conservatism and superstition forever, for 'when ,later there's less time to play the fool.' O. C. Hampton.
