A STORY ABOUT THREE CENTS. When I was a little fellow, I was playing one winter day with some of my boy friends, when three cents, belonging to one of them, suddenly disappeared in the snow. Try as we would we could not find them, and the boys finally gave up the search, much to the disappointment of the one who owned them. The next day, I chanced to be going by the spot, when suddenly I spied the three coins we had been looking for. The snow which had covered them the day before had melted,' and there they lay in full view. I seized them and put them in my pocket. I thought of, the candy I could buy with them, and how fortunate I was to have found them; and when conscience wouldn't keep still, but insisted on telling mt what it thought of me, and above all, what God thought of me, I just told it to be quiet, and tried to satisfy it by saying that Charlie B- - - - - -had given up thinking about his three cents by this time, and that the one who found them had the right to them. 'Well, I spent the money, ate my candy, and thought that was the end of the whole matter. But I was never more mistaken. Years passed on. I grew from a boy into a man, but every now and then 'those three cents' would come into my mind. I couldn't get rid of them. They would come. How| ever, in spite of them, I had all along a strong '� desire to be a good boy, and to grow up to be [ a good man�a Christian man. This desire grew stronger and stronger, for God never left me, and so I gave myself to Him. Now, perhaps, you may think my trouble was over. j But no; every now and then, 'those three I cents' would come into my mind as before. Especially when I would try to get nearer to God, there were 'those three cents' right in the way. At last, I saw what God had all along been trying to make me see, that I must tell Charlie B- - - - -that I had taken them ! To be sure, he was a man by this time, and so was I, but no matter, God told me as plainly as I am telling you now, that till I had done this, He could not bless me. So. then and there, I sat down and wrote to Charlie, inclosing in my letter twenty-five cents�the three cents with interest. Since then I have had peace, and God has blessed me.
