WE SHALL KNOW A. T. LANPHERE We shall know when in the future Death shall roll the mists away, Hiding from our earthly vision Glimpses of the coming day; When the shadows o'er us passing Shall be merged in joyous light, And earth's sombre eolored garments Shall be changed for spotless white. We shall know when in the morning We awake to clearer light, Freed from all the doubts and darkness That environ us at night; When the sunshine of our being Shines in splendor o'er the hills, And the beauty of existence All our joyous being fills. We shall know, Ah ! golden vision, When life's weary watch is o'er, Why our barques are rudely driven Ere they reach the quiet shore ; Why the storms of passion raging Throw their shadows o'er our way, Ere the night of sin and sorrow Ripens into perfect day. We shall know why death hath veiled us From the presence of our own; Why our dearest ones have left us In this world of care alone; Why these partings, and these longings For the dear ones gone before; THE MANIFESTO. 15 Why we ford the stream of sorrow Ere we reach the further shore. We shall know why the Eternal In his wisdom placed us here, Why we pass through earthly shadows Ere we reach life's golden sphere ; Why the sunshine follows darkness— Why the morning follows night— Why the darkest hour in passing Ushers in the morning light. We shall know, Ah! blest assurance, More than mortal mind can know ; We shall roam where crystal fountains O'er the sands of knowledge flow ; All our sorrows will be banished By the joys of love divine, While the light from God's eternal Throne, shall round about us shine.
