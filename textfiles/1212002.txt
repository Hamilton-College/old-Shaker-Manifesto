JUDGE NOT WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO. Judge not,— lest by wrongful judging Thou betrayest doubt of heart, And a vain distrust, which sadly Drifts the soul from Hope apart. And maketh selfishness intense, In hearts which feel no confidence. Judge not,—lest by sinful judging, Thou dost cast the fatal stone, Sending pain into some sad life, Making misery for thine own; And driving out its love and trust, Make some heart feel thy law unjust. Judge not,—lest by scornful judging, Dost let fall,—beneath the stars,— And cross a brother's pathway,— Treachery's impeding bars; Compelling thus his feet to stray, In blinding doubt, from God away. SHAKER MANIFESTO. 267 Oh hast thou a heart so hardened, That it cannot even melt At the touch of Love's warm fingers ? Tell me,—hast thou never felt An inward joy thrill into life At sight of Peace o'ercoming Strife? If not,—then thy soul is selfish,— Trusting neither friend nor foe ; Cold, unloving, narrow-bounded ;— God forbid that this be so, And may His charity be strown Across thy path-way, now o'ergrown. Oh ! it is thy humble duty, God to serve,—while He shall rule; While He sitteth on the high throne, Kneel thou, low, upon the stool; And learn thy brother's woes to feel, For judgment is not thine to deal. Judge not, then, but Oh, be noble ! And another's fault forgive ; Pluck the cruel thorn of sorrow From the heart,—and stoop to give A kiss to little child at play,— A drink to pilgrim on his way.
