SANITARY SANITARY EL'LES. EMILY OFFORD. Shake your bed-clothes separately, and air your bed every morning, so that the effete matter that has been thrown from the body may escape, and not remain to be again absorbed by the lymphatics. Inhale the fresh air freely before partaking of the morning meal, it gives zest to it. Never eat what you do not need because it pleases your taste. It is better to bear the cross and be saved from dyspepsia. Never eat between meals. Never eat or drink contrary to your own conscientious principles even though others may deride you. Never drink unless you are thirsty, and then nature's wholesome and healthful bever age will be agreeable and delightful. Never wear more clothing than is sufficient to keep the body warm. Never let a day pass by without shedding on some one, a ray of the sunshine of goodwill and kindly cheerfulness. Never neglect to pray for the guidance and protection of the Holy Spirit. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
