A LOVING TRIBUTE. KATY BOYLE. Written in remembrance of Helen Vanzandt.—See Nov. Manifesto. While yet in youthful, tender years, The Reaper spared her not; Mid many seeming riper plants, 'Twas her the Reaper sought. The reason why is all a mist— We cannot understand, But, Lord, we'll trust her to Thy care And say 'Thy will be done.' 'Tis hard to part with one so loved, In time's uncertain vale, Who in our joys and sorrows shared And with us stemmed life's wave. Our earthly nature would complain And murmur at the change, But yield when recollections rise, This change we too must make. We have a solace by and by, We'll meet beyond time's shore. To part no more what may betide, When earthly strifes are o'er. Again, we say, 'Thy will be done,' We'll trust in Thee alway, And strive to reconcile ourselves, That all with her is well. Mt.
