A FAREWELL, Written by Sister Ann Buckingham a short time previous to her death. Faeewill O earth and earthly things, I soon must leave you all; Farewell my dearest, gospel friends, I hear my Mother's call. She calls me to a happy home, To mansions bright above; - �, She clothes me with a power sublime That fills my soul with love. I think I see in realms above, � That glow with golden light, That fair and happy, spirit home, In vision pure and bright. And as I gaze in wondrous awe, Eich beauties I behold; I see before me gates of pearl And far behind, all gold. It is the happy, spirit land, That bright and joyous sphere; And O, my dear, beloved friends, I soon am going there. Those happy spirits sometimes come To me in blissful dream, Their forms arrayed in spotless white, Their brows with glory beam. They seem to call me far away From earth and friends below, To join them in their blest abode, Their home with light aglow. It is that happy spirit land, That bright and joyful sphere; And O believe me very soon, I'm going, going there. My gospel friends below I leave; How beautiful you are! May heavenly blessings you attend, Is my most earnest prayer. With gratitude my heart o'erflows To you my dearest friends; I thank you for your tender care, With love that never ends. Shakers, N. Y.
