THANKSGIVING. ODILON B. ELKINS. The occasion upon which we have met this morning, has. no doubt, been the subject of much pleasant anticipation. To those of immature years it must necessarily appear, simply as an opportunity for mirth and pleasure. To the mature it appears as an occasion for mirth and pleasure, and for profit as well. And every such gathering is, and should be, productive of both, to old and young. Doubtless, the expectative, and preparative, preceding any meeting of this kind, the discipline of writing something original, or commiting to memory a chapter or a verse, fraught with wisdom, and love, is a source of no less ï¿½benefit and happiness ; nor will we depreciate the pleasures of the table, the preparing with thoughtful care, and partaking gratefully of the fruits of our industry, under the favor of God. These pleasures are as legitimate, and proper as those of a spiritual, or mental character. Neither should be suffered to encroach upon the other. Let all be done to the glory, and praises of God. When we partake of the bounties which a loving Father has provided for our physical needs, let us not be like the quadruped, which, the proverb says, never looks up at him who thrashes down the acorns, but with thankful hearts, look up to our Maker, and reverently acknowledge our indebtedness. Then, when we seek at His hand, that Immortal bread which keeps the soul alive we need not go away empty. It is said that the injunction of our founder was, 'Eat heartily, work heartily, and figrht asrainst sin heartily. ' No reserve can be pleasing to God that has no heart in it. When thanksgiving day approaches, many are moved to turn their attention to the far past, to learn, from old rcords when, where, and how, the custom of celebrating this anniversary had its rise. This may be an interesting theme, but it is of more vi'.al importance that we bear in mind the favors and gifts which our Creator still continues to grant to His children. It is important to consider whether we are as devotedly thankful for our day and grace, as our ancestors, the Pilgrim Fathers were, or as were our forefathers in Christ. Whether the first Thanksgiving was kept upon Plymouth rock, or aboard the May-flower, whether early in the seventeenth century, or towards the close, does not materially concern us, nor are we specially interested in the minor circumstances, the particular reason why, or the exact manner how, it was observed. Accounts differ on these inferior points, but that the custom was introduced by the Pilgrim Fathers, is perhaps beyond dispute. No doubt they were thankful for the security of the asylum they had found, from the persecutions of their native land, and it would seem that the intolerance that had compelled them to seek a refuge in the wilderness, might have taught them a lesson of toleration and forbearance toward their inferiors. Somebody has said that when they first landed they fell upon their knees, but presently they fell u~on the aborigines. There is, perhaps, as much truth in the latter part of the statement as in the former. It has been remarked that every day ought to be Thanksgiving day. To make it so would be to live in conform ity to the teaching and practice of the first preachers of our faith, whose life was praise and thanksgiving to God, regardless of adverse circumstances, regardless of even cruel persecutions. To be unthankful, is to be unholy. Let us cultivate thankful hearts, whether our duty leads us along pleasant, and agreeable paths, or through unattractive, repellant scenes. We are all in the hollow of His hand, who is our Father and Mother. His love is over us, and beneath us, and all about us. Xo depth of human depravity is able to sink a soul where His love does not rcrch. Bat our sinful lives may, and do, make us blind to that parental tenderness, which is slow to auger and quick to forgive. And sometimes in looking back upon trying scenes, where we have had everything, seemingly, but the last feather to bear up under, we have traced through it all the designs of a wise and tender Parent. We have learned the lesson which His loving care placed before us, and have seen that it was His hand that sustained us all through the chastening, which made us more fully and tangibly His children.
