The Anti-Infidel Library The Anti-Infidel Library. This is a serial issue of live, vigorous pamphlets, issued by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass., dealing with modern infidelity in a most readable and trenchant style. The numbers contain from 32 to 160 pages, bound in strong manilla covers, as durable as cloth, costing 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cents each. The whole library is sent to any address for f 2.50, and will furnish sufficient equipment with which not only to meet the ordinary assaults of skeptics, but also to carry the war into Africa, and give infidels something to think of which they never thought about before. These publications have the heartiest commendations of leading ministers and laymen of all denominations throughout the English-speaking world.
