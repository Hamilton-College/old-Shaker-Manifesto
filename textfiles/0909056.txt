Poultry versus Swine An enthusiastic breeder of poultry says : ' Farmers will feed a bushel of corn to produce six pounds of pork, while the same amount of corn will keep a good laying hen one year, and she will produce at least twelve dozen eggs, averaging 18 cents per dozen, which would equal $2.16; in adddition she would rear a brood of chickens worth as much more, making a total of nearly $5, against six pounds of pork at 10 cents, equaling 60 cents, or, in other words, the hen will yield seven times as much as the pig on the same quantity of food.'
