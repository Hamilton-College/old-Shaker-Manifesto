Cold weather and frost has sealed up the tilling of the soil so that the major part of the work has to be done under shelter. Cutting and drawing wood for fuel, and journeying to exchange goods and fruit for money are the chief requisitions for out-of-door work. As Florida contains a part of our family interest and members; for want of home incidents that are perfected enough to be put in print, I will supply the deficiency with a sketch of proceeding in the Olive Branch Florida. Spiritually they are making progress by some ingathering, and some more in anticipation. One man additional, John T. Roberts. He will occupy the Peterson House and he expects quite a number to follow him. There are some others in anticipation. In temporalities their success is markt. They have set and are setting 63 guava bushes. 125 good peach trees. Banana promising. 100 peach to set. 40 orange trees. 6 grape fruit trees. 10 Japan per- simmon. Henry has set out some grape and scuppernong vines, the latter to cover an arbor 70ft. long by 10ft. wide. One third acre of rice 5ft. tall. An addition has been added to the house, 15x16 ft. and two stories high. The rooms are suitable for angels to dwell in. 'Our bouse is the color of old gold.' So say they. Calvin G. Reed
