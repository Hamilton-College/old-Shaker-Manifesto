One of the foremost of English medical writers, Dr. James Johnson, emphatically says: ' I declare my conscientious opinion, founded on long observation and reflection, that if there was not a single physician, surgeon, apothecary, chemist, druggist, or drug, on the face of the earth, there would be less sickness and less mortality than now obtains.' And Professor Magendie is reported to have addressed his students at the Medical College in Paris to the following effect: ' Gentlemen, medicine is a great humbug; I know it is called a science. Science indeed—it is nothing like science. Doctors are mere empirics when they are not charlatans. We are as ignorant as men can be. Who knows any thing in the world about medicine ? Gentlemen, you have done me the honor to attend my lectures, and T must tell you frankly that I know nothing about medicine. True, we are gathering facts every day. We can produce typhus fever, for example, by injecting a certain substance into the veins of a dog; we can alleviate diabetes; and I see distinctly we are fast approaching the day when phthisis can be cured as easily as any disease. But I repeat it to you, there is no such thing now as medical science. I grant you, people are cured ; but how? Nature does a great deal; imagination does a great deal; doctors do — devilish little. Watch for little opportunities of pleasing, and put little annoyances out of the way.
