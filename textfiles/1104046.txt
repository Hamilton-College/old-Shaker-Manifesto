GOOD FOR HOUSES A good thing to give a horse after he has been driven is a quart of oat-meal stirred into a pail of water. It refreshes and strengthens him, relieves his immediate thirst, and prepares his stomach for more solid food. It is like the plate of soup before dinner— satisfying and appetizing to gether. [We copy the above from an exchange. We purpose to use the same good hint in the heated harvest fields for our help • and would urge it as a superior beverage to beer or spirituous drinks for hard- working, over-heated, thirsty men and women. — Ed.]
