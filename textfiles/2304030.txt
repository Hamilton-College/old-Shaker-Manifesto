NOTES ABOUT HOME West Pittsfleld. Mar. 1893. We are bounded and surrounded bysnow. The blizzard which probably originated in the boreal regions, found its way hither on the 20th ult. After displaying his mighty blowing powers for two consecutive days, he took a short respite or journeyed to other localities, but returned after a day's absence with renewed fierceness. For several days it was a constant strife with Brethren and workmen, to keep highways and pathways in a condition that made traveling possible. We wonder if some of those Arctic explorers have not opened a channel through which those furious storms find their way into more temperate regions. Yet in the midst of storm and tempest, sunshine and calm, our trust is in an over-ruling Providence, believing that if we rely steadfastly on Him, working with patience the works which he requires, he will 'temper the wind,' give the promised seasons for sowing and reaping and in his own good time bestow every needful blessing. A company of loved friends from the happy land of Canaan, while enjoying a day's outing, kindly called upon us and spent a few hours in social converse, greatly to our satisfaction. Bless us again with your presence dear friends, a cordial and welcome greeting will ever be extended to all our gospel kindred from afar or near. On the 2nd inst. a company of young people from our place reciprocated the call and notwithstanding the bad condition of the roads were enraptured with their day's enjoyment. Another brave veteran, Elder Frederick Evans, a loved and revered Father in Israel, has passed on to the glory awaiting him in the heavenly life, full of honors and full of years. 'Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord,' who have nobly and faithfully wrought the work assigned them. And so they continue to leave us those consecrated worthies, whose presence was like a benediction, and whose countenances beamed with the light of purity. While biding our time here, may we wisely copy their Christian magnanimity and emulate their virtues. We fully concur in the opinion so warmy expressed in the March No. of Manifesto, regarding the increasing richness and growth of each succeeding publication. Julia L. Sweet. Shaker Station, Conn. The experience of many persons has shown that it is by united effort that all progress has been made and lasting good accomplished. We should work in harmony with others and do all we can to progress in the right direction physically, morally and spiritually. There is strength in union. We should have a noble aim in view, and try to come as near the mark as possible. * * * When selecting eggs for sitting we should have the 'ideal hens' in mind. They should come from a prolific ancestry. We ought to know their past record and breed with all the care we take to get the choicest stock in animals. We have solved the problem of how to obtain plenty of eggs when they are forty cents a dozen. Warmth and a varied diet are indispensable. Hens must have the care that comes from a love of poultry, and it must be a regular and not a spasmodic attention. Daniel Orcutt. March 1, 1893. The stormy March with its winds and clouds is now reigning supreme, traveling is impeded with the snow drifts and many roads impassable. To reach the Depot from our place is quite difficult, and the fields are resorted to, and the aid of townsmen is required to keep any roads at all, as the wind fills up the track as fast as it is opened. The cream gatherer could not get through for three days the past week. The cold is not as severe at present as has been the past two months. Water is more plenty, which is a great blessing. Our new heating apparatus is now in working order and will be THE MANIFESTO. fully appreciated. We have ten Radiators with coils in upper and lower halls which warm the house perfectly comfortable with one small furnace which is heated with coal, doing away with stoves and wood which required so much attention to keep warm at all. We are now released from the burden of providing wood which is quite an expense, and it will also be a saving of labor for those who provide it. These improvements are desirable to make home comfortable. We are truly thankful for the many blessings which are ours to enjoy. Health prevails in our midst. Bountiful Father praise to thee for thy unfailing goodness. The past I leave alone with Thee, My guardian and my stay; And with a spirit calm and free, I onward take my way. Maria Witham. Enfield, N. H. North Family. March, 1893. As we meet and mingle in the duties of life with the busy multitude of human beings, how varied our experiences; there are persons, who, like pleasing theories or some fine toned poem, make deep and lasting impressions upon us; they enter into our lives with precept or good examples, as noble ministers of true Christianity. While we may be able to gather valuable matter from abroad, we can also find much in our own homes equally as interesting and useful, in our intercourse with those united to us by like ideals and life works. True love for our fellowbeings creates Christian service, 'to try all things, but hold fast to that which is good,' and give of acquired soul wealth to others, with the devotedness and sweetness of spirit which characterized the late Phillips Brooks, who helped to make the the field of religion bloom with flowers of virtue and to eradicate from society that corruptibleness which destroys noble manhood and womanhood. 'Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime; And departing leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time.' Awakened to the realization of moral responsibility, thus leaving life records proving that virtue pays, is the connecting link that binds the pure in spirit on earth and in heaven. As each flower adds beauty to earth's garden, so each mind with its individual aroma, should add to society, honor in its special sphere of action, nurtured and sustained by the spirit of godliness; for conscience, without Christian culture is mammon's servant, while the Christ garnished, make practical God's laws, and form the solid fabric of his Church, which the moth of lust or the rust of selfishness cannot soil. And what purer work is there than to uplift fallen humanity, and give to society that culture which makes all free and equal, intelligent and happy? At present we are walled around with huge banks of snow, remnants of the 20th and 22nd days of Feb., at which date snow drifts measuring from five to eight feet deep could be found in nearly all directions. Sisters not only proving indispensable in the domestic departments, have been well engaged in working on sale hosiery, throughout this cold season. We were much pleased with the March Editorial; please accept our thanks for the same, with love for all. George H. Baxter. Canterbury, N. H. Weather Eecord for February, 1893.

M A.RCH, the lion month of the year, came in just as we expected from the rough experiences of stormy February, but although storms and tempests have outwardly raged, the inward peace of the band of faithful Believers within our gospel home remains unbroken and undisturbed. Peace and plenty, temporally, and especially 95 96 THE MANIFESTO. spiritually, being the order of the days as they come and go with no thought for the morrows. We are all glad to welcome Eldress Eliza Stratton, of the North Family, to the renewal of her former duties in the Ministry. Some fourteen years ago she removed from the Ministry and became an indefatigable Trustee, afterwards succeeding to the duties of Eldress at our North Family. The order of Ministry requiring her services once more, our Sister comes in again with a hearty and general welcome. As one comes, another goes, for the removal of Eldress Eliza to the Church necessitates a corresponding removal from it, and we bid God speed to our Sister Elmira Hillsgrove who leaves us for the North Family to become associate with Eldress Harriet March. Amid the various changes of life the uppermost thought is constantly with us that the purity of life lived by all souls, compose the Zion of God, and not houses, lands or a multitude of people. This thought leads into another, that of all the papers in the land, our little Manifesto should be the most spiritual in its'aims, from north to south teaching the use of all things as not abusing them, with the constant injunction that all our treasure-stores are being laid up in the heavens where neither moth nor rust can corrupt. This should bear the stamp of the united effort of a united people, to render to God all things with equal gospel non-reservation. With this full spirit of resignation, we become more united and receive from the heavens a deeper baptism into the spirit of Christ, receiving with meekness the power of God into our souls, we need never be afraid of becoming worldly or too deeply engrossed with the various business duties that await our willing energies. Our Sweater business affords us, by a steady receipt of orders, as much work as is desirable for our spiritual growth. Sister Lucy Ann Shepard has temporary charge in the absence of Sister Dorothea Cochran. Br. William Briggs finds scope for all his various resources of mechanical ingenuity to keep the machinery in smooth going order. Our Br. David T. Williams, as engineer, is unremitting in his attention and care, leaving no room for anxiety in that direction May God bless our dear Brethren and Sisters who are working among the intricacies of the machinery. Then there is Br. George St. John, who with that forethought which his able predecessor Br. Arthur Bruce always exercised has already taken time by the forelock in the direction of spring garden operations. He is attending the usual early seed potatoes as they are sprouting for special forward garden planting. Albert Evans. � Shakers, N. Y.. Second Family. March, 1893. It is an old saying, one extreme follows another; so it is as regards the weather. In our last we were lamenting no snow, and now we have too much. We also have had but little water; probably the next will contain accounts of floods; so it goes the year around. There is always something a little out of joint and not just as I would have had it, thus wails poor humanity. As we have been snowed in the past month we have not much that is new or interesting to write about. Our Beloved Ministry are here at their Valley home. The health of Society is as good as could be expected considering the cold and changeable weather. If blizzards and windy wTeather have anything to do with longevity, we have had enough the past month to make us think of Methuselah' s age. But we have come to the conclusion that there is enough for us to worry about that we can help, and to worry as little as possible about what we cannot help. It is well that we have not the charge of the weather for I do not think we cotild improve it, or make people more satisfied, therefore, let us remember that a contented mind is a continual feast. Isaac Anstatt. THE MANIFESTO. 97 North Family. Mar. 1893. What a bond of union the little Manifesto is, on its monthly visits, bringing the best thoughts from dear Brethren and Sisters. It must be the tree that 'yieldeth its fruit every month,' and is for the healing of the nations. By the time these notes appear the preliminary work on the farm and garden will have begun. What can be a more valuable adjunct to and as a means of healthy living than a well kept garden where not only the necessaries but some of the luxuries can be produced that will thrive in this climate. And while the subject of horticulture is under discussion we would say to all lovers of melons, that they can be had from two to three weeks earlier than common by the use of a cold frame, glass, without bottom heat cut sod about six inches square and four inches thick from rich pasture land, invert and plant under glass early enough so that by the time out-door planting is ready they will have made growth to their fourth or sixth leaf and be ready to set in the open ground. A tastefully arranged and neatly kept flower bed in the lawn or dooryard is a source of innocent pleasure and profit to young and old. We know of no one flower that will give such a magnificent display and is as hardy as Drummond Phlox. Every lover of flowers must make his own selection. The kinds that can be selected from, are legion. The wish from our beloved Brother, Daniel Orcutt that the Manifesto could make weekly instead of monthly visits touches a responsive chord in the souls of many of its readers. We are not given to indulge in flattery but would say with honest feelings, may the Editorial shadow never grow less, and all of the workers on our little missionary feel their hearts encouraged and their hands strengthened. We remember the words of Lawrence, 'Don't give up the ship,' and though at times out of sight of land we know that we have a pilot who is safe and we shall yet enter our port of destiny. Hamilton DeGraiv. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. March, 1893. The seasons come and the seasons go, thus have we passed through as severe a winter as one could imagine it possible for slender constitutions to endure, in the vicinity of Mount Lebanon. The weather prophets say it is not all over with yet, that the spring season will be cold enough at times, to test severely the buds on the trees and the roots in the ground. We hope for a fruitful harvest. When summer cometh, shall we behold the trees laden with luscious fruit adapted to the health of our frail bodies which are so easily effected by the changes of climate? Some have been severely afflicted with colds and we can but hope that the worst in this respect has passed off. Snow has been so deep and drifted in our dooryard, for some days, as to make it difficult to move around where paths had not been made with plow or shovel. But the rain has carried the drifts away with a witness. Their disappearance forms water to fill the streams that flow through the valley below us, to the discomfort of the inhabitants there. We are striving to live by the rule of right in all things, doing unto others as we wish to have done unto us in all the vicissitudes of life, in this our sweet Shaker home. We have but little here to mar our happiness, in comparison with those who have suffered to establish freedom of conscience. We can take all the comfort that is vouchsafed to us by the cross of Christ, whereby we are crucified to the world and the world to us. The elements of the world we are leaving behind, and are looking forward to the prize of our high calling which is in Christ; to the power that saves from sin and a sinful nature in all its forms. Catharine Van Houten. Ayer, Mass. Mar. 1893. Once more the sun shines upon us. After the storm comes a calm. I sympathize with dear friends who have ex- 98 THE MANIFESTO.1 perienced for the last week what we have here in Massachusetts, in the line of snowstorms. For five days we have had two yoke of oxen and a pair of horses trying to make the roads passable again, and yet they are anything but good roads now. But perseverance, no doubt, will bring about good results. It has been quite different with us from what it was with Sambo. When his master was complaining of the rainy weather, he looked up into his master's face with his familiar smile and remarked:�'More rain, more rest, Massa.' With us it has been, more snow and wind, more hard work, Massa, But it is a long lane that has no turning. Our little boy after shoveling snow most of the day to make a path to draw his sled, exclaimed,�Well, it will be summer after awhile and then we wont have any snow to bother us. A good thought to look for the sunshine under every cloud, though the thought comes from a child. In our divine service on Sabbath morning, we sung the piece,� Joy and peace are my sunshine, And no day so overcast, But I catch the silver lining Shining through the stormy blast.' Could we think of this in the time of trial and look for the rift in the cloud where the sun is shining, I think we would many times, find joy in the trial instead of gloom and despondency. Trials grow by dwelling upon them, like the snow ball, the more you roll it, the larger it grows, and the more we carry trials in memory the less we have of the spirit of Christ. Dear Elder Henry, your last Editorial meets the feelings of our people, and the more we keep that spirit, the more growth we shall have temporally, as well as spiritually. In the world, but not of the world. Having so much of the spirit of our gospel that when duty calls for association, we carry our principles with us, and not come down from the cross. I admire true patriotism in any class, and especially among those who call themselves soldiers of Christ. A coward is one of the meanest things of God's creation. Out-door business is quite at a standstill, as we are trying to finish up with our woodpile. A. D. Barrett. -Alfred., Maine. March 12, 1893. Febetjaey gave us all the snow desired. I presume the clerk of the weather got tired of so much complaining and concluded to send down enough which he surely did. The teams were out nearly all of one week breaking roads. It took some little time for the roads to get in condition for travel. The Brethren have well improved the sledding, for one hundred and forty cords of wood have been cut and hauled, ready for sawing, also one hundred thousand feet of lumber. To-day's rain has taken much of the snow, and before long we hope to enjoy the warm sunny days of spring. The Editorial notes in March Manifesto were excellent. May the strength and blessing of heaven sustain the faithful watchmen of Zion, and may their days be prolonged for Zion's sake, that the principles and truths of this gospel may be proclaimed and maintained, is the prayer of a humble and sincere laborer in the vineyard. Fannie Casey. A PLEA FOR PURITY OF LANGUAGE. Man communicates his thoughts and desires to his fellow-men through the medium of language. Conceptions and wishes, in order to be of any practical use to any person, foreign to self, or to be wrested from oblivion, must be clothed in words. These terms, or words, then, simply represent thoughts or ideas, which have been formulated by the activities of the mind. That the expression of the product of thinking be clear, it is highly essential for the thinker to be able to employ terms, which convey his true and full meaning. If lie wants his desires to THE MANIFESTO. 99 be satisfactorily met, they must be thoroughly understood. This, of course necessitates a complete and accurate knowledge of the principles of the language, which he adopts as a means of communication. If the diction of an author is imperfect or ambiguous, his meaning is liable to be misinterpreted and he becomes a victim of severe criticism. All intelligent and cultured persons unhesitatingly condemn erroneous statements and incorrect phrases, when they occur in the field of standard literature, but there seems to be more latitude and liberty granted in the sphere of ordinary conversation and daily intercourse. Why such is the case, it is rather difficult to explain, unless on the unwarranted ground, that a thing which is commonplace, needs not be conformable to the laws of truth or restricted to an honest and faithful representation. Familiarity, however, should not breed contempt. Certainly a blessing or benefit, which is unremittingly conferred, should not lose any virtue or efficacy through its frequency. The sun suffers no contamination from its daily shining, nor does stellar beauty fall into corruption from its frequent glorious nocturnal decoration of the heavens. Neither should language be . allowed to be corrupted, on account of its constant use; but its purity and proper simplicity should be preserved at all times. It is impossible, perhaps, for the uncultured and illiterate to conform to the accepted laws of the language, as laid down in the text-books on grammar and rhetoric, when they wish to communicate their thoughts and desires to their fellow-men. Custom and habit are the only rules observed in making their assertions, and these serve as guides in their choice of words and expressions. The plea for purity and correctness in speech or writing, addresses itself, most particularly, to the learned, and those who are striving to reach the state of culture. The student, pursuing a higher course of learning, is confronted by its urgent claims, and he must, in one way or another, meet the demands, whether it be considerately and intelligently, or remissly and indifferently. He should be very careful in, the selection of terms in which to express properly his individual ideas and views. Here comes in a just demand for the exei'cise of guarding himself well against improper uses of certain phrases and words, which are found in ordinary conversation. Were less regard paid to customary and common expressions, and more originality and self-assertion manifested, there would be fewer erroneous statements. The great abuse and corruption, which the English language suffers at the hands of scholars and intelligent people in general, are due, not so much to ignorance or lack of knowledge as to thoughtlessness and hasty utterances. They are familiar with the principles governing the appropriate use of words and sentences, but fail in the application of them to their own peculiar needs. Unauthorized expressions and obsolete terms, as they fall from the lips of one who presumes to be learned, are very objectionable and repulsive to the sense of refined taste. Nothing perhaps detracts more from the efficacy and persuasive power of a public speaker, than a frequent or persistent abuse of certain rhetorical or grammatical principles. When he fails to clothe his thoughts in pure and fitting terms, his arguments fall far short of their desired acceptance and conviction. The cultivated ear calls for euphony and the harmonious arrangement of words into sentences, and whenever evident and conspicuous perversions of the language occur, it meets with an unpardonable offense. From such inaccuracies and errors, intelligence shrinks back with disgust and stamps the offender as unlettered and unpolished. It must be admitted that a strict conformity to the laws of the language can not invariably be observed. No one ever passes beyond the state where he is liable to make mistakes, even though he exercises the greatest caution and thoughtfulness. It is not, however, the occasional misuse of words and terms that is so ve- 100 THE MANIFESTO. hemently attacked in this article, but their frequent and persistent abuse and corruption. Such as are guilty of this practice have no just apology to offer, but must be considered and branded as ignoring the purity, simplicity and beauty of their native tongue. �Mercersburg College Monthly. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. North. Family. March 14, 1893. The past few months in our home has been fraught with many scenes well calculated to develop the better qualities in those who look at them aright. We have had a very perplexing time with our water pipes, and the supply has been cut off from the reservoir. This came about in consequence of the pipe which conveys the water, (a four inch pipe,) being laid in the brook and for a considerable distance upon the surface, depending upon the snow to cover and keep it from freezing. The snow did not come until a long time after the frost, so the pipes were frozen and bursted. Several times we thawed out and repaired them, covering them with straw, but all to no purpose, except to get experience. After patching and wrapping several times with hands in ice water, until they were well nigh past feeling, or holding, we got experience enough. Our knowledge increasing, we added thereto wisdom, so that in future we will know just what to do. We tried most thoroughly thawing by hot water, setting up a large kettle in the brook, and by sprinkling the wood with kerosene oil, we got the water boiling hot, and found by inserting a small iron pipe and pumping the hot water through, it was very effectual for a hundred feet or so; but when we came to pump it three hundred feet, and the water having no opportunity to get away, it became well nigh useless. So we picked up our traps, put the kettle in order, and came home; quit using our water motors and got a steam engine, ceased bathing in the tubs and prepared ten quart pails in which to baptize. Then we went to desiring and wishing and praying that we might have a thaw and some rain. Well, it was a long time coming; but it came and with a rush. We turned the surface water into the reservoir and in a very few days it was nearly full. We have been doing a little missionary work by advertising; the fruits of which will appear in due season. As all are knowing to the demise of Elder Frederick, perhaps a little account of the final winding up of his notable career would be interesting. Thursday, the 9th, was the day appointed to do the last duties. A more characteristic day of his life and ministration could not have been chosen. A born Englishman, in the full sense and meaning of that word, ever on the alert to battle against error, and with his iconoclastic club to overthrow false systems and theologies without mercy, the day could not have been more apropos. The meeting house was prepared by starting a fire three days beforehand, and introducing a large coal stove, and every preparation was made for a large meeting. The roads over the mountain were in a very unsafe condition by reason of the enormous snow drifts, but all the same, notice was given out and we determined to do our best. Wednesday was beautiful; at 12 o'clock at night, the stars shone brightly; but before morning the heavens began to pour out, and they did not cease to weep, except at intervals, until the next day. In the morning we drove up to the grave, saw that everything was in order there; shoveled a path from the house to the place of meeting, preparatory to walking over; but the rain and the thaw came on so abundantly that it was impracticable for the Sisters to walk. We had loaned the large sleigh to our Canaan friends, and the roads from there were considered impassable, so they could not, or did not come up. We had just bought a light sleigh, which was prepared to carry the corpse, but this got broken before meeting, in traveling to and from the meeting-house. We tried to borrow an- THE MANIFESTO. 101 other, but failed; so we took our lumber sleighs, put the farm-wagon boxes on them, covered the whole with new blankets, and put on the riding wagon seats, lashing the back seat to prevent tipping, and carried the Sisters over amid wind and rain to the place assigned. The Brethren and boys put on their rubber boots and walked. To the great surprise of everybody, whom should we meet but Elder George Wilcox and two Sisters, coming from over the mountain, which was supposed to be utterly impassable, wending their way to pay their last tributes. At last we were assembled, and some few of our neighbors, and ready to commence the services at 1 o'clock. The meeting proper lasted three hours and a quarter; then came the the last duties; the interment. As the traveling was so very bad, only those who could be of service were appointed to go to the grave. Then followed a scene never to be forgotten. The water was coming down the road leading to the grave in quantity sufficient to drive a good sized saw-mill. Up a little distance, and over the cemetery, the snow from the hills had slidden down, covering the track entirely to a depth of from two to three feet. Nothing daunted, on we went till one side of the sleigh went down and only by stopping the team at once, and all hands holding on to the sleigh, was it prevented from tipping completely over. Struggling through the snow and water over the tops of rubber boots, we got to the grave and secured some shovels, dug the snow from the upper side of the sleigh to bring it down level, and from under the horses and in front of them, and so came right side up to the grave. This we found full of water and running over. Down to the house, by the short cut, to get pails; then we returned, bailed out the water and performed the last duty. Getting home about 6 o'clock, we sat down in solemn reflection. Elder George and company could not return over the mountain, even if they had so desired. They remained over until Saturday morning, then took the cars for home. Thus ended one extraordinary mundane life and a funeral service that was as interesting as it was arduous. There was thrilling music in the whole of it. The apparent discords only made the harmony more sublime. Music talks to the soul; and we have heard no uncertain sound. In kindest love, Daniel Offord.
