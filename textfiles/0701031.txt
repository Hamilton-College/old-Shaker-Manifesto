Any one doubting the benificial effects of Shakerism... Anyone doubting the beneficial effects of Shakerism upon the churches, can profitably investigntc the modus operandi of Thos, K. Beecher's church in Elmira, N. Y. The poor are cared for by the church. A refectory is attached thereto for the hungry, There is a church horse and carriage to convey the aged and crippled to and from church, and to take the sick and convalescent on an airing excursion. It looks after the morals and occupation of its youth, and is educating quite a number for the ministry. It was this Beecher who recommended confession of sin, as c , helping a man a good deal, to know that some one else knew of his misdeeds.'
