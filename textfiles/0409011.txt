HOPE We shall meet beyond the river, Where the harps iEolian chime, There to clasp our hands together, On the other side of time. Tow'ring mounts may here divide us, Storms may threaten fora time ; Storms nor mounts, can there divide us, When we reach that happy clime. In the truth, naught can alarm us ; Toes without and foes within, Ne'er can gain the power to h;trm us, If our hearts are free from sin. Not to live for joy and beauty, Are we called while here in time; But to walk the path of duty, Till we reach the summer clime. Look beyond 1 there's light before us, Like a shilling mantle there ; And God's love is with and o'er us ; We are folded in his care. Let a holy purpose guide usâ€” While we stem the stream of time ; And from earth's illusions hide us, Till we reach that sun bright clime. Faith, the gift that God has given, Is to us a beacon star; That will lead our souls to Heaven, From earth's elements afar. When we reach the pearly portal, Songs of joy shall to us come ; And dear friends, long since immortal, Gladly bid us welcome home. Maria Wheeler, Union Village, O.
