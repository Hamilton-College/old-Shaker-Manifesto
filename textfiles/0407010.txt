WRATH 'The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.' But the wrath of God revealed from heaven, against all that defiles the temple of God, is Heaven's richest blessing; it should be regarded as a friend. We shall need much of such Divine displeasure to fit us for the mansions of eternal brightness. O. P. Mt. Lebanon, April 26,18T4
