West Pittsfield, Mass. March, 1899. We realize as the lengthening days pass that 'winter's reign is nearly over,' and that soon spring, the loved harbinger of birds and flowers will be with us, and with gentle smile and touch awaken nature's sleeping children to renewed life. We are willing to bid adieu to poor, overworkt winter. Surely his part has been performed faithfully and he should be awarded due praise. The snow has fallen thick and fast, the wind catching it has piled it in huge drifts here and there, the thermometer has reacht a lower point than for many years, and a genuine blizzard has been introduced to complete the record. But intersperst with this have been bright, sunshiny days when jingling sleigh-bells chimed merry times as the sleighs past over the smooth snow. The ice, of fine quality, and plenteous in supply, was promptly gathered, for we find in spite of our dislike for winter we enjoy a little of its preserved essence during the warm summer months. La Grippe laid seige to our home in February, and for a few weeks held us unwilling captives. Still we did not despair but rallying our weakening forces struck a final blow for liberty and rose to conquer. Day and night we waged warfare until the enemy beat a retreat, not being able to cope with our armed forces, who fought with pellets and plasters so skillfully. At present the wounded are nearly recovered and peace once more reigns. The busy mill at the foot of the hill, and the buzzing saw in the valley, are at work all day converting once stately trees THE MANIFESTO. 61 into boards and cords of wood for extensive uses. And so with its lights and shades time passes onward. Already nearly a quarter of the new year has become a part of the past. May the days yet awaiting be filled with blessing for our brothers and sisters in other homes, while unitedly we endeavor to raise aloft our banner whose motto is 'Purity and Truth.'
