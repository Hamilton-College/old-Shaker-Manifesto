THE MANIFESTO Some kind Shaker has sent us several copies of the 'Manifesto' a Shaker Magazine published in New York. We like the spirit of it very much, but we cannot conscientiously take any stock in Ann Lee as a leader. We prefer Christ the Son of God as a leader and for our Saviour. We do not intend to caricature any person's belief, ' fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of men.'â€”[Ed. The above we extract from a very prettily printed periodical, but one tending to very gloomy considerations, called 'The Coming Struggle.' In sympathy with Editor Chase, we, too, cannot 'conscientiously take any stock in Ann Lee,' nor any other man nor woman 'as a leader,' unless Ann Lee or such other man or woman followed and taught Christ most and best. If Ann Lee differed in anywise from the purest teaching and life of Jesus, the Christ, we ask the attention of no one to her gospel testimony. If her administration of the gospel of Christ left a single loop hole through which carnal men and women could evade the full cross and self-denials of Jesus, we do not know it. But we do know that the great objection of the majority, concerning taking 'stock in Ann Lee as a leader ' or in her testimony as a gospel, is that neither leaves any opportunity, nor gives any permission to engage in fleshly indulgences even as Jesus did not. Leaving Ann Lee out as a leader; we ask those who ' prefer Christ as a leader,' to be sure and follow where he led and leads ; and then to considerately discriminate, if they can, how far from a Shaker life Christ has led them.
