The Shakers. The Troy Times does not believe the Shakers are dying outj and says : Regularly we hear or read that the sect of Shakers is dying out. Every six months or so, a correspondent writes to a newspaper that the Shakers are losing in numbers, wealth, and discipline, and every other newspaper in the country reprints the letter. Already enough obituaries of this peculiar people to serve for the funeral memoirs of all the eccentric religious communities in the land have been written. The fact is, that the Shakers are to- day gaining in wrealth and discipline, and holding their own in numbers. Their lands, which were bought for almost nothing, have constantly gained in value, and now, owing to their location and productiveness, they are as valuable for farming purposes as any we know of. For a dying sect the Shakers have considerable vitality. In a late number of the New Haven Evening Register, we find the following paragraph: It is said that there is not now living a single descendant in the male line of Chaucer, Shakspeare, Spencer, Milton, Cowley, Butler, Dryden, Tope, Cowper, Goldsmith, Scott, Byron, Moore, Sir Philip Sidney, Sir Walter Raleigh, Drake, Cromwell, Hampden, Monk, Marlborough, Peterborough, Nelson, Stafford, Ormond, Clarenden, Addison, Swift, Johnson, Walpole, Bollingbroke, Chatham, Pitt, Fox, Burke, Grattan, Canning, Bacon, Locke, Newton, Davy, Hume, Gibbon, Macaulay, Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, John Kemble or Edmund Kean. There is a law under which the procreative forces pass from the back brain to the intellectual and turn from the intellectual to the spiritual faculties.
