ORGANIZATION OF SPIRITUALISTS The Spirit world, through their medium, Jesus, has spoken plainly and concisely of the principle that shall govern in the 'New Order,' and spiritual era or dispensation which we find recorded in the 20th chapter, 25th, 2fith and 27th verses of Matthew, and culminated in practical operation with his followers at the Pentecostal period, recorded in the 2d chapter of Acts. To give up all for each others' sakes, as the primitive Christians did, is what is meant 'For Christ's sake;' for Christ labored for others' sakes, or for equality for all, which is natural and just, or spiritual. Hence in the 'New Dispensation,' God, a principle of love and justice will be the only organizer; for we shall have a church without a creed; a kingdom without a king; a state without a governor or a government, and dwell on the earth as the angels or spirits do in heaven, or as the birds in the groves.
