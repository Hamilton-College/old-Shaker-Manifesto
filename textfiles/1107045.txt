A CLERGYMAN'S CALL A good story is told of Dean Stanley who traveled extensively through the United States a year and a half ago. He was spending the night with some New England friends and desired to be called at an early hour in order to proceed on his journey. The task was assigned to a boy employed in the house, who was instructed especially, that after rapping at the dean's door and hearing the question, ' Who is there ? ' he should reply, ' The boy, my lord,' and then discharge his errand. The boy was at the dean's room at the exact moment, and rapped softly at the door. Upon hearing the question, ' Who is there ?' he answered, ' The Lord, my boy ; ' the transposition of words occasioned a peal of laughter from the distinguished visitor. The dean considered the incident a capital one, and told it with a great deal of amusement.
