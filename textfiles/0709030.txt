Bro. H. Chase Allard We were sorry to learn of the demise of Bro. H. Chase Allard , aged 71, at Enfield, N. H., on the 2d July. He was highly prized by the people there. He was one who knew what the severity of extreme trials was, and lived and died an honor to his people, and an example to all Christians. The most beautiful of proceedings were enacted at his funeral, which want of space forbids chronicling.
