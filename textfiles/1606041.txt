Canon farrar't Si�w Dooki A few weeks ago, when Canon Farbar was in this country, tens of thousands of people paid as much as one dollar each to hear a single lecture delivered by him, and were well pleased with what they got for their money. Several of the most important of those lectures and addresses with other papers are now published by John B. Alden, of New York, and can now be had in a very handsome cloth bound volume, for the price of 40 cents. Some of the lectures are also published separately in his Elzevir Library, in which form the lecture on Dante sells for .8 cents; on Temperance, 2 cents; on Ideals of Nation*, '2 cents; Thoughts on America, 3 cents.
