When the seed of faith becomes rooted... When the seed of faith becomes rooted in an honest understanding heart, the eifects will flow from thence into the outward conduct, and produce those conditions which are best adapted to manifest the Christ life. Duty to the material part, like the care of a servant, will come in secondary, merely as an aid in the practical work of righteousness. 'For which ot you having a servant plowing and feeding cattle, will say to him when le is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat; and will not rather say, Make ready wherewith I may sup; gird thyself and serve me until I have eaten and drunken, and afterward them shalt eat and drink.' A. G. H.
