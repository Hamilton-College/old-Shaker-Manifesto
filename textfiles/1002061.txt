RELIGION IN THE LIFE How few people think of religion as a principle of right living. They look into the Gospel of Christ as though it contained minute directions for daily action, and thus they come to regard religion as a set of rules, a whip to duty, something which is all the time saying to them, 'you shall' and 'you shan't,' — something that has manacles, fetters, chains for the hands, the feet, the eyes, ears, head and heart — when it is liberty to do right, helpfulness in rightdoing, and restraint to wrong-doing, disapproval of all that is evil. Christ's teaching was the outlining of great truths, the statement of living principles. When he said, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit,' he referred to the condition of mind necessary to be a Christian. When he drew that vivid picture of a selfish, godless man in torment, and a sweet-tempered, pure soul in glory, he gave declaration to the inevitable result of every life. Every man makes the moral condition of his life here, by the acceptance or rejection of the gospel principles, and the fruitage borne by the practice of them. Every man in the beyond will find his own place — a place which he prepared for himself by the manner of his earthly life. Some people have an idea that good people must die to go to heaven, and that bad people must die to go to perdition. But to live the principles of the Gospel is to live heavenly ; to neglect those principles is to live miserably. If you are an upright citizen, you have no fear of the law. The principles of your life enforce in you all good laws. So it is that right principles are the correctives of life and plain guides to duty, and there are no such principles apart from the Gospel of Christ. Men have only to apply his teachings, not in the letter alone, but in the spirit, to their circumstances and relations, to live his life. And his life, embodying the principles which he taught, is the Christian religion. 'Follow me.' — Golden Rule.
