KIND WORDS Thebe is no reason why all the Shakers who read The Manifesto, and it is taken for granted that all do read it, should not share in the good things that are said about our little paper as well as the Editor. A little touch of approbation may not be out of place with those who are trying to do good, even if they fall short of the mark. In 'Human Nature,' a paper published in San Francisco, Cal., and edited by Prof. Haddock: 'The Manifesto is published by the United Society of Believers on the first of each month, and is the only work issued regularly by the Shaker Community. Its aim is to furnish a plain and simple statement of the religious views of the Order and to inculcate the spirit of righteousness. 'The foundation stone upon which the structure of Shakerism rests, is virgin purity; or in other words, a life of celibacy. The principle has been kept unsullied for over one hundred years.' They are confronted with the cry, 'If all should become Shakers, the world would become extinct.' But the Shakers answer that 'they believe the great sin of the age is the destructive force of sensualism, and it is 'only by a return to the law of God through chastity in the relationship of men and women that human beings can be delivered from the curses of want and disease, and the great train of evils that so effect modern society.'
