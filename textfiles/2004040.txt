These were the words spoken by Samuel to the children... Text:ï¿½' Choose ye this day whom ye will serve.' These were the words spoken by Samuel to the children of Israel, but they are just as essential now as then. It is truly said, 'Ye cannot serve God and mammon,' and we must choose between the two. It is a very important choice and should be made rhoughtfully and prayerfully. The decision determines our iiappiness or unhappincss both for this life and the next. 'Aow is the day of salvation,'* therefore we should choose this day for we do not know if to-morrow vill be ours. It is also said, 'Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth.' After all the warnings and exhortations found in the Bible, we cannot fail to see the necessity of serving the Lord now and not allow that 'thief of time' Procrastination to take possession of us. Our daily prayer should be, 'Lord help us to bf true followers of thee.' We cannot be true followers of Christ without a thorough study of his life. If we do, we will find that he, like us, was tempted, but yielded not, and left us a precious example of forgiveness, forbearance, love, meekness, hopefulness and prayerfulness. He began while young to do good and to be good and if we are true followers of him we shall begin now while young and then when we are older we can look back upon a wellspent life, and forward with a full assurance of at last hearing the sweet reward, 'Well done, good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord.'
