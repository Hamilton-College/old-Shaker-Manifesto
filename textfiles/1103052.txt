SOWING AND REAPING Sow with a generous hand, Pause not for toil or pain ; Weary not through the heat of summer, Weary not through the cold spring rain; But wait till the autumn comes For the sheaves of golden grain. Scatter the seed, and fear not, A table will be spread; What matter if you are too weary To eat your hard earned bread ! Sow, while the earth is broken, For the hungry must be fed. Sow,—while the seeds are lying In the warm earth's bosom deep, And your warm tears fall upon it,— They will stir in their quiet sleep; And the green blades rise the quicker Perchance for the tears you weep. Then sow,—for the hours are fleeting, And the seed must fall, to-day ; And care not what hands shall reap it, Or if you have passed away Before the waving cornfields Shall gladden the sunny day. Sow; and look onward, upward, Where the starry light appears,— Where, in spite of the cowards doubting, Or your own heart's doubts and fears, You shall reap in joy the harvest You have sown, to-day, in tears.
