THANKSGIVING. 'He hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.' ï¿½ 1 Peter, ii., 9. Canterbury, N. H. Breakforth, O my soul, In songs of thanksgiving, Render a tribute To the God of the living. For he hath called thee, Called thee from darkness; Sing of his boundless love, With joy and gladness.
