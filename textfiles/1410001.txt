'LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE.' MARY WHITCHER. Why darken every window If you have light within ; Do you not love the neighbor, And wish to comfort him? The Father sheddeth freely His light on all below,� While nothing He requiteth For good He doth bestow. But prompteth kindness rendered From fellow man to man,� And here is goodness tendered Through his, the Giver's plan. As children dwell together Beneath the Parents' care The Father and the Mother Their mutual burdens bear. And children are expected In kindness, as a kin, To care for one another As parents care for them. Thus by the old creation, Or natural ties of earth, We see the new relation, And learn the Second birth, Where spirits flow together In love, in joy and peace, A heaven failing never, But promised the increase. Canterbury, N. H.
