There are many Christian people... ' There are many Christian people who think that Christ is going to come to the earth again, and reign personally. I am not ready to reject that theory; but if Christ does come to our world again, I believe He will find a Mount Zion in this land, and will set up His throne between the Alleghanies and the Rocky Monntains, and will walk the streets of our American cities. In that millennial day there will be one denomination of Christians far ahead of all others, if it have not swallowed them all up. Would you like to know what denomination it will be? I will tell you. It will be that denomination which has worked the hardest, trusted the fullest, loved the mightiest, and eclipsed all others in the spirit of Christian toleration.'
