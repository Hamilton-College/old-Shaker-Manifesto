THE WAY TO HEALTH The only true way to health is that which common sense dictates to man. Live within the bounds of reason. Eat moderately, drink temperately, sleep regularly, avoid excess in anything, and preserve a conscience ' void of offense.' Some men eat themselves to death, some drink themselves to death, some wear out their lives by indolence, and some by over-exertion ; others are killed by the doctors, while not a few sink into the grave under the effects of vicious and beastly practices. All the medicines in creation are not worth a farthing to a man who is constantly and habitually violating the laws of his own nature. All the medical science in the world cannot save him from a preihatui'e grave. With a suicidal course of conduct, he is planting the seed of decay in his own constitution, and accelerating the destruction of his own life.â€”Scientific American.
