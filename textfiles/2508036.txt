MOTHER ANN. By Charles Elwood Foster. [Contributed by Eldress Harriet Goodwin.] This name was given to a rocky profile at the end of Eastern Point, Mass. 'O Mother Ann.' Above the sea! With ferns and asters at thy feet! Hast thou not e'en a nod for me, Nor smile, thy summer friend to greet? Why seeks thy face the rising sun? Spyest hope there for a better day? Or future conquests, to be won When yonder clouds have passed away? No answer comes:calm, cruel, cold, Her eyes the skies forever scan; Earth's secrets surely she must hold While silent watch keeps 'Mother Ann.' Unmindful of the breaker's roar, Or storm winds play with scattered spray; On rugged, lonely Eastern shore She's eastward looking night and day. Boston Journal.
