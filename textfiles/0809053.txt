DENIAL BY PAUL H. HAYNE We look with scorn on Peter's1h:ic3 told lie! Boldly we say, 'Good brother 1 you nor I, So near the sacred Lord, the Christ indeed, Had dared his name and marvelous grace deny.' O fj'.ile boast! O haughty lips, be dumb! Unheralded by boisterous trump or drum, How oft 'mid silent eves, and midnight chimes, Vainly to us our pleading Lord hath come, Knocked at our hearts, striven to enter there; But we, poor slaves of mortal sin and care, Sunk in deep sloth, or bound by spiritual sleep, Heard not the voic3 divine, the tender prayer! Ah! well for us if some late spring-'idc hour Failh still may bring, with blended shine and shovrcr; If through warm tears a late remorse ma}shed, Our wakened souls put forth one heavenly flower!
