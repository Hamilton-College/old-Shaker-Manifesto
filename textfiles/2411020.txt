Sabbathday Lake, Me. Oct. 1894. Beloved Elder Henry:-1-We are reminded of the pleasant duty of writing a few lines for The Manifesto, in regard to our home. The days of the harvest are passing. Potatoes are already stored, a sufficient crop for home use and some to sell. We are now gathering the apples, of which we have an abundance for cooking, for drying and for eating. Many barrels are being packed away for sale and we shall have more than usual to make into cider for the Shaker Apple Sauce. Sweet corn seed is secured and drying; ensilage cut and silo filled. The young Brethren have been quite interested in raising vegetables and melons. O! the melons have been delicious that they have furnished for the family table! They took a collection to the New Gloucester Fair. One squash weighed 76 lbs. and a tomato over 2 lbs. One of the young THE MANIFESTO. 263 Sisters found a wild ripe strawberry September 21st. By consulting the Office Register we find 1250 names of visitors who have called upon us since the opening of the summer season. The autumn woods are perfectly beautiful now. Sunday afternoon a meeting was held on the shores of Sabbathday Lake. From our windows we could see them baptizing the people. We know not from whence they came nor whither they went but we do know that at the same time, we enjoyed a most heavenly meeting and received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Ada S. Ciimmlngs.
