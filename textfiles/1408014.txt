A CREED. I belibve in human kindness Large amid the sons of men; Nobler far in willing blindness Than in censure's keenest ken. I believe in self-denial, And its secret throb of joy; In the love that lives through trial, Dying not, though death destroy. I believe in dreams of duty, Warning us to self-control, Foregleams of the glorious beauty That shall yet transform the soul; In the god-like wreck of nature Sin doth in the sinner leave, That he may regain the stature, He hath lost,-I do believe. I believe in love renewing All that sin hath swept away, Leaven�like its work pursuing Night by night and day by day : In the power of its remoulding, In the grace of its reprieve, In the glory of beholding Its perfection,�I believe. Good Words.
