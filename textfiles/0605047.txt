Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. The material for the new ' Ministry's Shop ' at Mt. Lebanon is on the ground awaiting the clemency of the weather. It will be of brick; 32 feet wide, 38 feet long, with an L for outbuildings. Two stories high,— retiring rooms above. It is the present inteni ion to light and heat it by same reservoirs that warm and illuminate the new house. Its location is fifteen feet farther north; six feet farther west than the previous one — this change for the better prospect, and to escape the shade made by the house. The Church Family, Mt. Lebanon, purpose exhibiting some of their manufactures at the Centennial. Also, the South Family have secured space to display their Shaker Chairs — editorial, and others, we suppose ! We have thought it a good idea, that they should take with them Mother Ann Lee's chair, now in possession — what there is left of it—of Shakers at Watervliet, N. Y. It has been so constantly used, that the legs are worn up to the lower rounds, all round. We were pleased to notice that Bro. R. M. Wagan has issued a musical and historical circular of Shakerisrn for Centennial circulation; and has so ingeniously blended chairs, music and history together therein, that the people cannot see the pictures of chairs, without being forced to learn our history and our songs ! Will not all other Trustees be as anxious to dispense the gospel ? We doubt not, that while he thus magnanimously circulates such valuable information, he will also sell many of his chairs ! Elder F. W. Evans has been laboring in New York and Brooklyn considerably of late. Accompanied by ten of his family, songs and sermons were plentifully distributed. We • hope they were successful. There is no criterion equal to success.
