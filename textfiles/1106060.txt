'I S M S' Isms, like arsenic, are good in their place, but an ' ism 'is as poor a substitute for religion as arsenic is for bread. We have nothing to say against a man's showing a strong love for the church of his choice ; we have no fault to find if he regularly attends his own church and is tremendously energetic in his efforts to increase her efficiency, THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 143 yet we would rather a man would not work for his church or for the church, but for a church of Christ. Here is a distinction that ought not to be overlooked. There is a difference between religious and selfish, or sectarian zeal. Many an earnest worker for his church has very little leve for the Master's cause or for the souls of men. The most charitable words that can be spoken to religious bigots are those which Christ addressed to his disciples when they desired to call down fire from heaven and burn up the inhospitable Samaritans : ' Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.' Christ's love reached out to the whole world. His religion was for all nations and classes. He preached no ' ism,' but the universal fatherhood of God to man and sonhood of man to God. He called all Christians ' brethren of one master.' Any spirit not in harmony with the spirit of Christ's teachings, can not be of God, and such a spirit will be sure to bear bitter fruit.â€”Church Mirror,
