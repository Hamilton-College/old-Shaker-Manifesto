The Prayer of Socrates .— O ! beloved Pan, and all ye other gods of this place, grant me to become beautiful in the inner man, and whatever outward things I have may be at peace with those within. May^I deem the wise man rich, and may I have such a portion of gold as none but a prudent man can either bear or employ. Do we need any thing else, Phaedrus ? For myself I have prayed enough.—Plato (Phcedrus).
