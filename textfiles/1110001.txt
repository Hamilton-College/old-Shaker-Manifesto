SOMETIME MARIA L. SCHULTZ Sometime, when all my weary tasks are done, And life's hard lessons learned, When ceased the tired walks from sun to sun,— When rest is fairly earned; — When all the crosses have been carried through, Temptations met, and passed ; —I think there will be something sweet and true. To bless me at the last. And if, through all the darkly-curtained days Of years which follow Time, I can look up, and see the golden rays Of God's love-light sublime ; — If I can drink life's bitter wine, and still Taste His sweet love divine, I think that I may know that 'tis His will To test this faith of mine. But if my heart complains because its tasks Do all so hard appear, And in unreconciled impatience asks Why life is so severe ; — And if it murmurs that it cannot learn The lesson it most needs, I think there will be one for me, more stern To translate into deeds. Then let me lowly live, and faithful, keep God's counsels as I go, Rememb'ring there's a harvest yet to reap From seeds which now I sow. And if, with holy courage, for Truth's sake, My soul through trial stands,— I think it will be something sweet to take A blessing from God's hands. Canaan, N. Y.
