MUSCLE AND BRAIN Work.— In the end of a Cycle, muscle and brain become too much separated. In the forming of a new Cycle, which is ever effected by a new revelation, muscle and brain are again brought into united activity. Adam and Eve were set, not merely to speculate upon the infinite botanical and zoological varieties of the garden of the Earth, but to dress and keep it in order—to work. The Egypians had become utterly separated into brain-workers and muscle-workers. The God of the Hebrews laid the foundation of a new social system among the Israelites in re-united brain and muscle-works. He made life itself, to each individual, dependent upon muscle — hand and finger labor — no exceptions to the law, Gather your own food, or die. Manna and labor were inseparable. Under that ruling, all had some opportunity for brain-labor. The Apostolic decision, that 'He who would not work, neither shall he eat,' was under the same law. It may be noted, that, Avhen professed Christians had divorced Brain and Muscle, they had also divorced their diluted Gospel from the 'spiritual gifts' by which the early, working Christians had been distinguished from the world.
