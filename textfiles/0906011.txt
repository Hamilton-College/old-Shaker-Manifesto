FAREWELL, VAIN WORLD GEORGE H, GARPHIE Farewell, vain world of strife, With thy delusive snares ; For endless joys of life I leave thy pains and cares. Farewell, vain world once more,O, world of many sins ; My hopes now higher soar, My faith in Christ begins. Once, though a haven bright, With all thy pleasures wild ; I was captive in thy might, Thou leadst me as a child. Brighter now the dawn appearsI see a light afar; Inspiration bids me cheer To the Golden Gates ajar. Shakers, N. Y.
