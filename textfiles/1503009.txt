IF JESUS WAS HERE. NAPOLEON D. BROWN. If Jcsils was here he would not be a politician. He would not be a Democrat or a Republican. lie would condemn both so far as it pertained to Christianity. He would not join himself to the popular churches of the world because they do not follow the advice he gave in his first appearing. He would not marry, nor commit adultery, nor would he trade and traffic, buy and sell, to get gain for individual comfort; so as to dress fine, ride line horses, provide a sumptuous table, for his few choice friends ; and there sit to eat and drink and talk of things pertaining to this life. He would not swear, nor goto war and kill people for fame, lie would not drink whiskey, nor chew tobacco, nor preach the gospel for pay. What then would he do? He would preach the gospel of the Kingdom of Heaven, free ; without money and without price. He would gather his followers together in Church Order, laying down Avhat little property they had, at the feet of the Great Preacher, which he would pronounce common. He would have land purchased ; and houses erected, suitable for the comfort and convenience of his people, and every one should have according as he or she Ineedeth. Those that had married would be as [ though they were Brother and Sister, and they would be father and mother to ! all. In fact, he would form a Shaker ; Village, which he has done, and not j onlv one, but seventeen of them, and .'� he is Lord of all, and dwells within i them, and is their God and they are his.
