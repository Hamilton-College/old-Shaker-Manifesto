TRUTH. BY A. E. P. Roll on, thou mighty tide of truth, And deluge all the land; Sweep error from those honored posts, Where now it holds command. Roll on, roll on, nor cease thy flow, Till every seed shall die, Of worthless tares and bitter fruit, Sown by the enemy. Too long already has this tide Set back upon its source; Still it is gaining added strength, And a resistless force. And when the rains from heaven descend, 'Twill swell a torrent deep, And foam and dash impetuously, And every barrier leap. . Then raise the flood-gates, free its course, And let it onward go ! The thirsty earth will drink it in, And better fruits will grow. Why should we spend our precious time In beating back the truth? And see grim want and famine gaunt Still stalking o'er the earth. Why not set free this blessed stream, To irrigate the land? Why not go into all the world, Obeying Christ's command? Such arc the thoughts tumultuous, Now surging in my soul; But which I'm vain endeavoring To keep in my control. You know, to wakeful watching eyes The night seems very long; And should we work when darkness reigns, It might be all done wrong. But some bright rays are beaming through, Upon my darkened way, THE MANIFESTO. 35 And streaks of light are glancing in, Betokening the day. We'll throw the shutters open wide, Admit the sun's bright rays. For see the eastern firmament With light is all ablaze! Now hope revives within my soul I will no longer fear, Since there's a Power above myself, That silent prayer will hear. For I seem to hear this answer , Come floating now to me ; 'Fear not, fear not, who watch and wait, The truth shall yet be free. It soon shall have a channel made, I will the gates unlock, And force for it a passage-way, Though chiseled through a rock.' Selected.
