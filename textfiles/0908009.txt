LIFE'S MORNING ANNA STEPHENS Life's morning hours soon pass away, Like hues of sunset light : No vain regrets, no mournful tears, Can stay their arrowy flight, As clouds before the summer wind— With naught their course to stay— So morning years with youthful dreams, Glide to eternity. But will they pass like summer's clouds Upon the balmy air ; No good thing sought, no good deed done, No treasure gained with care ? 0, what is youth but life's fair spring, Its growth and blossom hours ? The time to sow the precious seeds, With earnest, spirit powers. The wheat we sow will surely grow, This law will never sleep ; And if our hopes are true or false, Their harvest we must reap. 176 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. But, if through life's fair spring-tide years We till the mellow soil; And do our work with willing hands, Through summer hours of toil. Autumn will yield a precious store, To fill our granary ; And we can sing a joyful song, In harvest jubilee. The evil days will never come— No future shall we fear— But fruits of everlasting peace, Will in our lives appear. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
