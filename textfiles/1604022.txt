SEEK FOR THE TRUTH, The acceptance of the testimony of the Church of Christ can lead only to one result; the crucifixion of the worldly element in the soul. If the religious work which we have accepted, fails to accomplish this essential point, it is quite evident that we have not chosen the right form of testimony, or have not been baptized at the right fountain. So carefully warned we should not be deceived by accepting an article which is not in harmony with the standard, or the Christ life. There can be no reasonable excuse for us to pass in by the way of the 'broad gate' as we know without a doubt that it leads to destruction. If we venture to move along with the worldly crowd, then we may be assured of this fact; we run a great risk of losing sight of the narrow way that leads to life. We cannot walk both roads at the same time. So thorough is the investigation of every department of earthly duties, and so forcibly subjected to the test of criticism that it will be known to the fullest extent, whether an article is genuine or false, or whether it be an amalgamation of good and bad, and as thorough an investigation Avill be made of the systems of religion, by which the lives of men assume to be governed. The only safe course, is to study into lhe truth, and to make that preparation in the soul, that God's word may prove acceptable and that all error may be rejected. Men cannot gather grapes of thorns nor figs of thistles, any more than they did in the early days of Christianity, and yet an effort is made from generation to generation to accomplish this very thing. Attempting to bring righteousness out of unrighteousness and to establish for salvation the rules which governed Adam, Noah, David and Solomon, a Babel of religious ideas has been brought forward as being in harmony with the spiritual instruction of Jesus Christ. Every dispensation may have had its special teachers, and these messengers may have been sent by divine authority to accomplish a certain work. ï¿½ Adam, although called a son of God came with a message that did not carry him above the elements of the earth, and yet he may have fulfilled the mission for which he was sent. Noah, decidedly in advance of Adam, begun to preach righteousness in the earth, and lived so carefully that the record speaks of him as walking with God. Moses with a still greater work, disciplined the mind to the keeping of laws and regulations. He made his followers more or less responsible to God for the course they pursued in their relation with mankind, and then affixed a penalty for every transgression. The mission of Jesus was of a new order, a new creation, a dispensation of righteousness. To accept him was to accept the assurance of eternal life, which he, in all its fullness brought to man, while the blessings so needful in this world, would through him be increased an hundred fold. We find that those who had been chosen as leaders of God's people before the time of Jesus Avere zealous advocates of the law of generation and even demanded their followers to enter into that relation. The whole of their work belonged to the earthly kingdom and included the selfishness of a private inheritance, the revengefuluess of war and the carnal association of a life in the flesh. YYhen Jesus was called to embrace his gospel work, his whole theme was that of regeneration, in which the kingdom of God that was to be established among men, claimed his first attention. In this kingdom all the selfish relations that have occupied so conspicuous a place in former dispensations, will now cease. The work of Jesus Christ is that of the resurrection order, and all who accept it will rise and become the sons and dauo-ho ters of God. To follow Jesus, we have this simple but effectual rule. A man must forsake all that he hath. 'Go,' said he to the young convert, 'sell all thou hast, give it to the poor, then come and follow me. ' Encumbered with selfish property, neither a young nor an old man could be a disciple of the Teacher. If this young man could not secure the privilege of discipleship without this great sacrifice, can it be done now with less sacrifice ? Those Christians of today, who live very much as did the carnal Corinthians, in the days,of the apostles, would not be interested to^bear any additional cross. In their combination scheme they have quoted largely from the writings of Moses, and from those of St. Paul and as one might very naturally suppose, made use of but little that was spoken by Jesus. A healthy revival of the testimony of the Nazarene would be the opening of a new era upon the earth, and the promulgation of the spirit of practical righteousness as it was once heard in the cities of Judea would make of the ' kingdoms of this world, the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ.' It would also make a radical separation between the sons of God and the sons of Belial, and awaken a testimony that would demand the crucifixion of every worldly element in the soul.
