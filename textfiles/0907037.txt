He paused, looked at the disturbers, and said : ' I am always afraid to reprove those who misbehave, for this reason : Some years since, as I was preaching, a young man who sat before me was constantly laughing, talking and making uncouth grimaces. I paused and administered a severe rebuke. After the close of the service, a gentleman said to me : ' Sir, you have made a great mistake ; that young man was an idiot.' Since then I have always been afraid to i-eprove those who misbehave themselves in chapel, lest I should repeat that mistake, and reprove another idiot.'
