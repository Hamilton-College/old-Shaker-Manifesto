Asï¿½And given a world with exclusive' ness, etc. We have received a report of the meeting held in Pittsfield, written by the Believers of Mt. Lebanon, which will be read with pleasure, but was received too late for insertion in the April Manifesto. Look for it next month. A very interesting letter received from our friends on the Pacific coast, will also be found in the May Manifesto. The article from Elder C. G. Eeed, is pleasantly appreciated. Write again.
