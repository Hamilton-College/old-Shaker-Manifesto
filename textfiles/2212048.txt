Phrenological Journal and Science of Health We find the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health up to date in its consideration of current events. For instance, The Late Arctic Expedition and its commander, Lieut. E. E. Peary, receive an appreciative notice with several illustrations. Then follows a sketch of the doings in Chicago, touching the Columbus Exposition; several of the large buildings are given, and a portrait of the President of the Directory, Mr. Higinbothams. A sketch of Mr. Whittier, with excellent portrait follows. The Poet is very popularly termed 'Poet of Freedom.' In the department of practical, mental science, a story of school experience commends itself to the world of teachers, viz: 'Out of Darkness into Light,' and the reflections on the faculty of Sublimity show a nice, critical sense. The essay on Reverence hits the times well, and so does 'An Open Letter' to mothers, which especially shows an exceptional courage in both the writer and the publisher in appealing to the popular common sense with regard to a most important yet most sedulously avoided subject. Dr. Handford discusses health and disease in his usually practical manner, and in the same department is an article on the usefulness of the enema as a preventive or remedy in many diseases. A careful reading of the Notes in Anthropology is advised, as several items of much value are recorded in that department. The best advice is, the whole of this November number of the veteran magazine should be read by all. It is published at $1.50 a year or 15 cents a month. The last three months of this year free to new Mibscribers. Address Fowler &amp; Wells Co., publishers, 25 East 21st Street, New York.
