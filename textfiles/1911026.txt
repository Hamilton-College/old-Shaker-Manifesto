Pleasant Hill, Ky. The youth and children of the Center Family were made happy the 22nd. inst. with a long delightful trip after hickory nuts. The party, numbering twenty-nine, left home at 2 o'clock A. M., in four carriages. (Quite a caravan.) Twenty-four miles brought us to the renowned hickory woods. The day was per feet in its loveliness. After gathering a liberal supply of nuts, we reached home at 7-30, P. M. very tired and sleepy. The day will long be remembered by the 'Little Folks,' and we return our kindest thanks to all the kind Brethren and Sisters who did so much for our enjoyment. Especially to Elder Napoleon, Bros. Alfred Vann and H. N. Daily. The West Family youth also spent the day very pleasantly at Danville, Ky. Corn averages 50 bushels an acre. The potato crop is better than we have had f^r years, unusually large. A half acre in our garden yielded 200 bushels. Quite an abundance of apples. The Centre Family made 31 gallons of apple butter. Preserving on a small scale this year. M. A. J.
