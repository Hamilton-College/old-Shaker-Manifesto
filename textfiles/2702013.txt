Sabbathday Lake, Me. Jan. 1897. 'He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his^name's sake,' are the words printed at the top of a calendar some good friend presented to the writer at Christmas time. Surely I have been led in the paths of righteousness where the Lord is my Shepherd and I need never want, while I rely on his promise; 'Lo, I am with you always.' Winter set in quite cold, and froze the ponds and streams at an early date. Ice is said to be 16 in. thick on the lake and our Brethren prepared for cutting it, but a warm spell came, accompanied with heavy rains, which covered the ice and that business had to be suspended. As it is colder now, they will complete the work the coming week. There has been no snow to speak of in this section thus far. Our good Br. Samuel altho feeble speaks of the Brethren and Sisters and is continually blessing them. He often notices the faithfulness of Br. Pliny who is seen about the place these cold days with fuel to keep the fires burning brightly. The Brethren have sold 1,000 cords of fire-wood on the stump to the Kicker Brothers. At this time the cellars are full of apples, and no sale for them. Flowers are blooming in the greenhouse for us, and this is indeed very cheering. Flowers, by some, are considered among the non-essentials, but they certainly are beautiful, and cause one to have pure and holy thoughts that are uplifting, inspiring and divine. A'la S. dimming*.
