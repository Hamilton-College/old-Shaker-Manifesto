'THINK ON THESE THINGS.' M. J. Anderson. All our dignity lies in our thoughts.ï¿½ PASCAL. Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things arepure, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. Phil, iv., 8. Worthy subjects for contemplation ; themes to uplift the mind and feelings from the miasmic lowlands of sensuality, up to the sunlit slopes of our higher nature and being. The fair sweet lily and the noxious weed may grow side by side, each drawing sustenance from the same soil, one absorbing the nectar, the other the poison of life elements. So it is with individuals ; under the same circumstances and advantages, they will, each according to their inherent nature and tendencies, either absorb the spirit that unfolds the good and beautiful, or otherwise imbibe and assimilate all that tends to develop the coarser part of their natures. We must strive to curb and rein our thoughts as the master does his steed, teaching them to go in the direction we will. If, according to the apostle's injunction, we dwell on whatsoever things are true, we shall preclude from our mental vision, that vast array of superficial and unreal imagery which the world places before the mind, impressing it with false ideas and chimerical fancies, that have no foundation in truth. If we think only upon the true, the curtain of life's drama will rise revealing scenes of naturalness and beauty, unfolding to our senses the grandeur and glory of a life whose centre is God, and whose outgrowth is beneficence and love. 'Whatsoever things are honest.' Ah, if we think honestly we shall surely act nobly towards all mankind. They who work by hypocrisy and deceit, will be crushed in the ruins of their own building. Oh, let thy whole life reveal sincerity of motive, for he who strives with honesty of purpose, wields a power more potent for good than earth's mightiest chieftain. 'Whatsoever things are just.' 'Deal justly, and love mercy,' giving to all their exact dues. If our minds are exercised in this direction, equity will govern all our dealings with others ; we shall ever keep before us the divine ideal of righteousness, dispensing good to all mankind, without favor or partiality. 'Whatsoever things are pure.' Upon this basis rests the whole structure of good thoughts. For this cause came the flood. 'Their thoughts were evil from their youth upwards,' and their whole lives were corrupt through sin. How can we form a desirable character blameless before God and men, unless its foundation is in purity. The foul germs of impure thoughts spring up to blight every good thing; to despoil arid mar the fair image of God. Let us look well to our thoughts, and above all things be chaste in our imaginations, then will our whole being be illumed with the light and truth of God, for where sin reigns He cannot dwell. ' Whatsoever things are lovely.' If we think with admiration upon those qualities and graces which adorn the spirit and make it angelic, we shall strive earnestly to incorporate them in our lives, then we shall indeed be lovely and loveable. 'Things that are of good report' concerning our brother or our sister, let us delight to contemplate, nor listen to the voice of slander which ever seeks some trifling flaw or blemish, to mar or defame the reputation of those who are striving to live uprightly. ' If there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.' Look ever for the good, and blame only where duty and necessity require it, and then let our reproof be given in the right spirit and manner. If we realize that ' Our happiness depends upon the quality of our thoughts,' we shall guard the secret springs of action with care and concern, remembering that out of them are the issues of life.
