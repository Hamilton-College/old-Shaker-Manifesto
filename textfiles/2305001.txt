A Biographical Sketch of a Remarkable Career. Passed to spirit life, March 6, 1893, Elder F. W. Evans of Mount Lebanon, Columbia Co., N. Y., in the eighty-fifth year of his age, without sickness and without pain. The North Family at Mount Lebanon, where Elder Frederick had remained for sixty-three years, may never produce a more remarkable or notable character. He presided as Elder of said family for fifty-seven years and until last November. Some years ago by invitation of a friend, he wrote his autobiography for the Atlantic Monthly. This article was afterwards republished with a compilation of other articles relating to Shakerism, in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1888, in a book of two hundred and seventy pages, under the title of 'The Autobiography of a Shaker.' From this book we quote the following: ' 'I see great importance in a principle�very little in an individual. Not of myself should I write of myself, but in the hope that others may be advantaged thereby, I acquiesce in the foregoing suggestion. I have always lived much in the future, yet my present life has been a practical success; while my work has ever been before me, my reward has always beeu witli me. 1 am satisfied with the continued realizations of the prophetical spirit within�of the abstract principles that have been my inner life.' 'My father's family were of the middle class in England. They were long lived, my grandmother reaching the advanced age of one hundred and four years, and my grandfather approaching one hundred. My father, George Evans, was the youngest of twelve children, and died comparatively young. He was sent into the English army; was under Sir Ralph Abercrombie in the Egyptian expedition, co-operating with the fleet under Nelson, and held a commission in the service. My mother was of a class a little above, so that the marriage caused a perpetual breach between the two families. Her name was Sarah White. I was born in Leominster, Worcestershire, England, on the 9th of June, 1808. The first fact that I can remember may be of some interest to the student in anthropology. When I came of age, and on my return to England in 1830, I was relating to an aunt on my father's side, whom I had 106 THE MANIFESTO. never before seen, that I had always stored up in my memory one thing which I could not account for; I could remember nothing before or after it to give it a meaning, and none of my mother's relatives knew anything about it. I saw the inside of a coach, and was handed out of it from a woman's arms into those of some other person. My aunt was utterly astonished and stated that my mother was coming down from London to Birmingham, when I was not more than six months old, that something happened to the horses which frightened the party badly, and that I was handed out (just as I had seen and remembered) by my mother into the arms of another person.' 'When I was four years of age, my mother died and I was thrown among her relatives, who sent me to school at Stourbridge, where there were some two hundred scholars; and the position the master assigned me was that of the poorest scholar in the school, which effected my release from the school-room, to my great satisfaction and peace of mind; for if there was one thing more than another that I hated, it was school books and an English school master with his flogging proclivities. I was then about eight years old.' He then gives an interesting account of how he was cast among his uncles and aunts; of the farm life at Chadwick Hall and how he rebelled at being educated; of his father and brother visiting him and his choice to go with them to America, when twelve years old. He describes his brother, George H. Evans, the great land reformer and associate of Horace Greeley, and his home at Binghamton, N*. Y., where an aunt of his made the remarkable prophecy that of all the young people belonging to the three families of his father and his uncles, Frederick, though then a black sheep among them, 'would yet occupy the most desirable position in life,' which came to pass. He goes on to say: ' 'I now took a sudden turn in respect to books and learning. I saw that knowledge was not only power, but that it wag also respect and consideration. I made up my mind that I would learn to read and love to read. My first dose was the 'Life of Nelson;' then I set myself to reading the Bible through by course; and I did it. And here I made a discovery (or rather my friends did,) that my memory was so retentive that whatever I read was, as it were, pictured on my brain. I had only to look at the picture to see it in all its minutest particulars without any effort. And (as Lincoln would say) this reminds me of what a woman I met on a Hudson river boat said; that in coming from California, she was nearly drowned, but before consciousness was gone0 all the sins of her life were present to her view ; not one, however small was missing.' ' 'I next went to Ithaca and put myself to school to an Episcopal minister, who proved a real friend. One of his first lessons was to teach me how to think. He had only a dozen scholars and we were all well attended to. I became with him a great favorite, and the times of intermission were largely devoted to my special instruction and benefit. At parting, he advised me THE MANIFESTO. 107 always so to live that I could respect myself, and that has ever since been my life motto. Next, I apprenticed myself at Sherburne Four Corners, N. Y., to learn the hatting business. There, I had access to a library of valuable books, and I took to reading -Rollins' Ancient History,' 'Plutarch's Lives of Great Men,' the 'Tattler' and the 'Spectator,' and Zimmerman, Shakespeare, Watts, Young, Thomson, Socrates and Plato. I also took up theology and asked myself, why I was a Christian, and not a Mahometan, or a follower of Confucius ? for I ha*d read the Koran and the Bibles of all peoples that I could obtain. I read Locke 'On the Human Understanding,' and 'The Being of a God.' This laid in me the foundation of materialism. For I came to the conclusion that matter was eternal, had never been created. Thomas Paine's 'Crisis' and 'Rights of man,' together with Volney and Voltaire, were also among my friends.' 'I became a settled and firm materialist�a believer in matter, as I then understood it, the object of my external senses ; for I did not then know that I had any other senses. This continued to be my condition until I met with the Shakers, some five years afterwards. I possessed this one great advantage, that what I did believe was true, however much there might be true that I did not believe.' In the following chapters, Elder Frederick tells of his conversion to the socialistic theories of Robert Owen and to communism, and of his visit to a community of this kind at Massilon, Ohio. On this journey to the West, he traveled mostly on foot in preference to any other way, walking sometimes forty miles a day. In 1829, he returned to England, where he remained about a year. He then came back to New York and assisted his brother, George H. Evans and others, in perfecting plans for a new community, and was deputed to travel for information and to find a suitable location in which to start. 'At this time, we had in New York,' he says, ' 'a Hall of Science, and Robert Dale Owen and Fanny Wright were among its great lights.' In the year 1830, he called to see the United Society of Believers at Mt. Lebanon, and was directed to the North House, as the proper place for inquirers. Here he was agreeably surprised and impressed by the air of candor and openness and the quiet self-repose with which he was met. After a week's inquiry, he pronounced the Shakers a Society of infidels, and declared that it was the first time he had found religionists who were also rationalists, ready to render a reason for the faith and hope that were in them. He further says: ' 'The Shakers prayed for me and I was met in my own path by spiritual manifestations during several weeks, until my reason was as entirely convinced by the evidence I received of the existence of a spirit world, as I am by evidence presented to my outer senses, of the existence of our material earth.' 'After three month's absence, Ireturned to New York, to face for the first time my astounded materialistic friends, to whom a more incomprehensible change could not have happened 108 THE MANIFESTO. than my apparent defection from their ranks. As soon as my arrival in the city was known, there was a gathering at my brother's office. The room was well filled; many older than myself, to whom I had looked as my superiors in knowledge and experience, were present. At first there was a little disposition shown by a few to be querulous and bantering, while the greater part took it as a serious matter to be righted by solid argument.' 'I called the attention of the company, and inquired whether any of them wished to give me any information concerning materialism�its principles ? All said, 'No ! you do not need it.' I then inquired if any one present was acquainted with Shakerism? and again the answer was 'No!' Then, gentlemen, I rejoined, it is for you to listen and for me to speak. And I did speak ; and gave them as simple an account of my experience thus far as I was able.' 'I also had a separate interview with Robert Dale Owen at the Hall of Science. At its close he remarked: 'I will come up to New Lebanon and stay two months, and if I find things as they now appear I will become a Shaker.' I still await his arrival. In course of time all of them became Spiritualists. Who sowed the seed?' ' 'I joined myself to the order and became a Shaker. I have now (1868) had thirty-eight years' experience and feel satisfied with the goodness of God and his people to me. I have gained a degree of victory over self which causes my peace to flow as a river, and which fills me with sympathy for all seekers after truth and righteousness.' In the transition of Elder Frederick, ends the career of a prophetic, inspirational man of God�a man, as a dear friend lately expressed it, wiio always found the seed that grows the broad leafed and glowing tasseled flower. In his public capacity as a minister of the gospel of Christ in his second appearing he was equaled by none. Twice he has been on a missionary trip to England, in 1871 and again in 1887, the last time visiting Scotland also. Upon both occasions he was accompanied by our friend and brother James M. Peebles, M. D'., the 'Spiritual Pilgrim,' for whom he entertained the warmest sympathy and love. Physically, Elder Frederick was strong and vigorous, and remarkably well preserved for one so advanced in age. This condition may be measurably attributed to his hygienic manner of living, having been a vegetarian for about sixty years, and to his regular and systematic habits. With a nature susceptible to the weal or woe of mankind, a heart full of love, compassion and charity, and a soul redeemed from the lusts of the flesh and of the mind and made clean and white, he could the more readily perceive how to reach the hearts of the people and make them feel the truth for which he pleaded. His plain, straightforward arguments could not well be disputed, and if they were, discussion of some length was sure to follow. Tenacity for the right, as he saw it, was a prominent feature in his character, and so clearly was it defined to him that he would fain have every one believe as he believed. Happily his faith was founded on the truth, THE MANIFESTO. 109 based upon the rock of divine revelation. Many a time-worn, weary traveler has stopped amid the fevered heat and rush and wrangling of the surging crowd, to drink of the cup and to eat of the testimony of truth, of which he was an exponent, till it became their life, even as it was his. It was his meat to do the will of his Heavenly Father, and his drink to feel the love of his Heavenly Mother. This was his treasure, and for it he sacrificed worldly honor, fame and renown. His many friends in the outside world will miss the noble form, the kindly face and the proffered hand of the grand old man. As a reformer among reformers, he saw afar off the danger signal and promptly gave the alarm. He led the opposition to the Sunday closing of the world's fair and was emphatic upon the separation of church and state, and not less so in demanding equity as the only solution of the labor problem. The leading topics of the day in the world of social and political thought constantly occupied his mind and moved his pen. A few days before passing out, he made these remarks: 'We are living in a world of ideas. Napoleon said in his day the next war would be a war of ideas; how much more does it apply to this, our day ! ' To the Society of Believers, he was a watchman on the tower of Zion, one of her main standard bearers and a mouth-piece from which issued words of eternal truth. To his own home and family he was strongly attached and the attachment was mutual. We loved him as our father; he loved us as his children. We saw in him a life hid with Christ in God, a life made manifest by good deeds, a life ever green, even as the groves about our home which he planted, trimmed and cultivated with his own hands. And now the silver cord is loosed and the golden bowl is broken at the cistern and the pitcher broken at the fountain. The spirit will not only return to God, who gave it, but also to his own, and his own will receive him and know him ; for is he not now, as always, a ministering angel, sent to us who shall be the heirs of salvation? The spirit of prophecy was upon him to the end. At times during his last hours, he sung parts of the following verses, which he wrote and published in 'The Shaker,' when he was editing that publication about twenty years ago under the unpretentious title, UNBORN POETRY. There is a river that makes glad the city of our God. Passing over the river is not to die With outstretched limbs in state to lie, For as a man thinketh, so is he, In time or in eternity. To die is a change that none forego, The peasant, the king, the friend and foe, Go hastening on in weal and woe, To the land of ghosts which none may know. Know as we know the things of earth, In manhood, youth, and back to birth. Mystery of mysteries from the beginning! Why do we live? love? Why keep on sinning? Where did we come from? Whither go we, Men, women, and children, bond and free? To die is not to pass over the river, For still we live, live on forever, 110 THE MANIFESTO. But there is a river that's never dry That none may pass over until they die, Die to the life that reproduces The race of man without abuses. The end has come, the summer has ended, The harvester death, with life is blended, Life�eternal life, from the throne of God, The Lamb was the first, the first who trod The banks of that river�the river of God.
