THE ART OF NEWSPAPER MAKING Of all writings of man, none is so widely perused and critically examined as the newspaper; and of all public characters, newspaper contributors mostly require diligence, energy, and patient application. The necessity of giving variety to their articles, in length, and subject, and style, creates a heavy draft upon the intellect. The articles must not be too long, or they will weary, no matter how much thought expands, it must be contracted ; nor how many ideas may suggest themselves, they must each be condensed into a narrow compass ; the marrow of the subject must be extracted by patient toil, and served up in tiny morsels to fastidious readers. They must not be too short, or some will complain that the subject is not finished. They must not be too dry, or the fitful or careless mind will not read ; they must not be too light, or the austere will turn from them with disgust. The language must not be too learned, or it will shoot over the heads of the youth, the future strength of the land ; it must not be too simple, or the self-styled learned will reject the pieces With contempt. The style must be easy, flowing, or none will be pleased.
