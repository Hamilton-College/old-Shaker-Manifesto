Progression [part 3 of 6] A. DOOLITTLE, EDITRESS Melissa : When we can see the beautiful Combined with useful art, We see an impress of the truth That moulds the human heart. And this, within our own loved home, Securely we can hold, If science, reason, culture, grace In wisdom here unfold. But permeating all must shine The faith, the holy light, That teaches us to live to God, And read his works aright. Catharine : From countless stars with golden eye, From fleecy clouds that float on high. From the lightning's flash that rends the sky, And the thunders heavy pealing : From the wintry storm and the summer's shower, From mountains grand that upward tower, From boisterous winds that sweep with power, And breezes softly stealing : From ancient rocks and mineral ore, From the mighty deep with its ceaseless roar, And pearly shells that strew its shore, We learn the law of progression. ' Tis written on every created thing, In the beauteous life of the welcome spring, And the rich increase which the harvests bring As the seasons glide in succession.
