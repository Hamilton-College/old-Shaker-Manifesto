VEGETARIANISM. Having published several articles producing an erroneous impression in regard to the above subject, will you receive another view? That man can best subsist on the direct products of the vegetable kingdom, is either a scientific truth or a fallacy. The founder of Hygeio-Therapy believed it to be an important truth, and regarded it as a cornerstone of his system, and if it cannot be maintained the whole structure must topple. Dr. Sanborn in his first article expresses the idea that flesh contains little or no nutriment. No other vegetarian, that we are aware of, has advanced this view. Vegetarians admit that flesh is a nutritious food, and that man may live in health to a good old age, eating it daily, with a good proportion of vegetable products. But Dr. Walter is quite as misleading where he claims that 'it is not true that the mental and physical vigor, especially the former, of the vegetable eater, ever has, or ever can, equal, let alone surpass, that of him who eats food transformed and reorganized by the animal for the use of him.' Pythagoras, Plato, Epicurus, Plutarch, Sir Isaac Newton, Milton, Swedenborg, Shelly, John Howard, John Wesley, and many others who were vegetarians can hardly be sat down upon in regard to mental power by any modern writer. Daniel and his companions not only 'appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat of the king's meat,' but, 'in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in his realm.'�[Daniel i., 15-20.] 'Enquirer' asks Dr. Walter why, if meats are better adapted to the need of man�'because they have been brought vnearer to the structure of the human organism than the vegetable products,'�may we not logically conclude that human flesh would be the best food of all? This would be the natural inference from this kind of logic, which if true, we ask why do carniverous animals prefer for their food the vegetable-eating animals? Because the flesh of animals appears to be nearer the structure of the human organism it does not follow that it is man's most suitable food. If man's digestive machinery be adjusted to assimilate a different kind of food, it will keep in good condition longer by performing the work for which it was designed, as tills is a rule which applies to all nature's works. It is well known that men are more happy, more healthy, and longer lived, who use their faculties of body and mind, than those who live in idleness. Then it does not follow that because food is easily digested in the stomach that it is the best in all respects. Important changes take place in the liver in what is called 'after digestion,' in which the liver performs an important part, particularly in the metabolism of albuminoids. Dr. J. Milner Fothergill says : 'There can be no question about Hie fact that with some persons vegetable albuminoids are much more easily digested than animal albuminoids.' Dr. B. W. Richardson, equally as good authority, than which there can be no better on physical science, in a recent lecture on the food of man, says : 'From experimental observation which I have made, I am of the opinion that vegetable flesh-forming substances may be as easily digested when they are properly presented to the stomach as animal substances of like quality.' In taking the testimony of personal experience we must consider the habits of the individual. The digestive machinery of the flesh eater has a different adjustment to that of the fruit and grain eater and in man has the power of adaptation to circumstances. Man therefore may become so adapted to the use of pernicious substances as to seem to require them. That many find no trouble in digesting flesh, but would be distressed by a meal of fruit ard grain is true, others will feel happy while chewing tobacco and be miserable without it. This shows how much an unexplained fact is worth. Thousands of men, having become con- vinced of the evil of tobacco using, for example, have given it up only to return to it with their chains of habit revived, and all their courage for another trial gone, whereas by right management for the first few days, they might have become masters of themselves as when evil habits are removed nature readily restores normal conditions. There is also a necessity of good management in changing a life-long habit of diet, and many have failed for lack of this, who with it would easily have succeeded. The practice of using flesh as a portion of food being almost universal by the people of this country there are very few advocates of the vegetarian theory; as men of good scientific attainments are apt to be influenced in their teachings by their perverted proclivities and conditions. Dr. B. W- Richardson, above quoted, a flesh eater, can rise above his idiosyncrasies, and referring to man's food, he said: 'Evidence on this question can only be derived from two sources, the one physical, and the other mural. In searching for physical evidence it is necessary to turn to the construction of man, and to ask whether by his build and construction he was formed for animal food * * * * On the whole my judgment on the evidence of the teeth is in favor of tlie vegetarian system. * * * If from the teeth we pass to the subject of the process of digestion which goes on in the mouth, the evidence, as far as it goes, is also in favor of the vegetarian theory. The secretion of saliva is clearly a provision for vegetable food and not for animal. * * * * Taking into consideration the whole facts connected with this structure of man, the inference was justified, that in spite of the very long time which man had been subjected to an animal diet, he retained in preponderance his original and natural taste for an innocent diet derived from the first fruit of the earth. * * * * In my long medical career I have known no instance in which a child had not preferred fruit to animal food, and it is a lesson learned from experience that the next natural diet for the young, after being removed from the natural milk diet, was one of fruit and bread. * * * From a moral point of view the argument about flesh eating is strongly in favor of the vegetarian theory.' Man possesses p sympathetic nature and to prove that he must violate,'this by taking' the life of the lower animals for his food, would be to show an inharmony in his creation, and thus we must consider that could it be proven that mental and physical strength could be sustained by animal food, we still must consider that these alone cannot bring true greatness and happiness for it is goodness that lifts the soul. The first settlers of this country, who found it a vast wilderness abounding in wild game, its lakes and rivers well supplied with fishes, may have found an excuse in their necessity, in using them for food, but its continuance in these days when that wilderness has been transformed into grain fields and orchards, making it necessary to breed animals for the slaughter, or transport them from the far West, must be attributed to perverted appetite and to misguidance by those who are looked to as teachers in this matter. �J.
