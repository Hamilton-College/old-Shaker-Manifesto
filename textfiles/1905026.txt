AN HONEST CHRISTIAN MAN. The following fable which I have written will serve to illustrate the truth that a truly honest man will not take a larger sum for property than its just value, even if he is offered more. A certain man named George Smith came one day to a farmer named Daniel Jones, wishing to buy a pair of oxen, and said: 'Those red oxen of yours suit me, and I will give you one hundred and twenty dollars for them.' Daniel Jones replied: 'That is thirty dollars more than they are worth.' George Smith looked wonderstruck at this remark. The farmer said : 'I know the value of those oxen better than you do. One of them is a little 'breachy,' and the other one cannot bear the heat so well as some oxea, and yet there are many good qualities in them ; but, all things considered, ninety dollars is all they are worth, aad you may have them for that price.' George Smith gladly took the oxen, and said to a man on his way home : 'It beats all what a difference there is in the religion of men. Now there is old James Clark, my near neighbor; I have heard him make many a long prayer. If he had owned these beautit'ul oxen he would have asked me one hundred and thirty dollars or more for them, and he would have called them a great bargain at that price, and he would not have said a word about one of the oxen being inclined to be breachy, and the other not very tough in hot weather. I do not know anything about religion myself, but one thing I know, as well as I know where the sun shines in a bright day, and that is, there is a mighty big difference between Daniel Jones' religion and James Clark's religion.
