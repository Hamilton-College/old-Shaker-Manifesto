How well to live and do no harm... How well to live and do no harm, Though very little good we do ; How great the lesson yet to learn, To be to others kind and true. Snatched from the world, we know we are, To find the holy, just and pure, To calm the elements that jar, And make a peace that will endure. M. W., Canterbury, N. H.
