THE HAPPY OMEN ' The present age perceives that there are bonds of union far more important than doctrinal divisions.' The above we clip from the editorial note of The Christian Union which commented upon that nature's nobleman, deceased, E. H. Chapin. We hope all our dear friends will read, and ponder upon the noble, tmsectarian sentiments of the above paragraph. Thirty years ago, Dr. Chapin suffered the ignominy of the direst persecutions of pen, press and pulpit. At his funeral, as if to make amends for the iniquities of their early educators, there gathered, to pay the sincerest of respects, clergymen of all the denominations which a quarter of a century ago so detested him and his love for humanity, which so loved God as to believe God hated no one. ' The world does move;' and with it its theological, biased prejudices grow less. Thirty years from now, who knows how much more men will love each other and how fewer creeds there will be, and what there are, how much nearer like Christ, who was positively non-sectarian !
