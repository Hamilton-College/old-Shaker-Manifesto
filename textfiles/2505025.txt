The missionaries do not always have the daintiest menu... The missionaries do not always have the daintiest menu as they sit down to dine. Missionary Walker describing his bill of fare in Central Africa says he occasionally has white ants as a delicacy, and likes THE MANIFESTO. 117 them very much, though it takes some time to get over the feeling of repugnance which ants at first excite as an article of diet. There is nothing like getting used to things. Dr. Junker found that, after a while, he could eat fried ants with as much relish as any of the natives, and the explorers on the Congo have not objected to an occasional hippopotamus steak when stowed goat and boiled chicken have failed to give sufficient variety to the canned meat of civilization. An orchid collector who has enriched the hot-houses of Erastus Corning and other horticulturists, avers that stewed monkey isn't so very bad, at least on the upper Amazon. One dish however, was set before an eminent explorer awhile ago, that was too much for him, and he unconditionally surrendered. It was De Brazza, and he sat down very hungry one day to eat a native dinner on the banks of the Ogowe. He thought he was eating fish and a very palatable dish it seemed, until he was told by the delighted lady cook whom he was complimenting, that it was snake. The information ruined his appetite. The missionary by the way, has abundant cause for thanksgiving, and no doubt has his Thanksgiving dinner. But what foreign missionary dines off roast turkey? Their number can be written by a 0.
