PEACE A LETTEii from that loveable man, Alfred II. Love, inviting us to be a delegate to the Universal Peace Convention beginning on 10th of July, presents some novel features: The old hall in Philadelphia, where war was first declared, has been secured for the above Convention. The first two days are to be occupied by English speaking delegates ; and several days thereafter, by other nationalities. A Peace Forge is to be erected on the Centennial Grounds, and the fulfilment of the long-desired prophecy inaugurated â€” by the transformation of swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks ! Elihu Burritt, the learned blacksmith, has been invited to be one of the forge men. Whether we are there or not, friend Love, and all friends of Peace, we want your help in establishing ' The Peace Congress of Nations !' ^c
