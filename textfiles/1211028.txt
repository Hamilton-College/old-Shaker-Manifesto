VISIT TO BOSTON I have pleasant memories of the friends I met in Boston, and the sights T there saw have left bright pictures on memory's wall. The last day of my stay I went through Prang's vast chromo factory. I had always a curiosity to know how it was possible to manufacture such lovely pictures at so cheap a rate. But I had never once dreamed of the work it took. When I went in and saw long rows of desks, and at each one seated an artist bent intently over a picture, faithfully copying line by line, dot by dot, each little stroke or speck, and saw the pictures transferred one by one to lithographic stones, and then printed on paper or card-board, shade by shade, color by color, a little more red, a little more yellow, a little more brown, till it passed through some twenty or thirty impressions, going from hand-rollers to powerpresses, from room to room, I then realized that even the tiniest chromo was a work of far more toil than a grand painting in oil colors. But the rapidity of the reproduction makes them cheap and plentiful, and I saw some as high as twenty-five dollars in price, and others only a cent or two in value. We saw one large room containing two or three hundred girls, all putting fringes on valentines, chromos, and holiday pictures, and counting, folding, and arranging them; and we saw the Christmas cards for the coming season in process of being made. One. large room way down in the cellar was called the 'stone library.' It was filled with shelves of lithographic stones, containing plates from which the pictures had been printed. These stones are all brought from Bavaria, and many of them cost twenty-five and fifty dollars apiece. We went in the engine room and saw the power that moves the great machinery of the factory, and the engineer touched one of the great belts and lighted a gas-jet with his finger, and also transmitted a spark to each of us from it, by touching the tip of his finger to ours. in Truth Seeker Elmina
