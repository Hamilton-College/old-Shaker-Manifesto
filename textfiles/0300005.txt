WELCOME TO THE NEW LEBANON MINISTRY When the first soft flash of morning Stole o'er the eastern sky, Now we hear the gladsome voices From nature's vast domain; And the stars' last gleams were fading From yon blue vault on high; They have caught the welcome chorus, And echo back the strain, The earth was robed in beauty, Yet fairer than its grace, Appear'd to us the dear ones Whose presence bless this place. The trees with music tremble, The sunbeam glances tell Of the unclouded pleasure That reigns where angels dwell. Chorus. O, welcome! welcome to our feast I On this fair hallow'd ground, From ev' ry heart responding, Sweet welcome echoes round. O. welcome! welcome we repeat, To call your blessing down, Your loving presence with us, Our feast with joy shall crown.
