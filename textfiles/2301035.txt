Betsey Crosman Betsey Crosman , at Church Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Nov. 24, 1892. Age, 88 years and 9 mo. Sister Betsey is the last of that noble family whose names have for so long been synonyms of consecration, virtue and trust-worthiness, in the several homes of our Society. They need no monument to perpetuate their memory, for they will live in the hearts of the people so long as the sun rises over the hills of Mt. Lebanon. A. J. C. We'll not mourn when the beaxitiful spirit Is freed from its casket of clay; For the unseen life, is the real life, The dawn of an Eternal day. A. E. N.
