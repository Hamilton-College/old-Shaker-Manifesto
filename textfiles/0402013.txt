Titles of a secular character are convenient and unobjectionable... Titles of a secular character are convenient and unobjectionable, as they denote one's occupation. Thus doctor, 'squire, captain, editor, merchant, artist, etc., are appropriate titles ; but rev.' is the silliest handle that was ever put to a man's name, and nobody who is not vain and pompous would ever allow himself to be called by it. Only once, we believe, is it used in the Bible, and then applied to no other being than God â€” ' Holy and reverend is his name.' Yet almost every beardless boy in a pulpit (except, perhaps, Elder Grant) is a 'rev.' The title of 'elder,' as a gospel teacher, is rather modest, and it is Scriptural, too; but just think of saying the Rev. Jesus Christ, the Rev. Dr. Paul, the Very Rev. John, the Rt. Rev. Matthew, and the Most 'Rev. Father in God Stephen Barjona! It would be thought an insult, and perhaps indictable aalylasphemy by the statute made and provided. We Americans are great hands for wearing honorary titles, so that plain and democratic 'Mr.,' when superscribing a letter, for instance, is going out of fashion. 'Is the Professor here?' shouted a man as he poked his head into a Boston city street car. 'He is!' answered thirteen men, as they all rose up.
