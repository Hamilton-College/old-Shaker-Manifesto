In Memory of our Sister JULIA RUSSELL. By Sadie Y. Webber. When the angel, Death, entered the home of the great poet Longfellow, separating him from a dearly loved friend, he fashioned his grief in these beautiful lines,ï¿½ 'Good-night Good-night, as we so oft have said Beneath this roof at midnight, in the days That are no more, and shall no more return. Thou hast but taken up thy lamp and gone to bed; I stay a little longer, as one stays To cover up the embers that still burn.' Dearest Sister, thus, we bid thee, a kind 'Good-night.' There are embers still burning which we must cover, before we retire, and tho the hours may often seem long, we will work with hope, and trust that a glorious, eternal morning will break for each of us, when we shall meet thee in spirit life, never to part.. Thy call was sudden, but it reminds us that 'We are but tenants in the Lord's house, we must assure ourselves ol this, for shortly the great Landlord may give us notice that our lease has expired.' Wise indeed, are they who live in constant preparation, and can meet this call with a justified conscience and answer, 'Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents, behold I have gained beside them five talents more.' Our departed Sister needs no eulogy of words to portray her character, her example of daily consecration speaks for itself and we know her to-day, as an earnest, devoted spirit. Not alone have her hands toiled for temporal interests, even to the last moments of consciousness, her consecrations for the upbuilding of a religious home, have been manifest to all. While her life was molded by Godly principles, she earnestly exhorted others to the same care. We shall miss her voice which has so constantly joined in the service of God, but we pray that her ministration will remain to bless the labors of her companions. From the young, especially she receiv* s a tribute of deep gratitude; many times have they realized her Christian charity, and none can say they ever failed in duty through her influence. We realize all too deeply that the home-circle has been broken and a gem of worth has been snatched away. We mourn thy absence dear Sister as we would the loss of a beautiful treasure at the zenith of its usefulness; the bereavement is too great. In our grief we turn to our Heavenly Father who knoweth the depth of every mystery, and give thy life into His keeping while we pray for guidance to fashion our own after the pattern of Christ. Rest in peace; already thou hast heard the summons, 'Well done, good and faith, ful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' Thy works merit this, and as a flower in Paradise we leave thee till we, through good works, are permitted to swell the ranks of the redeemed. Enfield, N. H.
