FAITH. HARRIET WHITNEY. 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things not seen. ' It is to the soul a. gift of God, and if nourished by tenderness and love ; will grow to be of great value. To the Christian pilgrim on his upward march through life, faith is a reliable staff. To the Mariner on the tempestuous deep when the angry surges roll and toss his little barque, and every moment would appear to be the last; how in faith he throws himself upon the mercy of a kind and beneficent Father, hoping through that faith, to be saved from the perilous deep. So it ought to be with us that are young; who have just started the Christian race, we ought to have a faith strong in God ; so that in the day of trial we could say with our blessed Savior, ' Get thee behind me Satan,' I will have no part with thee. If we have strong faith in God and in the principles of right, we are building a structure whose foundation is solid and firm. Without faith it is impossible to please God. ' It is not given to one condition or age, and with held from another. It is for us that are young as well as for those of riper years. By the forcing of small roots into the earth the towering tree is firmly established to brave the tempest, and so faith grows with each individual effort until it becomes a permanent indwelling principle.
