THE BROOKLET May Rullhausen Down from the heights of the mountain, Flowing without delay, Cometh the beautiful brooklet, Day after day. Over the stones and the pebbles, Over the green soft moss, Still in its curious winding, It keepeth its course. Under the cloud and the sunlight, Under,the tall stately trees, Out in the clear air of heaven, 'Tis free as the breeze. Passing through vales and through meadows, Rippling along with delight, Singing a song full of music, Even at night. Dashing o'er rocks, full and bounding, Heaving and foaming along, Evening and night, day and morning, Happy and strong. And where, O where art thou going?— 'On to the beautiful sea, Where I'll mingle my sparkling waters Lost ever to thee.' —Age 14 years. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
