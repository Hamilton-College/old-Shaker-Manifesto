Removing Freckles The Christian Union says: 'Horseradish grated into a cup of cold sour milk—let it stand twelve hours, then strain and apply two or three times a day—will remove freckles from hands or face in a short time. Or, one ounce lemon-juice mixed with a quarter of a drachm of pulverized borax and half a drachm of sugar, will also remove freckles. Keep the lotion in a glass bottle corked tightly a few days before using and apply to the freckles occasionally, and it will soon remove them.'
