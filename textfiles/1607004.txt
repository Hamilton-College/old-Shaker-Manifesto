TESTIMONY OF RICHARD TREAT. Being one of those who first received and obeyed the testimony of the gospel in America, and who, through the mercy and goodness of God, have been enabled to keep it and bear testimony in its favor to this day ; and feeling sensible of the many blessings I have enjoyed, and still do enjoy in it, J consider it my duty to give a short statement of what I have found, experienced and felt in my own soul, through the power and influence of this blessed gospel. If my testimony can be of any benefit to the candid part of mankind, or direct any who are laboring under the burden of a wounded conscience, where to find the true physician, who is able to probe the wound, and apply the healing balm, I shall feel satisfied that I have not written in vain. I was born in Sharon, Conn., March 14, 1757. When I was a child, I was much affected with my mother's dis: courses concerning a life of godliness, and especially about Jesus Christ, and of his being crucified by the wicked. These discourses excited in my mind many serious thoughts about religion. As 1 grew older, I often felt deeply exercised in mind, and had many serious reflections concerning the life that Christ's followers were taught by his precepts) and example to live. When I was eleven years old, my father moved into New Lebanon, N. Y. From this time revivals of religion were often breaking out among the people, and many were awakened to seek after religion and join the churches of the different denominations. But these revivals would soon die away again, and the people become as lifeless as beEbre ; so that I could see no difference between the professors and the profane, which often filled my mind with serious trouble. I felt a great desire to find something that would save me from sin, and cried to God in the best manner 1 could ; but I could not obtain my desire. I have often 'prayed, even when going into company, that I might be kept from sin ; but my youthful mind was so easily led astray, that my prayers availed but little. I was married in the spring of 1779 ; but this by no means released me from a wounded conscience, which I felt almost continually, from the age of eleven to twentythree, when T was taught the way out of sin. In June 177!), a remarkable revival broke out in New Lebanon. Many of the people were filled with great power of God and saw wonderful visions ; and many prophesied that the millennium was nigh, even at the door. The work was very powerful through the summer.�1 had great faith in it, and received a measure of light, and fully believed that Christ was about to make his second appearance ; but I feared we should not know him. . Elder Joseph Meach'-xm, our principle leader in the revival, said that he feared he should not know Christ when he came ; for he would come like a thief in the night. Many believed this to be a preparatory work, and were confident that a greater work wras about to take place. In the fall, the spirit, life and power of the revival was withdrawn, and 'marrying and giving in marriage' increased abundantly. But many retained their confidence and waiting in hope; but they could not help anyone, as they could not help themselves. After the spirit of the revival was withdrawn, the exercises of my mind were distressing beyond expression. I believed I had committed the unpardonable sin ; for I thought I had sinned against so great a light that I could not be reclaimed. In the spring of 1780, we received intelligence of a strange people who lived in the wilderness, about seven miles northwest of Albany, and who, it was said possessed the spirit of discernment, and the gift of working miracles, and other apostolic gifts. Many people visited them from the country round. Some believed they were of God, and were under the influence of divine power ; while others imputed their extraordinary gifts to the spirit of witchcraft. When I heard of these things, I fully believed it to be the very work which had been prophesied of in the time of the revival, and was determined to visit them. Accordingly I set out on foot, in company with Justus Webster, an acquaintance of mine. The weather was very rainy and the roads muddy, and being unacquainted with the way, our journey was very tedious ; but I was determined to go on at all hazards ; for I believed my case would there be decided. It was late in the evening before we arrived, aud as we drew near to the house we heard them singing, which struck my mind with a feeling I cannot describe. We were kindly received, aud seated by a fire to dry our clothes : for we were very wet and muddy. Mother Ann said 'James, bring some watei and wash these men's feet. ' These were the first words I heard from her. The man soon came with a large, clean pewter basin of water. I began to obect against being thus waited upon ; 3ut lie replied, 'make no words.' He ben washed our feet and dried our stockings. After this I seated myself m another part of the room, observing every motion, and expecting soon to lear my final doom. They seemed to lotice my companion more than they did me, which seemed to me an evidence of my reprobation ; though I had not made known my feelings to any one. At length John Partington came to me, and with his finger made the sign of a cross upon my breast, laying, 'Thou art neither cold nor hot: J would thou wert cold or hot. So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will .-.pew thee out of my mouth. ' There, thought I, that is just what I expected ; and immediately I fainted and fell on the floor.�When I came to myself, I heard Mother say. Come James, le: us go in ; for that man prays. ' She,came into the room, and looking upon me, said to Elder William, 'Take this man and hear him open his mind.'; I went with him and opened the state of my mind, and told him I believed I hud sinned against the Holy Ghost. 'Nay child, said he, you cannot do that until you have received the Holy Ghost. ' These words were to me the most comforting sound that had ever reached my ears. He told me I might confess my sins. This I was thankful to do, and did it faithfully ; and truly I felt the greatest satisfaction in exposing the worst sins I had committed. I remained there a number of days, and received many precious gifts of God. 1 was instructed how to forsake sin, .and my soul was filled with the power of God. At length Mother told me I must return home and right all my wrongs ; and where I had injured or defrauded any one, in any way, I must make restitution, and take up my cross against all sin, and especially against the works of the flesh. She said if I would do this faithfully, the power of God would never leave me, but would give me power and victory over every sin. I returned home and did as I was taught. When I came to confess to the wicked wherein I had wronged them, and offered to make restitution, they were offended to hear me mention and offer restitution for such small trifles, as they considered them. But I was faithful in my duty, and I found the promise of Mother completely fulfilled to me. Although I considered myself but a babe in Christ, I felt, according to my little measure, the baptism of his spirit. Whenever evil presented itself to me in temptation or thought, I instantly felt the power of God run through my soul, and the evil was in a moment banished from me, so that I felt entirely released from it.
