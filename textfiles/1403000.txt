AURICULAR CONFESSION OLIVER C. HAMPTON. He that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall find mercy, but he that covereth them shall not prosper. '�Solomon. �'' If we are faithful to confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' 1 John, �., 9. Hardly anything seems to create greater uneasiness and dismay in man, than the idea of confessing his sins in the hearing of his fellow man. But perhaps no one ever honestly tried the experiment, without finding a wonderful releasement from the burden of his sins, and a feeling of at-one-ment with God, to which before, he was an entire stranger. When this burden of sin is rolled oft' and his mind is tranquil, he is in an excellent condition to begin life anew and to commence the work Of repentance, by leaving off, and traveling away from sin, and wrong of every kind. At this important crisis in his life, he can form many serious and good resolutions to correct all sinful habits, into which he has ignorantly or willfully fallen, and lay out more virtuous paths for his feet to walk, in which to find greater peace and consolation, and live in reconciliation with both God and man. Let me assure any one who has never tried it, that whether he fully understands the fact or not, he will find himself forgiven and fully absolved from all guilt and selfcondemnation, after sincerely confessing all his sins to some one appointed to hear him, and a calm sheltering feeling of security and acceptance with God, which will be more abiding and yield him more inward comfort than any previous, religious exercise of his life. Many have tried it and all have testi- Red to this, who have been truly honest and sincere. The deep stains of memory are erased from the tablet of conscience and the spirit left in a free, released condition, to enjoy the beatitudes of a. holy life and the blessedness of well doing. This confession of all known sin, has always been considered the stepping stone into the Temple of Holiness and eternal progress, to higher and high,er blessedness and perfection here and hereafter. Believers have always judged of the prosperity of souls setting out in the gospel by this criterion of confession. If done in uprightness and sincerity the 'safe travel and peaceful journey of the , penitent, is pretty safely calculated upon ; if otherwise, there is almost if not quite a certainty of failure. The only hope remaining, consists in the contingency that the. superficial novitiate may come .'up to a. time, in the progress of 3iis or .'Iior experience, when after-convictions may lead to the necessary confession� and the soul may at last find a true joining to the Church, and an abiding home 'in the fold of Christ. All ecclesiastic nistory, upto the days of the Protestant � Reformation, abounds in facts going to show, that auricular confession was among the sacred obligations of all, or at least a. large majority of past popular systems of Religion ;�as witness the � Brahmins, Budhists, Hierophants of �Egypt�-the Essenes-, Jews and Catholics. �Even: the Ptiseyites, though a Protestant sect,' have adopted the practice and ac; knowledged to having found great peace 'and comfort as well as spiritual edification and benefit' therefrom. .Therefore, dear friends, Brethren anc Sisters in and out of Zion, let us all be ;encouraged from the testimony and ex)erience of these bright clouds of witnesses, and still more from the direct inspirations and revelations from Heaven :hrough the medium of our Holy Savior and our blessed Mother Ann, to solemny and sincerely confess all our sins in the sacred Order of God, thereby securing the spiritual boon and blessing of our Heavenly Father and Mother ;� planting our souls on the Rock of Eternal Ages against which iC the gates of Hell can never prevail. ' It is so sweet to lie down at night, and know ourselves to be in a state of perfect peace with God and all men, that if we are called away before the morning dawn, we are pei'fectly ready to depart and be at rest with the angels and kt spirits of just men and women made perfect through sufferings ; ' the very same ordeal we ourselves have passed through that all our sins have gone before hand into the judgment, and have been sent into the land uninhabited, no more to be remembered against us forever. Let us try this, first of all experiments, in the upward journey into higher and holier conditions, viz ; confessing and forsaking all known sin, and see if we cannot exclaim with the rapt seraph whom John the Divine saw and heard on Patmos, ' Now has come salvation and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ, for the accuser of the Brethren, He who ceased not to accuse them day and night is cast down.' What is it that ' accuseth day and night. ' unless it is a conscience wearied and loaded with sin and from which there is no rest or peace. In this good gift of confessing and forsaking sin, is a certain and sure asylum from all these painful scenes of self condemnation and despair, and let all who will, come and be released and forever blest.
