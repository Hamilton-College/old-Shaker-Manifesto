For the Children THE TWO LIVES. CORA M. NEWHALL I once knew of a little girl, who always wished she could become as good as some of the friends with whom she lived. One day, when alone she said to herself: 'Now there are two ways of life, and I must choose one of these two. One is the Christian's life; and the other is the worldly life. One tells me to obey the teachings of my father and mother, take up my little cross against thinking of naughty things, and letting unkind words fall from my lips. It teaches me to be kind to my mates and to heed the Golden Rule—'Do unto others, as I would that others should do unto me.' It teaches me to cultivate good manners; to say 'Good Morning,' or to make some friendly greeting when meeting my companions. It teaches me to trust in those who are older, and wiser than I am; believing that what they say or do, is for my present and future good. It also teaches me to correct my faults before retiring to rest at night; to resist temptation, shun bad company, and to be honest, clean, and pure. Now the worldly life does not teach me these good things. It allows me to disobey my parents, to be dishonest, to go where my inclinations lead, and not to heed the voice of conscience when it says 'You are doing wrong!' I do not like this way of living so well because I will be unhappy. I think I'll take the Christian's life, and become like those whom I love to look upon, for I know I shall be happier in this life, at least. My young readers, how many of you have 71 THE SHAKBE such thoughts in your hearts ? I have been acquainted with this little girl, for twenty years; and not once has she regretted the choice she made to live that life which would make her a noble woman; though she has failed many times to do what was right—just as all little people are apt to do sometimes. Remember therefore, that to choose a good thing, is a safe way, and is never to be regretted. Canterbury, N. H.
