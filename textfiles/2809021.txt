OUR EXCHANGES. The Humane Journal The Humane Journal is publisht in Chicago, by the Illinois Humane Society. It is a beautiful little teacher of the law of kindness. The Firebrand The Firebrand is publisht monthly by the 'World's Faith Missionary Association' and edited by C. S. Hanley. It has come out in a beautiful new dress, and the whole make up of the paper is pleasing to the eye. The Firebrand is true to its name in the 'lighting of Watch Fires ' in every land.' The Evangel The Evangel is devoted to the restoration of primitive Christianity. It is publisht in Buffalo, N. Y. We shall wish the little magazine the best of success and shall be deeply interested to learn how primitive Christianity is defined.
