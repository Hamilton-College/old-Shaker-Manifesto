OUR MISSION 1. We all have a duty of life to perform, A mission of love to fulfill; A work that is worthy our pow'rs to engage, With firmness of purpose and will. We all have a journey of life to pursue, The highway of progress to climb; A strife to endure, and a vie t'ry to win, 'Mid perils and dangers of time. And should we not linger to proffer our aid, To those who with trials oppress'd, Are leaving the earthly for treasures divine, Who're seeking but finding no rest? And shall we not give all our feelings in prayer, For souls who are yearning for light, And place in the pathway of safety and truth The upward bound traveler aright ? O, yea! we can brighten with smiles of good cheer, The way of the downcast and sad, And give to the sin-sick a promise of hope, The sorrowing spirit make glad. We can comfort the mourner with tidings of joy, And lighten life's burden and care; Uplifting the spirits of those who are bound, The blessings of freedom to share. 4. We can hush the wild tumult of discord and strife With love's gentle accents of peace, And welcome the weary worn pilgrim to rest, Where storms of contention shall cease. O, this is our mission, and this is our call, To resurrect souls from the earth, And aid them, through high aspiration, to rise, To joys of the angelic birth.
