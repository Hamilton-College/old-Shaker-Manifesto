TRUE RICHES. Canterbury, N. H. 1. Be fixed, my heart, on higher aims Than seekng 2. Enlist my thought on nobier themes Than fame or 3. Let purer mofives guide my feet In Wis dom's. 4. What profit e'en to gain a world Of Eden worldly pleasure; Thy long ing spirit hath its claims wealth inspires; For these shall pass like idie dreams ways so pleasant; Since fut ure bliss is made complete joys or glory, If by our gain we lose the soul, Cho. On an eternal treasure. Before truth's altar fires. By guarding well the present. In depths of sin and folly? Ah, 'What shall it profit a man, Cho. If he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?' Mark viii, 36.
