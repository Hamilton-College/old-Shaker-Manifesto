We are all prone to keep the level... We are all prone to keep the level of those we live with, to repeat their words, and dress our minds, and often our bodies, after their fashion, and hence the spiritless lameness of our character. Our greatest danger is not from the gross, the vulgar, or the licentious, but from the common class of humanity who claim to live a moral life. The mind grows by what it feeds upon, therefore a mental scavenger is, like the scavengers of the earth, low in aspiration, and led and governed by the lower passions.
