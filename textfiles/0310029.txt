HEAVENLY TREASURES O lay up your treasures in heaven above! For purity reigns in those mansions of love, Where peace like a river the righteous enjoy, While heaven-born pleasures their time doth em- ploy. The treasures of heaven are fadeless and pure ; No earthly enjoyment can like them endure : O then let your hearts for these treasures aspire, Let nothing inferior claim your desire. The bubbles of time, with their shining display, Leave sad disappointment as time wears away; Then seek for the fruits that from righteousness grow; Press onward, the life of the Spirit to know : For those who are seeking those treasures to find, Who labor sincerely with heart, soul, and mind, Shall swiftly the path of redemption pursue ; And Wisdom will guide them in all that they do. Their treasured enjoyments are those that will last, An enduring substance when all else is past. But earth's richest gift can abide but a day: They vanish like dew in the summer sun's ray.
