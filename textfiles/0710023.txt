SOCIETY ITEMS We get excellent reports of health from nearly all the societies. Mother Ann used to speak of health as ' the second greatest blessing' naming the spiritual work of the gospel first. In our report of the curious contagion of injured hips, failure to correct proof, left an unfortunate brother at Enfield, N. H., unmentioned. We hear gladly of improvement. Several parties from Canterbury, N. H., are giving expression to their zeal, by visiting neighboring towns, preaching the word, and getting additions to the subscription list of The Shaker. [Obituary] Mother Betsey Wilcox Mother Betsey Wilcox , aged 81, left for the evergreen shores of the better land, from Enfield, Conn., August 6, 1877. She had celebrated her golden zvedding to the Shakers, before death came.
