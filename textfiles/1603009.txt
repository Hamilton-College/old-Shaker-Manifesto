TESTIMONY OF PHEBE CHASE. In early life my mind was exercised with serious impressions about the welfare of my soul. Inconsequence of this, the leaders and Elders of the church considered me as a suitable candidate, and well prepared to become a church member. Accordingly I was taken into the Congregational church at Providence, R. I. where I then lived, being in the nineteenth year of my age. I continued a member of that church for several years, and with respect to what was there required of me, I walked 'blameless and without rebuke,' or even a gentle admonition, until I embraced the gospel of my present faith ; then indeed, altheugh they could bring no moral accusation against me, I was quickly excommunicated from the church. But while I was in this good standing with them, instead of growing and increasing in the knowledge of the Lord, I daily increased in pride and arrogancy ; the natural propensities of my mind were more inclined to evil than ever ; snd still I was called a good Christian, and a wholesome church member. Alas ! how aptly may the words ï¿½f the prophet be applied to such ! ' This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me.' Matt, xv., 8. I finally began to feel uneasy and troubled in my mind. I saw that all was not well with me ; my poor soul lay at stake. I coxild often feel a sense that God was calling upon me to come out from among them. But how should I come out ? I knew no way out; and of all the sons and daughters of the church to which I belonged, there was not one that was able to lead me out. It was then I cried to God, and prayed for deliverance ; and earnestly entreated that I might find a people that served him in righteousness and truth ; for I fully believed there was such a people somewhere ; but 1 knew not where to find them. It was not long before I received the answer to my prayers. In the summer of 1780, the joyful news of peace and salvation came to my ears ; and the way was open and free for all, or as many as were willing to confess and forsake their sins. By hearing the report, I received a measure of faith, and believed it to be the work of God ; but I knew it not. The following year, in March, I visited the people called Shakers, at New Lebanon, N. Y. being then in the twenty-fourth year of my age. Having become fully convinced that they were the people of God, I came forward and confessed my sins, with a full determination to forsake them forever. I sincerely confessed them to God before his witnesses, and felt my mind greatly released from the weight and burden I had long been under. And through the mercy and goodness of God, I was able to feel a sense of the light and manifestation of Christ in his second appearing, through Mother Ann Lee ; and by the revelation of God in my own soul, I can bear witness to the truth of her testimony. I know by my own experience, that she was able to show to lost souls the root and foundation of sin, and the cause of their loss from God ; and to show the way whereby they might travel out of their loss. As I Avas favored with many privileges with Mother and the Elders that stood with her, I feel it my duty and privilege to testify the things that I have seen and heard. 1 have been with her in times of persecution, and have witnessed her sufferings ; and had she been a wicked woman, I certainly should have discovered it, and should not have followed her, for I had made my escape and fled from such like people, to find a better sort. I wTas not disappointed, nor mistaken in the change. I had sufficient opportunity to know that the charges alleged against Mother Ann were false. I can also bear witness that she not only maintained a sharp and powerful testimony against wickedness of every kind ; but she supported her testimony by her godly example in all things. She was every way faithful to teach and admonish the people to good works, and to keep the fear of God in all their goings forth, in all things, both spiritual and temporal. Mother Ann was a pattern of righteousness and virtue which I feel confident was never excelled among women ; and her pure and heavenly example, which is well worthy of the attention and serious consideration of all, like a true pillar of light, is still increasing and abounding in all her faithful children. According to the measure of my faith and obedience to Mother Ann's testimony, I have been protected from the snares of Satan, and the evil propensities of a lost nature : so that I am enabled to keep a conscience void of offence toward God and all men. Although I have passed through many scenes of tribulation ; yet I have always found comfort and peace in the gospel. I have been blest with faithful and kind Elders, Brethren and Sisters, who are dear to me as my own life, and with whom I can worship God in spirit. In addition to these things, I have been blessed with many heavenly visions, and have enjoyed many precious manifestations of the power and goodness of God. These heavenly gifts and divine manifestations, I very well know, are too far above the power of nature to gain the credit of an un'believing world ; but to me thej feel like the bread of life ; they have fed and refreshed my soul from time to time, and more than forty-five years, by which means I have been nourished and supported, strengthened and comforted. Why then should I not know from whence good cometh? and why should I not bear testimony-of these things? Yea, why should I not thank God always, that he has called me by the everlasting gospel, to be a partaker of so great a salvation ? I rejoice that there is still an administration of the same spirit of truth, and a continual succession of the same Christian example maintained in the Church. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
