AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JOHN RANKIN. No. 2. In the progress of the above exercises of mind, when duty called me, and I providentially fell into company with any of the religious part of the community, stimulated as we were, by the then present excitement, our conversation would naturally turn on some religious topic, but frequently on the new and interesting operations of the day. Having complied with every duty as far as lay in my power, according to my apprehension, I obtained stronghopes that I should attain to the end of my faith. On some occasions, when in conversation with some of * the most zealous preachers of the day, my feelings would excite me to speak with pathos on the necessity of living religion, on the depravity and degeneracy of human nature. They discovering my views and anxiety on these subjects proposed that I should revise my former reading, and suggested to me other scientific books, preparatory to being received a probationer for the Ministry in the Presbyterian order. When I came to address the public, to my regret, I discovered that my former zeal had subsided, my fervor was reduced to lukewarmness, my lively views of the loss of man had become faint, and I felt shorn of my locks, and my strength was wasted on language, science, and speculation on the letter. I knew not what to do, in order to regain life and vigor. The revival had ceased and little more than formality pervaded the congregations. About this time, 1796, I received an invitation by letter from a friend in Tennessee, to visit him. On my arrival, to my astonishment I found the inhabitants of the Presbyterian denomination comparatively a barren waste in a religious point of view. In the month of Jan. 1796, I visited South Union, then called 'Gasper's River,' and on the Sabbath preached to the people, also preached in the vicinity of Russellsville, Nashville, Gallatin, and other places. In 1798, I returned to Gaspers River and attended a four days' meeting. At this time I was under obligation to no people, as my labors were a voluntary gift. I had no pecuniary contract for a single cent, but supported myself and family from my own resources. In December of this year I moved to Gaspers River, and became a teacher among the people. I labored in this place OCTOBER, 226 thp: manifesto. one half of my time and traveled abroad some one hundred miles, where it had been arranged for me to preach. In August, 1799, the Kentucky Revival began in earnest. Due attendance, serious attention to preaching, and solemn inquiry what they should do to be saved, appeared to agitate the minds of the congregations throughout. In the month of June, 1800, the principal members of the three awakened congregations met together at the Red River meeting house, with large accessions of citizens, and two preachers from the state of Ttnn. The multitude sat and heard with reverence. At the close of the meeting, a part of the body went out of the house, while many remained in their seats in contemplative silence. Suddenly a cry burst from the assembly, and some were thrown into strange contortions. Some had singular gestures with words quite inconsistent with presbyterian order. All was confusion. One of the preachers asked, What shall we do? The confusion should be quelled. I replied, We can do nothing at present, we are strangers to such an operation. The cry and burden of prayer to God is for mercy and the salvation of their souls. The next large meeting was held about one mile below South Union in the month of July. The curious came to gratify their curiosity. The seriously convicted presented themselves that they might receive some special benefit to their souls, and promote the cause of God at home and abroad. Many came even from the state of Tennessee. � When I came in sight of this vast assemblage, I was astonished. I said within my heart, 'God is in this place.' I felt a spirit of thankfulness and prayed God would favor us with a bountiful effusion of his spirit. Through the day and night the exorcises continued without much intermission. Professors prayed to be saved from the least and last remains of sin, and also from lukewarm professors and sinners of every description. On Monday, the last and great day of the feast, the proclamation of the spirit came;�'If any man thirst after righteousness and salvation, let him come and partake of the waters of life freely.' Toward evening of said day, inquirers began to fall prostrate on all sides, and their cries became piercing. Heavy groans were heard and shaking throughout the house. At the approach of night, the floor of the meeting house was literally covered with the prostrate bodies of penitents, so that it became necessary to carry a number out and lay them on the grass or garments, if they had them. The night was beautiful; heaven and the elements seemed to smile on the occasion. The news of the meeting spread all around in the adjacent congregations. The subjects of the work would pray with fervency for their friends and neighbors and exhort them to be converted to God. Small children often spoke with boldness and truth in language to which they were unaccustomed, to the astonishment of the surrounding multitude. Dancing and whirling entered into the exercises and THE MANIFESTO. 227 some of the strangest operations of the day, were the falling into trances for hours and sometimes for days, and then rising in raptures of praise to God for redeeming grace. These would prophesy that they saw the kingdom of God near at hand. The great work increased in searching power from its inauguration, till the year 1805, when the messengers 'v\ere sent from the east with the gospel tidings. These ministers introduced with their testimony the oral confession of sin and I have seen respectable people fall upon the floor, under the operations of the spirit, and confess themselves guilty of sin. These facts prove the truth, the light. (the end.)
