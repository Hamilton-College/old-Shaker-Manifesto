Dear Antoinetteâ€” I inclose one dollar for the ' Shaker and Shakeress ' another year. It is more beauti- ful to me than all the newspapers that flood the land, for its pages are not blotted with a catalogue of sin and crime, but are as refreshing as the springs of Mount Lebanon. I hail its visits as the face of a loved friend in a strange land. It tells me of a Summer Land, where souls grow beautiful, true, and good. My spirits are often heavy laden, and I long for that rest of soul that dwells with the chosen people of God. Yours in love, Sylvina J. Hannibal, Mo.
