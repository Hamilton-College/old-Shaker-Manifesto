A PLEA FOR THE TURKEYS By Cora C. Vineo I saw them first when with their mother, they Took scratching lessons, peeped a turkey song, And wandered in the grass that turned to hay When summer sun grew hot and days were long. Again I saw them in their youthful prime After the molting days had swiftly passed, And thought how dextrously old Father Time Had worked, to make their feathers grow so fast. But months passed on, the festal time drew near, The turkeys grew in strength and size and weight; THE MANIFESTO. \ But, oh, alas! I felt a sudden fear, And pity smote me as I mourned their fate. I saw the gory execution block, And sharpened ax that told of days gone by When man against his kind with cruel shock Condemned them by the guillotine to die. But justice seemed to call for deeds of shame In those fell days when anarchy ran wild, And truth and liberty bore all the blame, When slaughter made the worst foes reconciled. But in the death of these poor innocents Not even justice could approve the waste, And mercy shocked, forsook the murderous tents Where men raised blood-stained hands and killed for taste. And when I saw the dread dissecting knife Wielded by hands that nurse the infant race, And not content with simply taking life, They mutilate the corpse,â€”oh, foul disgrace! Aud then before the market-place in rows I saw the naked victims cold and pale, And seemed to hear them say in dying throes, 'Come cannibals, our bodies are for sale.' My heart sank in me, for in dream I saw Children and lords and ladies (?) sit and jest, Yea, even judges of the moral law, And sport about the part they fancied best. Oh pitiless \ we send the Holy Book And missionaries where the heathen roam, But in our folly blindly overlook The unconverted heathen here at home. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
