NOTHING TO DO ' Nothing to do! ' in this world of ours, Where weeds grow up with the fairest flowers. Where smiles have only a fitful play, Where hearts are breaking every day. ' Nothing to do ! ' thou Christian soul, Wrapping thee round in thy selfish stole, Off with the garments of sloth and sin, Christ, thy Lord, hath a kingdom to win. ' Nothing to do ! ' There are prayers to lay On the altar of incense, day by day ; There are foes to meet within and without, There is error to conquer, strong and stout. '' Nothing to do ! *' There are minds to teach The simplest form of Christian speech ; There are hearts to lure with loving wile, From the grimmest haunts of sin's defile. ' Nothing to do !' There are lambs to feed, The precious hopes of the church's need ; Strength to be borne to the weak and faint, Vigils to keep with the doubting saint. ' Nothing to do ! ' and thy Saviour said, 'Follow thou me in the path I tread.' Lord lend thy help the journey through, Lest, faint, we cry, ' So much to do ! '
