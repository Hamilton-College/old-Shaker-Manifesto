OF THE SHAKER GRANGE Wm, H. H. Denhurst Amesbury, Mass., Dec. 17, 1880. Friend Polly Reed, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. : It is only a few days since the Shaker Manifesto came into my possession. It is the first Shaker publication apart from a little pamphlet of belief I have ever seen or read. The glorious principle of unselfishness and holiness is the pervading Spirit. By its perusal my interest is at once enlisted. What has hitherto been the unsightly phantom of blind prejudice is awakened by a better comprehension into warm regard and sympathy, and a desire to become identified with such commendable activities. An item in the Manifesto states that any one can become a Granger after the Shaker style by remitting ten cents to Polly Reed. I avail myself of the privilege, trusting that the membership from such small beginnings THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 39 will prove fraternal and worthy of additional membership by one and the same person. With my best wishes for your health and happiness ; and the prosperity of the muchmisunderstood ' Institution ' that you are identified with, I am yours inquiringly, .
