BE HONORABLE. [Contributed by M. Witham.] Boys and young men sometimes start out into life with the idea that one's success depends on sharpness and chicanery. They imagine if a man is able to 'get the best of a bargain,' no matter by what deceit and meanness he carries his point that his prosperity is assured. This is a great mistake. Enduring prosperity cannot be founded on cunning and dishonesty. The tricky and deceitful man is sure to fall a victim, sooner or later, to the influences which are forever working against him. The future of that young man is safe who eschews every shape of double dealing and lays the foundation of his career in the enduring principles of everlasting truth.ï¿½ Young Folks Rural.
