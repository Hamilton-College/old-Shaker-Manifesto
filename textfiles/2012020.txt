In the January number of the Manifesto, we shall commence, by request, the republishing of the Book that has been known as the 'Kentucky Revival.' This singular manifestation has always been considered, by the Believers, as a wonderful out-pouring of the spirit of God, and although it was a work that took place in the early part of the present century, there may be many among our readers who will be interested in the history, and spiritually refreshed in the presentation of this unexplainable work that visited the rich and poor, and no less the professor and profane at that early day.
