LACONISM THEO. GORHAM The Spartans, or Lacedemonians, whose country was called Laconia, systematically endeavored to confine themselves to sententious brevity in speaking and writing. Hence the word Laconic. Have we any thing to learn from those people ? Some may object to studying, as example, a people with whom stealing ranked as a virtue. A concise brevity pervades the writings of nearly all the ancient philosophers. And who would not be a philosopher — a lover of wisdom ? Could the sayings of the Nazarene be condensed, yet contain the ideas ? When Alexander, standing before Diogenes, said to him, ' What can I do for you ? ' Diogenes replied, ' Stand out of my sunshine.' Laconic, but scarcely civil. But what could Alexander expect from a cynic who lived in a tub? 'Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay.' Let your answer be short but soft — not sharp. Some one has said, ' an article may be long, yet concise.' An invisible prompter says, ' very true.' Laconicism is worthy of consideration only as it implies not writing a volume when a page would answer the purpose. 'Veni, vidi, vici ' — I came, I saw, I conquered — the memorable words of Caesar — contain more than many of our modern generals, in their Indian wars, could say in as many pages of foolscap. When humans turn the battle to the gate — the physical sword into the sword of truth, and fight the evil in their own souls, they will be able to overcome the evil in others, without injuring them in body or soul.
