The Nationalist The Nationalist Educational Association, 77 Boylston St., Boston, Mass. $1.00 per. year. Among the many valuable exchanges that visit our office, we find that the R. P. Journal occupies a very appreciative pla,ce in the mind. Spiritualism seems to be so thoroughly interwoven into the life of man that we should find it extremely difficult to separate the one from the other. It becomes a subject of such universal interest that every class is absorbed in its beautiful revelations, its mysteries, and may be in its puerile manifestations. To be able to encourage that which develops goodness of heart and manliness of character, and with equal firmness to expose the work of charlatans and knaves, requires a high sense of duty, both to God and man. We appreciate, most emphatically, the straight forward and open manner in which the Editor deals with all the exhibitions, and exhibitors of spiritualism while affording them every privilege to establish their own claim. � �
