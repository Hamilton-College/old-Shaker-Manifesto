SONGS OF CHEER 'Finally have compassion one of another, love as brethren.'1''â€”1 Peter, iii., 8. Mt. Lebanon. N. Y. 1. We would spread the joy of blessing far and near, 2. Oh, ever is the loving word the best, We would speak the loving word the heart to cheer, It calms the heart by sin and want oppressed, Like merry birds of spring, Glad music we will sing, With the murmur of a prayer, We will still the waves of care, In our happy, happy songs of cheer. And bid the troubled spirit rest. 16 THE MANIFESTO. SONGS OF CHEER. Chorus. Solo. Sing the songs, happy songs of cheer, Sing' the songs happy songs of cheer, Oh, that no heart was sad, We would make the whole world glad, With our happy, happy song of cheer. 3 Oft have we felt our inner, longing needs, Blest by a power that strengthens, clothes and feeds, Like fragrant breathing flowers, We will fill the weary hours, With the incense of our loving deeds. 4 Though darkened shadows fall across the way, The night will soon give place to smiling day; With the sunshine of our cheer, We will chase the shadows drear, And echo, echo joy alway.
