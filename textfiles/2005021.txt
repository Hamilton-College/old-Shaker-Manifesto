Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½We greet you with 'How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.' We open with this most appropriate of texts, in noting items about home, present month, in reference to the call upon our Society of Beloved Elder Giles B. Avery and Eldress Harriet Bullard, so widely known as members of the Order of the Central Ministry of Mt. Lebanon. They came to us the 4th. inst. via. Harvard and left for Enfield, N. H., the 10th. It hardly seems good taste to eulogize these special God-sent messengers, and surely no better taste to be silent over this season of blessing. Other persons and events are eulogized and pass into history. Not so this occasion, the pure presence and soulcheering ministrations of spiritual love and confidence in God through these loved ones will live forever in the hearts of those who have 'ears to hear' and hearts to retain the seed sown. We saw and felt that their staff was the rod and their crown the cross, yet we were blest and reconciled to take our portion of both the rod and the cross. As a result of their co-operation, Elder H. C. Blinn resigns the office of minister over the Societies of Canterbury and Enfield and assumes the Eldership of our Church Family, William Briggs associate. Br. J. S. Kaime succeeds Elder Henry in the Ministry. The Brethren who have carried burdens as Elders in the Church, Benjamin H. Smith and Alexander Y. Cochran are appointed as Trustees of the Church retaining Elder J. S. Kaime as special counselor. How satisfactory, when, at the call of the 'Good Shepherds,' hearts and hands are for better, purer and more acceptable service. In this spirit we find our faithful Brethren assuming new duties, in which they are sustained and blessed* by those who have witnessed and appreciated past consecrated. May our messenger, beloved Ministry, convey to you the thanks of a grateful people. Our table is still spread with the choice fruits of the spirit from Brethren and Sisters of Enfield, N. H., as represented by beloved Elder Abraham Perkins and Br. John Bradford. Surely the Lord hath remembered us and his comfort is round about us. More than welcome are such angel visitants and we trust other Gospel friends tnay come and 'do likewise.' We thought to speak of a devotional religious service held during your absence of more than usual interest, but lest we call forth the whispered reminder 'Be brief' will simply add that the maple harvest closed with the satisfactory result of over five hundred gallons prepared syrup. Spring advances timidly. We would suggest that she be allowed a free, liberal reign, for we covet the re-appearance of early vegetables as potatoes were taken from our garden the first week in June, 1889. God bless our gardeners and farmers, and hasten our crops. We prefer them ere they are made into flesh, as we do the water into wine.
