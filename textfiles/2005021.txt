NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. April 6, 1890. Had the 'Notes about Home' been introduced to the Manifesto a few months earlier, we too might have reported at that time, present home repair; of debris removed, roads straightened, and other improvements about our Dwelling, made by young and interested hands. But the end is not yet, and when proposed equal improvements are made about our Office and its environs, we shall be happy to report. We look at the notes carefully wishing to add a new item, but in vain. Our experiences are common to all with the exception of no La Grippe. The physicians of Europe say it was hard to tell where La Grippe ended, and where panic began. If the disease visited us it was contemporaneous with its appearance in Europe, and before we knew enough to dread it. Our neat wire street fence, with its black and white gates, has been standing eighteen years. The maple shade trees by the roadside were set, from fifteen to thirty years ago ; but the telephone poles on both sides of the street, (more useful than ornamental) are of recent date. We are patiently waiting for the 'Village Improvement Board' to organize and run a good foot path through our beautiful village. We are fortunate in being connected with the family on each side by such, but further than this we cannot report; and the children coming to school must �'traipse through mud,' and then lose several days during a term, for the want of a decent path. The anxiety for an ice harvest has been a matter of interest the winter past, but nothing has been said of the harvest of pleasure anxiously waited for by the 'wee small folk,' who thought snow and ice came because they 'prayed for sliding;' and like the ice gatherers they laid aside all duties possible, to attend to it as long as a slide was to be had; and were rewarded with robust health and rosy cheeks. In the middle of January one of the Brethren gathered some trailing arbutus, and after keeping it in water for a few days, the buds opened as fresh as in May and brought happy thoughts of an eternal bloom, to the bedside of a dying Sister. Branches from a deciduous flowering shrub were also broken off in mid-winter, which have not only grown leaves in water, but produced a perfect bloom. When reading of 'the bees in the chimney,' we are reminded how necessary it is, that to carry out the full purpose of our religious Community life we must 'Make home a hive where all beautiful feelings Shall cluster like bees and their honey-dew bring, Make it a temple of holy revealings And love its bright angel with shadowy wing.' We are glad to see an increasing interest in the Bible questions. The number of answers has increased from sixty to ninety. One important selected promise in the last number we find omitted. It is indeed pleasant when the labor of life has been arduous yet satisfactory, to think of rest; but if we are living, active workers spiritually, we do not seek this. All we ask is a privilege to work, while so much labor is needed; and imbued with this thought, six of us choose as the most comforting of our Savior's promises 'Ask and ye shall receive; seek and ye shall find ; knock and it shall be opened unto you. * Center Famliy. We Closed our school on the 22nd inst. The teacher, Elder Calvin Reed has been unwell recently from indigestion and heart difficulty. We hope for his speedy recovery. Have finished our wood business it being all split, housed and piled in good shape. We are now awaiting the spring season in which plowing and sowing the garden and field seeds will be in order, so that we may have something by and by to nourish these bodies of ours and make them strong to enable us to do good to the household of faith. March No., of Manifesto contains some excellent articles, among which I wish to name, Sister Anna B. Goepper's and Mary L. Wilson's, bearing on subjects of vital interest to the young and rising generation, and all concerned in the well-being of Society. Our young people are much interested in Sabbath day bible lessons and Monday evening Lyceum. We think and hope both may be productive of good and prove a blessing to all concerned. T. Kayson. April, 11. We have for several weeks been preparing for spring. Have filled our woodhouse and are anxious for the weather to enable us to put in crops. The roads and foot-paths through our Village have been, and are in a very bad condition. We certainly should do something to make them better. We have recently taken two boys from near Fortress Monroe Va., this adds a treasure of life to the external and enables us to keep in a training condition. One thing I am quite satisfied about; that fine houses with all modern conveniences do not make people any more contented, or more willing to bear the cross. I sometimes think they may incline us to be more at ease in Zion. : In passing through New York city recently, it was distressing to witness the great gulf between the high and the low, the rich and the poor. There must be something radically wrong in the laws and system of government that permits of such extremes between man and his fellows all claiming to be the children of the one Heavenly Father. Until this system is changed I have very little hope of a religious revival that will fill our homes with earnest, unselfish, truthloving souls. In kindest love, Daniel Offord. Hancock, Mass. The mild winter sent the ice hunters into this section. Some of them located their works about a mile from us on the shores of the Richmond Lake and the good Sisters provided them with food. At one time we had. thirty men and ten horses as boarders. We fed and lodged them as best we could. Your Sisters in Canterbury would hardly been able to have kept those tubs of bntter if they had a four weeks call from such a company. The company makes a liberal conpensation for all favors, and the ice busiuess it is thought, will bring an increase into this section of $500 000 and the laboring class get a good share of it. The company at Richmond Lake cut some one hundred thousand tons. For six weeks there has been two and three North Family. hundred teams drawing ice from the Onota and Pontookuc Lakes which are six miles from our Village. I. Lawson. Enfield, Conn. 'We feel the balmy breeze of May, Soft blowing down the grassy way.' We should fill the hours with some worthy object in view, for they seem to fly as if on the wings of the wind. Mental, physical and spiritual activity is the source of happiness. Duty is the watchword. Farm and garden work begins to press. A good garden is the gem of the faim. The more it is cultivated the better. We should have good seed to plant. Good seed is the basis of success, and we cannot afford to'j have any but the best. There is more than one way of doing things, and it may be that there is a better one than ours. If so, it is right to learn it. We should aim to make lets acres produce more, and with less work. Wood ashes are excellent for all soils deficient in potash. The difficulty is to get enough of them. No matter about the fine points of hens if the egg basket shows that they are all right. Good care is the best hen-doctor. Put sitting hens in quiet, dark places, away from disturbance. D. Orcutt. Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Elder Henry:�We greet you with 'How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.' We open with this most appropriate of texts, in noting items about home, present month, in reference to the call upon our Society of Beloved Elder Giles B. Avery and Eldress Harriet Bullard, so widely known as members of the Order of the Central Ministry of Mt. Lebanon. They came to us the 4th. inst. via. Harvard and left for Enfield, N. H., the 10th. It hardly seems good taste to eulogize these special God-sent messengers, and surely no better taste to be silent over this season of blessing. Other persons and events are eulogized and pass into history. Not so this occasion, the pure presence and soulcheering ministrations of spiritual love and confidence in God through these loved ones will live forever in the hearts of those who have 'ears to hear' and hearts to retain the seed sown. We saw and felt that their staff was the rod and their crown the cross, yet we were blest and reconciled to take our portion of both the rod and the cross. As a result of their co-operation, Elder H. C. Blinn resigns the office of minister over the Societies of Canterbury and Enfield and assumes the Eldership of our Church Family, William Briggs associate. Br. J. S. Kaime succeeds Elder Henry in the Ministry. The Brethren who have carried burdens as Elders in the Church, Benjamin H. Smith and Alexander Y. Cochran are appointed as Trustees of the Church retaining Elder J. S. Kaime as special counselor. How satisfactory, when, at the call of the 'Good Shepherds,' hearts and hands are for better, purer and more acceptable service. In this spirit we find our faithful Brethren assuming new duties, in which they are sustained and blessed* by those who have witnessed and appreciated past consecrated. May our messenger, beloved Ministry, convey to you the thanks of a grateful people. Our table is still spread with the choice fruits of the spirit from Brethren and Sisters of Enfield, N. H., as represented by beloved Elder Abraham Perkins and Br. John Bradford. Surely the Lord hath remembered us and his comfort is round about us. More than welcome are such angel visitants and we trust other Gospel friends tnay come and 'do likewise.' We thought to speak of a devotional religious service held during your absence of more than usual interest, but lest we call forth the whispered reminder 'Be brief' will simply add that the maple harvest closed with the satisfactory result of over five hundred gallons prepared syrup. Spring advances timidly. We would suggest that she be allowed a free, liberal reign, for we covet the re-appearance of early vegetables as potatoes were taken from our garden the first week in June, 1889. God bless our gardeners and farmers, and hasten our crops. We prefer them ere they are made into flesh, as we do the water into wine.
