INWARD HEART THROBS. ANDREW BARRETT. My dear young friends ;ï¿½It issaid, '' Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' This is the impression that rests upon my spirit. As the tongue is the mouth piece, so it will speak the heart-throbs. As the Spring time is the season for sowing the seed for the temporal or physical support so is youth the spring with each individual for sowing the seeds of a virtuous life, forming- those principles and habits that mark the perfect man or woman. In gaining these principles there is something higher to reach after than the gaining of earthly fame or power. There are victories over self to be won, there are treasures of immortal inheritance to be gained which will brighten and adorn the spirit through all future life. If this happy condition can be gained by self-abnegation and true self-denial, to me it is well worth the sacrifice. How truly apparent it is that humanity needs the spiritualizing process, needs to cultivate the devotional spirit which lifts the soul above the narrow confines of the little selfish circle of Me and Mine into a condition of harmony, an atmosphere of purity where they can claim a relation with the angels. An eminent mind ence said, 'Give me the first twenty years of your young people and I will be responsible for the remaining years. ' Habits that are formed within the period of those years make a life's impress. As our education is largely taken from books and periodicals how necessary that we select the right ones. Books and papers do more to determine the mental abilities and tastes as well as to form the character and disposition of their readers than perhaps any other ca.use. How important it is young friends that your minds be directed to, and by the choicest of earth's literature. The reading of weak, sensational literature never did and never will prepare a boy or girl to become a loving, helpful and tender hearted self-reliant man or woman. The perusal of blood and thunder stories filled with tales of strife and horror, not to speak of the evil reports of gross wrong doing on the part of their heroes, is not calculated to awaken deep thought concerning the duties of life. A wise consideration of the future, a desire to be noble and grand in character, and to build up a self made practical existence, is the condition and the faith of the true Christian. ' Where there is no vision the people perish.' 'Hands at work and heart to God' is a revelation from God to the true disciple of Christ. It is a self-evident fact that without faith in a spiritual ministration the people run into infidelity and materialism. My young friends, ' Character is the eternal temple that each one begins to rear yet death can only complete : the finer the architecture the more fit for the dwelling of Angels.' Our life deeds form our character. Habits formed in early life either elevate, strengthen and lift up, or dwarf or degrade the spirit. They will be our judges or accusers. A bad resolution broken is far better than kept to the dishonor and shame of the individual. To covenant with death is to make a bad resolution and then to keep it regardless of the tender feelings of your instructors. Dear young friends ; to you we are looking as our successors. We expect you to occupy some of the important positions that awaits your generation. To do so successfully you must know how to handle the great problem of life. It is so enwrapt with every interest, public and private, moral, social and religious, that you cannot escape one or the other. If you meet them wisely and honorably let your principles be thoroughly based upon truth and well understood. Rather suffer wrong than do wrong. Two wrongs never made a right. In the day of trial you will show how much you have of the spirit of Christ. If you can extend the forgiving love of God to your erring Brother or Sister for the insult received, you are strewing your path with flowers and building up that eternal temple which is to be your home when you drop the mortal form.
