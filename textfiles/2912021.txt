Alfred, Me Nov. 1899. The fall months keep us busy w7ith their various duties. We have no place for drones. 'Hands to work and heart to God,' is our motto. We have just stored twenty-two tons of grain in our cow barn. We are getting sixty-four gallons of milk a day, two thirds of which is shipped daily to Boston. Have a good stock of cattle and have raised twenty-four calves this season. The fall term of school has closed after a successful season of ten weeks. Number of scholars, fifteen. During the past month the angel of death has made us a call and taken our Brother, Frank Libbey: a faithful worker in the interests of Zion. It reminds us that this is no continuing city. The present is ours the future we know not of, so we will strive to do what good we can and be working for those treasures which are immortal and perish not. In parting with The Manifesto we feel that we are parting with an old friend. We hope that some time in the future we can welcome it again to our home. Eva M. Libbey
