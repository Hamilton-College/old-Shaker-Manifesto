WHAT CAN YOU DO? By A. C. Scammell. What can you do? Why open your eyes, And see the old World wait for your waking; He says,'You never shall sleep again. See the work I have planned for your taking. Work half done, and work not begun, All kinds of labor under the ï¿½un.' You can put the leaven in some one's bread, The leaven of brotherly kindness, Then you neeil not teach him the Golden Rule, Nor the sin of his moral blindness; The sweet, light loaf will strengthen him so 1 think he will find the way to go. You can cut the staff for one's up-hill walk, From your own up-climbing and falling, Tell your own story just as it is, Though it make you blush in recalling; Your brother lies need of your weakness and strength To reach the Rock and the Shelter at length. You can be the poem in many a life, You can keep sweet chimes a ringing Till hearts that were sad shall be always glad, Why, the World was born a singing! And tears that are, need not be tears long; 'Tis your work and mine to set them to song.
