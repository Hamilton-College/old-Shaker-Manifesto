THE HOURS. [Contributed by Mary Johnston.] The hours are viewless angels, That still go flitting by, And bear each minute's record up To Him who sits on high. And we who walk among them, Shall one by one depart, See not that they are hovering, Forever round our hearts. Like summer bees they hover, Among the idle flowers, And gather every act and thought; Those viewless angel hours. The poison or the nectar, , The heart's deep flower cup yields A sample still, they gather swift, And leave us in the fields. And some flit by on pinions Of joyous gold and blue, And some flag on with drooping wings Of sorrow's darkest hue. But still they steal the record, And bear it far away, Their mission flight by day or night No magic power can stay. And as we spend each minute, That God to us has given, The deeds are knpwn before his throne The tale is told in heaven. The bee-like hours we see not Nor hear their noiseless wings, We only feel, too oft when flown, That they have left their sting. So teach me heavenly Father, To meet each flying hour, That as they go they may not t-how My heart a poison flower. So when death brings its shadows, The hours that linger last, May bear my hopes on angel wings, Unfettered by the past. Selected.
