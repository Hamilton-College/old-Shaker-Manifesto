Hamilton DeGraw,--Brother:--Your letter of 30th. of March received... Monroe, La., May. 1890. Hamilton DeGraw,�Brother :� Your letter of 30th. of March received ; also the leaflets or tracts. To me they were very interesting. I am searching for truth as I understand and can comprehend it. I subscribed for and received the Manifesto. I also sent and got the 'Life of Mother Ann,' 'Shaker Covenant' and 'Shaker Anthems and Hymns.' I find much that is instructive in the 'Covenant' and the life of Mother Ann is very interesting. In searching fOr truths, especially for spiritual truths, one has to remove an immense amount of rubbish to get a few grains of truth. Like digging for gold, much has to be cast aside to get the precious metal, which always retains its lustre, let it be found wherever it may. You speak of sending some Tracts and copies of the Manifesto to those whom I would recommend to read them. Alas, my brother, I cannot name one of my acquaintances that I could say would profit by them, or subscribe i'or the Manifesto. Some might look into them and read a few lines, and then would only laugh or ridicule, as Monroe, La., is what I call a church and priest-riddtn community, the Catholic Church predominating in this town. It has a population of some twenty-five hundred souls. The white people have six churches and the colored people have six ; and all these are within a radius of seven-eighths of a mile from the place where I am writing this letter. Brother Hamilton, I am no longer young. Years are passing over my head and old father Time has been touching my hair with silvery tints, which is a sign to me, that I must be preparing to return to the power that sent me, and meet the deeds that were done while in the body. My acts are the messengers which have gone before to meet me. My prayer is that good and wise intelligences may ever be with me to guide me in all my walks of life. I wish to do all the good I can as I pass along on life's highway, as I have assurance only of the present. I cannot prevent the effect of the wrongs of yesterday and can only take care of to-day. Brother, distance lends enchantment ; that good place we wish to reach is always in the distance. I was born in Westmoreland Co., Pa., and have crossed the continent two and one half times. When I have left places to get rid of disadvantages, others have met me in the new place, and my condition has often been made worse. My present opinion is this : that the good place is where we are cop tented, having a good degree of health and enough of this world's goods to supply our daily wants. If life is spared, I intend to leave Louisiana and go farther north. As to the disadvantages of the southern country, their name is legion. One has to be here, to see and to realize them. I close, wishing you well. Fraternally yours, JOSIAH STAHL.
