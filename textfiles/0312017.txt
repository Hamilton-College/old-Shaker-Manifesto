For the Shakeress Feeling that I am a debtor to all lovers of truth in the preceding Dispensation, who, by a life of self-denial, strove to vindicate and uphold the work of righteousness on the earth, I would gladly give a fitting expression of my gratitude therefor, and honor the past; and also give my testimony to strengthen the present; and to help (in my humble way) any sincere soul, who may be looking among the lo heres and lo theres, to find the Christ of God that can give true rest unto souls. The years of my pilgrimage on earth number fourscore, fifty-six of which have been spent with Believers, or Shakers. In practical obedience to the truths taught and lived by all who are true to their profession, I have seen the travail of my soul in the work of regeneration ; and, as I have progressed ' from faith to faith,' I have also received increasing light and power to work the works of righteousness, and am now reaping the fruits thereof, which are peace and rest to the immortal part, that I know a life in sinful indulgence could never give. And I have witnessed the operation and effect upon others with whom I have been associated, and I can testify that I am satisfied with the goodness of God through the Gospel of Christ in the first and second appearing. I am conscious that I am now nearing the end of my sojourn in time ; but I feel a bright hope for the future ; and, although my physical strength is waning, yet in spirit I am joyful; I feel thai the prediction of the prophet Jeremiah is being fulfilled in our time, when the ' virgin ' sons and daughters of ' Zion can go forth in the dances of them that make merry, both old and young together, and sing in the heights of Zion,' and partake of the goodly feast of ' wheat, and oil, and wine' of the kingdom, until 'their souls are as a watered garden.' My feelings go out in love to, and in prayer for, all honest truth seekers, that they may be led, as / was, to renounce the inferior pleasures of time and sense, and learn, to live to God and die to sin; and, through obedience to truth, fit themselves for the society of angels in the Heavenly Father and Mother's kingdom in the world to come.
