Persons of Principle, v. s. Persons of Circumstances. GILES B. AVERY. Ik a retrospective view of humanities' history one special class of the human family ever command our respect, reverence and gratitude; to them we look for strength in times of weakness ; light, in dark hours; nourishment, when fainting; refreshment, when weary ; courage when resolution grows faltering; stability, when temptations and trials thorn our way. These are they who have guided and squared their course in life by principles of righteousness, as judged by the Divine Law. While the unnumbered millions of earth's giddy throng, in surging masses, have drifted with passions foaming waves, or been driven by the tide of circumstances, in various directions, according as its tide hath flowed and ebbed in various directions, but veered from heaven's course, now turning, for a moment to the right hand path of truth and virtue, if fortune's winds blew in that direction ; then to the left, to wander in the wiles of sin, if temptations, or the influence of the multitude led in that course, persons of principle have held on the path of virtue, true as the needle to the pole, and steadfast as the rocks of Gibraltar. In all ages, in all climes, in all kingdoms or governments of the world, the citadel of strength, and the bulwarks of protection for human society have been built up and sustained by those stable benefactors of society, (few though their numbers have been, compared with the masses,) who have consecrated their lives, fortunes and honors, unselfishly, to work God's work as best they understood it, though reviled, scoffed, or persecuted by the heedless, giddy throng of persons of circumstances ! Noah, Abraham, Moses, John Baptist, Jesus, Peter, Paul and their coadjutors�the saints and martyrs of yore together with the 'Two Witnesses,' male and female servants of God, who all adown the dark ages, kept their eye on God, and his work for human weal, and wrought with its spirit and power. These, together with nameless and numerous others, who, regardless of opposing circumstances, have consecrated their life work to human reform and progress, and become the great benefactors of our race. Of these were those who received the baptisms of the prophets of Bible record, and of the French prophets of later date, and lived in obedience to the inspired dictum of those periods. A few of these fled from the tyrannous persecutions of France, to England, and their work culminated in the advent of anew and great dispensation of God's mercy and grace ; when the spirit of the Lord brooded over the waters of human conditions, and prepared a few noble souls to receive the Testimony of Christ's Second Appearing, those who buckled on the armor of faith, and fought the fight of the Christian warfare, to the pulling down of the strongholds of Satan. Of this number were Mother Ann Lee, and pioneer members of her little church. However noble the endeavor and en- terprise that persons of circumstances engage in, for a season, when obstacles are thrown in their way, when opposition is to be encountered, when persecution lifts her thong, these laborers forsake their field of toil, fold the banner they had thrown to the breeze in the days of prosperity, abandon their noble enterprise, and slink back into listless indifference and disgrace, reminding us of the patriarch Jacob's admonition to his son Reuben�''Unstable as water ; thou shalt not excel ! ' But, did Jesus relinquish the strife when thousands who encored him with praises and believed on him one day, forsook him the next ? In no wise ! He pursued hi? godly course till life's bitter end ! Did the suffering disciples, and the noble martyrs who followed Jesus in ages past shrink from duty, and lock up their testimony and heart's fervor in silence because of the wicked opposition of souls unwilling to bear the cross of Christ? Far from it! They toiled on till life's threads were spun ! Did Mother Ann Lee, and the noble Elders with her, or their faithful successors, the early pioneers of this gospel work of the 'Latter Day,' the day of Christ's Second Appearing, relinquish their efforts to save souls, by constant labors, early and late, because many souls who once set out fair in the way of God turned back, no more to tread the goodly paths of self-denial and the cross? They did not! They toiled on, through life, to plant and establish souls in the Gospel of Christ, in this land of liberty of conscience. Even worldly philanthropists, from secular or humane motives, have been more persevering than to abandon noble pursuits, because of meeting bufferings, disappointments, sufferings, oft-timesintense. Witness John Howard, who gave his fortune and his life to relieve the sufferings of his fellow men impaled in prison's doleful precincts. Witness the unflinching efforts of the world'sdiscoverers and inventors, Columbus, Americus, Morse, Harvey, Ged, Arkwright. Watt, Fitch, Howe, Mc.Cormick ; and numberless others,�Cyrus W. Field, in starting and instituting the Atlantic Ocean Telegraph cable. To accomplish this he crossed the ocean fifteen times, and, though he met with many failures, and the loss of immense fortuues, and 1488 miles of cable, worth many hundreds of thousands of dollars, he persevered until his labors were crowned with success, and an immense fortune is his reward personally, while the value to the civilized world, in mercantile and civilizing purposes is beyond the reach of human calculation at present. Examples numberless might be presented for patronage. But, to souls who, with open eyes can trace human history, the task is needless. The most gigantic and noble enterprises ever accomplished by the sons of men, have been achieved only by a dauntless perseverance, under exceedingly harassing and burdensome difficulties. Difficulties sternly met and overcome,. tone the spirit with a deathless energy,, sometimes apparently almost superhuman ; while a good and possible purpose relinquished for want of persevering effort, is the author of discouragementsand, sometimes, of dissipations, ignominy and disgrace ! But, life's pressing needs are before us ; there are millions who- need salvation ; there are souls seeking the bread and waters of life, ministering spirits, heaven born souls, are needed to herald the gospel testimony to the suffering millions groping in spiritual blindness, and wading in the marshes and pits of sensual degradation and sinful pleasure. There is a harvest field ripening and ripe for the sickle of the Lord; and willing reapers are needed to gather into the heavenly garners the prepared guests to the wedding of the heavenly Bride and Groom. Welling up, welling up daily, are all the urgent necessities for action in the house of God. To be idle, is to provide for destitution and loss. To be indifferent, is to be shamefully degraded. To be negligent of duty, is to incur the displeasure of the heavenly hosts, and all living souls in the house of God on earth. To be opposed to the work of creating souls anew, giving them a birth into God's Kingdom, is to incur the necessary chastisements from the hand of God that gloom the soul in misery and merited woe, while, to unflinchingly work for God, is to win crowns of glory, honor, and immortal life ! Ho for the workers in God's field of redemption from sin, and progress of the human race in wisdom and virtue. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
