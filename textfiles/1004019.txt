The Children's Grotto BOYS WANTED Boys of spirit, boys of will, Boys of muscle, brain and power, Fit to cope with any thing — These are wanted every hour. Not the weak and whining drones That all troubles magnify — Not the watchword of ' I can't,' But the noble one ' I'll try.' Do what'er you have to do With a true and earnest zeal ; Bend your sinews to the task ; ' Put your shoulder to the wheel.' Though your duty may be hard, Look not on it as on ill; If it be an honest task, Do it with an honest will.
