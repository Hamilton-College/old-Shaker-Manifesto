MEDICATED SOAPS. A distinguished specialist in skin diseases�Dr. Bulkly�discussing the so-called medicated soaps, says that the attempt to medicate soap is a perfect farce�a delusion and a snare to entrap the unwary and the uneducated. The soap is to cleanse, it is applied for a few moments, and washed off, and is incapable of effecting a cure of the skin. The assertion can be made with truth, he says, that itch, which sulphur will certainly cure if regularly used, has never been and can never be, cured by this remedy in the form of soap. The soap neither keeps the skin always well, nor cures it when diseased. Carbolic soap is useless and may be dangerous, because the carbolic acid may cover a cheap, poor soap. Respecting the soothing soaps, as glycerine, honey, oat-meal, almond and a host of others, at best they are only bland soaps, and no way superior to a perfectly pure soap without these healing properties. The safest soap to use, of those ordinarily employed, is undoubtedly very old, white castile soap.' I have quoted this writer, not because I concur with him entirely in his views, but because I think they are in the main correct, and because I know that people are greatly imposed on by the high-priced and, in most cases, useless soaps, advertised. It reminds me very much of the practice in many parts of the country, of searching and digging for roots and 'yerbs' to make a poultice, when cloths wrung out of hot water would answer every purpose. As to itch, it is certainly true that soap alone, especially strong home-made soft soap, will cure it, without any addition, if thoroughly and persistently used. The same may be said of tar and carbolic soap in other skin diseases, but these are better applied in the form of an ointment, the virtues being due to the tar and carbolic acid, and not to the soap, and these are more effectually used in the form above indicated.
