Sanitary BATHING AND WHY WE SHOULD BATHE. Among all the appliances for health and comfort to mankind we may safely say there is nothing so well known, so useful, and withal so comforting, and yet so little practiced, so carelessly and thoughtlessly neglected, as judicious bathing The skin of the human body, from head to foot, is a network of pores, which ought always to be kept free and clear of obstructions, These pores are the openings into minute tubes or channels, which lead through unseen meanderings into the sanctum of life within To those blessed with good health, a bath, as a common sense appliance, gives thrift and growth to healthy functions, a brightness and delightful serenity, a clearness of mind and buoyancy of spirit. It is ceitainly a blessing to both mind and body. For the mental worker, it is a nerve tonic. A thorough immersion in water of proper tempera- ture will calm and give -strength and tone to his whole system. The indoor laborer who gets but a scanty supply of fresh air, needs a bath to obtain those invigorating elements so common in the open air. The outdoor laborer�especially thfc. farmer�who works with heroic energy all day long, unavoidably gathers on the entire surface of his body a complete prison-wall of dust and thickening, gummy perspiration: and when his day's work is done, he needs then, more than any other thing, not only a wash, but a good, luscious, full bath to fit him for a clean bed and a refreshing sleep. The glutinous mass of perspiration, dust and filth, which gathers on the surface of the bo ly naturally covers and clogs the pores and often enters them and poisons the system. To remove that filth, frequent ablutions and occasional immersion in water are exceedingly desirable, and usually indispensable to health and comfort; consequently, every family should have a convenient bath� and a full bath too�of some kind, not only for general neatness of person, so desirable to every individual of taste and culture, but as a means of preserving health, and in many cases, especially under the advice of a good physician, as the safest, pleasantest and one of the most powerful and efficient means of combating disease. Directed by good judgment and wise counsel, a bath is a valuable auxiliary to other remedies, and it can be used when internal remedies cannot. In the long catalogue of diseases to which flesh is heir, scarcely one can bemamed in the treatment of which a bath is useless. In an emergency, which often happens when least expected, as in cholera, cholera infantum, cholera morbus, cramp, fits, &amp;c, a pliable, portable bath, which requires but little water, ready just at the right time, may save some precious life. Finally, everyone needs a bath at times, and every human habitation should contain something for a complete immersion in water, and since convenient and efficient portable baths at comparatively low figures are now extensively advertised for sale, there is little excuse for anyone to be without this priceless benefit.�'Common Sense Practitioner.' Western Rural. HOT WATER AS A. MEDICINE. In drinking hot water it should be tipped, and not drunk so fist as to distend the stomach and make it feel uncomfortable. From fifteen to thirty minutes may be consumed in drinking the hot water. A period of six months is generally required to wash out the liver and intestines thoroughly. Not more than half a pint of hot water should be drunk with the meals. To make the beverage palatable or to medicate it, aromatic spirits of ammonia, clover blossom, ginger, lemon juice, sage, salt or sulphate of magnesia are sometimes added. Where there is an intense thirst or dryness a pinch of chloride of calcium or of nitrate of potash may be added to allay the thirst and leave a moistened film over the parched and dry mucous surface. When there is diarrhoea, cinnamon, ginger and pepper may be boiled in hot water, and the quantity lessened. For constipation, a teaspooniul of sulphate of magnesia, or half teaspoonful of taraxacum, may be used in hot water. Inebriety has a deadly foe in the use of hot water. All thirst and dry mucous membrane disappear in a few days and a moist condition of the mucous membrane and skin takes place. The relaxing influence of the heat inside the alimentary canal relieves spasm and colic of the bowels, just as heat outside the abdomen relieves. Hot water dilutes the ropy secretions of the whole body, and renders them less adhesive and tenacious. It dissolves the abnormal crystalline substances that may be in the blood and urine. It washes out the stomach and leaves it fresh and clean for eating. It promotes elimination everywhere. As we are 75 per cent water, to keep from stagnation we need continual renewal. The universal use of hot beverages at meal time is based on a physiological necessity. If hot water in due quantities is taken between meals there will be but little use of taking water at meals. N.

' Yes�buj; where there is one case of overwork there are ten cases of overeating and twenty of overdrinking.' MEDICATED SOAPS. A distinguished specialist in skin diseases�Dr. Bulkly�discussing the so-called medicated soaps, says that the attempt to medicate soap is a perfect farce�a delusion and a snare to entrap the unwary and the uneducated. The soap is to cleanse, it is applied for a few moments, and washed off, and is incapable of effecting a cure of the skin. The assertion can be made with truth, he says, that itch, which sulphur will certainly cure if regularly used, has never been and can never be, cured by this remedy in the form of soap. The soap neither keeps the skin always well, nor cures it when diseased. Carbolic soap is useless and may be dangerous, because the carbolic acid may cover a cheap, poor soap. Respecting the soothing soaps, as glycerine, honey, oat-meal, almond and a host of others, at best they are only bland soaps, and no way superior to a perfectly pure soap without these healing properties. The safest soap to use, of those ordinarily employed, is undoubtedly very old, white castile soap.' I have quoted this writer, not because I concur with him entirely in his views, but because I think they are in the main correct, and because I know that people are greatly imposed on by the high-priced and, in most cases, useless soaps, advertised. It reminds me very much of the practice in many parts of the country, of searching and digging for roots and 'yerbs' to make a poultice, when cloths wrung out of hot water would answer every purpose. As to itch, it is certainly true that soap alone, especially strong home-made soft soap, will cure it, without any addition, if thoroughly and persistently used. The same may be said of tar and carbolic soap in other skin diseases, but these are better applied in the form of an ointment, the virtues being due to the tar and carbolic acid, and not to the soap, and these are more effectually used in the form above indicated.
