RETALIATION AND FORGIVENESS. By Lillian Phelps. 1) EFORE Moses' day the people were accustomed to live according to their I ) human feelings which repaid doubly every injury received, knowing no higher law. Then Moses, under divine guidance, taught the law of Justice, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;' which was to give as much, and no more than was received. But Jesus brought to the knowledge of men the divine law of Love, for 'Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.' These three stages are types of the growth of a soul. From birth, the first thought is to defend one's self against censure, injury or that which wounds the selfish nature. As the soul matures it learns to deal in strict justice, giving only in the measure that has been received. Yet this leavesthe soul in the state of nature. When a soul attains the divine law of Love, he finds no place for revenge or retaliation for he is governed by this law ; 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'* Where this Christ love has taken possession of the heart no hatred or hard feelings can find a place, and the divine command, 'Love your enemies' is no longer a hard saying; neither is it difficult to forgive as we would be forgiven for the indwelling spirit of Christ, if it is there, can manifest itself in no other way. One writer has beautifully worded this sentiment in the following lines, Oh forgive and forget, if the friends we love fondly Prove themselves to be false, and unworthy of trust, Oh deal with them kindly, for they are but mortals, Erring like usfor we too are but dust. Oh deal with them tenderly, pity their weakness, We know every heart hath its evil and good, We all have one Father in heaven, hence are brothers, Then let us forgive and forget, as we should.
