Kind Words Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Aug. 1889 Beloved Elder Henry :—As regards our little publication, THE MANIFESTO, it is to us a welcome visitor; but visitor is not the right name; it is our monthly Companion. When it comes laden with sweet music it starts anew within us, our spring of joy. Your Brother, Daniel Offord Enfield, Conn., Aug. 1889 Dear Editor :—I feel interested in our beautiful Manifesto, and would here express my thanks for the blessing it brings to us. Who can read its pages and not feel emotions of gratitude for the truths it conveys? Maria Witham
