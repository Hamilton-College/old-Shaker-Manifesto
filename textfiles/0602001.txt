AN HOUR IN THE DAY OF PROGRESS ELDER G. B. AVERY The present is, emphatically, a revolutionary age, a day of numerous revelations and developments, of rapid transitions in science, art, morals, and religion â€” creedal faith or profession. The character of Christians (so called), as a class, is being weighed in the balance against reputation; and religious creeds, as well as their professors, are being brought to the bar of judgment, to be tried by the light, which, for the last quarter of a century especially, God, through ministering instrumentalities, has been widely dispensing in some degree, throughout the world, among all people, of every nation and clime. To us, it is manifest, this work of judgment will not stop, until it comes home to individual, even as unto creedal, denominational, national, and society life. At present, conviction for sin is, apparently, almost lost from earth; but, its advent will break forth in the near dawning of a brighter day. It will return, like a morning shower, or the evening dew; and its pearly drops will moisten the arid deserts of soul experience, and make plants of life to bloom there luxuriantly. The crucible is heating, to apply the crucial tests to professions of religion, by revealed Christian principles of righteousness. God's ministers, seen or unseen, are blowing the fire! Let honest, sin-sick souls, through all the land, rally to this crucial standard, and enlist; for God has so constituted the human soul it cannot live (though it may exist in death) without religion; and the time is rapidly dawning when irrational professions of religion, together with mere professors, will have to take backgrounds among the dishonorable.
