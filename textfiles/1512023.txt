HE WANTED TO 'TAPER OFF.' A CLERGYMAN called upon a well known physician one day and said : *' Doctor, I wish to consult you about my health ; I am afflicted with very uncomfortable symptoms ; my hands tremble and shake, my eyelids twitch and quiver, and my lips are without sensation. as if they were numb, Isn't it a serious matter? Am I not in danger of paralysis?' ' It is, indeed, a serious matter, ' replied the physician, who knew his patient, 'but you can be cured entirely if you will follow my advice ; but I am afraid you will not be willing to take my prescription. ' 'Iceitainly will, doctor; try me; what is it?' 'It is simply to give up the use of tobacco entirely and forever. That is the whole cause of your trouble.' ' Aren't you rather hard on me, doctor? I own up, I both chew and smoke when I am diggiug out a sermon, and I need to. I couldn't write well without it. If I should give it up my people would see ilie difference at once. ' ' Excuse me, but do you really mean to say that you, a minister called of God to preach the way of salvation to lost sinners, must depend upon a filthy weed for your inspiration ? What kind of a call is that?' '� I will give up tobacco if I must, doctor, but you will allow me to taper off gradually, won't you? I am afraid it will injure my health to give it up all at once.' '� ' Taper off! ' it would soon be tapering on again. I never knew of a man who turned from a wrong way to a right way too quickly. My dear sir, if I were a repentant horse thief and had come to you for spiritual help, would you tell me I might ' taper off ' and stop stealing horses and only steal pigs and chickens and smaller things, un'il finally I should reform altogether? &gt;�*o, you would not preach any such nonsense. You would tell me to leave off stealing entirely, once for all. ' �; If, after I had given it up fur a week or two, a terrible hankering and craving should come over me. what could I do ?' 'Go down on your knees and pray for divine help until you get it.' ��Well, doctor, I think I must stop using tobacco, but I will wait until I go to the Adirondacks in the summer. I can attend to it better then than now. ' 'Like Felix, you would put off this important matter 'till a more convenient season. I warn you, sir, that you cannot trifle with your health in this way without serious consequences. It must be attended to immediately or I cannot answer for the result. ' The patient finally concluded to follow the physician's counsel fully, and the gain in health :-ind vitality proved the wisdom of the course.�Mary Winchester, in the Christian Home.
