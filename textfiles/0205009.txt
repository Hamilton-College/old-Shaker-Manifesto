O, Speak the Loving Word BY MARIA WHEELER, UNION VILLAGE, OHIO ' Love, and love alone is the loan for love!' O, speak the kind and loving word, To every heart, or friend, or foe, Or stranger lone. For human hearts by words are stirred, And leap with joy, or weep with woe, So oft unknown. Yea, speak the kind and loving word, E'en tho' their hearts are happy now, And no dull woe Sits guest-like at their hearth; unheard May come some grief with clouded brow, A nameless foe. O ! let thy words of love be strong, Thy sister needs them, tho' she frowns, Her heart is sore. She may hare wrestled with the wrong, Grown hopeless of the victor's crown, And strives no more. Or if from virtue's path she's strayed, And pleasure won her heart's embrace, O. love her yet. Perchance for kindly words she's prayed, And smiles, instead of frowning face, And love for hate. O, speak in love, and live its praise : The truth may shine with lustre bright Around our way; * And yet a film may cloud our eyes, And shroud us from its glorious light, Obscure its ray. Hearts oft grow cold, and proud and stern, For love to melt their ice away; So firmly set; O ! never teach a heart to spurn, As meaningless, kind words, for aye, So rarely met. Unto the happy, light and gay, Give kindly words, for sorrow needs No herald here; Unto the child in guileless play, To Age, whose step and dim eye pleads Our gentlest care. How sweet the music kind words bring, Into the heart and household dearâ€” No chimes so sweet. No warbler can so softly sing, The choirs of heaven pause to hear The strain complete. Nay, never will the kind word die, Or ever cause a throb of pain, But live alway. 'Will glow like planets in our sky, Will plant sweet flowers for our gain, O'er life's rough way.
