THE MIND. By Alonzo G. Hollister. IF the mind does not immediately grasp a truth presented to it in proper form of expression, by meditating on the expression, or simply by now and then referring to it in thought, the understanding will grow to its perfect comprehension, silently and unconsciously, as plants grow from germination to flower and fruit. How often has the mind puzzled over an abstruse or intricate question until quite confused, and after resting awhile without thinking of it, being occupied with other matters, on taking it up again found it all clear. There is an interior mind and memory, and an exterior mind and memory to each individual. The interior pertains to the realm of spiritual ideas and existences. If it be sought unto, and spiritual-mindedness cultivated by the interior, it will expand the exterior, or natural understanding and impart knowledge of many things not otherwise perceived. Isaac Newton said his great discoveries were made, by intending his mind upon the subject in hand. Just so a spiritual idea faintly perceived, by intending the mind upon it, increases in clearness, till it is fully revealed in the outer understanding. Faith is planted as a grain of mustard seed, and is nourished by reflection and good works till it brings forth fruit to eternal life. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
