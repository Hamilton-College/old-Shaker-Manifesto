Shaker Station, Conn. Nov. 1897. Of most importance has been the visit in their usual course, of our beloved Ministry. _ After imparting strength, comfort and counsel to us, and stimulating all by their stay, they are preparing to leave for other parts of the vineyard. Considering the season, our crops of hay, grain, tubers and fruits are fair. Sufficient for the usual needs of the family and some over. Our dairy stock is now occupying the new barn, with every prospect of passing the winter comfortably. The last week of Oct. was made very pleasant to us by the presence, for a too brief visit, of Sisters trom the South family of Watervliet. They introduced themselves to us at the opening of onr Sabbath meeting and won our hearts at once by a beautiful gift of song, rich in ministration of Angelic love and power. Our social unions with them dining the visit were also very enjoyable. We aie always pleased to meet gospel fririvls. Walter S. Sheoherl.
