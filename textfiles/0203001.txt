Thankfulness ' In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.''â€”2 Thess. ii. 18. Mark the reason why we should be thankful for all things : Because it is the will of God. Let me ask myself this question : Am I thankful for everything ? Am I thankful for that which displeases and crosses, as well as that which pleases and comforts me ? Do I make a blessing of everything ? Do I rejoice when persecuted ? Do I pray for my enemies or persecutors ? Am I thankful for THE SHAKER. 19 the opportunity of giving up all for the gospel? Do I thankfully give up my own will, my feelings, words, thoughts, and actions, to be governed by the Gospel, through my accepted Lead ? If I do not thankfully give up all these, then I do not give thanks in everything. But I can go farther, and say, that I am not only thankful for the opportunity of giving up all; but that I hare done so, and am thankful I have given up Father, Mother, Sisters, Brothers, Wife, and child, with all my relations, and worldly goods; and also that spirit that desires the continuance of such relations ; and am ready to give up my own carnal life in all things, and be thankful for the opportunity. Therefore in everything I give thanks. My particular thanks are due to you, dear Editor, and Correspondents, for the genuine spirit of comfort I derive from 'The Shaker.' Napoleon Brown.
