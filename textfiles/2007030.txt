Enfield, Conn. We must not try to live without labor. If necessity does not quicken the energies, we must work as a matter of principle, for mental, physical and spiritual activity is essential to the perfect development of human character. If any one were asked what is the great curse of the farm, he would be apt to say, weeds. They give us an endless fight. No half way work. Weeds can be raised cheaper than most crops, because they will bear more neglect. But they don't pay in-the end. They are the little vices that beset plant life, and are to be got rid of the best way we know how. It is cheaper to nip them in the bud than to pull them up root and branch. Here is where brain work comes in. Our experiment with Japanese buckwheat last year was a success. The kernels are more than twice the size of our common variety, and black. The stalks grow large and vigorous. It is well worth cultivating. Try it. Hens that are spare and leggy, are said to be the best for layers. We should study to obtain large eggs, not forgetting quantity, and well grown fowls. The best quality pays best and costs no more to produce. D. Orcutt.
