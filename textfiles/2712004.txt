SUNSET ROSE. By Martha J. Anderson. Fair rose, as delicate as sunset hue, When faintest shade of amber tints the sky Between the fleecy clouds that westward lie, When Sol has changed to light the depth of blue. Thy waxen petals opening to the view Disclose a beauty heaven could not outvie, And breathe a fragrance which the God's might sigh To quaff from censers filled with spices new. Rare flower, like gem of some ethereal sea; Perfection symbolized, Gods loving thought In loveliest form and purest grace outwrought, True emblem of man's highest destiny, When bud and blossom of life's growth shall be The perfect crown of immortality.
