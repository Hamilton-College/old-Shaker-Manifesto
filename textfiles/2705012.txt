Shakers, N. Y. April, 1891. While writing, the merry notes of the robin and bluebird greet me with the announcement that spring has come. For the last month the greenhouses and hotbeds have been brought into requisition for starting early vegetable plants. The report of George H. Baxter on the anniversary of Washington's birthday was interesting. The observance of those days which remind us of the lives and deeds of the great and good who have honored history's pages is beneficial; for 'lwes of great men oft remind us we can make our lives sublime.' It is a beautiful coincidence that the two most prominent names in American history have tl.eir natal clay in the same month. Washington and Lincoln are associated as the founders of the hope of the world, and the liberator from the thraldom of the dark ages. It is pleasant to share in the benefits tliat have come from the labors of such souls, but also to be willing to suffer that the truth may prevail is another question. Wherever the Divine Spirit may lead, may we be willing to give all we have to God and his blessed cause. That there is an indwelling spiritual force able so far to triumph over the physical as to heal its infirmities is well known to those who have been privileged to enter that spiritual temple and partake of the fruit of the tree of life. Why it does not at all times come as a healing power we can not answer but the many manifestations of that gift which have been record- ed in history and revealed in our own Church prove its reliableness. That there will be a revival of that power is our prayer. Hamilton DeGraw.
