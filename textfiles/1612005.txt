RIGHTEOUSNESS. HARRIET A. JOHNS. 'Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of Heaven.' Matt, v ; 20. This admonition was spoken by our Savior to a few humble fishermen who bravely left the narrow circle of separate family relation to be co-workers with him in establishing on a much broader basis a new order of life among mankind. Although Jesus found in the Jewish church a great deal that was wrong, it seems that he also found righteous individuals, since of one he said: 'Behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile.' Yet notwithstanding the good which existed among the Jews, our Savior said to his disciples, 'Unless your righteousness shall exceed theirs ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.' Who were the Scribes at?d Pharisees do we ask ? Biblical history informs us that the Scribes were a class of men specially educated for the purpose of preserving and expounding the sacred writings. They were called also the schoolmasters of the nation. Their influeuce was great and the co'mmon people held them in high repute. The Pharisees, however, were a numerous and dominant sect of the Jews, who professed sanctity and close adherence to all the external forms of piety and for which strict observance of the traditions of their fathers, expected to inherit the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Yet from Bible record we learn that they drew nigh unto God with their mouths and honored him with their lips while their hearts were far from Him. And iu vain did they seek to worship Him, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. So we perceive that neither the great nor good deeds performed by this class of persons could be accounted for righteousness to those who were called to follow Christ. This reminds us of the prophecy of Isaiah concerning the order of Christ's kingdom, the beauty and righteousness of which should exceed all others. When we compare the Law written by Moses the acknowledged guide of the Jews, with the teachings of Jesus to his disciples, and which all who followed him must embrace, we understand more fully the difference between the two orders, of life. The Savior said he came not to destroy the law but to fulfill it. Yet it is as plainly affirmed that he was the end of the law to as many as believed on Him for righteousness' sake. Throughout his whole sermon on the mount, when he refers the listening multitude to what was said by 'them of olden times,' he closes each reference with the emphatic,�'but I say unto you.' Would it not be well for us to study more wisely and pray to understand wherein our righteousness exceeds the righteousness of those who make no profession of following Christ, lest when we come to the Christ spirit seeking greater truth we go away sorrowfully as did the young man who came to Jesus inquiring : ' What good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?' Jesus first cited him to the law which reads,�Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not bear false witness. He answered, 'All these things have I kept from my youth up.' The Savior looked upon him lovingly and remarked, 'Yet lackest thou one thing. If thou wouldst be perfect, sell all thou hast and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasures iu heaven, and come follow me. ' What! go and sell all that he had ! All that the law had permitted him to retain? Sell all? Give up his claim to the righteousness of the past? The righteousness that the wise and good has ever approved ? Yea, all this and thine own life also, if you Avould follow me in the new order of spiritual progress which I (Christ) came to establish, was the decision for this young man, and by the same sacrifice shall we meet the approbation of God. In this way only shall our righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, is the plain declaration to all who would be true Christiaus in this day of perfected light and progress.
