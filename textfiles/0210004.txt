Real Christianity versus Profession 'There is one argument in favor of Christianity, which I could never reason away,' said a young man who was trying to be an infidel, and could not, ' and that was the consistent, godly conduct of my own father.' To which any bystander might have replied: ' There is one argument against Christianity, which I could never reason away, and that is the inconsistent, ungodly walk of a majority who call themselves Christians. These men and women are fathers and mothers in our own neighborhood, and are asking all to become Christians, which means a profession o1 something which grants an indulgence to its possessors to do that which should make humanity blush.' If to be a Christian means to follow the example of those who monopolize that title, I, too, must look in another direction. And if to be a Christian means to be good, I will try to be good, without making confederates of a set of hypocrites. Religio-Philosophical Journal
