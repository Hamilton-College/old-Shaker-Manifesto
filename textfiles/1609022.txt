THE SOLUTION OF THE LABOR PROBLEM. DANIEL FRASER. Population ever gravitates towards subsistence. 1st. Land is the source of subsistence. 2nd. That portion of the population engaged in providing clothing, shelter &amp;c. must ever bear a definite relation to the supply of food. 3rd. When the wage-earners are employed, they have access to subsistence. When not employed the food supply is cut off. 4th. Open to the unemployed immediate and free access to the source of subsistence, and the labor problem is solved�it solves itself automatically. 5th. The great law-giver founded the moral law on a just apportionment of the land, and enacted 'Thou shalt not steal.' Those who are denied access to the elements of subsistence, cannot be justly held to moral responsibilities.�Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
