Harvard, Mass. Sept. 18Q4. 'Time, thou art flying rapidly Ah! whither art thou flying?' These words of the poet Grey come into my mind as often as our very welcome Manifesto reminds us that another month has passed. We have not been blest with rain enough to do any good but once since the first of June. The earth is parched and everything is dry. Our beautiful maple trees are losing their color and assuming their autumnal hues. We are now engaged filling our silo. Ensilage rather dry and somewhat discolored, but mainly good though not qui e as large as common. On the 23rd of August our loved Sister Martha Carr departed this life. She has 240 THE MAN1FES1O. been a sufferer for some years, and though feeble in body was lovely in spirit. One of those of whom it can in truth be said; 'She was good.' We have just enjoyed a pleasant visit with Sisters, Marinda Keniston, Hester A. Darling and Nellie Hamlin, from Enfield, N. H. Such angel visitants bring a blessing in many ways. It is profitable to make a break in the daily routine, while interchange of thoughts develop ideas and quicken into action the dull machinery of the brain. We are so organized that we need changes and rest, and it would be better, in this age of hurry, if they came oftener. Our apple crop is good but in consequence of the drought apples are small. We have enough of everything for our daily needs, for which we are grateful. Mar da M. Billiard.
