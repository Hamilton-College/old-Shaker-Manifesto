INDIANS LEARNING THE ARTS OF PEACE GEN, McCLELLAN IN N. Y. WORLD IN N. Y. WORLD. Speaking of the peaceful methods of dealing with ndians, have you heard of the success of the little •aining school at St. Augustine, Fla.? About forty r fifty.of the worst cases for such treatment—Camanches, Apaches, and other southern Indians—were wrought as prisoners to St. Augustine, and have nice been drilled by military rule and square. The )risoners were treated kindly but with unmistakable rnmess and decision. I understand that they contitute now a well-ordered little colony in the garrion town. They have been taught to build little cotages, to cultivate the ground and to live at peace vith one another. They have a printing press mong them and all attend school. Some have hown a taste for the simple manufactures and arts, nd all are employed in some useful and profitable lanner. If these most unpromising cases, at first ook, could be so trained, I think that there is reason o believe that the condition of other hostile Indians ould be as readily changed for the better if they ould once be brought under strict military superision.
