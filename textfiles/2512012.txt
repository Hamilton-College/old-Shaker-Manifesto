WHAT IS IT TO BE A SHAKER? By Fannie Estabrook. TO be a Shaker is simply to live a life of purity according to the example of our Savior. He taught the gospel work while he was on the earth, and it was prophesied that there should be a second appearing, which we believe came to mankind through the ministry of Ann Lee, a woman who came from England to teach a good and godly life. One of the first principles she taught was Love, for 'By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples it ye have love one for another.' So to be a disciple of Christ we must love each other. Mother Ann taught, as did our Savior, to love our enemies and think evil of no one. Peace is another principle of the Christian life. There should be no war except the war with the elements of sin. 'Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them,' should be our rule. If we do wrong we should confess it one to the other and thus restore the peace broken by our transgression. Faith in the work of righteousness is necessary would we add good works. We do not live in a community for the enjoyment of temporal blessings alone but because these conditions are condusive to our spiritual growth. It is a beautiful life which gives happiness in this world, and an eternal home hereafter. We who are yet young and have chosen a Christian life should be zealous to remember our Creator in the days of our youth. Our gospel parents have suffered for the cause and we are reaping the results of their faithfulness. If we but obey the light with which we are blest we shall find saviors and teachers who will ever point us the 'the way, the truth and the life.' Hancock, Mass.
