Little Things BY ANNA WHITE ' Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil our vines.' A little spark will create a great conflagration, burning up villages, towns and cities. A little hole in a ship sinks it. A small breach in the sea-bank carries all away before it. A little over-crowding of the stomach will produce sickness. A little intoxicating drink has been many a man and woman's ruin. A little stab in the heart will kill a person. A little harsh word will stir up anger. A little gift of the Spirit, if slighted, will produce spiritual death. A little sin, as it is frequently and very improperly called, brings death to the soul. So in turn, little acts of goodness, little words of kindness, little smiles of approbation, make up the sum of human happiness.
