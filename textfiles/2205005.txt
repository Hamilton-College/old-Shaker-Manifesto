HOME INTEREST. ASENATH C. RUSSELL. I never enter this hallowed place within whose walls our gospel parents have so often met to renew their vows of consecration, and to return thanks for blessings received, but that the question presents itself, what must I do, as one of their children while sharing the benefits accruing from their upright lives? The answer is, give all as they have done, to the cause in which you have enlisted. With advantages superior, in many ways, why should I set bounds to my sacrifices ? I cannot expect the reward which they have for long service, yet I would be so faithful to the duties of my day, that my treasure may be satisfactory with this thought ever in mindI will make use of every opportunity for spiritual or mental growth. As I give in daily service All I have, with willing heart; In these seasons for improvement, I would take an active part. Why should not my strength be given, Though my talents may be small; To my home and dearest kindred Who have consecrated all? Like the busy bee in summer, Culling sweets from every flower; As the days are swiftly passing, Let me fill each golden hour. Wheresoever duty calls me, I would work with mind and heart; Meagre service though I render, Act the Christian's noble part. Life is one broad field of labor, Fraught with unremitting toil; Calling forth our best endeavors As we cultivate the soil. I would not give all my service To sustain the mortal part; Rather, grow the Christian graces, These, will sanctify the heart. Dear companions, in life's pathway, We have journeyed, side by side; As the shadows round us gather, Naught our interests shall divide. To the work that is assigned us, We will give both hand and heart; Till life's mission is accomplished, Be resigned to act our part. Enfield, N. H.
