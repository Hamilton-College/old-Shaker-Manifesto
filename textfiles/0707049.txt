Genuine Christianity To the Editor of the New Age :—I am very much pleased with the real work being done by your journal, and that in this it is filling a niche in the age of progress that has long waited for its advent. Well knowing its unsectarian character, I am almost dissuaded from entering a criticism upon the very fine production of L. K. Washburn—'Pious Pretension.' I fear, however, the writer has too strongly urged his points of argument when he infers that because popular Christianity is' very unlike the original of that name, there is none of the original element operative today. Among other questions that could be answered affirmatively, the following ai-e numbered : There are those who are following in his footsteps to-day. There are those who are selling all to give it to the poor,— who do not own a cent the^ call their own. There are those who are doing the will of the Father so successfully as to have in possession a measure of eternal life. There are ministers who are living and doing as Jesus did. There are people who, professing to follow Jesus, very nearly succeed in doing so. Thei-e are people who, relying not at all upon the merits of the man Jesus, deem his example, his life, worthy of all acceptation, until a greater shall come. There are people who, THESHAKEH. advance of them in religious life, are yet so successfully dealing in his virtues and lifeexamples as to be a very peculiar people, and the dispensers of unpalatable truths through their lives. We would ask friend Washburn, or any other friend interested, to visit some Shaker village, and therein, among many who have not yet travailed to the new birth in Christ life, find others whose meat and drink it is to live just like the author of Christianity. The article, ' Pious Pretension,' will do good—stir up many professors to look to their practices; but will it not admit of some valuable criticism as well ? G. A.
