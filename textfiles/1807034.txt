SOUL BREATHINGS. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1. Be thou my guide and stay, O Holy Spirit; Thy 2. Faith draws my soul to Thee, Come dwell within; All 3. Bliss of the angel life, Free from remorse, Hope saving love alway O may I merit. Sin oft my dark'ning shadows flee When light shines in. I covet of the christian strife, Joy of the cross. Tho' now my path besets, Clouds of doubt hang drear; Earth's gifts the best; Angel love would share, Mount feet must tread Heights of Calvary, Thus care my ing to comes true heart forgets When Thou art near, holiness On wings of prayer, rest in God, Eternally.
