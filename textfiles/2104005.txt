Avery, but was received too late for publication in that pamphlet. Ed.] South Union Ky., Feb. 10, 1891. Dear Manifesto :ï¿½In common with the other branches of our Zion, we wish to tender our tribute of affection and respect to the memory of our dear departed Elder Giles B. Avery. We were greatly shocked when the sad intelligence reached us, it came so unexpectedly as we had met him but a few months previous, and as far as we knew in usual health. We did not expect that he would be called to a wider field of labor so soon, but we have no doubt that such is the case and that it has only expanded his field of labor in the great work of redemption. We mourn the loss of our departed Father in Israel; remembering his words of wisdom and love, spoken to us while he was here. We feel his loss almost a personal bereavement, yet our confidence is unshaken that if we will arise in the strength of our might, resolved to inherit the promised land, we will not be forsaken, but will have the same power to guide us, if we are true to the Older of God. This was the teaching Elder Giles labored to disseminate, and we realized the -fact that his every effort was for the upbuilding of the different Societies in things both spiritual and temporal. All Zion seemed to share an interest in his labors and he knew no special locality, but was a laborer in God's vineyard wherever it might be planted. His spiritual nature beamed forth in all his acts and words. He wanted mankind saved from sin and degradation and elevated to a higher plane of purity and spirituality. We trust that his memory will ever abide in our minds, and the love and reverence we feel for him, remain with us, as an incentive to live as near to his example, as our strength and talents may permit us. In viewing his life of usefulness and perfect consecration to God, we can but exclaim in the language of the prophet in viewing the primitive Israel, 'Lord let me die the death of the righteous and may my last days be like his.' But we would not call him back to earth again if it were in our power, for he has passed from death unto life, leaving a shining example of diligence and zeal in everything that makes up the sum of a well-rounded Christian character. He strongly inculcated the teaching Mother Ann gave to her followers when she was upon earth: 'Put your hands at work, and your heart toward God.' His example leads us to a desire for spiritual food, that we may live to the honor and glory of God. Farewell then loving Father, may we meet you again. Jane Cowan.
