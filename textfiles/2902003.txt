PSYCHE. By Martha J. Anderson. O soil, in the smallest globule sent From the innermost soul's bright portal, With infinite purpose and life intent When fledged are'thy wings immortal. No folding thy powers, when once they have sprung From the chrysalis that confined thee, From life's first note is the paean sung Of the ages that enshrined thee. Thy breath in the atom first is felt, Rock, plant and tree enfold thee ; Dissolving matter may freeze and melt Yet its various forms all hold thee, Progressing toward the destined height Through mineral, plant and creature, Till man -appears as a God of light Perfect in form and feature. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
