APPLES FOR FOOD. Selected. The highest medical authority asserts that cooked apples, either boiled or baked, are the bes,t food for patients in the fevered condition of small-pox, typhoid fever and erysipelas. It has been well said that 'apples are general favorites.' Every eye covets, every hand reaches to them. An apple is a noble fruit, and its virtues blush to be tasted. Every muse delights in it, as its mythology shows, from the garden of Hesperides to the orchards of Plato. A basket of pearmains, golden russets, or any of the choice kinds, standing in sight, shall perfume the scholar's composition as much as it refreshes his genius. Apples are now considered to contain far more brain food than any other fruit or vegetable, and to be much more nutritious than potatoes, which enter so largely into the component parts of every meal. At present, apples are principally used in the form of pud' dings, pies, tarts and sauces, and are also eaten raw, in which state they are more wholesome than when mingled witli butter, eggs and flour. But they are very delicious when simply baked, and served at every meal; and substituted for pickles and such condiments, they would surely be found beneficial. Sweet baked apples are a most desirable addition to the breakfast and tea-table, and far more healthful, appropriate and sustaining than half the dishes usually esteemed essential at such times. Served with milk and bread, they make the best diet that young children can partake of, and are very satisfying in their nature. Baked apples without meat, are far more substantial food than potatoes can possibly be made, and to us the delicious aroma and flavor are always most appetizing. We would rather go without our daily bread than our daily baked sweet apples. We presume there are many families who will not use a barrel of them for the table this season, but will devour at least six barrels of potatoes. Let us beg of them to equalize the two a little more, and purchase at least three barrels of apples to five of potatoes. They will find that less flour, eggs, sugar and butter will be consumed in a family when a plentiful supply of apples is stored in the cellar. Selected.
