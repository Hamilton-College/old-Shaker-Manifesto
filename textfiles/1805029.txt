COMMUNION. Catherine Allen. The sounds of earthly din and tumult all are still, And round my soul is drawn a veil, that screens From every outward thing which claims the heart and And casts a dimness over heavenly scenes. [will, Oh gentle, calm, serene! Oh holy stillness hlest! What sweet communion now my spirit holds, With one who hovers near, an ever welcome guest, Who tenderly in love my heart enfolds. My blessed Angel Guide, and watcher ever near, My constant friend and helper through each strife; To thee my inmost thoughts and motives all are clear, Those hidden springs that move the wheels of life. Thou knowest all my faults; how oft my feet have strayed Or slipped when steep and rugged seemed the way; And how my soul hath wept, the struggles I have made To mend the past and truer live each day. Through darkness and through light, thy presence I have felt, In joy or grief, as right or wrong I've turned; And known that thou wast near, when secretly I've knelt To seek the conquering power for which I yearned. And when with searching eye, I've turned those pages Whereon life's changeless records all appear; [o'er, Thy gift hath helped me learn the lessons which they When in the light of faith they we re made clear, [bore. And with me thou hast gone beneath that river's tide' Which cleanseth e'en the memory iroin sin; And on its sunlit banks where blessed ones abide, Hath helped me gain those gifts the purified may wini Most grateful for thine aid, but needy still ï¿½f care, I ask anew the strength which thou canst give, To fortify my soul, God's searching truth to bear, That ever to his honor I may live.
