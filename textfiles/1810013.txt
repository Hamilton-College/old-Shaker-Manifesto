MANIFESTING THE LIFE of CHRIST. Nancy G. Danforth. Those who name the name of Christ, or claim to be his followers, should strive to show forth the spirit and life of the Teacher in all things. Their love must be stronger and purer than the love of the merely worldly-minded. It must ever flow from fountains pure and clothe the spirit at all times, iu sunshine or storm. We as Believers in the second manifestation of Christ should, above all others, show forth this likeness of the divine,�be ever ready to forgive as we would be forgiven. Though we may suffer wrong we should not wrong ourselves by any malice or hard feelings. 'We must set aside all of selfish, personal trials, and seek to aid those who desire a higher attainment; have patience with their failures and disappointments, still holding out the hand of love and magnifying the beauty and glory of following the divine pattern. This we must do by being humble and showing that we are ever thankful for the great blessing of understanding what it is to walk with Christ in dail^ life. Knowing our own inherent weakness, let us thank God for his great mercy toward us, that the Christ life has been manifested to us ; and hence it remains for u* to show to others what we have received. May we never shrink from duty in this respect; but each day subdue self more and more, thus come nearer and nearer to the Divine Life and Love which we so much need to make us what we all desire to become, �the true children of a Heavenly Parentage.
