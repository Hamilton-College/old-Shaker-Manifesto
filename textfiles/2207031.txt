FORETELLS THE END. In north Georgia the Rev. T. K. Hostell, a Baptist missionary from Indian Territory, claims to be informed as to the date fixed for the end of the world. He says that during the last year lie has had so many mysterious revelations made to Mm that lie felt called upon to preach to his own people their impending doom. The Israelites, lie says, will take up their journey to Palestine on the 3rd. of April, 1896. On the same date in the year 1900, the new temple at Jerusalem will be dedicated with impressive ceremonies and Christ will make his secoad advent on Mount Olivet the 15th of May of the same year. In the meantime all the terrible disasters foretold for the last days will begin at once. Brethren will be arrayed against each other as never before. There will be wars and political revolutions calculated to drive people to a sense of their duty to God. His hearers listen with eagerness to his revelations and will talk of nothing else.
