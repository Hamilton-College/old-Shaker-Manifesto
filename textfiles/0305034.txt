KEROSENE Banger from fire. Never fill a burning lamp. Fill lamps by daylight. If obliged to fill at night, have the light a yard off and not in a current of air. Never pour oil on the fire. If burning oil gets upon the floor, smother with blanket, rug, or clothing. If the clothing takes fire, wrap a blanket or rug about the person, or roll upon the floor. Never run about, or scream more than once; for motion fans the flames, and in screaming they may enter the lungs. Keep the can closed and in a safe place. All kerosene oils (including naphtha, benzine, benzoline, etc.), are highly combustible; as a rule, the high priced oils are less explosive than the cheaper ones ; better pay a few cents more a gallon, and buy of respectabJe dealers, than run the risk of losing life and property.
