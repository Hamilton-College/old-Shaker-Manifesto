Alfred, Me. April, 1892. Beloved Editok:While there is nothing of particular interest to mention, yet I am afraid Elder Henry will think I have lost those pencils he sent me if I fail to write a few words. Our February notes it seems were too late and March notes were neglected from a press of other duties. April has seemed more like March. It is true the robins and some other of our singing birds have come but the cold nights, and cold, windy days should think might give them the bronchitis. We cannot give as good a record of health as at the North Family, Mount Lebanon. A disagreeable distemper prevailed through the most of March, and but few in Society or the towns around us escaped it. In many cases, there was a tendency to pneumonia. Our worthy Br. Richard Gilbert was so attacked and it took him from our sight, but not from our memory. His twenty-five years of earnest struggles had given him a degree of victory, and now he will be permitted to complete the work he had so well begun. The ground freezes every night so no farming or gardening is in order yet. Our Lebanon Sisters are ahead of us in the house-cleaning, as Elder John is afraid of colds and other troubles if Sisters commence too early. Brethren finished sawing wood and most 01 it is split. This too was delayed by the epidemic. When next month's notes are written, it will seem more like spring and the promise old mother nature will be giving of good things to come, will give us renewed hope and courage. Let us look well to our spiritual sowing that the harvest may be abundant. F. C.
