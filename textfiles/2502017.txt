Harvard, Mass. Jan. 1895. We now begin a new page in the great book of years. May our effort be to write on its unsullied pages naught but goodness, blessing and prosperity. On the 22nd ult. we occupied our new barn. It is well built, and as near like the one we had last, as possible, making a nice appearing structure. Our foreman on the farm, who has been with us twenty years, gave a weather vane with the design of a cow, which looks fine standing on the top of the cupola. THE MANIFESTO. 45 Christmas has come and gone, leaving, we hope nothing in its wake but joy. We had the usual memorial meeting in the forenoon, welcoming the Christ spirit and seeking to receive it into our hearts. The Sisters faithfully performed their part in making the day happy, feasting us with oyster soup, plum-pudding, cake, pie and as many more good things as health would admit. In the afternoon we were interested by our young people with singing, dialogues and selections appropiate to the occasion, Near the center of the room was a beautiful tree laden with fruits of all shapes and shades which Santa Claus proceeded to unload and distribute among the audience. Every one left the room happier for having been there. The first day of the year the farmers commenced fitting our new ice-house. They cut 2,200 blocks of the beautiful productions of the frost king, from 10 to 14 inches in thickness; 792 blocks were stored at the North and South. The attention of the laborers is now turned to providing wood for next year. As the year has commenced, so may it end, in happiness. Marcia M. Bullard.
