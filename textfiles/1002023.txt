DEBTS A debt is a load which you should be slow to take upon you. Debts bring trouble and sorrow. Interest will gnaw at your earnings without ceasing. It will never rest at night. It will not observe the Sabbath. It will not stop for sickness, nor for funerals. In rainy weather or in dry, in summer and in winter, it will keep on noiselessly adding to the load under which you groan. It is a sin to run in debt without a probability of paying. You should never run in debt for any thing that will not stand good for the debt incurred, or will not contribute toward its payment. You had better wear the poorest clothes and eat the plainest food, than buy food or clothes with other people's money. It is always safe to wait for these things until you have the money to pay for them. By so doing you will not only be saved from trouble, but also from pride and extravagance. Give no occasion to any to reproach the cause of Christ because of your dishonesty. Owe no man any thing but to love one another. Sel.
