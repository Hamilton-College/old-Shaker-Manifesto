DUTY Remember your duty to God, Though sorely afflicted you be ; Not through fear of the rod, Nor yet because danger you see. Remember your duty to man — Your Brothers and Sisters on earth ; The surest of ways that you can Prove your claim to a heavenly birth. Remember your duty to do, As well as your duty to know; Talk may be well — prayer is, too ; But add to them works, and keep low. The true ' faith which worketh by love,' Has no need for fear of the rod; Our duty, below or above, Will lead us in safety to God. John Whiteley. Shirley Village, March 14,1875
