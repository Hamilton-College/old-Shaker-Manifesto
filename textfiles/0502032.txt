VOICE OF PEACE 1. O'er sea and strand and peopled land, The voice of Peace is heard, It speaks with sweet inspiring tones, And many souls are stirred. It lifts the vail where wrongs prevail, Which long were covered o'er, Revealing harvests of life's fruit Despoiled by cruel war. 2. O, sad'ning sight of death and blight, Of mis'ry, want and woe, The waste of manhood's noble life, Whence cultured wealth should flow; The homes and lands which mourn the hands That bore the deadly steel, Whose skill was turned to matchless strife, Instead of human weal. 3. For throbbing hearts have felt the darts, And borne the curse of war, And nations perished in the scourge, Beneath the battle star. God speed the time, when peace divine On earth shall bear the sway, When Love shall twine her laurel wreath To crown the perfect day. 4. The bards of old in song foretold A time when wars should (tease, When earth would bloom a paradise, Beneath the reign of peace. That golden age on hist'ry's page Shall gleam in truthful lines, For even now its dawn appears, Through bright prophetic signs.
