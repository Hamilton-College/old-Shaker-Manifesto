FOE WHAT DO WE LIVE ? ANNA ERVIN. What do we live for? Is it to be The sport of earthly power; To launch our bark on fortune's sea, And float perhaps an hour; To waste our time in idle dreams, Of what may be to-morrow; To glean with care from present scenes, The source of future sorrow? Nay, we were formed to search for truth, Through paths made plain by reason ; To hail the light in earliest youth, Which shines in every season ; Yea, we were made to win below The boon hereafter given, To calmly smile at earthly woe And find our home in heaven.
