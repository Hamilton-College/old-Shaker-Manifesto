IF. If men cared less for wealth and fame, And less for battle-field and glory ; If writ in human hearts, a name Seems better than a song and story ; If www. instead of nursing Pride, Would lea, n to hate mkI abhor it ; If more relied on Love to guide� The world would bo the better for it. If men dealt less in stocks and lands, And more in bonds and deeds fraternal; If Love's work had more willing hands To link this world to the supernal; If men stored up Love's oil and wine, And on bruised human souls would pour it; If 'yours' and 'mine' would once combine,� The world would be the better for it. If more would act the play of Life, And fewer spoil it in rehearsal; If Bigotry would sheath its knife Till good became more universal; If custom, gray with ages grown, Had fewer blind men to adore it; If Talent shone for Truth alone,� The world would be the better for it. If men were wise in little things, Affecting less in all their dealings ; If hearts had fewer rusted strings To isolate their kindly feelings ; If men, when Wrong beats down the Right, Would strike together and restore it; If Right made Might in every fight� The world would be the better for it.
