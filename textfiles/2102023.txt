Union Village, Ohio. Dec. 1890. Deak Manifesto ;ï¿½We are now having a Southern Ohio winter. Christmas was a joyful pleasant time all day. We had a very good meeting and the singing was more than usually inspiring. Little gifts were changing hands and the sentiment in their presentation was, 'Peace on earth and good-will to men.' [See angel's song in the fields near Bethlehem; Luke ii., 8-14.] I read ten chapters in St. Luke on Christmas morning. In the evening we had a pleasant Christmas social. Eeadings, Recitations and Dialogues; the best singing I have heard for a good while. Recess. Candy, cakes, lemonade, popcorn, peanuts, etc., etc. Everybody pleased and satisfied. We had a good dinner on Christmas, but O this thing of slaughtering the poor turkeys to satisfy the appetites of the larger animal man. Bad business this. It will not always do for Shakers, eh? [Guess not. Ed.] However, we did not mean any harm if we did make graveyards of our stomachs. So 'Eise Peter, kill and eat and call not thou unclean, that which God hath cleansed.' [Peter did not have any turkeys. Ed.] Still after Peter's 1800 years experience I am sure he would preach a vegetable diet, both for health and purity's sake, if he was now on earth. We held Sister Malinda's funeral on the 26th at 2-30 P. M. Nine or ten persons spoke and all very feelingly. I never attended a more edifying or spiritual funeral. We have made nearly four miles of good fence this year and have thoroughly repaired our Laundry. Twelve hundred fruit trees which we set out this year are nearly all nourishing. Elder Joseph stands this climate a great deal better than the piercing winds of New England. School closes to tide over the Christmas holidays and to break up a monotony in the pupils. Begin again on Monday after New Year's day. Are putting up medicine again and this finds work for all ages. O. C. H.
