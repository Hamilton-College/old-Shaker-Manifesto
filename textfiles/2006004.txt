THE FIRST LAW OF HEAVEN. F. W. Evans. 'Go to the ant, thou sluggard;' and be instructed in the virtue of industrial organization. Why go to the ant? Rather let the Brethren, at least, go to the Sisterhood, not alone to learn industry but also to learn order ; to have a place for everything and to have everything in its place. Let them go into the apartments of the Sisters, and see the system of things. Lamps, tables, chairs, books, and then all the little niceties that make up the 'work table;' everything in order and in its place. And much of the order that is existing in Brethren's rooms is the result of Sisters' thought, Care and labor. Go into the kitchen, and observe the absolute cleanliness attained. Food is cooked, not spoiled. And three times a day meals are ready to a single minute. In the year, hardly a variation. Let Brethren note all this, and they �will learn the secret of why the Sisters are more spiritual than their Brethren, and why, in numbers, they are more sure pillars in the household of faith. The Elder Sisters keep the gift� 'hold the fort.' It is woman's day. The Divine Mother of all sentient beings, who has been hidden from the sight of carnal eyes, for ages and seons, is being revealed : because human beings are less carnal�more spiritual�humanity progresses. On the other hand, the Brethren intervene between woman and the rough, crude elements�human and material�and shield them, so that they can work in safety and peace ; even as woman intervenes between the uncouth, rough male element in the Brethren, and the angel element in the spiritual world. God's house is a house of order. Organization is operating throughout creation: the ant exhibits the law: what can be more perfect than the arrangement, governmental, of the ant-hill or beehive ? In human affairs, perhaps, the military organization exceeds all others in perfection; is it not singular that such should be the case ? Is destruction, rather than construction, the ruling power? It appears to be so, thus far in human history. What is histo- vy but a record of the master minds of the race contending with each other for place and power over the ignorant masses, who are kept in ignorance, that they may thus become helpless tools in their hands ? Education�the key of knowledge� must be assumed as the first duty of government. All children are born equal in ignorance and helplessness ; let them be as equally educated out of that ignorance. Keep all children in public, industrial, self-supporting schools, until twenty-one years of age ; first as learners, then as teachers. Let there be no place found for unrepublican class schools, high schools, academies, colleges, in the great American Republic; unless you want it to become a great military despotism, ending in monarchy. Let the public schools contain all grades of scientific knowledge and branches of learning known to humanity ; and be equally accessible to every child of the Republic. Is there not something approximatiDg this system in China and Japan, and is there not a hint of it in 'Looking Backward ?' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
