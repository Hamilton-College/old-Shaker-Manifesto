A PERFUMED CHURCH The wonderful and beautiful building known as the Mosque of St. Sophia, in Con- stantinople, is always fragrant with the odor of musk, has been so for hundreds of years (ever since it was rebuilt), and nothing has since been done to keep it perfumed. How do you suppose this wonder has been performed ? In the year 538—more than a thousand years ago—the mortar with which it is built was charged with musk, and there it is to this day!
