Narcoossee, Fla Nov. 1893. In times of depression or when competition has grown too heavy,—the cultiva- tion of staples may cease to be remuneiative and the unfortunate producer be com- pelled to adopt some other means of livelihood. Such a misfortune may overtake the farmers of the United States. The western farmer who relies on his crop of wheat or corn for a living, is met with an overloaded market and to save the crop from utter ruin, he lets it go at a reduced price. It may barely pay the expenses. Such is competition the world over. The expences in Florida to get the produce into the northern market is exorbitant. This has killed all the courage of the producer. There is but little compared to what ought to be in the fruit and vegetable line, shipt out of the State. The It. It. are 14 THE MANIFESTO. held by two monopolists,—Flagler and Plant system. The prices are fixt to meet thfir demands, instead of an encourage- lii'. nt to the labeling people. Some of the leading minds are now wci'kin.'!,1 i(ir ;• change. They see that unless this one ti ing can be changed, Florid i is doomed for another set-back in civilization. All through the state we can seo people tilling the soil for a iiving, and the increase is small compaied with the labor. For that little increase they want some compensation if they keep the wolf from the door. As many are miles away from the market where they would be-glad to dispose of their produce, they are forced to accept the mercy of the railroad Corporations. As the inhabitants are so few and their means so limited but very little can be obtained through that channel. I understand that one of our neighbors sent a car load of melons to some northern city, and when everything was settled he realized twenty-five cents. Many acres of melons are left on the field, just for this reason. Through the goodness of some leading minds of the State, a Bill has been brought before the Legislature and Commissioners have been appointed to correct the error. There is still a hope for the poor man in Florida. Andrew Barrett
