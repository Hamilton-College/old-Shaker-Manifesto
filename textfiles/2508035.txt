If you would make yourself unhappy... 'If you would make yoursalf unhappy it is one of the easiest things in the world to bring about. The art of being miserable, though an art not taught in our schools, is not one without method, and may be pursued until the person following it has fully acquired it. As a first step in the art, start forth in the world with the single, unbending purpose to live for self and for self alone. This rule is important, and rightly put into action, makes it more easy to follow out the later provisions. With this thought in mind, always seek the best of everything for self. Make it a rule to occupy the easiest chair in the sitting-room, and failing to secure it, keep thinking how uncomfortable are all other chairs in which you are compelled to sit. If there is an errand or any oth- 192 THE MANIFESTO. er trifling duty to discharge, be sure to put it on others; or if necessity demands that you yourself do it, grumble during the whole time occupied with it at the in dolence of everybody else. At table, if there is some dainty tidbit of insufficient quantity for all to partake, strenuously endeavor to secure this, and feel miserable if you are so unfortunate as to fail. Seeing a friend with finer clothing than you possess, think how much you should like to dress as finely, if not just a little bit better. In the every-day affairs of life, if another possess a grander home and has more money to spend than yourself, keep constantly wishing you were in his place, brood over it and let discontent and covetousness rule in mind and spirit. By doing all this, you will be in a fair way to be continually unhappy and what is more you will make many other people unhappy.' ï¿½Selected.
