The Phrenological Journal for July has something to say of Prof. C. A. Briggs and the church controversy, and says it clearly and well, giving a portrait of the reverend critic. A remarkable Irishman and public character was Mr. Kavanagh, who is described, and how he made his way in the world, despite the fact he had neither hands nor feet. The character of Hadyn, the great musician, is well limned, and Dr. Reynolds relates certain interesting incidents of animal intelligence. In the department of Practical Phrenology the reader will be much entertained. It contains a striking and profusely illustrated article on the study of character by photographs, and the first prize essay on the 'Utility of Phrenology.' 'A pink of Perfection' hits off a certain type of childhood capitally, and 'Wrong Side Out' is a good illustration of motherly tact. ''Refined Physical Culture' takes up the subject of exercise on a line that has novelty, and 'Grape Juice' will probably open the eyes of some of the temperance people. In his second article on 'Systematic Moral Culture,' the editor opens a newT field, and shows the fallacy of expecting moral starbility without a definite training of the moral faculties.
