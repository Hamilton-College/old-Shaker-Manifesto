Sanitary. RHEUMATISM AND DIET Rheumatism is, as often as not, caused by over-eating, and especially over-indulgence in meat, which is certain to cause an excess of uric acid, and render the body liable, on exposure to wet or cold, U&gt; an attack. We know that old people are proverbially liable to rheumatism. The reasons for tin's are not far to seek. One is that joints and ligaments are harder and stifFer, and very often contain a deposit- -urate of soda. Another is that, as a rule, people up in years eat more than is necessary to support life, under the mistaken notion that they want a deal of nourishment to keep them up. I say that, on the contrary, the wear and tear of tissue is trifling compared to what it is in earlier manhood, and that far less food is required. Therefore, if an elderly person would live long, and be free of aches and pains, and be calm in mind- -for that is a great desideratum- -he or she must live abstemiously, more or less.
