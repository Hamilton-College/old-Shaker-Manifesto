THE GOSPEL MARlON JOHNSON O where is the power that can lighten, The heart that is burdened with woe? O where i,s the love that will hrighten. The journey ot life here below? For hearts over-laden with anguish, Is no healing bahn to be found? When in desolate places they languish. In sorrow and heaviness bound? The soul that aspires to be holy To rise above bondage and sin To walk in the narrow path lowly, All hallowed without and within. O where is the aid that it needeth, To throw off the fetters that bind? Whose is the strong hand that leadeth, T*he way of salvation to find? The Gospel. Ah,â€” that giveth power, The soul's deepest cravings to meet It sheds o'er the dreariest hour, A balsam that's healing and sweet. Canterbury, N. H.
