The Homiletic Monthly The Homiletic Monthly for July is a most brilliant number of that periodical. It contains the usual Sermonic matter from the most popular preach ers. Among them J. W.Rylance, D. D.; C. H, Fowler, D.D.; Canon Farrar R. S. Storrs, D. D.; David Swing; Rev. J E. Converse; Adolph Sophir, D. D.; Decoration Services, by N. D. Williamson and Rev. T. Johnson Lamont; Prayer-meeting Services; Comments on Hebrews; Dr. Schaff's second article on the 'Homiletic Value of the Revised Version'' is exceedingly interesting, as is also Dr. Ormiston's Commentary on James; The Methodist divines come forward in this number and express their views as to the best methods of preaching; Dr. Chamber on Misquoted Texts; D. II. Wheeler, LL, D., brings to us 'Truth From an Enemy,' and John Hall, D. D., stands up for the Independence of the Ministry. Surely the above is abundant for one month. There still remiffli editorials, brief discussions, quaint and useful 'IIomiletic Materials in the Rough'â€”all written in masterly style. $2.50 a year; Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 10 &amp; 12DeySt. New York.
