SCRAPS FROM THE BORDER LAND In your beautiful faith I am with you heart and soul, and I love and respect your people much more than those by whom I am surrounded. You are more consistent in living up to your profession. I was much interested in a paragraph contained in our ''Manifesto' of August, entitled, 'A Heresy Case.' And I feel convinced in my own mind that some invisible power has allowed that man to remain in the pulpit. For although he was tried and condemned by his orthodox brethren, yet they suffered him to continue preaching, well knowing he will continue to expound his own ideas. Such a man will prove a great power. For one holding such progressive sentiments and fearlessly preaching them from an orthodox pulpit, will have an important weight in overthrowing false and erroneous doctrines endorsed by the Church. Indeed many of the renowned preachers of our day are leaning in the same direction ; the spirit world is helping them in their efforts, and as it aids them, it assists you. The Shaker faith will triumph over all at last, and the glorious time is not far distant. Allow me to send you a few verses which I think applies to Mother Ann Lee. MOTHER'S OLD HYMN Alfred J. Hough Through the trembling foes of the twilight dim I can hear the strains of that grand old hymn, Which another, whose lips are now still and cold, Sang 'mid&gt;t her cares in the days of old. There was something about it, undefined, That charmed into quiet the troubled mind, O'er the bleak heart breathed with a spirit bland, Like the warm south wind o'er a frozen land. And crowning it all with a strange deep chord, Like the throb of the heart of the blessed Lord, That shed through the fainting soul abroad, A sense of the pitying love of God. The songs of the singers that fame has crowned. In the flood of the years are lost and drowned, But mother's old hymn, every pause and tone, With the growth of time has the sweeter grown. And it seems not out of the past to come� An echo only of lips that are dumb� But down from the home of the glorified, It has always come since the day she died. We know not the music which spirits hear As earth is receding and Heaven draws near, But treading death's valley of shadows dim, I ask but to hear my mother's hymn.
