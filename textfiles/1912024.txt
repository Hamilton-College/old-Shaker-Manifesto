MOTHER'S OLD HYMN Alfred J. Hough Through the trembling foes of the twilight dim I can hear the strains of that grand old hymn, Which another, whose lips are now still and cold, Sang 'mid&gt;t her cares in the days of old. There was something about it, undefined, That charmed into quiet the troubled mind, O'er the bleak heart breathed with a spirit bland, Like the warm south wind o'er a frozen land. And crowning it all with a strange deep chord, Like the throb of the heart of the blessed Lord, That shed through the fainting soul abroad, A sense of the pitying love of God. The songs of the singers that fame has crowned. In the flood of the years are lost and drowned, But mother's old hymn, every pause and tone, With the growth of time has the sweeter grown. And it seems not out of the past to come� An echo only of lips that are dumb� But down from the home of the glorified, It has always come since the day she died. We know not the music which spirits hear As earth is receding and Heaven draws near, But treading death's valley of shadows dim, I ask but to hear my mother's hymn.
