Greasing Wagons: A good wagon costs a considerable sum, and it should be taken proper care of, and made to last as long as possible. Few persons understand the importance of thoroughly oiling the axles, etc., of wagons and carriages, and still fewer know which are the most suitable lubricators to use, and the proper way of applying them. A well-made wheel will endure ordinary wear from ten to twenty-five years, if care is taken to use the right amount of the proper lubricator ; but if this matter is not attended to, a wheel will be used up in five or six years. Lard should never be used on a wagon, for it will penetrate the. hub and work itself out around the tenons of the spokes and spoil the wheel. Tallow is the best lubricator for wooden axletrees, and castor oil for iron. When oiling an axletree the spindle should be wiped clean with a cloth wet with spirits of turpentine, and then apply a few drops of castor oil near the shoulder and end. When greasing an axletree, just enough grease should be applied to give a light coating; more does more harm than good, by working out and damaging the hub. Coal ashes have a wonderful effect upon pear trees, especially those growing in light soil. The ashes of last winter were used around the trees in liberal quantities, and those so treated have outgrown any thing in the orchard. Some that were even sickly, and apparently ready to give up their hold on life, have been restored to perfect health by these remedies.
