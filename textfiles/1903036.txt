COMPOSITION. Lizzie D. Horton. Who likes to write a composition? The subjects are plenty, but they are either too large or too small. When the subject is se- lected for us we often hear, I do not know what to say. I cannot remember anything I have heard about it. I have had an experience in regard to composition, which may be like that of many other young persons. But I remember one little girl who was advised to write, and the troubles she met, and how she mastered them. Her first trial was this� I cannot find a subject. At last this vanished when a friend suggested, 'The Snow.' She then resolved to do her best, and the result was the following. 'Snow is pure white. It comes down from the sky in flakes. It looks something like sugar, but � it is not good to eat. It melts when it is warm out of doors, and in the spring it all goes away This is all I know about snow, but when I am older I shall learn more.' It was finished quite abruptly. The advice given by her teacher may be of some profit to other writers. 'First choose a subject which you know something about, and before you write your thoughts on paper, have them clearly defined in your mind, and not waste time writing words. Do not fill your article with quotations, and never repeat the same idea several times, to fill out the sheet. Write just what you want to say and when you have done this, say no more ' If these few rules were carefully regarded, would we not soon learn to write a composition? Canterbury, N. H.
