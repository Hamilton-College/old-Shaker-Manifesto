The Message of Gov. Talbot of Massachusetts, to the Legislature, has been sent us, and we find it to be a very able State paper, brimful of political wisdom and human kindness. Its many suggestions, offered as amendments to previous customs and laws, are so cogent and desirable as to be a valued document for the Legislatures of other States to ponder over, and could only improve the wisdom of our national legislators.
