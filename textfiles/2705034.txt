Word and Works Word and Works for April makes its Forecast for the month with all the assurance of a well directed mind. There will be no anxious waiting this time as the Editor says, 'a regular storm period is central on the 2nd day of the month, and that April will bring an unusual amount of rain and some violent Venus storms.' If there is not, on that day, a regular blizzard in our town, we shall make arrangements to enquire of the man in the Moon. April is to bring us storms of rain and hail and thunder, but the Editor says.�'Let no one be foolishly alarmed, as though we predicted unknown calamity, but let all calmly watch and provide against nature's regular visitations.' The articles on Temperance have a leading value for the paper, and the writers are the manifested friends of humanity. In the Department of 'The Word,' are to be found some very pleasant and timely religious remarks that must have been written by thoughtful minds. Word and Works Pub.

The Ladies' Home Journal Ex-President Harrison, whose articles in The Ladies' Home Journal are creating such widespread interest, will write about 'The Social Life of the President,' in the April issue of that magazine.

The Book of Daniel in the Light of the Higher Criticism The Book of Daniel in the Light of the Higher Criticism; by I. D. Steele. The object of the author of this little pamphlet, aided by the timely Notes of Br. H. L. Hastings, is to prove that the Prophet Daniel and the Book of Daniel are just what they purport to be. True to the man, and true to his writings. Sometimes the Higher Criticism makes sad havoc with the prophets anil apostles, an 'I ii they had it all their own way they would soon make the Hible smaller than a pocket testament. It is a good thing to see men zealously defending what they eonseien tiously believe to be right. One of the writers makes this remark, 'Everything concerning the world's so-called snere.l writings, is a proper subj' et for investigation. Their origin, authorship, date, claims, teachings and histo' ry, all must pass in review, and if we have been misled or mistaken in any of these particulars, we must revise our conclusions in the light of establisht facts.' This is J.ind ami considerate and the skeptical mind must so accept it. I'ublisht by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Bcston, Mass.

THE IRISH PEASANT AND HIS PIG THE IRISH PEASANT AND HIS PIG. [From The Outlook, April Magazine No.~\ The rents of these little farms were from two to six pounds, Each cottager grew a lit tie Held of oats, another of potatoes, another of grass and some raised patches of cabbages or turnips. These crops were grown mostly on the thin soiled, stony hillsides. If a man took a field in the meadow below, his neighbors thought he was too well off, and accused him of an inclination to put on airs and ape the aristocracy. Besides all this it added an extra pound to the rent. Most of the people kept two or three cows, several sheep and a few hens. In some cases they owned a pony or a goat, or a flock of geese. There were also two half-grown pigs that frequented the village lanes. They were sharp-nosed, long-legged creatures, nimble of foot, and apparently capable in their wanderings of picking up their own living. When at home they lived in their master's house which had but a singl-j room and the pig-pen was in cue corner.
