JOURNEYING ON 1. Our faith is unclouded and bright as the day, Uplifting our spirits from darkness away; 2. The high way of holiness we will pursue, While pleasures terrestrial recede from our view; 3. Brave pilgrims who traversed this way in the past, With pure hallow'd blessings our spirits o'ercast; 4. Though thorny the pathway awaiting our feet, And many the dangers and trials we meet, No shadow of turning our progress shall stay, We're bound for the regions of bliss. We'll sip from the fountain of life that is new, And feast on the fruits of pure love. They scatter'd the seedgerms of truth that will last, In beauty forever to bloom. With courage undaunted no power can defeat, We'll press for the heavenly goal. We are journeying on, we are :;-' journeying on, To the love land of light, our beautiful homel Where sin cannot blight nor 'sorrow e'er come, O, beautiful, blest and eternal home.
