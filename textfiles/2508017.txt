Shakers, N. Y. North Family. July, 1895. There is no division of labor that seems to give the pleasure and satisfaction of being able to enjoy its productions fresh as they are gathered, like that of the agriculturist and horticulturist, although at present the economic conditions of human society are making him bear proportionately more than a just share of the burdens of life; However we are 'looking up through the clouds to the sunlight of heaven, and will continue thus, believing that out of the confused and trying conditions of the present will come a time that will permanently gladden the spirits of those who are honestly laboring to evolve better conditions. As we write we hear the booming of cannon from the different towns around us in their celebration of the glorious Fourth, giving thanks for the great liberty they are enjoying. (?) At present we are having fresh vegetables from the garden. It makes us forget the labor necessary for their production, when we witness the pleasure of those who share these benefits, and as the natural is but the material reflection of the spiritual and eternal; so when that labor and anxiety needed to develop the fruits of the spirit has passed into the realm of f orgetfulness, nothing but the joy and satisfaction in their possession will remain. By legislative enactment our town has been divided and the old and historic name of Watervliet has been changed to Colonie. During the last week of June we enjoyed a visit from Sisters Catherine Allen, Agnes Lee, Sarah F. Bodine, May Rulhausen of the North family, Mt. Lebanon. They brought with them that precious treasure appreciated by every one who is THE MANIFESTO. 187 seeking the higher life; garnering the fruits of the spirit through obedience to the teachings of the divine life. On the 11th inst. Sisters Isabell White and Louie Bussell from our North family at this place left home for a visit to Mt. Lebanon. We feel like exclaiming, 'O how swiftly time is passing!' and may it be improved to our spiritual benefit! It seems but yesterday when the gladsome sound of 'Happy New Year'' was ringing far and near, and we have already passed the meridian of the year. We hope it has brought pure enjoyment and solid comfort to every faithful Zion traveler and may the protecting care of the Divine Fatherhood and Motherhood rest upon all faithful ones who are laboring to uplift humanity from those conditions that deprave, into the presence and light of the truth, is the humble prayer of your brother in the cause.
