Shakers, N. Y. Feb. 1898. Fkom the window of our room where we are domiciled penning these Notes, we can look out upon the garden plat where in a few weeks we shall be engaged preparing the ground for the reception of seed with the hope that it will bring fortl many fold of the good things of life in the shape of fruits and vegetables. At present it is a wilderness of snow and ice, and our picture is in the anticipation of an ideal to which we are looking forward for fulfillment. If it was not for this persistent urging to gain possesion of that which at present we do not have, whether in the spiritual or material phases of life, the main stimulus to exertion would be gone and the energy at present displayed would be fossilized in that of an autonomon which is dependent upon power foreign from itself to move it to action. While perusing the last editorial upon the advancement made in dietetic reform in our Communities we were made assured that the world does move and no intelligent person would wish to go back to the (good?) old times of hard cider on the dining table, or the social smoke. 'Physician heal thyself,' could with propriety be said to the advocate of abstinence front strong drink who was suffused with the fumes of tobacco smoke or chewing the filthy weed. That such habits have a derogatory influence upon the physical, intellectual and spiritual organization of the user is well known. To what extent is determined by the resisting power inherent in the individual constitution. We rejoice in the advancement that has been made, with an earnest hope that the good work will go on to still greater perfection. Hamilton DeGraw.
