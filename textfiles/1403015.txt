PATIENCE. REBECCA SHEPHARD. 'In your patience possess ye your souls. ' These were the words spoken by our great Exampler, and how needful it is to grow and cultivate this beautiful virtue. That we may more faithfully practice it, in our daily life, is our most earnest desire; that thereby we may be enabled to bear all things for Christ's sake and the gospel's. In order to do this, we must ever remember, there is a never-failing Fount from which the needy soul may draw with the full assurance of aid. ''He that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out. ' Again, ' Ask and ye shall receive. ' All of these sayings were spoken to the disciples of Jesus, while He was yet with them; but no less for the guidance and comfort of the needy in the present day. Then shall we not strive to 'Let patience have her perfect work. ' Very much of the Christian character, we find embodied in this one gospel grace. We have often queried whether one is entitled to the name of Christian when allowing the spirit of impatience to govern, or find a resting place in the heart. Beautiful indeed are those lives, wherein the gospel grace of gospel patience is fully exemplified. Canterbury, N. H.
