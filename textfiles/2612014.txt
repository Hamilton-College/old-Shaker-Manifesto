Sabbathday Lake, Me. Nov. 1896. November is here with its rains and winds. Already the trees are stripped of their leaves, showing to the careful observer that they are preparing for the oncoming winter. THE MANIFESTO. 197 While we look over the past preparatory for our annual Thanksgiving we will thank God for the dear ones in our own loved home circle. Dear aged fathers and mothers who have toiled through the heat of the day! Faithful middle aged ones who now are bearing the burdens of life, and loving youth and children that our homes are blest with to-day. All these make up the hundred-fold relation that is promised as the heritage of God's people. We find none to spare, yet Br. Samuel Kendrick and Sr. Lydia Mariner are both sick and nearly helpless and we can not expect their tarry with us will be much longer. They have every care from loving Sisters and Brothers and they well deserve it. Sr. Aurelia Mace has recently returned from a visit to Alfred where she stayed a week. We hear that all were blessed by her visit and she in return, received blessing. We forcibly realized our loss while she was absent. On her return, Elder Henry Green accompanied her to our 'home for a visit. He tarried but a few days, then returned to his people, leaving with us his good and pure influence. The heating apparatus at our Greenhouse is undergoing repairs. We are having a hot water heater of home manufacture put in and hope it will prove satisfactory. Ada S. Cummings.
