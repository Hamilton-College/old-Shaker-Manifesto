It is all-important... 'It is all-important that you speak the truth when you do speak, but the fact that it is the truth which you speak is not the only important factor in your speaking. You must speak the truth in love, in love of the truth, and in love of the person to whom you speak, for unless you are loving and speak lovingly, you may have less power for good than one who speaks in that spirit without speaking the truth. The truth itself suffers in contrast with love-mixed error when the element of love is lacking in the declaration of truth.' ï¿½Selected.
