The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinri. More than a century has already passed since the witnesses of this gospel testimony received the revelation of the word of God. It became an inspirational fire in their souls, and carried them into an element so far above that which was earthly and sensual that they freely consecrated their lives to the gospel cause. In this, they were able, more effectually to become the servants of the living God. It was not a new order of life to be a witness of the truth; the world has been favored with this class from the days of ' righteous Abel,' and the spirit that leads men to recognize the humaDity of man, has gradually won a permanent place in the race. Judges, prophets and apostles have all been active workers to establish the religious element among men and to make their lives one of practical righteousness. It was a work that came as gradually as the rising of the morning sun,1 and like that beautiful gift from the hand of God, its light and warmth gave hope and courage to those who were watching and praying for a full deliverance from the entanglements of a worldly life. Many have desired to see the day that would bring to them the gift of salvation, and the power of the holy Spirit, which would enable them to walk in the testimony of Christ Jesus. The publishing of God's word, from the first message, has awakened the spirit of persecution, and these witnesses of this last great work were destined, as those before them, to walk in the midst of deep sorrow. Jesus was a witness of God, in advance of either Moses or John the Baptist and taught a more beautiful ideal of Deity; and a far more consistent form of duty for man to exercise toward man. The inspiration of th's wonderful gift of God that had illumined the mind of Jesus was signally revived in the life of Ann Lee, and by her it was denominated a revelation from our Heavenly Father. Like every religious dispensation that had been revealed, it had to encounter much cruel opposition. The self-denial which was demanded of the order, separated them from the world and the legitimate result of this act was, as has been testified by Jesus,�'Ye are not of the world, therefore the world hateth you.' Ann Lee and the Elders experienced this fact, as the record of their gospel travel so vividly represents. Ann Lee was born in Manchester, England, Feb. 29, 1736.f In 1758 she accepted the testimony of James and Jane Wardley, who wrere the leaders of a small society, and preached an honest confession of their sins, and bore a full cross against all that they knew to be wrong. In 1770 Ann Lee was cast into prison by the dominant English church members with the hope of suppressing the testimony which she held before the world. In this prison she received a deeper revelation of the divine Presence, fThe incidents of her early life may be found in a work entitled, ' The Millennial Church.' Price 00 cts., or in the ' Life of Ann Lee.' Price 10 cts. and on returning to her Society, she made known to them the revelation she had received, and was accepted as their spiritual leader, and Mother in Christ; and from this time she was known to them as Mother Ann Lee. On the 19th. of May, 1774, Mother Ann with eight others of correspondingfaith, left England, and after a stormy and dangerous passage of two months and seventeen days, reached the city of New York. In 177G this little company moved into the wilderness of Watervliet, seven miles from the city of Albany, and formed a settlement. They toiled diligently, in this new home, making improvements in their dwellings and lands, and in providing a comfortable subsistence for themselves and their friends. In this work they received encouragement from Mother Ann, that, 'God is about to raise up a people, here, in America, who will serve Him and honor the gospel.' The new converts expected from day to day, to see the fulfillment of this prophecy, but as it delayed its coming from month to month, they grew weary of waiting and became more or less discouraged. Mother Ann, above all others, maintained her confidence in the promises of God, and spoke words of patience and courage to the little family, for, said she, 'The appointed time will come, and that time draws nigh. God has not sent us into this land, in vain. Our mission is to preach the gospel of Christ.' Mother Ann now recommended the Brethren to add largely to their store of provisions, which called forth this enquiry, ' What is to be done with all this, seeing we are so retired from the world, and have so small prospect of any company to consume it?' This manifestation of a reasonable doubt was soon expelled by Mother Ann, who replied, ' We shall have a great deal of company, before the close of another year. I see large numbers of people coming, and they will accept and obey the gospel. ' The summer passed on without any special change in the family of Believers. Visions and revelations were the only comforting assurances that they now received of the promised revival. The severity of a northern winter settled down upon them and they could not expect, at this inclement season of the year to be able to do much moi-e than to provide themselves with security against the pitiless storms that were sure to visit them. From time to time they were encouraged to wait with patience, as Mother Ann said to them,�' I certainly know the time of gathering will come, and it is near at hand. ' This anxiety manifested by the Believers, was by no means, peculiar to them. Many of those who watch and pray are liable to faint if hope is long deferred. This same anxiety filled the minds of the disciples as Jesus spoke to them of the wonderful things that would take place in the city of Jerusalem. 'Tell us,' said they, 'when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign of their coming, and of the end of the world ? ' In one of the hours of anxiety and suffering which Mother Ann seemed destined to share, she cried out in her anguish as she stood by the creek, that ran by the side of their dwelling. ' O that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air and all things that have life and breath, yea all the trees of the forest and grass of the fields would pray to God for me. ' These words were accompanied with tears and heart felt agony, and all who were present shared in the same gift. Those who came to America with Mother Ann, expected that the gospel testimony would soon be preached and then accepted by the people of this country. But after waiting several years, without the addition of one individual to the faith, they were brought under trials and doubts. Mother Ann's confidence in God, was unshaken and she would often encourage the others to be patient, and wait till the appointed time. She would say, ' O my dear children ! hold fast and be not discouraged. God has not sent us to this land in vain, but he has sent us to bring the gospel of Christ to this nation, and many will embrace it, for the time draws nigh. ' The winter of 1779, however, passed away, with only a very faint ray of hope but with the coming of Spring, came new life. They soon learned that the spirit of a religious revival had accomplished a wonderful work in several or the towns near the Believers, and the people now began to come in large companies to visit the little family in the woods of Watervliet, to hear the gospel preached and to learn what they should do to be saved.
