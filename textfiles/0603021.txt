SPEAK NO ILL ' Nay, speak no ill, a kindly word Can never leave a sting behind; And oh, to breathe each tale we've heard, 'Tis far beneath a noble mind. Full oft, a better seed is sown By choosing thus the better plan! For if but little good is known, Still let us speak the best we can. ' Give me the heart that fain would hide — Would fain another's faults efface; How can it profit human pride To prove humanity but base ? Nay, let us reach a higher mood — A nobler estimate of man — Be earnest in the search for good, And speak of all the best we can. 'Then speak no ill, but lenient be To others' failings, as our own ; If you're the first a fault to see Be not the first to make it known; For life is but a passing day No lip can tell how brief its span; Then oh, the little time we stay Let's speak of all the best we can.' Kind Editor: Will you please insert this poem in The Shaker? I think very much of it, and wish it a wider application. Your sister, Samantha Bowie
