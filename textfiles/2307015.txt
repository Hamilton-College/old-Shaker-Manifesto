Beloved Elder Henry:--The class who were gathered... Shirley, Mass., May 30, 1893. Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½The class who were gathered by the first Believers, those who saw Mother Ann and her companions, and united together under the power of her testimony, are fast passing away. Sister Paulina Pearsons who recently left us for the Summer Land, was one who received a deep planting of faith in that testimony. The gospel was to her a living spring of eternal life. She was a pure, devoted Sister, always looking on the bright side. Discouragement never blocked her way, neither did storms impede her onward course. Her memory will always be fragrant with love and peace, and tender gospel ties. She was a great reader and distributor of our Monthly. 'I want,' said she, 'that Elder Henry should receive my love, thanks and blessing for his labors in keeping alive our ever welcome messenger. It has soothed for me many hours of retirement and brought bread of life to my soul.' May God bless the Editor, and all who keep afloat before the breezes of union, love and wisdom, our little craft, The Manifesto, is the desire of all your friends at Shirley and especially Your Sister, Joanna Randall.
