To the Memory of our Sister, Caroline Downs. By Abbie F. Bartlett. There's a bright, bright star, In the heavens above, That alone is shining for you, Beyond is a pearly harvest, A harvest for the good and true. Oh faithful Mother in Zion, That star is your beautiful life, Adherence to truth and to principles pure, Un-wavering ever in strife. So firm thy purpose to walk in the right, ISTo weakness nor turning is there; I know thy victories oft have been gained, Through deep tribulation and prayer. And even at the first, opposition we meet, In the path our Savior trod; And the fiercest strife in our earthly life, Is met on our way toward God. Oh beautiful spirit, thou hast shown to us What a Mother's love cun do; [There,' We need not wait till we meet 'Over The Christian life to pursue. Thou hast strewn thy blessings everywhere, They have sunk in the hearts you love; May it guide and cheer their youthful lives Till you meet in the home above. Oh sweet affection that rests with us, Though our lives be long or brief; [home, At last the death Angel has gathered thee As a ripe and golden sheaf. Farewell dear one to your angel hone, Where nothing can blight or mar; But leave Oh Mother, just leave for us, 'The Beautiful Gates Ajar.' Shakers, N. Y.
