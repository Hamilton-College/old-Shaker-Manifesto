THE WAY TO HANDLE SHEEP A great many men will catch the sheep by the wool on the back with both hands, and lift the animal clear from the ground by the wool only. We have slaughtered a great many sheep in years past, and when removing the pelts of such sheep 'as had been handled by the wool, we never failed to observe that beneath the skin wherever the animal had been caught by the wool, blood had settled. In many instances the skin had been separated from the body so that inflammation was apparent. We have known proprietors of sheep to be so strict in regard to handling them, that they would order a helper from the premises, if he were to catch a sheep by the wool or any part of the body. When about to catch a sheep, move carefully towards the one to be taken until you are sufficiently near to spring quickly and seize the beast with both hands, then pass one hand around the body, grasp the brisket, and lift the sheep clear from the ground. The wool must not be pulled. If the sheep is a heavy one, let one hand and wrist be put around the neck and the arm pressed against the leg. We have always handled sheep in the way alluded to. We never grasp the wool. Others seize the sheep by a hind leg, then throw one arm around the body and take hold of the brisket with one hand. But ewes with lambs should never be caught by the hind legs, unless they are handled with extreme care.â€” Ihe Farm, Dublin, Ireland.
