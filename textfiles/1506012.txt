HE IS THY BROTHER YET What though his erring feet Have stumbled in the way, And in a thoughtless hour He has been led astray; The great Creator's seal Upon his brow is set, And fallen though he be, He is thy brother yet. Look with a tender eye Upon that clouded brow, And win him, if you can, To paths of virtue now; But, O ! forbear to bend Thy cold and distant gaze Upon thy early friend, The loved of other days. Will not the happy hours That blest your younger years, When he was by your side In mirthfulness and tears,- - Will not the thought of these Within thy heart beget A sad, yet sweet response, He is thy brother yet? And when in later life, Where science holds her sway, You traveled hand in hand The devious winding way, Until hidden mines of Rich mysterious lore Had paid you for the ease You bartered to explore. Behold the path of fame That opens to your view, And tremble when you tread Its giddy mazes too ; And if you do not ask, Some higher power to guide Your ever varying barque As on the storm you ride. That proud majestic step, And lofty soul of thine, May all be made to bow To dark misfortunes shrine; And then, when trials come, You never will regret You owned the wayward one To be thy brother yet.
