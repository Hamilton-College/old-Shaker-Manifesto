COMMUNION. Fred. I. Stebbins. [WRITTEN FOR THE MANIFESTO.] How sweet the thought, So oft before expressed, That though we're far From those we love the best; There is a bond, By blest communion wrought. That brings us joy And sweet consoling thought. When far apart. Our bodies take their way, Our spirits fain With kindred souls would stay. And when away, 'Mid scenes though new and strange, The true heart turns To fields it once did range, And meeting there, Congenial spirits blend, Receive and give The blessings of a friend ; Joy and rejoice That soul can come to soul, Harmonious blend, And purest bliss control; The while the sweet Pure ministry of love Baptizes each With glory from above ! Hail! blessed boon, To seeking mortals given Communion sweet. Hail, Harbinger of Heaven ! ï¿½North East Pa.
