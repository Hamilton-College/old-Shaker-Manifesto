HISTORY OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. N0 3. Condition of the Church. The year 1791 was one of marked interest in the history of the Church. The Brethren and Sisters were deeply interested in the prosperity of their gospel home and made a willing sacrifice of their time and strength for the general good. They worked with au assurance that they were laying a foundation that would endure for ages. The different branches of domestic business became better established, and were managed more in harmony with the general wishes of Society. The Brethren not only built two dwelling houses in New Lebanon, but they sent members from the church to assist in the building of a dwelling at Hancock and a Meeting House in each of the Societies of Watervliet, N. Y., Harvard, Mass., and Enfield, Conn. The spiritual prosperity of the Church was, during this time, in active operation and Church Order was the watch-word in all things. 1791. This was a memorable year as the Church was fully established in the permanency of order, government, and general management. The principles upon which the Church was founded, were agreeably to the life and testimony of Jesus Christ. These may never be excelled by any other church, as this was one of consecration ;�the Lord's house. Those who entered were expected to dedicate soul and body to the service of God and his people. Although the office of Trustees had been partially established, Elder David Meacham was now appointed to the office of senior Trustee, and was the director of all business transactions which took place between the Believers and those not of the Society. An order was also established bearing the name of Family Deacons which was expected to have the oversight of the temporal affairs of the family. The several orders of the Church as now appointed for the protection and prosperity of the Community are as follows,� The Ministry�Elders�Trustees and Family Deacons. After this arrangement every ord?r was expected to manage their own business affairs, and to maintain a good union with the others and be responsible, in all their transactions, to their superiors. The Ministry now withdrew from the management of all temporal duties, to attend more directly to that which was spiritual, while the Elders took the immediate oversight of the family. Some bye-laws or orders had been established at an earlier date, but none had beeu committed to writing. These orders were founded on necessity and indispensable to the protection and harmony of every family of Believers. Their object was to enjoin what was right and to forbid what was wrong. In the experience and growth of the Church these orders were liable to be changed or modified to meet the necessities of the day. Already the people had learned that 'Order is heaven's first law,' and without a system of order there could be no permauent protection to the Believers. As an illustration of the rules given we append the following :� No one shall buy nor sell in the Church, nor trade with those not of the Church, except by the union of the Trustees. No one shall hold private property. A selfish, private union should not be maintained, nor a private correspondence held with any person in or out of the Society. These orders were aids in the securing of equal rights, according to several needs, and well calculated to promote a practical righteousness. The Society at Watervliet, N. Y., after the decease of Father James was included in the same Bishopric with New Lebanon, as the organizing of the Community in that place was effected at the same date. Elder John Hocknell who resided at Watervliet was very helpful in assisting the people to enter into the Community relation and to establish the order of the Church. So soon as it could be made consistent with other duties, the Ministry of New Lebanon delegated from the parent Society, Timothy Hubbard and Anna Mathewson lo be the senior Elders of the Church of Watervliet. Aaron Wood and Sarah Bennett were appointed as their associates. 1793. The estate of the Society, although limited, had up to this date been quite sufficient for the Community, but it was now considered best to purchase still more, and several farms were added to the consecrated inheritance, and dedicated to God and his people, so that no one called aught his own, of all he possessed. Neither was any one in debt or bondage to those not members of the Society. They were now much belter prepared for the inward work of the gospel, and able to briug forth the fruits of their faith in righteousness, peace and order, undisturbed by those without. They had already become permanently testablished as a religious and spiritual order of Brethren and Sinters, and disciples of our Lord, Jesus Christ. After the organizing of the Society the Believers remained very quietly in their home, and industriously working for the increase of the temporal and spiritual interests of the Community. Even the Trustees were very careful of the relations which they held with those not of the Society. In their manners, however, they studied to be kind and respectful, and in their business relations, honest aud above reproach. Those who had been chosen as the spiritual leaders, were rigidly cautious in all their deportment, that they might maintain a gift of God in their respecttive callings. The same care w_is manifested in their general manners, iu walk- ing, iu keeping step, and even in the quality of their manufacture. All this was kindly impressed upon the minds of the whole Community by example as well as by precept. So thoroughly was this careful spirit accepted by the whole body of Believers, that it dispelled much of the crudeness, the vanity and the self-love from the mind. The Church was now fully established as to its external organization, yet it was but the beginning of the real inward work of redemption, a mere start ing-point, from which there must be a progress through many degrees of spiritual travel. As saith the Apostle, first that which is natural and outward : then that which is spiritual and inward. Up to this date one important point of gospel order, which was indispensable to the true relation of the Church had not been perfected. It had existed only iu the kind and friendly relations which the gospel of Christ had so far revealed. As its office was more directly felt in the work of spirituality, it required more time for its full completion. The faith of the Believers had shown to them that the disorderly union of men and women had been the sin of the world, and to avoid this dangerous point they must set a double guard, in carefulness and watchfulness, against this besetting sin of the race. As the burdens of the Community increased, it was found necessary for the Brethren and Sisters, in their management of the general business, to confer with each other as to the means and methods that should be used. Every order that had been established soon saw the necessity of this new demand, and meetings were appointed every other day or oftener if necessary. Ihis union of the officers, in the order of the Church, gave the Sisters an equal privilege with their Brethren, in consultation, and in the management of all their business relations. It was soon ascertained that it was promotive of protection, and contributed to the peace and comfort of the family. This system of union meetings was soon universally adopted. OF THE WORSHIP. Previous to the building of the house of worship at New Lebanon, the Believers had no regular manner of holding their meetings. They were scattered in various little families and spent their hour of worship iu their o\xu houses. Sometimes several families would meet at a designated place, where the residence would afford more room, and at the same time be the home of a Minister or Elder who could direct the order of service. All who could, however, depended upon making a visit to Watervliet, as at that place, they would meet Mother Ann and the Elders, and be privileged to attend meeting with them, and be profited by the ministration of their spiritual gifts. These first Believers manifested great zeal in their efforts to live a religious life. Many men and women would perform the journey from New Lebanon and adjacent towns, to the Society at !Watervliet on dark, stormy days and nights, leaving their comfortable homes, and their pleasant surroundings, to enjoy a short season of spiritual communion with their gospel friends. At this date no fixed form was used for the opening of the religious service. The people would assemble in the house, and after sitting a few minutes in silence, would on a given signal prepare for worship. Usually the service began by the singing of a solemn song, or by the speaking of one of the Elders. This season of devotion was often attended with diverse spiritual gifts, of signs, of tongues, shaking and turning. At other times it took the form of prayer, exhortation and a searching testimony against all evil, or it would be a manifestation of thankfulness, of love, of simplicity or repentance. The prevailing theme, in all these gifts was the crucifixion of pride and of self-love. (TO BE CONTINUED.)
