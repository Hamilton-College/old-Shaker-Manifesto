NOTES Who shall decide when the lawyers and ministers disagree? and who' will care to decide when they hold their lengthy disputations on subjects that have but a trifle of influence upon the present happiness or prosperity of mankind. It is not a new thing for people to leave that which is very needful in life, and busy themselves about questions that are foreign to their present duty. Many a life has been in deep anxiety about Adam and his management in the garden of Eden, to the utter neglect of their own personal discipline or of the protection which should have been thrown around others. Matters in religious history have for a long time been a source of vexation as it is so di 111 cult to fix an exact date, or to bring the several points in history to harmonize. But as the earth receives light and these varied subjects pass under discussion, then the people will think. The people will think. Why not? They are urged to read, read, read. Thousauds of books, pamphlets and papers are constantly being spread out before them. The land is swarming with speakers Avho are alive on every subject that can tingle or tickle the ears, and as a natural consequence some few among the thousands will stop and think, and reason, and determine what may be for the best. But it is said to be ' an age of skepticism ' and the common mind must be guarded, so that oven the day of the Crucifixion must be established beyond a doubt, as one writer tells us that it 'is an important question and involves the harmony and integrity of the Gospels.' How wise it is that some one can tell usall about these things so that we may find a harmony while reading the Bible. If a knowledge of the day and the hour when that remarkable event took place would induce even the religious teachers to ' beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks, ' it might become a matter of universal interest. It may do no harm to know the exact time of all those biblical incidents which bear the date of the first century, if luckily they can be ascertained, but it is of far more consequence to ï¿½' live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. ' The harmony of the Gospels must have a very loose attachment for each other if their worth in the mission of'righteousness and brotherly love depends upon so slim a foundation as a historical date. The word of God that is written in the hearts of his people has a living influence for good, and this is pei-manently established, and we have only to prove our willingness to accept it. Jesus might as well have attempted to establish the day that Adam left Eden, as essential to the harmony of the books of the Old Testament and this would have been as imperative as that the day of the crucifixion should be established that the people might believe that Matthew and Mark were genuine records of the Primitive Church. The writings of one of'the judges of the Supreme Court of the IT. S. should be pretty good authority for the historical evidence which he brings forward to establish his point on this subject, but Judge Bradley has found his wisdom wanting in that he is called in question for his statement. He says that Jesus was cru- cified on the fifteenth clay of the Jewish month. That the day was supposed to be Friday, but there is a possibility that it may have been Thursday. Friday, however, is the day generally accepted and ' that is the almost universal understanding of Christendom. ' It is interesting, at this late date, to be assured of the ignorance of the Christian world during some two thousand years, in which time they have had no satisfactory harmony of the New Testament books. 'This inharmony has made many skeptics and some of the best modern critics have been led to reject the Gospel of John.' Now a writer comes forward to make all the crooked places straight, to. turn the feet of the Judge into the one safe way. The Romish Church as well as the Protestant is- also in error and must be set aside, but the Greek church of 7G,000,000 souls who say that the crucifixion took place on Thursday, is right. To have been crucified on Friday, the writer says, makes even the evangelists at variance with each other, but crucified on Thursday and on the fourteenth day of the month, makes everything perfectly correct, referring to his time of lying in the tomb. 'Crucifie:! on the fourteenth day in which the paschal lamb was killed and in which as the great Antitype, our Passover makes him to have lain three nights. Thursday night, Friday night and Saturday night in the grave, and all day Friday and Saturday and a part of Sunday, and consequently to have risen on the third day. ' Of course this must be very important information and particularly essential, 'in this age of skepticism,' when the exact day of the ciucifixion must be understood in order to have a harmony of the four Gospels. Matthew tells us in chapter twelve, fortieth verse, that Jesus said he should 'be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth ; ' but from Thursday night to Saturday morning hardly makes three days. If, however, it is proved, and we must believe that it is, that he was crucified on the fourteenth day of the month, other little discrepancies need do no harm. This matter settled we may now find some other thing of equal interest.
