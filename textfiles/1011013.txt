FOREIGN MISSIONS AND HOME NECESSITIES It is a very strange fact, but fact it is, that Foreign Missions are very much more popular than the relief of local sufferings. It is a positive shame to think, that such were the abominable inconsistencies of the professional Christians in a popular church in New York city, that they actually subscribed on a recent Sunday $16,000 for foreign heathens, while in the four weeks previous, a charitable association in the same neighborhood had application from 5,986 families for relief from the pangs of starvation; while a visiting committee in the Sixth Ward found thirteen hundred persons without shoes! It was just such inconsistencies which caused England's poet, Elliott, to write: ' Their Bibles for the heathen load our fleets; Lo! gloating eastward, they inquire, 'What news? ' We die,' we answer,' foodless in the streets.' And what reply your men of Gospel views? Oh! ' they're sending bacon to the Jews.' Their lofty souls have telescopic eyes, Which see the smallest speck of distant pain, While at their feet a world of agonies, Unseen, unheard, unheeded, writhes in vain.'
