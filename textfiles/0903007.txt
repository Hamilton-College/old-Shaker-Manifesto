LEX TALIONIS OLIVER PRENTISS The Lex Talionis of Moses : ' Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,' etc. Exodus 21, 24, and Leviticus 24: 20. Of Solomon: 'Heap coals of fire on his head.' Proverbs 25: 21, 22. Of Jesus : 'Turn the other cheek.' Matthew 5: 39, and Luke 6: 29. Some difference in the codes, corresponding with difference in material of which human society has been, is and is to be constructed. The Code Moses was for raw material, preliminary to the formation of a social structure. The Code Solomon came when that social structure was at its zenith, its culminating point. The Code Jesus was, and to some extent still is, propheticâ€”prophetic of Community, wherein all passions and appetites are held in strict subordination to our highest perceptions of the purity of the Angels of God, in the more advanced Heavens.
