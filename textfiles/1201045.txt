Some travelers in South America... Some travelers in South America, in traveling an arid and desolate tract of country, were struck with a strange contrast. On one side there was a barren desert, on the other a rich and luxuriant vegetation. The French consul at Loreto, Mexico, says that this remarkable contrast is due to the presence of the Tamai caspi, or the rain tree. This tree grows to the height of sixty feet with a diameter of three feet at its base, and possesses the power of strongly attracting, absorbing and condensing the humidity of the atmosphere. Water is always to be seen dripping form its trunk in such quantity as to convert the surrounding soil into a veritable marsh. It is in the summer especially, when the rivers are nearly dried up, that the tree is most active. If this admirable quality of the rain tree were utilized in the arid regions near the equator, the people there, living in misery on account of the unproductive soil, would derive great advantages from its introduction, as well of the people of more favored countries where the climate is dry and drouths frequent.
