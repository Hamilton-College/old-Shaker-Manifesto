IT MAY BE YOUR TURN NEXT. Judge not too harshly, oh, my friend I Of him your fellow man, But draw the veil of charity About him if you can. He once was called an honest man, Before some trial vexed - He stepped from out the narrow way - It may be your turn next. Fainting- upon the great highway A suffering soul doth lie ; Go staunch his wounds and quench his thirst, Nor pass him idly by. God will not brook the swift excuse, The thoughtless vain pretext, A fellow-mortal bites the dust- It may be your turn next. You heard, one day, a single word Against a person's name; Oh, bear it not from door to door 'I'o further hurt his fame. If you're the. man you claim to be, Remember then, the text, '1'0 ' Speak no evil,' true or false It may be your turn next. The world is bad enough, we own, And may need still more light; Yet, with true love to all, may be Help in the cause of Hight'. Lift up the sinful and the weak, The soul by care perplexed, Well knowing that to drink the gall, It may be your turn next,
