ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF CHRISTIANITY. In a sermon recently preached by Canon Farrar, he said: 'Blessed is the church which takes hold of the new as well as the old. * * * * An unprogressive church is a dying church, and a retrograding church is a dead church. The slumber of an unquestioning acquiescence is dropping buckets in an empty well. God is leading us upward and onward. He does not expect us to stand still and be bound within fixed limits. In every good and progressive church there must be freedom. There are systems, as we see, which God shakes to the ground in the earthquakes of history, because these systems are means, not the ends. They are the shadows which men take for the substance, and hold on to them with bigoted zeal when they should be allowed to give way for the progressive systems in which the real things are not changed at all. * * * * When doubt is sincere, as it very often is, then Christians should sympathize ; but when the trouble is in the moral nature, the doubts are hypocritical. * * * * Quench the life of God in the soul and soon no star of faith will gleam upon its cheerless midnight. But what shall we say to those who doubt in sincerity? There are many of them. How shall we guide these lost mariners to the true course? First, let them begin with what they know to be true. What are their doubts? About church organizations, about forms, about popular opinions, about miracles, about the sun's standing still for Joshua? Well, what oi them. If you cannot believe them, let them go. They are not essentials. To believe them will not make one wiser or better. ' These ideas were beautifully enlarged upon by the archdeacon, who, in conclusion, declared that no one is bound by dogmas or creeds, that sects are an abomination, and that the man who believed in and practiced the precepts of the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, and the Golden Rule, had a foundation upon which he could stand and defy all sects and all doubts.
