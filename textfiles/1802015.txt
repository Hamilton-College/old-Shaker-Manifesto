FORGIVENESS. Nancy G. Danforth. What is forgiveness? The Master has said, ' If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Heavenly Father forgive your trespasses.' Then how important it becomes that we understand the full import of the expression, 'I forgive you.' Do we forgive when by word or thought we can refer to past grievances? Nay. The bitterness still remains to poison the life, and may at any time break out in cruel animosity. It is by prayer and humiliation of soul that we are enabled to take the offender by the hand and say, 'My brotherï¿½my sister, I forgive you, even as I hope to be forgiven of my God. Though you may have deeply wronged me, may have wounded my very soul, yet it shall henceforth be as though it had never occurred. I will never more refer to it by way of trial in word or thought.' It may be hard to attain this feeling even toward one who a#ks to be forgiven ; then how much harder toward one who does not relent but still pursues the wroiifi course. Yet this is the Christian standard to which we aspire ; else we cannot rightfully claim to be the true followers of Christ the Pattern, who in the midst of keenestjsuffering could, in accents of love and tender pity, pray for his persecutors, 'Father, forgive them,' and add as by way of excuse, 'they know not what they do.' This is the true spirit we are to strive for and daily cultivate in our souls. This is the spirit and temper of heaven ; without it we can never find perfect or permanent peace and rest. With it how pleasantly the days come and go ; while the angels smile and the very heavens bend with blessing. Would that the whole earth and all its inhabitants were filled and clothed with this beautiful spirit of forgiveness. Canterbury, N. H.
