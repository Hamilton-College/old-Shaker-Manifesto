Mother Hannah Kendall of Harvard, Mass., was a beautiful minister... Mother Hannah Kendall of Harvard, Mass., was a beautiful minister of the word of God. The spirit of her ministration may be seen in the following : Do to others as you would wish others to do to you, and always speak the truth. Keep your consciences void of offence toward God and each other. Purge your souls from all sin, and be careful to state every thing in its true light. Govern the tongue for it is an unruly member. Labor to know the will of God and do it in all things. Strive to forgive and forget supposed injuries, aud put away all hard feelings that may have arisen. Be kind and condescending to each other, for this is the requirement of the gospel. If you are faithful you will be able to help others, as you have been helped. Where much has been given, much will be required. Seth Blanchard.
