Shakers, N. Y. June, 1898. Theke has been evolved from out of the struggle between ths cold of spring and summer's warmth a royal diadem of THE MANIFESTO. 109 roses. Lovely June is now triumphantly enthroned as the leader and director of the forces which will, when the shades of autumn deepen, bring to us the consummation of garners well supplied, we hope, with the products which a bountiful season has placed at our disposal. The diary notes from the travels of the early missionaries who visited the West in the early years of the century are interesting. They went forward with their life in their hands, ready to lay it down at the call of duty. Of such souls are constituted the hero martyrs who by their example have made it honorable to be counted with those who are willing to suffer for the truth. Those who were receivers of that divine light, as well as the mediums through which it was given, know that its promulgation was fraught with dangers that the ordinary mortal would not have braved unless inspired by a zeal and consecration that could make the words of the divine Teacher applicable: 1 ''Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.' We have realized of late more than usual the conscious presence of those dear friends who have past beyond the limits of the shadows that to a greater or less extent enshroud our earth life. In our seasons of devotion they have especially manifested their presence to admonish and to comfort those who yet have the battle of life to fight. Hamilton DeGraw.
