IF WE HAD THOUGHT If we'd thought at our last meeting With the friend we love so dear By his grave we'd soon be standing, Dropping down the silent tear, Would that word we spoke so lightly Have been uttered by us then? Would that in our silent sorrow We could call it back again. If we'd thought that soon a parting Would us sever far and wide, That some of the gladsome faces Would be soon across the tide, Would the hasty word and action, Would the satire sharp and keen From our lips have ever fallen, Or the action e'er been seen? If we'd thought the friendly counsel Was the last we e'er should hear, Would we then have scoffed so lightlyLet our heedlessness appear? If we'd thought the kind inquiry Soon would cease for evermore, Would it then have been a trouble. Would we then have wished it o'er? If we'd thought that act of kindness Was the last our friend should seek, Would we have by cruel harshness Brought the blushes to his cheek? If we,'d thought our heedless folly Would have left so deep a sore, Would we then have spoken rudely? Would we not have hushed it o'er? If we'd thought—alas ! the sorrows That the words awaken now; If we'd thought, ah, then the wrinkles Would be fewer on the brow ; If we'd thought that death was comingWill that be our latest cry? God forbid! we know he's coming, Let us think—he draweth nigh. Evangelical Messenger.
