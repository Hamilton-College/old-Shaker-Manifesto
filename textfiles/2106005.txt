SIMPLICITY. Catherine Allen. Simplicity is the companion of truthfulness; it is undesigning, free from all cunning and intrigue ; is manifest in plainness of dress and of language ;ï¿½in unassuming manners and straightforwardness of bearing. From pride and all unhallowed ambitions it dwells apart, abiding only in the heart made free from enmity and vain imaginations. To possess it, is to have an 'eye single to the glory of God,' when the whole being will be filled with light, all free from clouds of apprehensiveness as to what the appearance of motives shall be to others, and of anxiety for personal attentions. To the conversation and general bearing, it gives directness without bluutness, modesty without subserviency, and under its liberating influence the deportment, free from egotism or a forbidding dignity will be nobly independent, sincere, and graced with that self-forgetfulness and abandon of manner which is in itself an attraction and charm. Simplicity opens its white blossoms in the soul where integrity abides, and sends forth its sweet odors like the beautiful wild flowers, all unconscious of its loveliness. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
