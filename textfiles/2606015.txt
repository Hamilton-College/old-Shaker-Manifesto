Narcoossa, Florida May 3, 1896. Ouk Friend The Manifesto;Sixty days without rain. Yesterday 1% in. of rain with hail. Eleven pines are in blossom. Trees by watering are in prime condition. The garden has taken on its summer rest. Cabbages, potatoes and beans remain to furnish our table. We have dug two wells into the quicksands about 9 ft. deep from surface, with cui'b ample to collect water. Br. Charles, who has been sick for the past week, is very much better. For two days and two nights he received heroic care and attention. Elder Louis Basting visited and worked with us in the garden and on the hammock for one week, visiting the Big Dredge south of us and other places of interest and improvement. If it were possible for him to stay with us we should have been thrice happy. His mission could be felt if not spoken to the ear. May those penetrating x-rays of every good testimony find the shutter over a broken heart ever open, that they may permeate and mold anew our thoughts and affections, and may we carefully close our heart to every selfish feeling and cruel thought lest the impression taken be too deep to erase.
