OUR PETITION ELMIRA HILLSGROVE O lead us to the fountain Whence living waters flow; Help us ascend the mountain, Or walk the valley low; Whatever be our portion, Wherever Thou dost guide, Divine and holy Spirit, O there may we abide. It may not be our measure, To find the burden light, It may not be thy pleasure To open to our sight The reason of thy dealings ; Yet give us trust, we pray, A heart that's undivided, A love for thy pure way. Not selfishly, we're asking The favor of thy care; Thine every gift of blessing, We would with others share ; And may the hours passing Be fraught with deeds of love, May truth our hearts be moulding, Till wholly raised above The elements of Sodom, Its false and fickle strife, To find in Thee a service, More worthy of our life. Canterbury, N. H.
