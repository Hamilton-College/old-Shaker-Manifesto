East Canterbury N. H. Aug. 13, 1896. What a fearful mortality this midsummer hot wave has created. Cities and villages and even the farmers' homes on the hills and mountains have all been invaded If it is the work of the planets, and some think it is, then it must be a celestial hot wave, and the force that sends it is quite beyond our control. The hay crop that has been secured is of good quality, and even in quantity has no disappointment. The corn for the silo promises to be an excellent crop.* Some of it has already a height of 12 feet and is still moving upward. We may now anticipate a limited crop of apples for the winter hut the prospect is not at all flattering. The sweet and favorite blueberries have been quite abundant and some twentj bushels have been gathered for winter use. Including all the heat that has been poured upon us, and the free use of green corn, green peas and green cucumbers, with an occasional dish of ice cream, it is a wonder to see how few have fallen victims to some of the ills in the long list for summer. Let us give thanks that our stomachs are so wonderfully, if not fearfully made. Henry C. Blinn.
