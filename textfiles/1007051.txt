GRAND THOUGHTS FROM CONTEMPORARIES. That every good was diminished... That every good was diminished in proportion as the evils of the war were multiplied no one can deny. That the immorality and brutality of the present... That the immorality and brutality of the present times are largely — we will not say wholly — the results of the war, no observing man, it seems to us, can deny. WE REAP AS WE SOW. Plant blessings, and blessings will bloom ; Plant hate, and hate will grow ; You can sow to-day — to-morrow shall bring The blossom, that proves what sort of a thing Is the seed, the seed that you sow. Unselfish and noble acts... Unselfish and noble acts are the most radiant epochs in the biography of souls. When wrought in earliest youth, they lie in the memory of age like the coral islands green and sunny, amid the melancholy waste of ocean. — Dr. Thomas. Are you doing any thing to publish... Are you doing any thing to publish and scatter Gospel tracts ? A tract which costs a penny may save a soul. And tracts can be multiplied by millions if means are fur nished to pay their trifling cost. Some can write tracts, others can publish them economically, others can pay for them ; others still can distribute them judiciously, and so all can be helpers in the work, and sharers in the blessing. To be a Christian is not... To be a Christian is not to believe that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or John the Book of Revelation ; it is to be a follower of Jesus Christ. The purely literary opinion respecting the authorship of an ancient book has no moral character ; but the judgment that appreciates and reveres a noble life and the j udgment that either disregards or disdains a noble life has a moral character. There is no better test of manhood than this : the appreciation of the nobility of divine manhood in another.— The Christian Union.
