To be a Christian is not... To be a Christian is not to believe that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or John the Book of Revelation ; it is to be a follower of Jesus Christ. The purely literary opinion respecting the authorship of an ancient book has no moral character ; but the judgment that appreciates and reveres a noble life and the j udgment that either disregards or disdains a noble life has a moral character. There is no better test of manhood than this : the appreciation of the nobility of divine manhood in another.â€” The Christian Union.
