I knit and sew and play when I am not in school. I am trying to be a good girl. I have learned to mark letters in linen since I have been here. It is very useful, because I can mark the children's clothes. I take music lessons every day with one of my little mates. Sister J. is our music teacher, and she has loaned me a book that tells all about music, and I am going to learn it through I go to school every day. I study music and read and write. I have six companion?. Please give my love to Sister M. A. please tell her I am going to be a good sister. Your little girl. L. Horton.-—Age, 10.
