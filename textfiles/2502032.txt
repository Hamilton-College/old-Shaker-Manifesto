GLORIOUS CROSS. By Lucy S. Bowers. Glorious cross of Christ! what power In thee lies, Virtue sought and treasui-ed through thee Never dies. Hights of truth's eternal glory Rise to view, [life's When by thy righteous power we strive Journey through. Ages that live but in story Tell of thee, Name thy name, but know not of thy Purity. Carved on palace walls and temples And still tombs, Carved to last perhaps for ages Through earth's glooms; But not in symbols dull and olden Art thou known, With the true cross is Christ's presence Fully shown. Shown, by working souls' salvation From all sin, Known, by giving through each trial Peace within. Talisman against all evilBlessed cross! Be my whole life's light, still leading From all loss. Leave thy mark upon my forehead There to shine; Firm control of thought and feeling Oh be mine. Set thy seal upon my spirit Through the light, And when fadest out the sunshine Keep the night. Oh I seek thee for thy power, not For a crown, Though with thee a blessing surely Cometh down, But for the good thou workest in me That my soul Loosed from its tetherings may attain Its perfect goal. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
