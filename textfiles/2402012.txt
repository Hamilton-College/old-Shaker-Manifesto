As the mission of The Manifesto, is to do good... As the mission of The Manifesto, is to do good, its message can be THE MANIFESTO. 39 no less than, 'Peace on earth, to men and women, good-will.' To accomplish this much to be desired work for suffering humanity, there seems to be abundant opportunity. It comes through multiplied avenues and kindly solicits our constant and earnest attention. In the great family of man may be found every phase of want, which calls for aid from any and every good Samaritan. How true ! 'The poor ye have always with you.' As Jesus classed himself among those who were poor, so must every one who bears him company. 'The son of man,' said he, 'hath not where to lay his head,' after the selfish manner of the children of this world. The accumulation of a private inheritance is the foundation of all selfishness. It establishes the narrow order of this is mine, and that is thine. Any infringement upon my possessions arouses the baser passions of man and the spirit of hatred and strife is soon in the ascendency. A Christian church can not be a selfish church, as it is not in harmony with the universal testimony of Je$us the Christ. 'Except a man forsake all that he hath, he can not be my disciple.' This was the order of the little church in Jerusalem. They had all things in common. If prosperity came to them, all enjoyed the blesssng ; if they met with adversity, it touched every heart. Peter stands as our witness of the life of this first Christian church. 'Behold,' said he, 'we have forsaken all to follow thee.' Peter had entered the narrow way that leadeth unto life. He had made a sacrifice of all that he possessed. It was the price of his salvation as a Christian, but it enabled him to say as did Jesus, Except a man forsake all that he hath, he can not be a disciple of the Christ. Our response must harmonize with that of Peter. It can be no more, it should be no less.
