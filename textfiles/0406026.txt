MY GOD And can I live one day to Thee In that perfection which I see? Not merely without sin that's known, But without fault before thy throne ? How straight the path, how easy stray'd; What strength by which we must be staid; What thought, what interest, all to keep Thy laws, the blessing full to reap! We see amiss, we speak untaught; And folly's acts are often wrought, Where principle and simple mien, Should ours possess'd be ever seen. Where is the center of our ill ? Do we the laws of life fulfill? If house is kept in graceful way. Then grace may there descend each day. The noblest structure that is found â€” Its basis rests upon the ground; Though many stories nearing heav'n Strength to uphold from earth is giv'n. Then, our foundations can we shun, And build our hopes the winds upon? Or, must we seek through light yet dim, To build for God and live to Him? Mary Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
