Spurgeon's life and work We wish our space would permit of our doing justice to the most worthy firm of I. K. Funk, No. 10 and 12 Dey St., New York, but it will not. We beg of our friends to address the firm for a catalogue of their wonderfully cheap, but valuable publications. The last one received was ' Spurgeori's Life and Work,' price 20 cents ! and how such books can be sent for the money passes our comprehension, and at the same time meets our approbation ; for all their intentions are of a noble and nobler type, than simply the acquisition of money, for instruction of the valuable in literature is the special intention of these parties. Write for their catalogue.
