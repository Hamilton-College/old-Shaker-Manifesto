South. Union, Ky. Feb. 1895. He said to the snow, be thou on the eai'th,and here it is in beautiful white, covering the earth for more than a week, and keeping it warm from many a chilling blast: sent by Boreas from his arctic home. Such a change in climate is delightful when accompanied by a clear, blue sky, and a calm, still atmosphere. It is so agreeable to have a universe of sky and snow, once or twice in a decade of years. Frost and snow kills many a deadly germ in the soil and atmosphere; and while it purifies the one, it fertilizes the other, a gift and provision of nature for the welfare of the human race who are made in the image and likeness of their Creator. The health of our Society is reasonably good, for it could not well help being otherwise, being endowed as we are with a full supply of muscular energy, a force which is very useful in many an occupation. Now as some of our eastern Brethren are out prospecting for a more genial, climate and fertile soil than they possess in their northern homes, let them not forget to give our zone a thorough examination and blend their mental culture with our muscular energy, and we will have a Society that will be a beacon upon a hill.
