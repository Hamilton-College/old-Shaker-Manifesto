FIRM FOOTING. MARY WHITCHER. Without a power to cast me down I might on earthly soil recline, And wear alone an earthly crown, With earthly friends alone for mine, God sees a higher for my good, And bears the failing from my sight; Nor gives me any kind of food That perisheth as in a night. 0 God above ! of light and truth, The Father and the friend of all, The guide alike to age and youth, Who give their trust and heed thy call. This found by one connecting link, From soul of mine to thy pure thought,. And felt through all we do and think, When into unison full brought. Canterbury, N. H.
