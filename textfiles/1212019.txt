Part of the religion of the Hindoos... Part of the religion of the Hindoos is to be kind to animals. They carry this into such practical operation that they erect hospitals for sick and homeless brutes. At Bombay there is a hospital of this kind covering several acres. Part of it is open to the heavens, while the rest is occupied with low, stone buildings and she^s. The pious Hindoos believe that all life is sacred and that its preservation is in some degree an atonement for -d.i committed and many an evil conscience is purged by sending some unhappy beast to the hospital. Much of the food consumed by the sick animals is contributed in the way of sacrifices and thank offerings. Even lice and fleas find refuge in a room set apart for their accommodation, devout pilgrims and hired oeggars supplying their necessities. Selected.
