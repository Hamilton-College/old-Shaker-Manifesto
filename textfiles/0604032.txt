SPIRIT OF THE FARM Here's something worth money... Here's something worth money. Many farmers have otherwise valuable horses, but spoiled by the heaves. The Troy Budget is the first to publish this infallible remedy: Forty shoemake buds, one pound of resin, one pint ginger, half pound mustard, one pint unslacked lime, six ounces cream-tartar, four ounces gum guacum, one pound epsom salts; mix together and make into thirty parcels. Give one every morning in the horse's feed before watering him. This is the first time this recipe has been printed. For half a century it has been guarded as a precious secret. We know of its having recently transformed a $100 horse into a $600 one.
