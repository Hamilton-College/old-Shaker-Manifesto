ERECTION OF THE SQUARE HOUSE. By Eunice Bathrick. SHADRACH IRELAND came from Charlestown, to Harvard, Mass., k_J and became a convert to the 'New Light' doctriu &gt; of the then famous George Whitefield. Ke was a most powerful preacher, and his influence pervaded cities, towns and villages in the Northern and Southern States, from 1740 to 1770. He visited England, his native country, several times, and finisht his earthly course at Newburyport, Mass., Sept. 1770. It appears that Shadrach Ireland became a convert to Whitefield's doctrine and entered upon the service of spreading the doctrine with increasing light, in and about Boston, which gave displeasure lo the different orders of religionists of the day, in that vicinity. His denunciation of the dead state of religion among the Orthodox, could not be endured by them ; hence they were aroused and went legally to work to have him arrested, alleging that he had blasphemed God and that his tongue should be bored with a hot iron. Being apprised of their design he fled to Harvard, where some of his converts lived, who gladly received and secretly entertained him. It seems that his opposers had some pretext for the course th^y had taken as he said he had been called of the Lord to forsake his wife and family and join himself in spirit to another woman, professing at the same time to live a pure life. Shadrach, finding it unsale to return to his former place of residence, continued to find protection with his friends who lived in Harvard, which at that time was a thinly inhabited part of the town. It seems he had other disciples in more distant localities, even to the distance of fifty miles. His people gave evidence of their love and respect for him, as it appears they soon learned his place of retreat, and united in building him a 'house. A wilderness spot was sought out and a building erected by a united gift, six furlongs from the house of Isaac Willard. This house was large for that day and had a square roof. It was called the Square House and was built in 1769. The timber for the frame was cut on the farm and the work performed under Shadrach's directions. Some of it was done by his own hands, as he was by trade a carver and joiner. Here the standard was erected and Shadrach's people gathered to hold meetings. Samuel Cooper and his family moved into the house with Shadrach. His spiritual companion remained in seclusion till his decease,, a term of ten or eleven years. None but Shadrach's followers knew that he resided in the town. The Northwest chamber was his workshop. In this room was a bell, and the cord extended from it to the kitchen, so that when strangers entered the house he could be notified to keep silent. He also had a very contracted staircase, extending from the cellar to the lookout that was built upon the roof. This staircase went up by the west side of the chimney so that in case of danger he could flee to the lookout and see who was on the premises. His followers often visited him for instruction and those of his disciples who were of the most moral and virtuous class bore the cross with him. At this time it was evident he was clothed with the true spirit that he might prepare a people for the work of final salvation which he had already commenced. Mother Ann Lee saw this place and people in vision before she left her own country, and then believed she would be led to the spot in God's own time, which was fulfilled in 1781, but not until after the decease of Shadrach Ireland. Altho he lost his rectitude, some of his disciples remained true and were ready to embrace the testimony of Mother Ann and the Elders, when it was opened to them. Shadrach testified that his body would never die : and this belief was shared by his followers, but it appears he was mistaken, for some time in the year 1779 or 1780, he left the mortal form something in the following manner. On the night of this event he walkt the floor in great distress of mind and groaning deeply, said;�'I feel the wrath of God.' In the course of the night, Abigail Lowgy called a Sister to bring a light, which she did with haste, but when the Sisters arrived his spirit had departed. Shadrach had said,�'If I should die, I shall rise again on the third or ninth day.' Accordingly, at a suitable time for interment some of his followers prepared a tomb in the cellar of the house, in which they placed the remains. This place was brickt up and a board placed over the top. In this the body remained until it became offensive, when it was removed. It was taken by Abijah Worster and David Hoar to a corn field about forty rods south-east from the Square House. Several hills of corn were removed and a grave was made. After the burial, the corn was replaced to prevent all knowledge of the interment. This remained a secret for some time. {To be continued.)
