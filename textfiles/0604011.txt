When the late war began, a young man, the only son of a widow... When the late war began, a young man, the only son of a widow, who had been fascinated by Mr. Beecher's preaching, was moved by his patriotic exhortations and influence to enlist, and was presently killed in battle. His body was brought home and Mr. Beecher, going to the house, led the mother to the coffin, and said to her that there lay her son before her dead; that the young man, the hope of her life and the stay of her age, had been murdered, cruelly murdered, and that he, Beecher, was the assassin. And thereupon he burst into so passionate a paroxysm of self-accusation and reproach that the mother became his comforter instead of receiving consolation from him. Such an incident, entirely consonant with what is known of Mr. Beecher, would find a natural place in the pious chronicles. Harper's Weekly.
