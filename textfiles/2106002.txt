IN MEMORIAM. Sophia Wayne. Fair Niskayuna, on thy hallowed soil, Our loving Mother blessed her faithful few, Who suffered persecution, want and toil, And left to us then* precepts pure and true. Their fervent prayers, the glorious hymns they sung, Were answered from the Eternal Throne above; The saAe sweet strains arise to-day, among Those who now claim that home of peace and love. Departed martyrs, we revere your names, Your victories over antichristians won; You've passed the judgment, heard your Lord proclaim 'Good servants enter rest, ye have well done.' Your followers are not bereft of hope, The memory of your triumphs still remain, Though we with persecution's power may cope, We know our efforts will not prove in vain. And when to praise the Infinite we come, Let every heart in unity entreat That He will bless our church of Lebanon, And guard our Mother's home, fair Watervliet. Yet not for these most favored spots alone, We ask, O Father, for thy tender care, But that Thou wilt protect each gospel home, Shall ever be the true Believer's prayer. Ballston, Spa, N. Y.
