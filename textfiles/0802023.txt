A. Griffin, My friend:—Yours of 4th ult. is at hand... Shakers, N. Y., Jan. 1, 1878 A. Griffin, My friend:—Yours of 4th ult. is at hand. There seems a decided difference in our views, of the condition of the people of the other world. The future destiny of the innumerable multitudes each with souls as precious as ours, is a subject too vast to be decided by the dogmas of the past. Heathens, Idolaters and religious persecutors, have their hells of retribution as a weapon to frighten sinners into the church. The character attributed to Deity by such, is outrageously disgusting and has made more self-righteous hypocrites, and infidels than it has saved souls. That Jehovah was a man of war; inspired his servants to persecute heretics; instituted a church to damn all who did not belong to it; that He has created a heaven at some extreme height to which all, who belong to the church, or have faith in imputed righteousness, are wafted at death, there to exult in the eternal misery of the wicked—these are doctrines too crude to have a place in an enlightened mind. _ God will never deprive man of the gift of free agency; yet all who willfully transgress, must learn obedience by suffering. The attributes of Deity are parental. He is not limited in the exercise of his mercy to ten years or an hundred years. He ia the same God in the future. The separation of the spirit from our bodies does not change our relations to Him nor our own moral conditions. Spirits out of the body may still be virtuous or vicious ; and their heaven or hell will be as they make them. We cannot indulge our selfish propensities here, and be wholly released there ; only so far as we have purified our hearts by abstinence from fleshly lusts. Yours in love, Chauncy Dibble
