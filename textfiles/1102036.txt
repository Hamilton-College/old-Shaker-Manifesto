A New Book of European Travel Our indefatigable friend, D. M. Bennett is out with a new book containing a compilation of his letters from Europe. As a letter writer he has but few equals in condensing much in little spaceâ€”and yet the letters are interestingly lengthy. His style is not of the Chesterfield school ; neither do his thoughts savor at all of Jonathan Edwards' philosophy, while telling us about the sacred places of the old world. Bennett has made for himself a unique niche in modern history; and that he is doing- a great deal of good in his peculiar field as an iconoclast, we have no doubts. Those wishing to know how an honest man can differ from ' orthodox' visions, while viewing the same historical subjects, let them send for the book, inclosing $1.25 to D. M. Bennett, 141 Eighth street, New York.
