The beautiful summer has passed, although the harvest is not ended; and yet how brief seems the period since the sowing and planting time. Really 'Time flies' and we fly with it, hardly having an opportunity to secure the precious moments, ere they elude our grasp. Surely 'Now is the acceptable time' should be the motto of each who would make life worth the living. Our blessings the season past have been manifold. The sowing and reaping of temporal blessings, have been sure, while others of our dear friends near by have suffered the loss of crops by the devastations of wind and hail. Our garden yields productively, by faithful care. We had two-fifths of a mile of pears, as much by measurement of raspberries and blackberries, with an occasional specimen of the dewberry, a running blackberry, the average size of which is an inch and a half long, and three inches in circumference. To these are added all the nutritious vegetables, indigenous to our climate. Yet amid all these blessings, we are puzzled by a problem which we wonder if any of our sister Societies have solved. When we add healthful food, regular meals, and temperate habits, the sum or amount is perfect digestion, consequently good health. But when we subtract therefrom�as we are obliged to�imperfect mastication caused by rapid eating, the remainder is sure to be indigestion, with its attendant ill-omened figures; and to econcile these antagonisms, is as impossible as it is for the defaulting cashier to meet the demands of his bank, when he has subtracted the funds placed in his charge, for his own selfish use. 'Bolted' food is wasted food, since it is not what we eat but what we digest that makes us strong. It is said that those who properly masticate their food, never eat too much. Under these considerations economy would balance the scales, and add health, strength, and virtue which would far outweigh the little increase of time. Our summer school term of seventeen weeks ended Sept. 1st. Good teachers, interested pupils, and satisfactory results, is the verdict of all who have visited the school, or have been associated with the children out of school. On the last of August we little people had a delightful visit and picnic, with our dear friends at Hancock, who entertained us beautifully. Our- - - - - - - -to be continued in our next. Amelia J. Calver. North Family. Sept. 1893. We read with much pleasure the very excellent and thoughtful editorial of the Sept. Manifesto. The opening sentence of which is the key to our thoughts at this writing. The love and the peace that flows from the spiritual union of Brethren and Sisters, brought together by the love of purity is more precious, saving, and uplifting than any other gift under heaven. 'Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains,* and have not charity (or love) I am nothing.' We feel the importance of gathering and cultivating this beautiful gift of divine love. Where pure love is, the love of God, the love of the divine in Brother and Sister, there is freedom and confidence. Nothing is more helpful to the growth and strength of this union and the quick- THE MANIFESTO. 239 ening of this divine love than the blending of our gifts and aspirations in our spiritual meetings. Let us keep the altar fires of our spiritual meetings burning brightly and we shall surely increase in love and zeal and devotion. St. Paul, writing to the early churches says;�'Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.' We feel the force of the admonition in this last quotation and know the consequences of neglect. Since last writing, the Brethren and Sisters one day, and the boys and girls another day, enjoyed their usual summer ride. These are very enjoyable days, when the weather and all other appointments are favorable, as this year. Had our first frost on the 3rd inst. We began cutting ensilage corn on the 11th. Walter S.
