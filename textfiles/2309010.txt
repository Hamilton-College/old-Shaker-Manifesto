KINDLING WOOD. By B. Frank Wickeksham. [Contributed by E. A. Stratton.] Gke at things from small beginnings start, The progress which they make and spread, Depends entirely on the part And nature of material fed. Once let the poisoned dart of hate Control the functions of the mind, Then life, no matter what its state, Can peace no longer in it find. Burning with jealous fire, the soul Consumes within its narrow cell The thoughts and feelings which control A power, tongue can never tell. Passion (which we ourselves condemn,) Strikes, without thought, the fatal blow, It disregards all friendship, when It falls alike on friend and foe. Twin sister of a jealous heart, Is envy, with its bitter scorn; Where one performs an active part, Its sure the other will be born. And malice, with its:plans so deep, Holds to its breast, with cankerous hand A weapon which it ever keeps Eeady for use at its command. Were ever roaring flames so great, Or kindlings more destructive be, Than jiassion, envy, malice, hate, Bound by the cord of jealousy. The desolation they would bring, No pen of man could e'er portray, Eternal ages, too, would ring, With loud anathemas displayed. If we would have ou, life infused, Not with the evil, but the good, In starting out be sure to choose The proper kind of kindling wood. Instead of hatred, let the soul Be kindled by a flame of love, Dark passion, then, will be controlled By quickening power sent from above. If sympathy support the spark, The flame of malice cannot rise, And if good-will should form a part, Then jealousy and envy dies. ï¿½Pen and Ink.
