EQUALITY OF THE SEXES. JAMES S. PRESCOTT. When God made the sexes he made them equal, pure and innocent, and while they continued in that state they enjoyed paradise. As are the hands on the human body, so is the equality of the sexes in the spiritual order. There is a right hand and a left hand, the right hand is always first, the left hand is always second, and both hands are always ready to help each other in bearing one anothers burdens, and so fulfilling the law of Christ, in ministering to the wants of the body, which is the Church. Perhaps no one understood this law, better than St. Paul Avhenhe said, ' these hands have ministered to my necessities. ' It is evident that St. Paul, when nut engaged in preaching the gospel, labored with his hands. In case of the absence or inability of the right hand to perform its office, in the natural body, the left hand is always ready, in every emergency and under all circumstances to fill the place, and make up the lack. So is the body of Christ. Two of each sex are appointed in this day. This is the law govei*niug the equality of the sexes, in the spiritual Order, and there can be no other, because it emanated from God, making the government a Theocracy. North Union, Ohio.
