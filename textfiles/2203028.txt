Dear Children:--You cannot look after your habits too carefully... Enfield, Ct. 1891. Dear Children :You cannot look after your habits too carefully. Bad habits are often contracted by example of others. Bad habits grow by what they feed upon and they are ruinous to the soul. It is little by little that sin increases in strength upon its victims by repetition. To be safe from sin the voice of conscience must be regarded in little things. Beware of the first wrong step. 'Avoid the appearance of evil,' is the only safeguard. When you feel that a bad habit is controlling you, resist its despotism, tyranny. Evil habits must be conquered or they will conquer, and destroy your happiness. Living in sin brings grief and pain, dying to sin brings eternal gain. Correct your mistakes. Let your aspirations be away from the wrong toward the right. 'Hold fast that which isgood,'' and keep a clean conscience. The purer you live the better fitted are you to benefit others. Fight the good fight and you will overcome. Persistent self-denying struggles will win. Watch your thoughts closely and bear the cross freely. Thoughts produce actions. Eesolve to give up sinning, to-day make a beginning. Kegard good counsel. Never sacrifice principle for pleasure. Associate only with the virtuous. 'Good company will improve the mind, And wisdom will impart, But bad, the bi.ne of all mankind, Will sure corrupt the heart.' Your Brother. Daniel Orcutt.
