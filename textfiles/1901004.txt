REPLY Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., Nov. 1888. Mrs. L. M. Pomeroy. Respected Friend :—Your letter of the oth. inst. received. I have not seen the 'Springfield Union' containing my article yet; it will come soon. 14 THE MANIFESTO. So, you put yourself in the same class with Margaret and Katie Fox. They are mediums. You have been 'a medium for writing, tipping, test and speaking medium, &amp;c.' You ''know just how it is done.' Margaret and Kate were mediums ; and now they say that they have been acting as frauds, all these years. You do the same ; and then expect the world to believe you. Yet, you look for the Savior ; expect the bodily resurrection ; and affirm that the dead cannot return until their bodies rise ; that none have ever returned ; you are positive about it, &amp;c. You forget that Moses and Elias, and Samuel, returned and talked with Jesus and Saul; and many other Scripture statements. Do you not think that yourself and the Fox women are very wicked women, and that no person should believe a word that any of you may utter ? Then you contradict yourself, and affirm your belief in Spiritualism, saying, 'It is a power that produces raps, tipping tables, writing, and test-giving ; it is all done by power unseen.' 'For the devil has come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth his time is short.'—Thus you admit yourself to have been a medium for the devil to use in misleading humanity. Do not wish you to come here—better repent. Respectfully, F. W. Evans
