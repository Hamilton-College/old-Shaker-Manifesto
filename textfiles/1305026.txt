MORE AIR. Those who have been housed for the winter, scarcely securing a breath of pure air for months, should now breath as much of the spring air as possible, as one of the most important means of purifying the blood. All nature is active, vitalized, putting on new life and more graceful attire, and it is the privilege of debilitated women, nearly worn-out house-keepers, the victims of 'nervous prostration.' (A new disease, or one with a fashionable name, meaning something or nothing.) It is the right of all such to rally with the return of spring, and to do so by breathing more of God's pure air—free to all creatures, and as life-giving as free ! These exhausted women have a right to throw off some of the drudgery of kitchen toils—some if not much of this is needless—and enjoy the air and sun, while managing a flowergarden. Women have 'rights,' and among them is that of taking better care of their health, which implies a little more leisure, less of the burdens, cares and anxieties of domestic life. This she can have by the adoption of plain, simple and and sensible habits of living and dress. City &amp; Country
