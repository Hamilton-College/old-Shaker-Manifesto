Watervliet, N. Y. Jan. 1893. Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½We send you an article written by our aged Sister, Ann Buckingham who has now passed to the other shore. We are having a cold January, with but very little snow. Ice about fourteen inches thick, and very nice. We have secured what we may want for the present year. We are busy now in obtaining our yearly supply of wood. Many are the blessings that are bestowed upon a good, warm stove, but they will be forgotten on the approach of midsummer. The song of the shiit is still being sung by the good Sisters as their machines stitch, stitch, stitch, but as the price for making grows less, the song loses its joyful strain. Our water wheel, for lack of water at the reservoir, does not move, and that causes lamentation. When the heavens open and send down the much needed rain, I expect tu hear a song of lejoicing. The dear Brethren and Sisters who came from Groveland are a great support to our Society meeting, as well as to all the interests of their new home. We are very thankful they have come to dwell with us We are all engaged in the gospel warfare against the powers of evil, and expect by so doing, to gain the victory. Josiah, Barker. Second Family. Jan. 1898. The cold weather of the past lifteen days and no snow to hinder, has made ice of an excellent quality, from twelve to fourteen inches thick. The North Family joined hands with us and we are securing our stores of ice for the season. We have also made the Sisters glad, with a new range for the kitchen, and an addition of cold and hot water for kitchen, bakery and dairy. The water is supplied by a wind-mill which pumps it into a tank holding ten thousand gallons; to them it is a luxury, as in the past they have pumped all water used. It also runs at the barn. Not much snow, consequently no sleighing, but it has been a good time to cut fire wood. We have lately parted with a loved Sister, a Mother in Israel, one who helped build up Zion by good works. This causes our minds to revert to many who were of this number that have passed on within a few years. The Yedders, Wells, Bates, Trains, Harwoods, Youngs, Buckinghams, Copleys and other families who were the pioneers of this part of Zion, and they were a power for good in their day. Would that we could convert some like unto them in this day. But with all due respect for humanity at large, how many are willing to come and sacrifice all, as did those blessed pioneers, asking in return only the gospel of Christ and Mother. We have but a few more of these good aged souls left, and when they are gone, there will be a vacuum difficult to fill. May a wave of true conviction spread over Zion and the world of mankind, and may our ranks be replenished by more such consecrated souls. It is a general time cf health in our Society. We are pleased to say that our worthy Brother, Chauncey Miller is growing in strength, daily. Isaac Ansttti'.t. North Family. Jan. 1893. Since our last notes we have passed the festive season of Christmas and New Years; they were enjoyable both temporally and spiritually. At Christmas time tokens of love and remembrance were passed between the different Families. Then the seasons of spiritual communion. I pity the one that can attend them and not feel their uplifting power. On New Year's day we enjoyed a beautiful season with our gospel kindred, when the presence of our dear Elder Daniel Boler was made manifest with other angel messengers. Truly it was a baptism from the inner heavens. The winter so far has been quite free from snow, a few boisterous days, but on the whole, pleasant. The January Manifesto was so full of good things that we could not draw the line and so have taken them all in, sure they will not produce mental or spiritual dyspepsia. 47 48 THE MANIFESTO. The essay on 'Cheerfulness' is timely How often we look on the dark side even when we know the sunshine is better. The humorist is an essential character, in the social economy. One that is always chaste in his remarks, but has the faculty of making things pleasant and sometimes causing the company to have a good hearty laugh. It is health to soul and body. We second the motion of Elder Oliver Hampton that it would be desirable to have the address of those that write the Home Notes that wt may know the author and be better acquainted.
