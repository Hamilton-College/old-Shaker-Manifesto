ABERNETHY ON CORRECT LIVING VS. DRUGS. The Medical Record reproduces an extract from the biography of the late General Dix, by his son, Morgan Dix, in which is given an account of an interview with Abernethy, whom the General had consulted for professional advice. It is gratifying to note that the common sense advice of the illustrious physician was taken in a common sense way by the distinguished patient, and that the result was a ripe and robust old age, (80 years,) of which the dyspeptic youth of the General scarcely gave promise. After hearing a few words of his patient's story, Abernethy cut him short as follows : ' Sir, you are pretty far gone, and the wonder is you are not gone entirely. If you had consulted common sense instead of the medical faculty, you would probably have been well years ago. I can say nothing to you excepting this : You must take regular exercise as much as you can bear without fatigue, as little medicine as possible, of the simplest kind, and this only when absolutely necessary, and a modest quantity of plain food, of the quality which you find by experience best to agree with you. No man, not even a physician, can prescribe diet for another. ' A stomach is a stomach;' ?nd itis impossible for any one to reason *vith safety from his own to that of any other person. There are a few general mles which any man of common sense may learn in a week, such as this: That rich food, high seasoning, etc., are injurious. I can say no more to you, sir; you must go and cure yourself. '
