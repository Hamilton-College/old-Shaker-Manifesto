HOPE ON! HOPE EVER! D. H. Field Should we despair e'en though the present Seems the fiercest fight of life ? The future, with its fairest treasures, May crown our efforts in the strife. What if to-day be fraught with sorrow ? Dark and heavier than the past, Brighter may beam the glad to-morrow, With not one cloud to over-cast. Remember, 'tis night's darkest hour That welcomes in the happy morn ; And where the cross seems to be heaviest, The best and richest gifts are born. Let us, then, be up and doing ; Faint not in the glorious strife ; ' Onward, onward still pursuing !' Be the watchword of our life. Canaan, N. Y.
