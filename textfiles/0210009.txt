Angel Messenger of Peace Bl' OLIVE STEBBINS Fly, fly through the heavens, thou Gospel proclftimer, To earth's needy children, I earnestly pray; For truth and salvation will greet God's creation, O, may they thy warning and precepts obey. Fly, fly through the heavens, thou angel of mercy, Proclaim the glad tidings of ' peace and good will; ' To cultivate earth, use your warlike utensils, That it may bring forth, and jour granaries fill. Let news from Mount Zion waken every sleeper, To rise from their slumbers, and hail the glad sound, For now is salvation from war's desolation, Where righteousness reigns, and rich blessings are found. For all wars will cease where the Gospel is planted, Christ's mission was 'peace and goodwill' unto man; The same voice to-day, in this last visitation, Since it is revealed through our good Mother Ann. We now have a warfare, not with carnal weapons, The Avar we engage in begins at the gate; The sword points within us, the pure testimony, Our own life of sin we must certainly hate. All sinners must bow to the Lord in his temple, Before his true witness their deeds bring to light, Or they cannot enter this beautiful city, Where purity reigns as a standard of right. O come, all ye weary and ye heavy laden, To Mount Zion's borders, where sweet rest is found O come to the feast, is the kind invitation, O come and be saved on God's holy ground.
