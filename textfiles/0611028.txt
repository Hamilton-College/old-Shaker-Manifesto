Enfield, Conn. Enfield, Conn., sent a company of relations^to Mt. Lebanon and Watervliet, during September, on a visit. This is the only company of our visitors that has met with us during the year, and it numbered some very beautiful souls. One of these loved The Shaker so well that she invariably 'reads every word in it, advertisements on cover and all!' Some of The Shaker's best friends are at Enfield, Conn.
