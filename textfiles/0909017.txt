THE INQUISITION Ayer, Mass., Aug. 14, 1879 Dear Brother and Editor : Thoughts of the priestly invasion of American's boasted freedom gave me a restless night. We now realize that we have the inquisition restored with all the rigors that our attained civilization will permit. We have nothing better to expect of the clergy — the God-in-the-constitution advocates. They challenge a man's right to doubt,but to believe, every falsehood that ever cursed the earth and man, that is a virtue though it prove a curse to both soul and body. It is not the ' faithful believers ' that have advanced the world. History tells us it is to the doubters — the 'infidels'— that the world owes the greatest debt of gratitude. They never persecute nor kill, nor trample upon,but uplift the.fallen; give sight to the blind, whose eyes are filled with the dust of tradition, and whose minds are warped, and dwarfed by creeds and professions of faith. We had hoped something better than a subsided president bowing reverently to the dictum of church authority. So much at random. Now for what I intended to say when I took pen in hand. Can you see Bennett and say a kind and sympathetic word to him ? How do the warden and officers treat him ? Influence them if possible, to treat him kindly, as a noble human being which he is. Who knows but some of us will be behind the bars ? E. Myrick
