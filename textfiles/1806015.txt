AN OPEN VISION. Amelia. J. Calver. '�'�Now there are a diversity of gifts, but the same spirit.'''' 1 Cor. xii., 4. It was not midnight, nor was it a misty dream that stole over me ; but in the calm, clear light of day, before my inner vision appeared two platforms, suspended in the air, the material of which seemed to be a delicate polished wood. The one to the right was filled with little brass machines, which were spinning fine threads of various colors. These threads were gathered into one above the platform, and being slightly twisted, formed a strong cable. Around this platform moved with noiseless tread, the operators of these curious machines ; some were oiling the little gudgeons, others with watchful care kept the tiny wheels bright and clean, others often found it necessary to accelerate a tardy spindle, or slacken a too hasty thread ; while anon some gentle hand occasionally straightened a kink, or removed unspuu material from the ascending threads. Thus run the little machines, without jar or confusion, and these many threads of various colors, formed a cord beautiful in its variety, strong in its multiplicity. I now turned to contemplate the platform on the left, but what a contrast! The machines were the same, and earnest operators were guiding them ; but instead of the busy hum of the working wheels only grating sounds were heard ; and why? No careful hands were lubricating the pivots, no guiding touches regulated the pensions ; but all thoughts of the anx- ioas spinners seemed centered in the color of their threads, and as it was only individual bias which decided this, many a thread was broken off, and the cord above grew thinner. Nor was this all; the threads so ruthlessly broken became entangled with others and clogged wheels, wThich might have 'run well.' The wheels deprived of work were pushed aside. To stop? Not so. It seemed their nature to run, and run they did; but the little cogs once so nicely fitted in place, were now grinding themselves against the edges of the platform and against each other, and destruction was the result.
