Mt. Lebanon, Sept. 1,1874 Charles and Amanda Deyo — Esteemed Friends : I hope my absence from your gath- ering will not be noticed. My spirit is with you in the good cause of Peace. Of the Seven Seals, which the Lamb opened, the first was a White Horse — Innocence and Peace. The rider had, for his weapon, a Bow, and a Crown, as a sign of victory. Revelation was the Power. This was the first Church, founded by the Apostles. For three hundred years, this Church denounced War. When the Second Seal was opened, a Church was founded, of which Constantine was the head—a Red Horse, signifying Blood. The rider took Peace from the Earth — that they should kill one another. Constantine intro- duced war into the Christian system. It is there yet. The Moon — Church and State governments — was turned to blood. Is it not so to-day ? Is there any hope for peace, until all theology is purged from our Statutes — all Sunday laws and every form of Priestcraft, and Woman is installed Human, as complete as Man — endowed with the same inalienable right, to make Laws, and execute them. Lay not the flattering unction to your Souls, that any Male Government will be a Peace government — Males will fight. Not until the raw material is so far wrought up into Manhood, that the Man yields might to right, and ceases to hold Woman as a Slave, can She become the medium of Heavenly Truth to him. When Redeemed Woman rules the Souls of Men, as absolutely as heretofore the un- redeemed women have ruled men's bodies, there will be peace. Dear Friends — Peace be with you. You will meet a little company of our Brethren and Sisters. As a delicate and appropriate expression of the welcome, we know you feel, you may, during their sojourn, practice a little more self denial than is your wont. Dress plainly. Eat plain food. Be what you seem to be, and seem to be what you are — that our countries may join. Please excuse the simple plainness of your friend. F. W. Evans
