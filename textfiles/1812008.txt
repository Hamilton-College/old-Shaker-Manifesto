Legal Decisions of Common Law of the United States. Alfred, Me., Sept. 30, 1865. Elder Otis Sawyer, Dear Friend :�In answer to your suggestions per annexed sheet, I submit the following suggestions and replies. The duty of protecting the property of every individual, by just Laws promptly, and impartially administered is one of the strongest and most interesting obligations on the part of government, and in discharge of this obligation, it is bound, and will assist the rightful owner of property, in the recovery of the possession of it whenever unjustly withheld. A Trustee or Agent entrusted with general powers, must exercise a sound discretion, act in good faith, within the scope of his powers, he has all the implied powers necessary to complete the business in the scope of his employment. Tt is a general rule that when an Agent or Trustee is duly constituted, and names the principal for whom he acts, and contracts it, his name, the Principal is responsible and not the Agent. But the Agent must not exceed his powers. This rule, Chancellor Kent says, pervades every system of juris-prudence, and stands on strong foundations ! If a Trustee, or general Agent does what he is authorized to do and something more., it will be good so far as he ivas authorized to go and the excess only will he void. When the Trustee, or Agent exceeds his powers, and purchases in his own name without disclosing for whom he acts, his principal will still be liable, provided the property so purchased comes to their hands and use. Persons dealing with an Agent, or Trustee are hound to enquire and know how far such Agent is authorized, and that their contracts are within the scope and limits of the power conferred on him. All Trustees deriving their powers from courts or appointment of individuals or Communities, are subject to well defined rules of law and equity. The Trustees cannot reap benefit from the use of the Trust fund or property ! He cannot act for his own benefit in any contract, purchase or sale, as to the subject of the trust. He cannot take upon himself an incompatible duty. He cannot have an adverse interest and employment, for this would expose his judiciary trust to abuse and fraud. These principles are especially applied to your Deacons and Trustees, whose time and services belong to the Society. Real estate as well as personal, purchased with the trust fund or property, and conveyed to the Trustees still belongs to the owners of the fund, or property with which such purchase is made. Agents and Trustees are bound to render an account, at any time on demand of those for whom they act. It was settled some forty years ago in this state (Maine) by the highest judicial authority, and upon principles of common law, equally applicable here, and in every other state, that the ' Covenant by which the members of the Society or Societies of Shakers are bound, to each other, is a valid instrument, obligatory on all who voluntarily enter into it.' That, the Covenant requires the surrender of all the property, and commands the entire services of persons admitted to membership. Not only the property but the individuality of the member, is to a certain extent, yielded up to the Community of Interests, and he has henceforth no power to contract for himself or the Community, except within the rules prescribed in the Covenant and by the authorities of the Society. When he transcends these bounds, his acts are a nullity and impose no liability on the Society. Ans. to Interrogations. Ques. 1. What is the legal, and most proper course to adopt provided an individual appointed as Trustee or Agent violates his covenantal obligations, and refuses to be accountable to the authorities specified in our Covenant or Constitution, who are the Ministry and Elders, and for sundry violations of known duties, it is believed that said Trustee is embezzling the property of the family or Society in which, and for which he is acting as Trustee or Agent? Ans. The appointing power, the Ministry and Elders may remove the defaulting Trustee or Agent, give him notice of the removal and appoint his successor. Ques. 2. Suppose he claims to have taken the responsibility to step one side of the established rules of the Society, in which he is acting as Trustee or business Agent, which forbids hiring money, involving the family in debt, or in any way making the family responsible for money received and he hires money on his own name, and by speculation with funds thus received, earns one thousand dollars, more or less, and claims that as his own private property, what claim has the Society upon money or other property thus earned ? Ques. 3. If money so obtained is vested in neat stock, lumber or real estate, what course should be taken by the Society, to take the possession of said property ? Ques. 4. If the Society has good reason to suppose that an individual Trustee has money or investments in Government or Company stocks, which are deposited iu banks' safes,�How can legal possession be taken of them ? Ques. 5. If there is good reason for believing that said Trustee has money, notes, bonds or other securities concealed on his person, what right has the executive authorities of the Society, to compel such individual to make presentation of property to them ? Ques. 6. Supposing a Trustee holds notes, bonds or title to real or personal estate, or personal property of any kind which he has received in his own name, no reference being made in those deeds, bonds, notes, &amp;c, of his Trusteeship or Agency for or in behalf of the Society, or family in which he claims to be a member, how does this effect or impair the right to claim and hold all such property ? Ans. to 2. 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the Trustees or Agent has neat stock, lumber, or any specific article of personal property, Bank Bills, stock or notes of hand, in his own name, it is still the property of the Society and duty and right of the Ministry and Elders and successors of such defaulting Trustee, to take and reduce to their possession such property, wherever they may find it. If it be in custody of any corporation, Bank or other persons. Give them notice of your claim to it, demand it, of such Bank, or third person. If you obtain possession of notes of hand though payable to such Trustee, you can collect them for the Society. If the promiser is known, you may notify him. that the note given such Trustee is the property of the Society, and then collect the amount of it. If any person, stranger, member or removed Trustee is embezzling removing or destrojing property, papers, title deeds, or anything else or secreting them about his person, the authorities of the Society may, without process of law, detain and take from him such property, using such force as may be necessary after demand to possess themselves of the property, no more. Or if it be deemed safe to delay, they may make complaint to a magistrate, and have an officer obtain the property so embezzled. I have no doubt, conveyances of real estate by deed to a Trustee by name only, ensues to the benefit of the Society and the authorities may enter upon such real estate and treat it as stolen property, of the Society, and a court of equity will order the conveyance by the removed Trustee. Every trade made by a Trustee though in his own name, is for the benefit of the Society. He cannot hold the profits of any trade, as his own. The authorities may take such property wherever they may find it, or money if within their reach. Taking bills of sale and conveyances to himself, does not at all impair the right of the Society authorities for whom he is bound to act, to take actual possession of all such property. Your authorities may take possession of all property attempted to be kept from them, as they find it. If in possession of third persons who refuse to deliver it up, an action at law may be maintained for it, or the value, as the case may be. If the defaulting Trustee, on demand of the Ministry and Elders, to whom he is required to account, refuse and they suspect he has funds, personal or real in his own name, or intrusted to other persoiis, belonging to the Society, they can, by bill for discovery, have him ordered to disclose under oath every transaction he has entered into and what funds, and estate he may have, where it is, and demand that he deliver or convey as the case may re- quire. This is the remedy where you do not know the extent of the misappropriation or cannot get hold of the property, papers or stock, &amp;c. Every person who transacts business for your Society, is known to act not for himself but for the Community. All men dealing with him are bound, especially in an important affair, to know that he is authorized, and the extent of that authority. As your regulations do not authorize hiring money, the Trustee could not bind the Society. If you have been accustomed to borrow money through a Trustee or any member of a certain individual, and the authorities paid it, that might give the implied authority, for the same individual to loan again and collect of the Society. Paying that individual would not authorize other persons, to whom you had not paid, to collect of you loans to the same, or any other Trustee. Ques. 7. If t*he violations of Covenantal obligations of such individuals, are such as to convince the leading authorities of the Society that he has forfeited his right of membership and said individual refuses compliance with Society rules and Covenantal requirements and still persists in holding a place, and right of membership, then what course are the Society to take to accomplish his ejectment from the Community ? Ans. When a Trustee is not only removed from his Trusteeship, but for misconduct and violation of his Covenantal obligations, is removed from membership, according to your rules, after notice, and reasonable time to leave, he has no more right than a stranger and becomes a trespasser by remaining or re-entering and may be treated as such, by process of law. Ques. 8. If such individual has run in debt, contrary to the established rules and laws of the Society, after a declaration and caution to the public against trusting members, or professed members of the Shaker Community, has at any time been made patent to the world, through the medium of the leading public journals in the state, what obligations are the Society under to pay any such demands, supposing the Society may have, at any previous times for the honor of the Society and to secure individuals met some such improperly contracted debts ? Ans. This is substantially answered. Such payments would be considered as secrecy and create no implied promise to pay other individuals nor that one again, after notice. When the Trustee trades outside of his authority, you may elect to be bound or not. If you receive the goods you would be obliged to pay ; not otherwise. When- a Trustee retires, and you do not apprehend an escape or loss of property, an application to a court of equity for a full account would be preferable to the summary modes above suggested. Yours very truly, Ira T. Drew.
