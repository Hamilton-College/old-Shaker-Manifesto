Eldress ELIZA ANN TAYLOR, Our Mother Ann of Today. Anna White. We do not propose to give even a biographical sketch of her who stands in the mediatorial order as Mother of the Church on earth�the New Creation�our Zion home, because space is limited, and were it otherwise, we are void of necessary information that usually accompanies such productions. And again, it might seem to others who are more intimately acquainted, rather a precocious proceeding on the part of the writer. Immature as they are, we offer a few thoughts that may grow beneath the pen, even as the seed grows beneath the sod, and be of some value to the reader. Impressions are imbibed in various ways, directly and indirectly, by spirits out of the form and spirits in the body, as well as emanations arising from one's own mind. It matters not, however, from whence they proceed, or whither they take their flight, so long as they leave with us a salutary influence. It is now eighteen years over a century since Mother Ann Lee received the most wonderful revelation ever erven to mortals. ' The my&amp;tery of iniquity' was made known to her by spirit agencies, and in heavenly visions she was shown the root and foundation of man's loss from God. The Christ in her testified against all filthiness of flesh and spirit and lustful gratification of every name and nature, as the very source and foundation of human misery ; and that these lusts must be crucified, and every sin confessed, one by one, as they had been committed to a witness of God, who, imbued with divine unction and power from on high, could help 'unbar the prison doors and let the oppressed go free.' Interesting�biographical history of Mother Ann and the first founders of the Society are given in full, in successive numbers of �' The Manifesto ' by our able Editor, and are highly appreciated. Ever since the establishment of the Order, as one after another has passed on to higher realms, a successor, from Mother Ann down, has been appointed to fill the vacancy : Thus, the Mediatorial chain remains unbroken to the present time. It can never be broken, because it is of Divine origin, no more than the door of Revelation can ever be closed. 'Behold I set before you an open door and no man can shut it.' We learn that on July 18, 1811, in Manchester England, was born the subject of our narrative, Eldress, Eliza Ann Taylor�the youngest of six children. When only six weeks old her parents, William and Elizabeth Taylor embarked for America. After their arrival to these shores they resided for a time in New York City, and subsequently in the City of Hudson, N. Y. where they remained until the year 1820 when they moved to New Lebanon. All came, save one son who was bound out as an apprentice. In those days of home industry, the old-fashioned loom and spinning wheel, like the old oaken bucket, were the chief essentials in a family. In this family, consisting of eight members, not less than five looms were in daily use from morning till night, and this little girl of five summers turned the quill wheel; thus we see the principle of industry was early inculcated and observed. An interesting incident, and one worthy of note occurred, that directed the father's attention to Believers, and was the first opening wedge to an introduction. A brother, by the name of Eli Porter of New Lebanon, was owing one cent to a merchant in Hudson, and went to pay it. With others present in the store was William Taylor who, though an honest man, was amazed that so trifling a thing as a copper should be taken into account; he noted it however, and resolved to become acquainted with such an honest man that would turn out of his course for a penny debt; and this he afterwards accomplished. From this important principle being literally carried out, of never running in debt, and ' owing no one aught but love and goodwill,' a whole family were gathered, and most of them remaiued to be useful and worthy members of Society. This should be an incentive, to Believers, to pay promptly all just debts. As childhood blossomed into youth, so industry bore its fruit, and maturer years developed faculties in Eldress Ann that were adapted to the needs of a large family. She soon became a burden bearer. For a number of years she was Deaconess in the Church Family ; from there she went to live with Eldress Betsy Bates as assistant in the Order of Elders, aid in 1852, upon the removal of Eldress Betsy to the Ministry, was appointed senior Eldress in the Church, where she served five years as a faithful Shepherdess over a large flock. She was next called to supply a vacancy in the Ministerial Order, and after serving ten years as an associate with Eldress Betsy, was appointed and anointed as first in the Ministry ; Eldress Betsy having passed to her spirit home. For thirty one years Eldress Ann has stood as a true representative of Mother Ann Lee, loved and beloved by her people far and near, who probably know of her recent physical sufferings. Mental and spiritual sufferings are unavoidable ; these will continue so long as there remains one soul to be redeemed unto God, and the physical being so closely allied, the one affects the other. For a long time it has been quite popular with the outside community, when a person has held, or is holding an important place of trust, to issue bulletins, and insert short and lengthy articles in newspapers concerning their physical condition, especially when health becomes impaired; as at preseut with the Emperor Frederic of Germany, who is soon expected to follow his illustrious father; seven of the most skillful physicians being unable to save him from the ravages of disease. The query arises, why may we not issue something similar, when occasion demands, through the columns of 'The Manifesto?' Not because of existing custom for 'Be ye not conformed to this world ; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds unto God.' Not because of caste or nationalities, for we are Brethren and Sisters. Equality in all things being one of the prominent rounds in the ladder of ascension from earth to heaven: and ''hath not God made of one blood all the nations of the earth?' Not because of place or station, for shall not 'every valley be filled, and every mountain and hill be brought low?' Howbeit, our fathers and mothers in the gospel, who have by selfabnegation and abasement humbled themselves to that degree that the love o[ power to rule and reign over others is subdued, are exalted above the highest hills, (the kings and queens, emperors and princes of this earth,) and are, in the estimation of their spiritual offspring, bright examples, ' guiding stars on the journey of life, '�lighting this vale of mists and shadows with an illumination far exceeding the sun in its meridian splendor. It is love based upon purity, respect for virtue, reverence and veneration for godliness that calls forth this feeble tribute to one, whom we are privileged to call, 'Our Mother.' We are happy to inform all our dear Brethren and Sisters of the household of faith, though we have not been formally appointed, that our beloved Eldress Ann is gradually recovering. Let us continue to pray for her full restoration, and lighten her burdens by individual faithfulness, that we may be blest by the light of her countenance, awd receive wise counsel from her as of yore, for many years tr&gt; come. The warm genial breezes of Spring, and kindly attendants, though not doctors, cannot fail to bring renewed life to one so full of spirit, so overflowing with love, so fraught with the great Maternal Soul in Deity, the Mother of the Universe.
