Dear Brother, Henry C. Blinn:--Please find Postal note and... Peoria, Oct. 1890. Dear Brother, Henry C. Blinn :�Please fiud Postal note and continue to send me the welcome messenger, the Manifesto, which comes as a glad epistle from afar. After I have gaiued from it many tokens of blessing, I give it over to the Public Reading Room, where 1 have also placed a copy of 'Shaker Theology.' This last was a present from the author, Elder II. L. Eads. Both are eagerly perused by other readers whom we trust are seekers after the abiding love of Christ. This is the holy calling of all true Believers. To abide in the Love of Christ, is to overcome self and the world. If it were not possible to withstand the temptations, and overcome the world, then Christ would not have admonished his disciples to ''continue in my love.' We are in constant danger of forsaking Christ and the teachings of Mother Ann and those who were with her in the beginning of the Second Appearing of Christ, if we do not '-Watch, watch and pray.' The spirit of the world, if we will permit it, will creep into our hearts and overthrow Christ's love and life, therefore we need to bear in mind the words of Paul;�'Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is good and acceptable uuto God.' It is God's will that we should abide in his love and be filled with the fulness of God. and it is not only his will, but it is our privilege to become perfect, and love God with all our heart, soul and mind. Jesus in his mission among men, proclaimed, 'Not every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.' To abide in Christ's love we must keep his commandments. 'If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.' Christ was submissive to the will of his Father. 'My meat,' said he, 'is to do the will of Him that sent me.' Apd when the Father saw fit to give him the bitter cup of sorrow he took it meekly, and said, 'Not as I will, but as thou wilt.' It is Christ's command that we should follow him daily and deny ourselves for his cause. We should follow him in his humility, in his meekness, in his gentleness, iu his patience, in his long-suffering, in his holiness and in his purity. When God may choose to give us the cup of sorrow, we should submissively drink it, and gladly do or bear every duty in a humble manner, and do our best. We should not fear to do too much for Christ, for our Gospel kindred, and for such as know not of this precious love. To abide in the love of Christ will bring no sorrow nor regret but joy and peace forever. 0 Lord my best desire fulfill, And help me to resign Life, health and comfort to thy will, And make thy pleasure mine. Why should I shrink at thy command, Whose love forbids my fears ; Or tremble at the gracious hand That wipes away my tears. Thine, Lord, wholly thine, Forever one with Thee : Rooted, grounded in thy love, Abiding sure and free. Yours as ever in trust, Dr. Carl Semelroth.
