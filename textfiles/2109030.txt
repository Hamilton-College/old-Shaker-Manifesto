The Bible Class. Answer to Bible question, No. 24... Answer to Bible question, No. 24, published in August Manifesto. On what day was Jesus crucified? and on what day did he rise from the grave? Five answers have been sent in from Hancock and thirteen from Canterbury. Most of them say that Jesus was crucified on Friday and rose from the grave on Sabbath morning, which was the third day. One writer says, Jesus was crucified on the 2nd. of April and rose on the 5th. which makes three days. Another says he was crucified between 9 A. M. and 3 P. M. Enfield, N. H., 12 answers. A. J. C. writes,�The Jewish Sabbath began on Friday evening and ended at the same hour on Saturday evening. Some of the Evangelists state that the crucifixion occured on the third hour while others say the sixth hour. Some writers state that every thing was done that human policy and prudence could invent, to prevent the resurrection of Jesus. In this instance after the tomb was sealed, they stationed a guard of soldiers to protect it from intruders. The women not finding the body in the tomb were greatly perplexed; but they remembered the words that he prophesied of himself, before the crucifixion, and left the sepulchre and informed the other disciples. J. E.'s answer is as follows:�Jesus was crucified on Friday, the day before the Jewish Sabbath. At midnight on Saturday, the stone which closed the entrance to the sepulchre was rolled away and an angel sat thereon. Just before the break of day, the followers of Jesus went to the tomb, carrying spices, but were told by the angel, 'He is not here, but is risen.' M. M. C.'s answer. Texts, Matt, xxviii., 1, and St. Luke xxiii., 52, 54. Matthew and the other evangelists write that Jesus was crucified on Friday and rose from the tomb on Sunday, the Christian''s Sabbath. L. D. H.'s answer:�Jesus crucified on Friday the day before the Jewish Sabbath. St. Luke xxiii., 54. He rose from the tomb on the morning of the first day of the week, which is on Sunday; as we read that the angels said unto the women who visited the tomb;�'Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified; he is risen, he is not here.'
