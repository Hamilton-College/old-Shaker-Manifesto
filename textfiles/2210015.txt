Watervliet, N. Y. Second Family. The weather has been unusually cool for this season of the year, but no frost to do any harm thus far. The past week the weather has been all we could ask for securing crops. We have more fruit than was expected, especially of plums and pears. Apples will be a fair crop. We are busy canning tomatoes and drying sweet corn. Elder Joseph and Elder Alexander Work gave us a call. Sisters Matilda Reed and Minerva Reynolds of the Church family, Mount Lebanon, made us a pleasant visit. We are always pleased to see our gospel kindred, especially so when they are like those whom we have mentioned, worthy toiling souls who have made the full sacrifice, and have consecrated their time and talents and all they possessed for the good of the cause. May we be worthy to claim relationship with such in this life, then we need not fear the future.
