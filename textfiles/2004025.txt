Canterbury, N. H. Beloved Editor ;�And do you expect us to call upon you regularly each montli with our little or big notes about home? Should you miss us if we did not come with the slight olive branch of assurance that we still live and hold our city celestial and terrestrial? Sometimes well done, and sometimes not so well but that we may improve, very much improve. We are in the last state now, needing improvement, and mean to win the 'Well done' from the power that appointed us to the trustWe have many points of good breezy matter that we could note the present month, but conclude to give you only a short story. Our Society enjoys more than usual good health, yet should you closely investigate, you would find remaining some sensitive throats, affected by trachial and bronchial inflammation, as reminders of the sins of the past or the ravages of and by ilLa Grippe.' Not every post righted, but improved�no relapse. We could tell you of wood sawei1 and being split and housed, of maple trees tapped, and slowly yielding sweet, (not salt) tears. Work not sufficiently advanced to give exact data. Also of increasing pro5perity at the barn, consequently the Dairy is looking up, which means blessing for kitchen sisters�result�plenty of good food for the.table, and plenty of dressing whicli 'was once hay (hardly wood or stubble.) We can tell you all this and yet,not touch the things we love best and the things which love us best, stay with us and comfort us when the fountains fail and the fig tree yields but leaves. We bt gin to hear the piping of spring birds, some of which regile us with pleasant songs, and then again we hear warblings from that celestial summer clime where branches are never verdureless. The words of one of these we think will please you. 'Lion-hearted, brave and true God hath not forgotten you, And his arm is sui e to do What his love hath promised. Standard-bearers, forward press By the light of holiness; Ah, no foe, no wilderness Can separate you from Him.'
