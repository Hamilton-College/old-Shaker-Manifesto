Scalds, and Burns , and how to treat them. The very simple remedy which we give has been thoroughly tried in our Society, for burns and scalds, both severe and light. It gives precedence, in our esteem, to all other articles, for its superior curative effects, its simplicity and cheapness. It would be well for every housekeeper, especially, where there are children, to keep on hand a vial of this mixture for any emergency. Take any quantity of linseed oil. according to the extent of surface burned, add to this, lime water, stirring all the time until it changes to a whitish color and becomes about the consistency of thick cream. Have also, prepared cotton-batting sufficient to cover the inflamed surface, upon which spread the mixture evenly and quickly; see that every spot showing the least inflaniation, is closely covered with the dressing, and there will be but little pain and a speedy cure. In many cases no other dressing would be necessary. If the burn is severe, it would require a longer time to heal and need a frequent application. Should the cotton get dry. remove, and wet in the preparation, covering the surface again as quickly as possible from the air. Continue this treatment until the inflamation has subsided and no farther difficulty need be apprehended. This treatment is equally good for frost bites.â€”Canterbury N. H.
