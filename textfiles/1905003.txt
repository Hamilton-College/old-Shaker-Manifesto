SHAKING THE OLD CREATION. F. W. Evans. 'Yet once more, and I shake not only the earth, but the heavens also; that all those things which can be shaken�by the truth�may be shaken, and that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.' Assuming that 'the earth' means the civil governments, founded in force� by the sword�and sustained by fraud� the laws made by the conqueror�and 'the heavens' to be theological systems that exist in combination with all such ' force and fraud ' governments, constituting them the church and state governments of all the earth, except the United States government of North America: we can begin to see why God should 'shake' them and man curse them�'curse their God and king, and look upwards,' towards a Universal Republic, composed of all the human races, under the guidance of a heavenly Father and Mother�God�as being Brethren and Sisters of one great household. All these Babylon governments are 'turned to blood'�war. They conserve the greatest good of the fewest number�the non-producers, and the greatest misery of the vast majority of producers, who do all the work and create all the wealth. The 'feudal system' is the basis of the force and fraud, war governments. Under it, women� half earth's population, and physically the weakest�'have no rights that man feels bound to respect.' She is part of man's property. The successful general, like William the Conqueror of England, parcelled out, as being his own, all the land of the nation, to his officers. These rented it to the common soldiers, to farm and work, on the terms they dictated, which allowed the farmers barely enough to support life.,�as in Ireland, and Turkey, and, indeed, in all nations in Christendom, at the present time ; where 'acre is added to acre and hous� to house,' until there is no place left for the poor, landless people. JUDGMENT DAY. 'He shall come whose right it is to reign.' Hitherto, might, not right has ruled the nations�they take the sword and perish by the sword. And the wise scientists of this world go prospecting and digging amongst their ruins, searching for the things that destroyed them� ungodly treasures�the fruit of human suffering and misery. 'The prophets prophesy lies, the priests bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it so;' and all unite 'to give their power unto the beast' of Church and State�the warring civil governments. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. ' The foundations of the earth are out of course.' They cannot be repaired ; the old building must come down. ' If the foundations are destroyed, what can either the wicked or the righteous do'�but begin again and rebuild ? A nation conquered by the swovd, its land held by the conquerors us rulers, in the name of God�'the divine right of kings'�produced the terrible cry, from outraged humanity, 'Crush the wretch!'�meaning, an Inquisition Church�'and let the last king be strangled with the entrails of the last priest,' and let us�the people� have the land for our natural, inalienable inheritance! 'Blessed are the meek' when war is abolished�'for they shall inherit the earth'�'the new earth wherein shall dwell righteousness.' HEREDITARY RULERS. An aristocracy by birth�a house of bishops�belong to the old earth, who proclaim the Jewish Bible to be the plenary Word of God ; the Jewish God of war and of generation, io be the Deity�one of three male Gods, constituting a Trinity, who constitute themselves the rulers and governors of the universe, composed of all worlds, and of all the governments on earth, except the United States of North America. And to make this no longer an exception, the church and state priesthood are now getting up petitions, signed by seven millions of priest-ridden men and women, who know not what they are doing. They are as a flock of sheep, in a safe fold, surrounded by a hungry pack of wolves, who make them break down their own protective fence, by frightening them from side to side, until the fence gives way, and they are in the power of their devourers : so will it be with the people of this non-Christian, favored, secular government, which secures to all its citizens, freedom of conscience�from the ignorant fanatic to the enlightened skeptic ; from the true Christian, to the Brahmin or Mohammedan. When they put the Trinitarian God and Christ into the American Constitution�on whose coin they have unlawfully put, uIn God we trust,' instead of, 'In gold we trust ;' which would, at least, be a truth and not a lie�liberty of conscience will be gone. The sectarian priesthood are undermining�and will move the old heavens and earth to destroy�the American government. Let freedom's friends awake to the danger ! The priesthood constitute themselves judges of all people outside their sectarian fold. They set up a book as the word of God ; then they translate, interpret and revise it, to suit their own selfish ends and purposes. On this Jewish book, they build a system of orthodox theology, -is a standard of truth for all souls. Dis.senters are heretics to be ''restrained by the sword,' when they get the civil government into their hands, and God and Christ into the constitution�meaning themselves. The civil government will then be, as in Rome, a, Holy Inquisition, in the hands of a most unholy priesthood : they will do by our souls, as the doctors are doing by our bodies. They assume that human beings can believe, by authority, anything that the orthodox church and state may dictate, regardless of evidence�'a doctrine of devils.' If they do not so believe, they are obstinate heretics, wicked blasphemers, whom it is the duty and glory of the orthodox to kill, in the service of God. To butcher, as at the slaughter of St. Bartholomew, when from seventy thousand to one hundred thousand Huguenot Protestants perished in a single night; being killed by the Catholic part of the population ; and the Pope returned thanks to God, in a Te Deum, for the church and state destruction of the best part of the inhabitants. And the Protestants are but an image of the Catholics; each sect having its Pope, who exercises all the power of the first Beast, and in the same manner, as far as they have the opportunity. PHYSICAL RESURRECTION. They believe 'that the bodies of all who have ever lived upon this earth will be reanimated, resurrected, at the Judgment day.' PROBATION. ' At death, all persons, old or young, will go, immediately, into an everlasting heaveu or an everlasting hell ; there being no probation in the next world : yet, at the Judgment Day, all must be forthcoming, iu order to find their old, earthly body ! ATONEMENT. 'As in Adam all die, and are worthy of eternal perdition, by reason of the j sin of Adam; so, in Christ, they are! saved from that perdition, by the blood of the atonement�provided they believe in it' (which I do not, in the least.) Yet the orthodox hold that the Jews are much to blame for crucifying Jesus ; although it was the only means by which any one of them ever was or will be eternally saved. Such are the dogmas of the 'first heaven and first earth,' now fast passing away, by means of the shaking that is extending, from Dr. Farrar of London, to the Andover University in America, and all over Christendom. TEN HORNS. Tpn horns�powers�grew out of the beast of Church and State. They hated 'the whore of Babylon,' and tormented her with the fire of the rational, scientific truths of geology, astronomy, chemistry, and all the science?. These were the infidels�Voloey, Voltaire, Hume, Franklin, Washington, and his bosom friend and private secretary, Thomas Paine, and Jefferson; with hosts of others, who produced the. French Revolution, and the American Revolution. In the American Revolution, it was ' Vox populi, vox Dei'�the voice of the people became the voice of God : they were the sovereign people. INALIENABLE RIGHTS. Upon these rights, a purely nonChristian, secular Government was founded : A right to be born ; to live ; and to an equal education ; and equal possession of the land. Class-education means destruction of Republican government : therefore, all children should be held in public institutions, until of age� in self-supporting, manual-labor schools. REVOLUTIONS. The rise and Call of empires that Volney records- �turnings and overturuings, upheavals and revolutions�-have ever succeeded one another, from ancient Egypt, Persia, India, Babylon, Rome, and Greece, down to our own Civil War. But there awaits a final change of Systems. vwIn the days of these kings ; the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ; but it will stand for ever. And it will break in pieces all other kingdoms in the old heavens and old earth'- �Church and State systems and all their institutions. Two forces are working to effect this� reason and revelation. INFIDELITY AND SHAKERISM. The coming revolution will not be personal or national�a change of rulers, or the ups and downs of a single people or race ; but a change of principles, applicable to the whole of the human race. The revolution will be for the permanent benefit of all mankind. A new heaven and a new earth. Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y.
