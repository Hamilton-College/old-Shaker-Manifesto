ONLY REMEMBERED. R. A. SHEPARD. ' Only remembered for what I have done, ' By conquests achieved, by victories won Over all selfish and sinful desires,� To remembrance like this my heart only aspires. Then I will be valiant, be watchful and true, My imbred foes conquer and passions subdue; The good of my neighbor as my own I'll cherish, All selfishness, leave it forever to perish. � Canterbury, A. H.
