CORRESPONDENCE Dear Children: A happy new year... Enfield, Conn., 1886. Dear Children :ï¿½A Happy New Year to you all. How swiftly the years pass away. Make the most of this one. Turn over a new leaf in the volume of your lives, and on it write virtuous deeds. Each new year seems like a golden promise, and may this one hold a germ of abiding joy for you. What of the past year's journey? Have you made progress heavenward, or taken steps backward? There is no standing still. The question is a serious one for you to consider. So many things left undone, so many neglected opportunities dropped along the wayside never to be recovered, you would gladly turn back and gather them up. But alas ! only the present is yours. In reaching for things that are past, you too often reap 'a harvest of vain regrets. ' It is time for good resolves, for better endeavois, and a purer life. Virtuous living is worth more than resolutions. It is not enough to mean well. Do well. 'Live unspotted from sin. ' Never put off vows of amendment. 'One moment today is worth two tomorrow. ' No day like today. If your today is well spent, lasting' happiness will be yours. Time well improved brings peace to the spirit, Cherish a noble ideal and strive to live up to it. Grow better today than you did yesterday; better this week than you did last; better tins year than you did last year. [n eternity you will appear in the garment that you have formed during your earthly pilgrimage. There may you meet, sometime, and there may you greet each other in the happiest of all New Years. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
