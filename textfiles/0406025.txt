Lines written for, and read at the funeral of Sister Nancy Osment By E. H. W. Pearly gates, are ye unfolding To receive from earth a soul ? Angel guides, O, are ye holding Her, in strong and tirm control? Bearing from our life a mother, Who did tenderly impart, To each sister, and each brother, Love to soothe the weary heart. Shall we see no more her presence, Beaming gladsomeness around? Shall we long for spirit-presence, When no more her smile is found? Dark and lonely, if no angel Lights with joy the narrow way — If no heaven-sent Evangel Cheers us with its blessed ray. Never fear! I hear her whisper ; Trust in God and I'll be near; Ye are my interest — my treasure — Let your hearts be of good cheer. Just the thinnest veil between us, Loving souls 'twill not divide; Mother's love around — within us — O, how sweet to there abide! Mother's love! how like a glory, Pure and blest encompass'd her* Made her life a record holy, Of the Christ that dwelt in her. Leave thy mantle, O beloved, As the mortal drops from view I Comforter that Jesus promised. Still remain to bear us through. Not one sad farewell we'll utter! No more tears bedimour eyes! May thy peace be as a river; Hush'd be all our selfish sighs. Striving for a world's uplifting We'll unite with saints above, Stem all careless downward drifting, Till we perfect grow in love.
