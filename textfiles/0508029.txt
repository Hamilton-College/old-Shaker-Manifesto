PERFECTION My God, my home, my precious call, Ideal grace unfold ; I see that glory in them all, Which ancient seers foretold. My God is perfect, true and wise, And while this God is mine, Perfection will alone- suffice In life that is divine. IIow much salvation do we ask ? For it a price we give, If only from the grosser ills, From these remote we live. If we desire the saving power, From every thought of sin, We give our all, from hour to hour, 'Till we perfection win. Mary Whitcher, Canterbury, N. H.
