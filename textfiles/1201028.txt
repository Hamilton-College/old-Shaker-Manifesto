Canaan, N. Y. Dec. 1881 Beloved Sister L. ;—I received your little missive on the 14th. inst. which was very acceptable. You speak of its being a task for you to discipline yourself to a perfection in penmanship and letter writing. I agree with you in this, although as I practice I find that it becomes much easier. This afternoon a large number of the brethren and sisters are attending the funeral of an aged sister at another family, one whose death impressed my mind with the importance of so living, that I shall not fear to meet my reward when the angel Reaper shall call my spirit to its final home. She was well beloved by all who knew her, for she had been a faithful Christian for many years and was fully prepared to make the change. I rejoice that m\ lot has been cast with the faithful followers of Christ, and I am resolved to stand flrm in the faith that calls me to a life of purity and self-denial, to sacrifice selfish inclinations for the good and happiness of others. — There is a high wind today and it is exceedingly cold. But what matters the weather without? If true Christian love reigns in SHAKER MANIFESTO. 19 our hearts it will be all cheerful and pleasant within. Please accept my love with that of all my dear companions, and thank Sister A. for the proposition she made for you to address me. I should be pleased to hear from you again. Affectionately, Your Sister, E. E. H.
