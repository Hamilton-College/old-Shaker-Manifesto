Thoughts of the absent and of our day and time May Whitcher Tis not for the departed That we are called to weep, Or for the honest hearted Who still their vigils keep. But for an aid in Zion Of equal strength and care Her inmates can rely on And all the needy share. Something must fill this measure A living pool to stand, Or Zion lacks the treasure Required at her hand. Some one must hold her order, Obey her saered truth, Maintain her virgin whiteness, Or who shall know her worth? Where is the burden falling Where are the hands well staid And where the feet established Through living faith obeyed? And can we lose our birthright When called the chosen seed, Or shall we hold our standing Till we are free indeed? The spirit answers in us, We must obey our light, And walk in true uprightness If we maintain the right. No longer point the pathway But place our feet therein, And from the morn till evening Sin not, nor lead to sin, Duties are always with us And those who need our care, And as we give, we're given Increase for all we share. 7 THE MANIFESTO. 'Tis not a fabled story, But those who keep the word, They know and feel the glory And power of their God, To walk above earth's darkness Her groveling and her sin, Above all nature's cravings With spirit pure and clean. Then keep the standard waving The cro s we'll not bring down But every trial braving Till ours, the Conqueror's crown. Canterbury, N. H.
