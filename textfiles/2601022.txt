White Water, O. Nov. 1895. The Manifesto is a regular and welcome visitor to our home, and no doubt also to the homes of the United Societies of Believers throughout the land. It is ever filled with welcome and cheerful notes and news from some of the members of the great sister and brotherhood of Shakers. In these parts wTe have had a very long dry spell, as the farmers term it, lasting almost five months without interruption causing many of our products to fall short. Wheat sown in the early fall has not come up yet for want of rain, even live stock have had a very hard time. But now the long-wished and prayed-for rain has come, and for nearly twenty-four hours it has been raining without interruption, reminding us again of the fact that the supreme Ruler of the universe, sends us all good and needful things at the proper time, making good these words: 'So long as the earth shall stand, there shall not cease seed-time and harvest;' all we have to do is to learn to labor and wait. The very fact that it rains and that the sun shines upon and for all, is a very strong argument in favor of communistic life, in the dispen- sation of these great blessings. There are no step-children, all share alike. Selfish- ness has no place in nature, except in the heart of man where, on account of his high estate, it ought least to be. John (J. Ludivig. Dec. 1895 In looking over the Nov. number of The Manifesto I find that White Water is not represented, which I think is an oversight. I like to read the home items to know what our gospel Brethren and Sisters are doing. It is encouragement given from the right source. Eecently we enjoyed a visit from two of our Sisters from South Union, and one Brother and four Sisters from Watervliet, O. which was a source of great pleasure. The dry season which has prevailed for so long a time, is at last broken. We are now having an abundance of rain. Some three inches fell at one time. Our crops were injured to some extent by the drouth, but.still we are thankful. THE MANIFESTO. 23 Some improvements are in progress, which take time and money. Our little family numbers nineteen members, and there are about as many Brothers as Sisters. With this little note I want to wish all our gospel friends a happy and prosperous New Year. L. Parker
