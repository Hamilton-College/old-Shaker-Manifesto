HYGIENIC HINTS. Wm. A. English, M. D. It is certain that unless we supply such articles of food as contain the elements needed to build up the tissues and organs, and replenish the waste occasioned by the various activities of the human body, this body will soon become unfitted to perform its daily functions. The following suggestions may be useful to those who are interested in this subject, at least, by way of stimulating further investigation: 'Prove all things.' The principal requisites of perfect food, (after being assured that it is outwardly pure and clean) are as follows :� First: It should be agreeable to the sense of smell. Second: It should be decidedly palatableThird: It should be (according to our reason and experience,) nutritious and digestible, and in such condition as to admit of thorough mastication and insalivation. Fourth : There should be sufficient variety, at different meals, and change, at different seasons, to meet the varying demands of the system. Fifth: It should be as fresh as possible; (but this will be further explained.) Sixth: As a general rule, simples are preferable : but in case of compounds, no ingredient entering into the preparation should be such as would be unwholesome if eaten separately. Seventh : No stage of the processes of securing our food, or preparing it for market, or for cooking, should be repulsive to our feelings, or to the sensibilities of our spiritual natures. Let us now consider the above points more in detail. First: The nose, from its position directly over the mouth, is a useful sentinel, always on guard to detect the aroma of every substance that comes near ; and we should heed its warnings implicitly, and allow nothing to enter the mouth that is repulsive to the sense of smell; yet this sense, like all the others, should be guided by reason, for it is not always wise to eat every article that 'smells good.' If the aroma is not masked by compounding or high seasoning, this agreeable smell simply testifies that the food elements are in harmony with elements previously assimilated, and by eating or drinking unwholesome articles, like tobacco and alcoholic drinks, we may finally acquire a liking for their aroma. The animals naturally obey the sense of smell, and never partake of anything repugnant to it. We could learn some lessons from animals, if we were sufficiently teachable. Second: Food that is not palatable is never perfectly assimilated, for the digestive fluids and nerve forces do not respond as fully to an unpalatable morsel. There are idiosyncrasies of taste belonging to certain persons, these should be duly respected, and generally are of pre-natal origin. Third � While considering the nutritious value of food, a practice which has grown out of the ignorance of the masses in regard to the essentials of proper food must not be overlooked. I allude to the separation and exclusion of a large portion of the valuable elements of the grain, in the manufacture of superfine flour, which is so impoverished by this suicidal process, as to be unfit for the general use of those who eat to live, rather than to conform to foolish or fashionable customs. It is found that even a dog will starve when confined exclusively to the food products of superfine flour; and chemistry solves the problem for us, by proving that the better part of the elements that build up our tissues, are not to be found in such flour. Grains in their natural condition, boiled whole, cracked or ground into meal, so as to retain all these elements, form a highly nutritious class of foods, and, together with the leguminous seeds, (peas, beans, lentils, etc.) and nuts, comprise our most nutritious foods. Each individual seed, kernel, or nut contains a germ of life, capable, under favorable conditions, of developing to such* an extent as to reproduce its species. It would seem a very natural inference that food containing so much of the life-principle must be superior, in dietetic value, to food taken from the carcass or tissues of an animal, from which not only the life-blood but the life-principle itself�the organizing force�has departed. The various classes of seeds above mentioned, with fresh vegetables in their season, and fruits to supply the necessary fluid elements, combined with aromas and flavors of such wonderful delicacy and variety, together with milk, butter, cheese, (and possibly eggs,) form a dietary fit for a king, or for an American citizen; each one of whom should be a true king. But the question of the digestibility of food cannot be reduced to cast-iron rules, owing to different conditions arising from previous habits, environments, etc., and, though vegetarianism is undoubtedly the ideal dietary, it would be very unwise to counsel all people to adopt it at once; for, by ages of flesh eating, the digestive organs become so accustomed to it, that, with most people, its sudden disuse, would be attended with considerable physical discomfort. It would be folly to ignore any individual's experience, as to what agrees or disagrees, in the line of food; so, each one must, in a large measure, be his or her own judge, yet we should endeavor to perfect our ideals; and our appetites and desires will gradually conform to them. * * * Fourth: A monotonous diet is not adapted to the proper development of the race, or the individual. Our physical and mental activities are so varied; our temperaments so dissimilar ; our pre-natal proclivities, and our environments and habits so very unlike, that the necessity for variety at meals, and change from time to time, is sufficiently apparent. Fifth: All organic material used as food, tends to decay, after reaching its highest stage of perfection, and should be eaten when most highly endowed with the life-principle. This applies with especial force to garden vegetables which, not being matured, rapidly wither, and become stale and unwholesome. All kinds of flour and meal should be eaten as soon as possible after being ground, as it is then constantly parting with its finer liftelements. All food tends to deteriorate rapidly, after cooking; and, if allowed to remain long uncovered, absorbs atmospheric germs which are disease-producing. The more moist the food is, the more danger there will be. Milk, water, and all fluids cooked or uncooked, rapidly absorb injurious gases and microscopic germs from the atmosphere, if allowed to remain uncovered or unsealed; more especially in warm weather. Nuts and some kinds of fru\ts, though they will keep a long time, should never be eaten after their flavor becomes impaired. Sixth: Food that is compounded of different articles, and highly seasoned, should be regarded with suspicion, especially if meat is a leading ingredient; for it is customary with those who prepare these compounds for sale, to use a very poor article of flesh, and mask the inferiority by plenty of salt, pepper, and other condiments. Those abominations of modern cookery� pies, cakes, and puddings�which are made for gustatory pleasure, regardless of consequences, and often contain some of that delectable substance called lard, might, with propriety be given to that class of animal scavengers from which the lard is obtained : GO they are not fit to enter tie human stomach� (unless belonging to some one closely allied �psychically�to the animal referred to.) No ingredient that is not first-class, should ever enter into any dietetic compound, and simple food is usually preferable. Seventh: As the occupation of gathering and preparing grains, nuts and fruits for the table is pleasurable, and not in any sense repulsive to our higher sensibilities, and as these kinds of food contain all the necessary elements of nutrition, why does man continue the practice of slaughtering innocent animals and devouring their dead bodies? This practice, unless one has become hardened by it, cannot be engaged in without experiencing a severe shock to the higher nature. The Esoteric
