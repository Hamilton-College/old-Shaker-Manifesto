PASSED AWAY. With this present number the twelve months of 1888 will have passed away. Months of vital interest to every active worker in the cause of righteousness and peace. To us, they can return no more ; and, indeed, we have no occasion to wish their return, as all our deeds of loving faithfulness will bring their commensurate reward; while on the other hand, if we have an accumulation of broken promises or neglected duties we must undoubtedly suffer a corresponding penalty. All along through these varied seasons we have not been left to toil alone, nor have we been left to mourn over the unfruitfulness of the Christian life. God's goodness has been to us a never-failing fountain, 'a well of waters springing up unto everlasting life.' Bounteous gifts from the hands of a Heavenly Father and Mother have been conferred upon us for encouragement and for distribution among those less favored with these divine blessings. In many, very many things we have great reason for rejoicing, while in others, as might be supposed, we may have some cause for regret. It will, indeed, be a bright, spiritual season, well worthy to be a part of the incoming millennium, when we can count the full year of twelve months, in which there is no sin, no sorrow or even a 'shadow of turning.' Whatever may have crossed our path in these twelve months, bearing in the least, a relation to these conditions of mind and manner, we still may rejoice in all the battles that have been fought, in all the victories achieved, and that we are yet able to make renewed determinations to march on toward the Holy City. In this we have the daily lesson as it is brought before the Christian mind, and into which he should throw all the zeal and patient persistence of an unreserved interest. The gospel testimony requires all this of everyone who names the name of Christ. In this way we accept the opportunity to diffuse spiritual life and light, by which much good may be accomplished. I trust that we may review with much pleasure, the work through which we, so recently, have passed, and take courage in the assurance that many evils have been overcome, many enemies of the cross slain, and many false spirits cast out. Such a gospel work as this may entitle us to a share in the promises, by which we may receive a new name and a beautiful home in the City of our God. When the mind of the Revelator was illuminated to see that most lovely abode, the Kew Jerusalem, as it came down from God, out of heaven, he saw in the fulness of its glory, the heavenly reward which was promised to those who had obtained a victory over the elements of the world. It was the city of the living God, the abode of the meek, the merciful and the pure in heart. We trust that in this review of the year so soon to close, our readers may be able to find their own case so clearly illustrated that there need be no hesitancy in accepting it. Add or diminish as may be required to suit the emergency but do not fail to find time before the thirty-first day of December, to establish in the heart, a determination to love God and to work righteousness during the year 1889. Write out a list of moral obligations and then have the force of character to make them practical. Go farther, ï¿½enter the spiritual realm and 'Seek first the Kingdom of God and its righteousness.' 'Deny thyself of all ungodliness and every worldly lust.' There need be no fear in accepting these few lessons in self-denial as in or out of the church, they may have a very salutary influence upon the mind.
