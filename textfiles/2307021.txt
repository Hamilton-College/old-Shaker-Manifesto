Ayer, Mass. June, 1893. Beloved Elder Heney:ï¿½For some time I have threatened to trouble you with my pen, and fear I should not have put it into execution only that Elder Andrew has asked me to represent Harvard in next issue of Manifesto. Business first, is the motto. Will ask you to be so kind as to send us one dozen of your last issue of Hymns and Songs with bill of the same. We shall also want a few copies of the 'History of the Shakers' when ready. It is a work often called for. Time has hurried us through a long, severe winter, but it has not obliterated from our memory the splendid visit we were privileged to enjoy at your charming home; neither has it robbed us of the great good we received at your hands, nor the pleasure we enjoyed with your people. We are very much interested in the June Manifesto, especially in 'Halt and Consider.' It is a seasonable call and may we heed it. Are we not fulfilling the prophecies uttered in the days of our prosperity, of what would occur if we did not yield obedience to God's laws, as He has often manifested them, in all ages, to his people? In the twenty-eighth chapter of Deut., is recorded the terms of prosperity which holds good to this day. The late season has necessitated an amount of push and tact to accomplish the farm and garden work on time; but it has been ably and heroically done, and we are now ready for harvesting the hay crop, and praying for a blessing upon our labors.
