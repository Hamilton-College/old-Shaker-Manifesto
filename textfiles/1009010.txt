THE PRAYER MEETING BELL Emma A. Lent I cannot go to church to-night, The room is closed, the gas is bright, And then my head don't feel just right, 'And I'm not very well. Perhaps 1 really ought to go, But then the brethren vex me so, They pray so long, and speak so slow, Oh dear me ! there's the bell. I'm sure they need not look to me, I have my work, as all must see, Besides, my friends were here to tea, And they know that full well, And I have been out once to-day, And it is quite proper I should stay At home to-night ; but, by the way, ilow long they ring that bell. I wish I knew just who'll be there, And who will make the opening prayer, But then there's dampness in the air, And I'm not over well. For just last week I had a cold, And looked quite faded I was told, Oh well! I guess I am growing old, Is that the second bell ? Our pastor made an earnest plea, That all would come ; but 1 can't see As that is any thing to me, When I'm not feeling .well. By stitching now with all my might. These ruffles I may finish quite, For it is too late to go to-night, That was the second bell I'm glad the bell is quiet now, It troubled me I must allow, I wish I had not made that vow, To go when I was well. I promised I would always aid, And do whatever conscience said, Ah me ! I wish I had obeyed The summons of that bell. Oh Father ! on my bended knee In all my guilt without a plea For pardon now I come to Thee, My heart Thou know'st well, Would feign disown the blessing sweet, Of health, and strength, and try to cheat My soul in believing it were meet, Thus to ignore the bell. My Lord, I know that Thou art there To bless Thy people bowed in prayer, My sin sick soul I pray Thee spare, And make it pure and well. And then again 1 will not stray, Or from Thy presence turn away, But with glad heart henceforth obey The calling of that bell. Bexford Flats, N. Y.
