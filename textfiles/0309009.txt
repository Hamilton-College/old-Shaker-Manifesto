CONFESSION OF SINS There is, at the present time, great excitement, in England, upon the subject of confession of sins. It has got into Parliament. Under the Church-and-State Government of England, the Upper House — Lords temporal and spiritual — has the care of the souls and bodies of the people. Their theology is still cut and dried to order, just as our orthodox priests are hankering to cut and dry it for the people of America, Shakers included. Four hundred and eighty-three priests have signed and sent to Parliament the following Petition: ' That, in view of the widespread and increasing use of sacramental confession, your .Right Reverend House may consider the advisability of providing for the education, selection, and licensing of duly-qualified confessors, in accordance with the provisions of canon law.' Of course the English objections to this are, first, The principle is anti-Protestant; second, That it means Roman Catholic Church-andState, instead of ' the Establishment.' As things are going, the Pope may pretty soon emigrate to England; unless Infidelity, Spiritualism, Rationalism, and Shakerism, rise up as opposing powers, and saving influences. The logical end of Protestantism is Catholicism. And, when they coalesce, all the above opposing powers will also coalesce, and it will be the battle of ' Gog and Magog around the camp of the saints.' Then the ' unwalled villages ' will have to be protected by fire from heaven — Divine Spiritualism.
