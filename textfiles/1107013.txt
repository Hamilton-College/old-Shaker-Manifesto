MONOPOLY EDITORIAL NOTES. Beware of those engaged in monopolizing the fruits of other's labors. Beware of the Corruptionist ! There never was a time when so-called men were cheaper; when Legislatures could be procured easier; when courts could be suborned with so little money, and when so little indignation rested among the people! We hope, if there is a God of nations, who has cognizance of the doings of the governments of this country and the world, that there may be, if necessary, a revolutionary volcano that Will burst asunder the moxopoly of our church, of other churches and of The States and 'General Government, never more to be consolidated. Corruption walks upright, and among the powerful; let the apparently powerless take on courage and feel strong in their position of innocence. Corruption never did exist long without discovery, in high nor low places.
