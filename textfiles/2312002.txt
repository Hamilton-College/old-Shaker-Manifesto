SOUTH UNION. No. 2. Three more missionarips were sent to Kentucky in July, from the Society at New Lebanon :�David Darrow, Daniel Moseley and Solomon King. With this able re-inforcement, a. greater work was accomplished, and the testimony of truth spread with w nderful rapidity among those who were religiously inclined. In the month of December, the Believers had another experience with some lawless characters, who surrounded the house when a meeting was being held. The mob did some screaming and tooting and then finished their work by breaking the glass in several of the windows. The missionaries at this time, had so far progressed, that they held in thvir ranks, several of the most able ministers of the revival. John Dunlavy, Richard Me Nemar and Matthew Houston were ordained Ministers of the Presbyterian church, and Iy their wellordered lives had maintained a powerful influence over the minds of the people. On the 15th of July, 1806, Elders Issachar Bates, Benjamin S. Youngs with Richard Me Nemar, again visited Kentucky. It Avas a disagreeable journey on account of the cold weather, and some four inches of snow on the ground. On the 22nd, they attended a meeting, but they represent it as a Babel of confusion. A large company of rude characters were present, evidently to make disturbance. Although the meeting continued some four hours, the Brethren found THE MANIFESTO. 277 no opportunity to eueak, as the confusion of singing and dancing aud speaking by these disturbers of the meeting was so great that the Brethren thought it prudent to remain quiet. On the 23rd of February, 1806, the Brethren attended a meeting at Paint Lick, where some three-hundred people had gathered. The service was held at intervals throughout the day and then through most of the night. People of all religious persuasions living n this part of the country, were in attendance and took part in the services. An assembly of a thousand persons met on the 8th of June, and were addressed by Elder Benjamin S. Youngs. He spoke for an hour and a half. Some disturbance was attempted, but for so vast a multitude, the people behaved very well. It was in this meeting that the first colored man accepted the faith. He was a slave of a man by the name of Fisher. Elder Issachar Bates writes,�After we had gathered a goodly number of souls in Ohio and northern Kentucky, several of us went into Kentucky, Logan Co., and gathered some twentythree lovely souls of adult age. Two of the Brethren had occasion to go- to Long Lick to obtain a load of salt. Following the custom of the Believers, they knelt by the side of the table, before and after eating. The hostess seeing this new feature was anxious to know about these two men, and accordingly asked,� Are you Quakers? Nay. What are you? We are Shakers. From this little instance, the whole family were converted to the faith. These missionaries were obliged to accommodate themselves to their surroundings, as best they could. Their meetings were sometimes held in the woods, and the speaker was obliged to stand on a log while preaching, that his voice might be heard distinctly. At other times they held their meetings in the house of some friend, or in a school-house or even in the drive way of a barn. The word of God must be delivered and these messengers soon found it to be a duty to hold their meetings where they could find a company ready to receive it. [Elder Benjamin relates the following of himself as a miraculous preservation or a special Providence, in being protected from abuse at the hands of three sons of Belial. Ed.] Benj.�I left Matthew Houston's home and rode nine miles to the dwelling of Francis Sasseen. When near Lancester, I met three men on horseback. After passing me a few steps, they ordered me to stop. One of the company then said to me,� Ihree.�Where are you going? Benj.�Toward Danville. Three.�What are you going to do there ? Benj.�Why? Three.�Because we do not suffer such fellows as you are to travel through our country. No Quaker has a right to pass through these parts. Benj.�I am not a Quaker. Three.�You look like one by your dress. Benj.�It seems strange that persons like you who appear to be gentle- 278 the: manifesto. men, should so insult a man, peaceably traveling on the road. They then rode nearer to me and with an oath demanded,� Three.�What is your profession? Benj.�My profession is to treat people civilly. They repeated the question and received the same answer. Three.�Do you know Matthew Houston ? Benj.�I do, very well. Three.�Are you one of the same profession ? Benj.�I am. Three.�Is he not a Quaker? Benj.�Nay. Three.�He is not ? Benj.�Nay, not a Quaker. Three.�Is not this like the Quakers, to say Yea and Nay ? Benj.�It is not. Ihree.�What do the Quakers say? Benj.�They say Yes and No. At this they laughed and began to make mockery with their speech. TJiree.�Is your name little Benjamin? Benj.�My name is Benjamin. Three.�This, then is the great Benjamin of whom there is so much talk, who goes about to seduce the people, accumulating property and making disturbance among peaceable people. If you live as you say you do, why do you commit fornication? Benj.�I know of no such thing as you testify. Three.�We have no doubt of it. We have it from respectable witnesses. Benj.�That is immaterial so long as I can look you all in the face with a clear conscience. Three.�We do not believe you. Benj.�1 have not said that 1 am without temptation. 'The disciple is not above his Lord.' I was kept under this ordeal till near dark. Perceiving myself in wicked hands, and in danger of my life, I turned my horse to get awny, but one of the men rode close to my bide and caught hold of me. Another rode to the opposite side and took me by the arm, while the third pulled off my hat. Being held in this position, I entreated them earnestly to let me go, but th-y would not. Three.�You had better keep quiet, as we have for a long time intended to whip you, and if we should take off your head, it would not be a sin. Benj.�They then began to swear at me. Three.�Will you promise that you will not come into this part of the country again? Benj.�I have no present intention of coming again, but could not tell about it, as I wish to do my duty. I expect now to go to Danville and then to Ohio, and may go on to New Lebanon, but what I shall do, I can not tell. Three.�If you will not promise, we will take the flesh from your bones. Benj.�It is against my conscience to so promise, and I can not do it.- I am in your hands. Do with me as you will, but I can not bind my conscience with any such promise. They then ordered me to dismount, and repeated the above a second time, and then apparently made a move to pull me from my horse, when to my great joy they heard the sound of a trumpet. This alarmed them and starting for their horses they said,�Let us THE MANIFESTO. 279 be going. Soon the noise ceased and they were encouraged in their design, as no one came in sight. Three.�You have intended never to come into these parts again, and if we ever catch you here, take our word for it, we will take the flesh off your bones. Benj.�I have no intention one way or the other. I do not know but that I may return in ten days, but I have no intention. They then took my hat and threw it into the woods and rode away. After leaving them, i went on to Lancaster. I had passed through a very distressing scene but by the Providence of God, I had found a way of deliverance. (to bk continued.)
