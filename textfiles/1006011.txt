OUR REST Elijah Myrick. TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF ELDJSH GROVE BLANCIIA11D. If is true, dear father, you are weary of earth, As from its joys and its sorrows you now disappear. That the spirit and soul with its priceless worth, Should pass on to rest like the departing year. Have the battles of life e'er made you to feel That earth's most royal gifts are comparative dross ? Have life's gains with the sunshine that love can reveal, Taught you how much of gain, how little of loss? If so to my seeming, your theme must have been Through the duties of life for this change to prepare; Dispelling the mists, that would darken the sun That has lightened your way ' to a dwelling place there.' The birds and the blossom, the stars overhead, Are some of our teachers, whose lessons sublime Never hint that inclosed in the realms misnamed dead, The soul ever sleeps through the annals of time. That weariness conies like the eveningshades, To wrap in its mantle the heart and the mind, And soothe them to rest while the outer world fades, While the soul drops its fetters, more freedom to find. The state of the present, is simply the shell Of the spirit that waits for its breaking, to free The mind, whose immortal unfoldings shall toll The life that is waiting, for you and forme. We ask for that rest that will bring to the soul, A knowledge of justice, of mercy and love; Where reason shall rule, with its welcome control, While mind vies with mind in haste to approve. And we firmly believe that time will reveal The fact that mankind in the future shall be Redeemed from the errors which keenly we feel, When rest with the truth, is the state of the free. And we mourn not for those who are passing along, To that blessed spirit-realm of earth just above, So while you are greeting the celestial throng, We will join with the angels, and give you our love.
