Humanity Humanity for Oct. mid Nov. has a discourse by Dr. J. E. Roberts who is denominated a minister of this world. This article is 'Con- cerning Prayer' and to read it is to be made better. Among the many good things that are said is this 'Religion is to live well, to do justice, to love mercy and to be fraternal and kind.' 'Is he a Good Man,' can be read very profitably several times. Other nice articles may be found in this same number, which may require a careful study, and a thoughtful consideration. Publisht at Kansas City, Mo.
