1883. Marion Patric. A New Year has dawned upon us, bringing its train of peculiar thoughts, and aspirations as the Spring brings buds and blossoms. All the experiences of the Year come up afresh, and as we count up our sorrows, and number our blessings, how does the balance find us ? Not as way-worn, weary travellers, melancholy, and depressed; but with the guiding star of Hope, we stand upon the hill-top of this New Year, and with heart-felt gratitude press forward to gain new victories, for we cannot wrap ourselves in the downy mantle of indifference and say we have no more to do. What we have failed to accomplish in the past, we hope to do in the future, and therefore would consecrate ourselves anew to the service that lies nearest and dearest to our hearts. Enfield, Conn.
