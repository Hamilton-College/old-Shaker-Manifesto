LABOR. Annie K. Stephens. 'In the sweat of thy brow shalt ihou eat bread.' 'Blest work, if thou wert cursed of God, What must his blessings be.' These two quotations, though diverse in spirit refer to the same principle. The first taken from the most ancient Christian literature portrays the undeveloped condition of the people of that day, when mankind considered manual labor a curse of God, sent as a condemnation for their disobedience. This idea has been handed down through the ages, though somewhat modified, and those who have been so fortunate or rather unfortunate as to be placed in circumstances that did not require bodily exertion to sustain their physical needs, have deemed labor a degradation, and looked down upon those that the decrees of fate had placed differently, as inferior beings, unworthy of their association. What a misconception of that glorious blessing, that God ordained should be a mercy instead of a curse ; we are glad that such sophistries hoary with age are giving place to progress and enlightenment. Wealth and idleness have been the monarehs that have ruled the world with relentless sway ; they have won honor, fame, distinction ; while plodding hard labor, the rightful inheritor, has been degraded and oppressed by the power of accumulated wealth. What means this great agitation of thought that is going on in all civilized countries? what mean the strikes, the great labor organizations ? they seem to me the commencement of a great volcanic eruption, that is yet to shake the whole fabric of monopolies to pieces ; then, can we build a structure whose foundation shall be equality ; procuring equal rights to all and privileges to none. I feel utterly incapable of solving this vast problem, but the deep conviction of my heart is, that as more of the divine spirit of love seeks to rule human hearts, selfishness and avarice will give place to its indomitable sway, and mankind will be lifted up above petty personal interests, thus striving for a universal Brotherhood and Sisterhood, where the welfare of each shall be bound up in the welfare of all. Just now I am strongly reminded of Peter the Great, the Czar of Russia, who reigned in the sixteenth century. Though charged with many obnoxious qualities, there was one trait he possessed that is truly worthy of a noble mind. Wishing to enrich his empire with the knowledge of more civilized countries, he left the luxury of a court and traveled through various places as a private person, employing him-elf as a workman at the dockyards, laboring with his own hands, being fed and clad like the rest of his fellow-workmen. Thus he gained knowledge, and a practical experience ; the fruits of which he employed for the benefit of his kingdom and its subjects. Many of his successors might pattern from this example, instead of living in luxury and extravagance, obtained by the oppression of the lower classes. Labor is worthy of all honor ! Stop the brawny arm of labor and the world's commerce is paralyzed. It is true that we havs chained the lightning's flash, ;md bound the forces of steam to do our bidding ; but what are they unless directed by the hand aud intelligence of man. It is labor that has builded cities and towns, reared lofty structures that are the glory and pride of nations. It is labor that has turned a 'rocky soil to gold,' and made the wilderness fertile ; it has spanned mighiy rivers, tunneled mountains, banded continents with steel, joined hemispheres with electric wires, and channeled the ocean's tide to bear its fleets of oak and iron and their cargoes to distant lands. Reverting to the second quotation at the commencement of this article, its beautiful sentiment speaks to our souls, and we feel that labor is an imperative duty, devolving upon us all according to ability. The bee gathering the sweets from a thousand flowers, the ant toiling over its miniature burden, the beaver at his dam, and all the active forces of nature tell us that man is made for labor. The formation of the body, its muscles and sinews ; the construction of the hand, and the divine law of right and duty, written on our own souls, issue the same edict. Idleness is the parent of all evil; while labor is healthful and developing to the soul and mind,ï¿½the 'great principle that carries men and nations onward ;' it is only when there is no heart or mind in it, that it becomes mere drudgery. No matter how humble our avocations, let us vitalize them with earnestness, devotion and intelligence, thus proving to our satisfaction the true nobility of labor. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
