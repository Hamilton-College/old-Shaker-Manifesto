Augustus Woodbury It is the providential arrangement, that some men shall sow the seed, and other men shall reap the harvests ; that some shall fight the battle, and others enjoy the fruits of victory. It is the sign of human weakness, and perhaps of human ingratitude, that those who reap and enjoy should forget those who sowed and fought.â€”Rev. , at the funeral of George G. Fogg.
