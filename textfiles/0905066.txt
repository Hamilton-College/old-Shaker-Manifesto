Life of Benj. F. BUTLER T. A. Bland by Lee and Shepard, Publishers, Boston, Mass. Worthy to be read by every lover of his country. ' Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate, nor set down ought in malice.' We are not politicians ; but when Congress, the President, and all leading officials of Government, tender thanks and grateful acknowledgments to an individual for very important and valuable services rendered our nation, it is wise for individuals to read, become informed, and reflect, before passing censorious criticism. We know B. F. Butler much better for the reading of this little work; and he has our much larger respect for the knowledge.
