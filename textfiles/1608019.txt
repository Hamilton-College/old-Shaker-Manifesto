THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT. B. M. 'The fruit of the spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Goodness, Gentleness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance; against such there is no law. ' M. A. W. I am the vine, said Jesus, And ye the branches are ; If ye abide in me, Much fruit ye all shall bear Continue in my love, and I your Friend will be? No harm shall e'er befall Those who truly [follow me. M. 1). ' He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love. ' All sing : God is Love we sing with gladness, God is Love repeat it gently Sing as angels sing above ; In Echoes from the world above ; May our hearts is found no sadness, our thoughts, our every action God is wisdom, God is Love. Merit blessing as God's Love. The Lord preserveth J. E. ' There's a song of praise in my heart tonight And a gladness no words can tell, As I think of the love that is holding me, That never can change or fail. Other love may grow cold as the years roll by; Other friends may forgetful be; But Christ can never forget his own Through the years of eternity. Sorrows may gather about my path; Kind friends may be borne from my side; But the arms everlasting around me fold, them that love Him. And still I in peace abide. He hath promised me strength for the stormy days As well as for those that are bright; He hath bidden me rest in his loving care In the darkness as well as the light.' E. K. ' God is Love, saith the Evangel. And our world of woe and sin Is made light and happy only When a love is shining in. ' All sing : We are sowing, daily sowing Seed, in future fruit to bear; Shall the harvest bring us blessing Or yield us anxious care? Heaven guide us, Angels aid us. As we work we'll watch and pray Thus we'll scatter seeds of goodness To blossom in another's way. all M. A. W. What is Joy? M. D. A Deity believed is joy begun. C. H. S. A Deity adored is joy advanced J. E. W. A Deity beloved is joy matured. M. A. W. Chant : Thou wilt show me the path of life, In thy presence is fulness of joy. All chant: And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; They shall obtain joy and glad ness And sorrow and sighing shall flee away. M. A. W. Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. J. E. ' Poor 'worldling! stay thy vain pursuit of peace In empty vanities : no good can live Children sing, In all the gilded charms that mock thee : cease Thy hold on these; loose every cord, and hear The voice of God : ' Come ye that weary are Ye heavy laden, come, and I will give You rest. ' Oh ! heed that call! in holy fear, In deep humility, bow down : the star [release. Oi hope shall rise, and joy shall speak thy soul's theme from virgin lives springing? 'Tis j'oy, joy! the pure in heart shall see God; Peace, peace shall crown their faithful labors. C. H. S. 'In active health or sad disease O ne'er forget that precious word� lie shall be kept in perfect peace, Whose soul is stayed on God. ' M. A. W. Sing: The Lord is long suffering and of great mercy. What is the theme our angel friends are singing? What is the Youth, reply, But Thou O Lord art a God full of compassion and gracious, long suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth. J. E. W 'There is a day of sunny rest For every dark and troubled night; Though grief may bide an evening guest, Yet joy shall come with early light. For God hath marked each sorrowing day, And numbered every secret tear, And heaven's long age of bliss, shall pay For all his children suffer here. And we will sing though all our day Seems dark with pain and loss ; We know that sorrow's furnace heat Consumes alone our dross. We know that our dear Father's love, Gives both our crown and cross. ' M. A. W. Long-suffering leads to Gentleness. M. E. K. 'If a soul thou wouldst redeem And lead a lost one back to God, Wouldst thou a guardian angel seem To one who long in guilt hath trod, Go kindly to her�take her hand, With gentlest words, within thine own. And by her side a sister stand, Till all the evils thou dethrone. ' M. A. W. Shakspere hath said, 'God's. goodness hath been great. ' What saith the holy scriptures? M. D. Or despiseth thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance. All sing very softly : I How deeply I've shared The goodness of my God! How kindly been led By the chastening of His word ! O angels, bear a - loft Sweet praises from my soul That I am blest to live, B. M. 'The goodness which struggles and battles, and goes down deep, and soars high, is the quality of whicli heroism is made ; by which the world is salted and kept pure ; it is the seed which bears fruit in martyrs making mankind faithful unto death. ' M. A. W. The Scripture saith, 'Now the just shall live by faith. ' What is faith'? All repeat. 'Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. ' Where love and peace control. M. A. W. Who has given us the most wonderful lesson on faith? Children. The Apostle Paul in Heb. 11th. chapter. ' By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.'' M. A. W. Meekness has been defined, ' As a grace which Jesus alone inculcated and which no worldly philosopher seemed to have understood or recommended. ' All chant: Blessed are the Meek for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are the Meek, B. M. Who will speak for Temperance? Children in concert. ' 'Tis to thy rules, O Temperance! that we owe All pleasures, which from health and strength can Vigor of hody; purity of mind; [flow; Unclouded reason, sentiments refined. ' B. M. Will the little girls tell us what our temperance drink shall be ? N. E. ' The sweetest, pure�t best of things That for our use is given; Is cool, bright water flowing free, Free as the air of Heaven. ' E. K. ' Cold water is the drink for me, Cold water, pure and bright and free ; It sparkles on the green hill-side; In yonder meadow see it glide. I'll take my little cup and dip, And of the good, cold water sip, And when I am a woman grown, I'll drink cold water, that alone. ' L. H. 'Twill never hurt my heart or brain, Nor make me give another pain; So every stronger drink I'll shun, And drink the purest sweetest one. ' J. E. ' The soul having attained, through consecration to God unto its highest desires, rejoices with joy unspeakable and full of glory; God is within and all around. An all-pervading purity, and a yearning to be forever shut in with God, fills the whole being. All things have become new. ' M. E. K. Anger no longer struggles for the mastery. B. M. Covctousness no longer suggests how to secure gain without honest compensation. C. H. S. Pride no longer asks permission to flaunt itself to attract the admiration of others. J. E. W. Envy is no longer wounded at the prosperity of rivals. Self-ease has departed, and the soul follows joyfully the pilgrim's path, content-with the fare found by the war. M. I). The water of life is quaffed instead of sparkling wine; and the soul's highest delight found with kindred spirits in an ocean of Eternal Love. M. A. W. Thus moving on in life's busy routine the ' Fruits of the Spirit' are found in ripe clusters abounding in the soul. ' C. H. S. Then love thy neighbor as thyself, So shall thy joys increase; Thy ways be ways of pleasantness, And all thy paths be peace. M. E. K. Let long-suffering lead to gentleness; With goodness strew thy way; And faith by bounteous grace supplied Will yield thee fruit each day. B. M. In meekness looking unto God, Temperance in all things show; Thus thou shalt find the law tulfilled And, heaven begun below. Of Love and Joy, Long -suft'ring, Peace, Of Goodness, Fait!: we'll sing; In Gentleness and Meekness live While to the cross we cling. Our Savior, may we e'er abide In Thee, the Living Vine; And may our lives rich Canterbury, N. H. fruicage bear The fruit life divine.
