THE PHRENOLOGICAL. The man who fills so large a page of German history in this era, Marshall Von Moltke, is given the first place in the June number of the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health. A few thoughts on practical humanity are embodied in 'The Lever of a Thought,' that follows. What is being done on the Nicaragua Ship Canal is told, and a glimpse of the Chief Engineer given. A pretty poem by Belle Bush is prettily illustrated. Mrs. Wells continues her vigorous sketch of Charles Ca 'dwell, and Prof. Sizer puts a fresh batch of 'Hits' in his department. The Necessity for Moral Education is discussed in a capital essay from Professor Dunton, and the Editor supplements his statements by showing the want of 'systematic' education in that line. 'Answer the Child's Questions' and 'Miss Bridgman at a Kindergarten' are among the features of Child Culture. Vegetarianism and advice in the simple treatment of Nasal Catarrh are notable topics in the Health Department. In the Editors' Department a protest is entered against Criminal Anthropology as taught by some, a criticism of Dr. Kenealy's inferences in the Talent of Motherhood, and a good suggestion with regard to the proposed Summer Congress of Phrenologists. A very full Index of the Volume XCIL, of which this number is the sixth and closing, is bound in wTith it. The Journal is published monthly at 15 cents a number and $1.50 per annum.
