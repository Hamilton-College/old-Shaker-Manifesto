Sanitary. HEALTH. A means of preserving health is the having a constant supply of fresh air in your bed chamber. It has been a great mistake to sleep in closed rooms, or in beds surrounded by curtains. No outward air, that may come to you, is so unwholesome as the unchanged air, often breathed of a close chamber. It is recorded of Methuselah who lived to a great age that he always slept in the open air for when he had lived five hundred years, an angel said to him, Arise Methuselah and build thee a house, for thou shalt live yet five hundred years longer. But Methuselah answered and said,ï¿½If I am to live but five hundred years longer, it is not worth while to build me a house. I will sleep in the fresh air as I have been used to do. TOO MUCH COFFEE. Do you want to be blind? Drink coffee. Drink lots of it. Drink it with breakfast, lunch and dinner, and drink it between meals. Drink it when you get up in the morning and drink it before you go to bed at night. Drink it long and strong, and keep it up, and by and by you' will be as sightless as the proverbial bat. That is what the celebrated French physician, St. Amaud, says, and there are New York doctors who indorse the declaration. It is well known that the Moors are inveterate coffee drinkers, especially the merchants, who sit in their bazaars and drink coffee continually during the day. It has been noticed that almost invariably when these coffee drinkers reach about the age of 40 their eyesight begins to fail, and by the time they get to be 50 years old they become blind. One is forcibly imprest by the number of blind men that are seen about the streets of the City of Fez, the capital of Morocco. It is invaribly attributed to the excessive use of coffee. This opinion has been confirmed by the opinion of European physicians living there. Atlanta Constitution. THE JAMAICA GINGER VICE. People who do not wish to acquire a spirit-drinking habit while taking medicine should study the 'Jamaica ginger'' now so generally sold. The stuff is said to be composed largely of alcohol, nnd to have produced delirium tremens, the same as its near relatives, whisky, brandy and rum.
