Juvenile. Dear children:--'Work in my vineyard,' is the Savior's command... Enfield, Conn., 1888. Dear Children:ï¿½'Work in my vineyard,' is the Savioi's command. Where is this vineyard? Is it not in your hearts? And how large a field for action is spread before you in this spiritual vineyard, where you ought to work earnestly and perseveringly all the time, laboring while it is day. If you are faithful workers you will find your time and talents fully employed, and your lives can be made noble and beautiful by unswerving adherence to truth and virtue. ' Work to-day in my vineyard.' Give especial thought to the second word in this command. The command is not for next year or next w^ek; not even to-morrow is left for your choosing or convenience, but, work to-day. There is no safety in 'putting off.' You cannot promise yourselves tomorrow. It may belong to your eternity. Your hour for action is the present one. Work now. Now is to you the golden moment. Use it wisely. 'To-day is yours, improve to-day, Nor trust to-morrow's distant ray.' The future will take care of itself if you take care of the present. To-day is the time appointed for doing what the Savior bids you, without hesitation or complaint. But some grow careless and thoughtless, and see not the importance of such work. So many refuse to do this bidding, to follow the Savior, to walk in his footsteps and imitate his virtues. So many wait for the 'more convenient season' that will never come, missing the real happiness they might enjoy in obeying Him, and they must feel regret over misspent time. Resolve that such an experience shall not be yours. Take each hour as a gift intrusted to you for use and improvement, and labor in such a manner that your time shall not be wasted or its results laid up as witnesses against you. And when you give an account of your stewardship, may you be found worthy to receive the reward, 'Well done, good and faithful servants.' Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt. THE CARELESS WORD. 'Twas but a word, a careless word, And thistle-down it seemed as light; It paused a moment in the air, Then onward winged its flight. Another lip caught up the word, And breathed it with a hearty sneer; It gathered weight as on it sped, That careless word on its career. Then rumor caught the flying word, And busy gossip gave it weight, Until the little word became A vehicle of angry hate. And then the word was winged with fire, Its mission was a thing of pain; For soon it fell like lava drops Upon a wildly-tortured brain. And then another page of life [blurred; With burning, scalding tears was A load of care was heavier made, Its added weight, that careless word. That careless word, oh! how it scorched A fainting, bleeding, quivering heart! 'Twas like a hungry fire that searched Through every tender, vital part. How wildly throbbed that aching heart! Deep agony its fountain stirred; It calmed, but bitter ashes mark The pathway of that careless word. Selected.
