THE CARELESS WORD. 'Twas but a word, a careless word, And thistle-down it seemed as light; It paused a moment in the air, Then onward winged its flight. Another lip caught up the word, And breathed it with a hearty sneer; It gathered weight as on it sped, That careless word on its career. Then rumor caught the flying word, And busy gossip gave it weight, Until the little word became A vehicle of angry hate. And then the word was winged with fire, Its mission was a thing of pain; For soon it fell like lava drops Upon a wildly-tortured brain. And then another page of life [blurred; With burning, scalding tears was A load of care was heavier made, Its added weight, that careless word. That careless word, oh! how it scorched A fainting, bleeding, quivering heart! 'Twas like a hungry fire that searched Through every tender, vital part. How wildly throbbed that aching heart! Deep agony its fountain stirred; It calmed, but bitter ashes mark The pathway of that careless word. Selected.
