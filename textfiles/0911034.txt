Punished THE PUNISHED. ELLA WHEELER. Not they who know the awful gibbet's anguish, Not they who while sad years go by them, in The sunless cells of lonely prisons languish, Do suffer fullest penalty for sin. 'Tis they who walk the highways unsuspec. ted, Yet with grim fear forever at their side, Who clasp the corpse of some sin undetected, A corpse no grave or coffin lid can hide. 'Tis they who are in their own chambers haunted By thoughts that like unwelcome guests intrude, And sit down uninvited and unwanted, And make a nightmare of the solitude. The Cape Times, Africa.
