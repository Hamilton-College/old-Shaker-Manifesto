West Pittsfield. Feb. 1894. The February Manifesto, with its mine of true riches, seemed to us almost incomparably excellent. Every sentence it contained was read with deep satisfaction, and re-read with increased interest. Were particularly pleased to hear from the Sainted Father in Israel, Elder John Whiteley, whose benedictions like the refreshing dews of heaven are distilled upon all, and whose invocations will not fail to reach the Omnipotent Father, who gives heed to the prayers of the righteous.

There has been nearly two hundred tons of ice harvested in the Society, preparatory to the coming warm season, which will soon be with us. It is presumed that a new cold-storage and ice house in connection, will be erected here in the Church family, in the course of the season, with nriny, if not all the modern improvements.

Owing to the condition of our country, and the stagnation in business, they are now mining only about three tons per day, and should the Wilson bill become a law with iron ore on the free list, Br. Ira thinks it doubtful if the parties having the lease, will be able to get men to work for wages low enough to 70 THE MANIFESTO. compete with foreign ore. However this j mine has some advantages over many others, being connected by rail to one of the main lines of railroad in New England, and is rich in a good quality of ore; consequently there is hope that it may pay for working.
