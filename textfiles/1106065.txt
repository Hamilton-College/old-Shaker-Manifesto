All Dead .â€”Have you ever read '' The Ancient Mariner !' I dare say you thought it one of the strangest imaginations ever put together. Dead men pulling the rope, dead men steering. But do you know I have lived to see that time, to have seen it done ? I have gone in to churches, and have seen a dead man in the pulpit, a dead man as deacon, a dead man handling the plate, and dead men sitting to hear.
