LEAVE US NOT IN TEMPTATION EDITORIAL NOTES. ''.' We strongly object to the 'old line' of policy in teaching 'The Lord's Prayer.' The implication of the expression 'Lead us not into temptation'â€” is a fear lest the good spirit would lead us thither unless petitioned to the contrary. The true spirit of the prayer would and does indicate a way out of human depravity, inclination and difficulty. The same, and fully as necessary, desirable condition of the child, as the man or woman, is that neither should be left in a state of temptation. We are not sufficiently learned to assert the fact of genuine interpretation of the original, but we deliver the common sense interpretation, taught us by our Shaker preceptors, to pray 'Leave us not iist temptation.'
