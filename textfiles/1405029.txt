Dear Children;-Be not overcome of evil... Enfield, Conn. 1884. Dear Children ;'Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. ' There is so much good for you to think of and to strive for. You need to ' gird on the heavenly armor ' of prayer and watchfulness, to tesist the besetments that assail on every side. I fear you give too little thought to the influence you are daily exerting. Let your examples be for good and not for evil. Keep yourselves 'unspotted from the world.' ' Wear but one face, and let that be an honest one. ' Reach after the highest realities. Be true, pure, Christ-like. Struggle for spiritual redemption. Your highest attainment is a virgin life. Strive for it with soulearnestness. It is your privilege to wear the Christian's crown. Deny yourselves for it. No crown without the cross. Let your lives be a protest against wrong. Wrong-doing brings trouble, misery and death. Every time you do wrong, you lose a measure of your self-respect, and mar the beauty of the true manhood and womanhood, which it is your privilege by a holy life to attain. On the contrary, every time you do right, you store durable riches and add worth to your character?. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
