Frying, by which is usually meant... Frying, by which is usually meant the fashionable process of preparing food in fat and grease is always objectionable. In general, we cook too much and cook erroneously. Seasonings for food if applied at all, should never be applied till ' the food is on the table. There is a good story told of a foreigner at a table in New York, one man had besprinkled the plate of meat with pepper, saying,at the same time, 'I take it gentleman, you all like pepper.' Another added some mustard with the same assurance and the same remark. The foreigner, not a little vexed, took out his snuff-box, and in his turn sprinkled its contents on the food, saying. 'I take it gentleman, you all like snuff.' Dr. Alcott.
