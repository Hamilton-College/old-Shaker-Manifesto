Sweet Corn for Fodder .â€” Farmers all over the country are becoming convinced of the great value of sweet corn for fodder, not only for use in summer, but, when cured, for winter. We have long used it, and prefer it to the common field sorts, and think it better in every way. It is now time to prepare for sowing corn in drills, as well as planting in hills, and it will cost no more to raise sweet corn for seed another year than other sorts. All the farmer needs is a few quarts of seed to start with, if he cannoi afford to purchase a larger quantity. But sown corn of some kind should find a place on every farm because there is seldom a season in which the pasture will not partially fail during a few weeks, if not longer, and then the fodder corn comes in very opportunely as green food.
