Deborah Fuller , at New Gloucester, Me. Nov. 5. Age, 79 yrs. and 6 mo. She was one of the most beloved sisters and firm pillars in that community. Remarkable for her talents, her virtue and purity of life, she was at a very early age called to responsible places of care and trust which she always filled with grace and honor, and for many years was one of the leading Eldresses presiding over the two communities in Maine. She had resided some seventy-two years in the community and her presence and sweet influence will be sadly missed by her people to whom she was attaclied by the most endearing ties of Christian love. Elder Otis Sawyer.
