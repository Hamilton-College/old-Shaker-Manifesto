To the Memory of Our Dear Sister, Marietta Brainard. Margaretta Davis. Life's Reaper has gathered our Sister From earth and her frail house of clay Yet assured as a ministering angel We feel her loved presence to-day. Though in mid Summer she has been garnered, Her fruit was well set, with no blight, Yet we sorrow that our precious Sister So soon is removed from our sight. We fervently prayed to kind heaven To grant a new lease of her life, The answer returned irresponsive, [strife' 'She has done with earth's conflict and Her hands ever willing in duty, Her heart ever ready to bless, A monument lasting have builded, Her goodness to this will attest. The breath of her kind gentle spirit Has shed a rich fragrance around, And deep in the hearts of the faithful Sweet memories of kindness abound. But keenly we feel the bereavement Of parting, though but for a day, Yet sweet is the thought of reunion We are aiming to walk the same way. Life's journey is short at the longest, With each ebb and now of the tide We are nearing the shores immortal, Our home on that brightOther Side Where parting is said to be over, And friends are united again. With joy we will then greet our Sister If like her we serve to the end. Canterbury, N. H.
