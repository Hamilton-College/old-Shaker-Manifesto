GOOD RULES FOR WINTER Keep the back, especially between the shoulder blades, well covered; also, the chest well protected. In sleeping in a cold room establish the habit of breathing through the nosej and never with the mouth open. Never go to bed with cold or damp feet. Never omit regular bathing, for unless the skin is in active condition the cold will close the pores and favor congestion or other diseases. When hoarse speak as little as possible until the hoarseness is recovered from, else the the voice may be permanently lost, or difficulties of the throat be produced. 20 THE MANIFESTO. When going from a warm atmosphere into a cooler one keep the mouth almost closed so that the air may be warmed by its passage through the nose ere it reaches the lungs. Never stand still in cold weather, especially after having taken a slight degree of exercise, and always avoid standing on ice or snow, or where the person is exposed to cold wind. â€”Sanitarian.
