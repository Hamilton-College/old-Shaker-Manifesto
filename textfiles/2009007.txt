Sacred to the Memory of ELDER MATTHEW B. CARTER, who deceased July 24, 1890. Aged 64 yrs. 4 mo. 6 days. Oliver O. Hampton. From time to time and one by one, We bid this world a last farewell, And what we have or have not done, When this brief race we all have run In future life must tell. Must weigh our works for good or ill, Must yield us joy or grief and pain, For we our destiny fulfill, In movements of our own free will, And our own fate ordain. Our loving Brother, Elder, Friend, And Minister of Good To all who for the truth contend, And even to foe as well as friend, In charity hath stood. In paths of purity and peace, He calmly walked from early youth, With yearly harvest of increase In Holiness without surcease, He rose in grace and truth. Pure as the lily of the vale, His life was wholly free from guile, He faced temptation's stormy gale, But did in innocence prevail, And stemmed its fearful tide. The Inspire! word exhorts us all, To mark the pure and perfect man, The upright in their holy call, Serene 'mid trials great and small, And free from blight or ban. Peace is the glorious end of these, Eternal rest their priceless boon, Who not themselves, but God to please, 'Have flung their banner to the breeze ' And to the line liave hewn. Savior of men, 0 let me die The death of these the righteous few, O let me seek that home on high, Eternal life's unclouded sky, Its holiest heights to view. O Heavenly Father lend thy power, Thy presence in this lonely vale. For darkness veils this midnight hour, And threatening clouds of sorrow lower, And fiercely drives the gale. Within thy Love O let us rest, In resignation's holy peace, With strength and consolation blest, Until we reach the higher rest, And all earth's sorrows cease. Union Village, Ohio.
