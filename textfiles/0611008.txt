HEAVENLY ASPIRATIONS HENRY MANTLE Heavenly treasures we are seeking, For this earth is not our home; From its shades we are retreating, Hoping for the good to come. Praised be our God in heaven, Praised be His saints below. With the saints above we leaven, And their sympathy we know. Oft our trials seem oppressive — Hard and harsh the storms we bear'— Mercy then makes more impressive. That of heaven we may share.. Whether high or low our station, Let us labor to fulfill Every righteous obligation — Bowing to God's righteous will. Life, we seek, life everlasting — May our souls immortal live ; And of heavenly fruits be tasting, Such as gold nor earth can givePass away ye fading treasures — Pass, ye vanities of time — Let us have immortal pleasures — Pure, substantial, and divine. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
