To me, it is not a matter of dispute... To me, it is not a matter of dispute whether in Jesus, the first Christ was manifested to men, or not. I accept him as typical of said Order, in the distant past, as in the coming future. If Jesus was not the first unearthed man, I shall be happy in knowing that of Clirists there are millions, seeing I can partake of their spirits and powers. Daniel Fraser, Shirley, Mass.
