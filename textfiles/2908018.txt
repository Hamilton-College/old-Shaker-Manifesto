THE KIND SHEPHERD. By Hattie Crook. In the Bible we are given the story of the lost sheep, where it strayed away from the fold, and when the master went out to feed his flock he found one missing. Then he left the ninety and nine and searched and called, until he found it, and then he took it home with him. This shows us that Jesus was kind to everybody even to dumb animals. The lesson to be derived from it to me is, that the kind shepherd looking for his one lost sheep amid night and storm, is a sign that God will not lose his care and tenderness for us when we wander away from Him. In our thoughts and ways we often wander away from this good spirit and like the sheep we stray from the fold of Christ, When the Christ spirit calls us we often do not hear, and if we do it is only to wander deeper and deeper into the jungles of sin and selfishness. We at last want the comfort and rest found only in this heavenly fold, but where shall we find our rest and comfort? None but the good Shepherd who has searched our hearts for the first repentant thought can at last lead us home. East Canterbury, N. H.
