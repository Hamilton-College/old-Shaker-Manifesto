Have a saucepan of boiling water... Have a saucepan of boiling water, and drop fresh eggs carefully into it; let them stand where they will be hot, but not boil until the whites set. Toast some thin slices of bread nicely, lay them in a dish, and pour over a gill of rich hot cream salted to taste ; take up the eggs with a skimmer and put an egg on each slice of toast; sprinkle a little salt and pepper over, and garnish with parsely if you please.
