GLEANERS. If 3*ou cannot in the harvest Garner up the richest sheaves, Many a grain, both ripe and golden, Which the careless reaper leaves. You can glean among the briers Growing rank against the wall, For it may be that their shadow Hides the heaviest wheat of all. Do not, then, stand idly waiting For some greater work to do; Fortune is a lazy goddess, She will never come to you. Go and toil in any vineyard, Do not fear to do or dare; If you want a field of labor, You can find it anywhere. Selected.
