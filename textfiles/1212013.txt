A PRAYER. POLLY C. LEWIS. O Heavenly Father, listen to my humble prayer,— Grant me thy kind protection, love and tender care; I'm hungry, I am thirsty, give me food to eat, And waters ot thy life, refreshing, pure and sweet. Henceforth, I will devote my strength, my all to Thee, My time and talents, great or small as they may be I'm Thine, I'm Thine and all for Thee I will forsake,— The yoke and cross of Christ, I will most freely take. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
