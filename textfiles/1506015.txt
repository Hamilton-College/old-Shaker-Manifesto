THE PUREST PEARL Beside the church door, weary and lone A blind woman sat on the cold door-stone; The wind was bitter, the snow fell fast, And a mocking voice in the fitful blast Seemed ever to echo her moaning cry, As she begged for alms of the passers-by; ' Have pity on me ; have pity, I pray; My back is bent and my head is grey. ' The bells are ringing the hour of prayer, And many good people were gathering there But, covered with furs and mantles warm, They hurried past through the wintry storm. Some were hoping their souls to save, And some were thinking of death and the And, alas ! they had no time to heed [grave, The poor sou! asking for charity's meed, And some were blooming with beauty's grace, But closely muffled in veils of lace ! [moan They saw not the sorrow, they heard not the Of her who sat on the cold door-stone. At last came one of a noble name, By the city counted the wealthiest dame, And the pearls that round her neck were strung She proudly there to the beggar flung. Then followed a maiden young and fair, Adorned with clusters of golden hair; But her dress was thin and scanty and worn, Not even the beggars seemed more forlorn ! With a tearful look and pitying sigh, She whispered soft, ' No jewels have I; [she, But I give you my prayers, good friend, ' said ' And surely I know God listens to me. ' On her poor weak hand so shrunken and small The blind woman felt a tear-drop fall; Then kissed it and said to the weeping girl, [pearl. It is you who have given me the purest Selected.
