SLIPPING AWAY. Lines Written to the Memory of Sister LAVINA P. McINTIRE. Ada S. Cummings. They are slipping away, our dearest friends Where the faithful findeth rest, We have them with us here to-day, To-morrow they have sped away, Into the land of the blest. They are slipping away, no calling them Already their day stars have set; [back, We notice their tottering foot-steps slow, And in our hearts we feel and know, Sweet rest is coming yet. Thus they are drifting away, away, In vain may our mourning be; We see them glide out on the silent tide, And their barques move on to the other Across the crystal sea. [side, And one to-day has slipped away; Her form lies stiff and cold, Her hands at rest are folded now, A peaceful calm o'erspreads her brow, Bespeaking joys untold. She hath slipped away and we feel her loss How we loved her no one can tell; All earthly sufferings now are past, Her work is done. She rests at last And with her, 'All is well.' Shall we mourn for her? 'O nay indeed!' I hear her sweet voice say; 'O do not call me back again I've had my share of grief and pain And now I've slipped away.' Thus she hath passed away from us, Where loving friends await; Where welcoming songs of peace divine, Are sung to her in yonder clime, Beyond the pearly gate. Into the City of Love and Light, Wliere the faithful dwell above; There we may view her with the blest, With dear companions safe at rest, Rejoicing in their love. God grant that when we slip away, And sail on the silent tide, We may safely anchor on that shore, Where grief and pain are known no more, At last, on the other side. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
