THE NEW DAY. By Isabella McLeod. Shine out, O glorious sun of truth And usher in the day When all mankind shall brothers be, And equal rights bear sway. When tramping, needy workers Of God's fair fruitful land Will by a Moses guided In triumph take their stand. A stand for life and liberty. For justice, truth and right, And not for sordid millions Gained through oppression's might. When sturdy honest toilers Need never suffer dearth, But find in hours of plenty Sweet peace upon the earth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
