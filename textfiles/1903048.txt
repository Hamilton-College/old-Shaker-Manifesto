Books and Papers. Hood's Sarsaparilla Calendar In the past few years Hood's Sarsaparilla Calendar has become such a favorite that the people anticipate its annual appearance with pleasure. The Calendar for '89, which is now before us, will fully satisfy every expectation as to beauty and utility. It is a little larger than ever before, retaining the cut-out feature of last year, and a handsome child's face looks over a pad of clear, plain figures, all printed in harmonious and pleasing colors. To be appreciated it must be seen. Get a copy of your druggist or send 6 cents in stamps to C. I. Hood &amp; Co., Lowell, Mass. North's Musical Journal North's Musical Journal. Jan. Con.

The Esoteric The Esoteric may be classed among the new Magazines, and yet it has been before the world, on its mission of light, for nearly two years. Its anticipated work, awakens a pleasurable hope, and will be followed with the deepest interest, while its pages are 'devoted to such subjects as will be best adapted to promote the highest mental and interior unfoldment of its readers.' New Cycle of Progress Every religionist should study the 'New Cycle of Progress' as it is only by these cycles of renewed light that we pass from one degree of spiritual travel into that of another still nearer to God.

It did seem as though the seedsmen outdid themselves last year in the line of elaborate catalogues, but here comes Vick's Floral Guide for 1889, from Rochester, N. Y., better than all previous issues. 'Better' hardly expresses itï¿½rather, we should say, far superior. It has been changed in every respect; new cuts, new type, enlarged in size (opening like an old-fashioned singing-book :) contains three elegant lithographs (8x10% inches) of Roses, Geraniums and Melon and Tomato; besides a very fine plate of the late James Vick and his three sons who own and manage this large business. These features must make the Floral Guide valuable to their many thousands of customers in this country We also notice that Vick returns to the plan started by the founder of the business years ago, of offering cash prizes at the State Fair. One would think they were a little out of their heads to offer to the public such a work as the Guide free, for that is what it amounts to, when they say it will be sent on receipt of fifteen cents, and that a certificate good for fifteen cents worth of seed will be returned with the Guide.
