Alternately, since early spring, we have sent out our usual stock of hopes and fears, as touching the closing of the fruit harvest of 1891, and especially the blossoming and fruiting of those trees that hold in reserve for us the treasures for use during the winter. All the small fruits have been thankfully received and many of them placed in the cellar to be used as an appetizing comfort in connection with other substantial food. The abundant crop of pears, including some of the best varieties, has been even more than one could wish. However, the daily influences that are brought to bear upon them, so continuously, will no doubt relieve us from all undue anxiety. A liberal supply of winter apples has far exceeded our expectations and we gladly give vent to many free-will expressions of thanks. Several hundred bushels of excellent fruit are being carefully laid away for use, as the good of the Community may determine. While we now feel thankful in thinking and knowing, in the months to come we shall be thankful in having,ï¿½and in being able to partake of them as our daily food. A few days since we received through the mail, a little package of 'Buckeyes.' For these we are indebted to the kind remembrance of Br. Watson Andrews of Ohio. The novelty of the name in this section, threw many quite from their guard, and they were puzzled to determine the size, shape or quality of a 'Buckeye.' Soon, some one says, 'They are just like Horse-chestnuts,' and as that was so near correct, the guessing closed. The tree should be better known, for its beauty of foliage and its pyramidal racemes of beautiful pink and white flowers. And now comes a package of Everbearing, strawberry plants from Br. Daniel Orcutt of Enfield, Ct., for which he has our kindest thanks. We shall hold the plants in fond remembrance, and when they 'grow and nourish,' we shall be interested to make farther investigations. Sept. 23. We were visited by a large delegation of Free-will Baptists, and for one hour our home was busily engaged in entertaining not less than one hundred and twenty persons. A religious service of three days had been arranged to take place some two miles from our Village, in the interests of the Baptist church, and while on their way the above number called to see their Shaker friends. The hour passed very pleasantly, and closed with singing, both by the Shakers and their visitors. Well, the harvest is not yet past, and although the New Englanders are not remarkable for the abundance which they may gather, they have the enjoyment of getting quite a good supply of God's earthly blessings and for which we hope all may carry a thankful spirit.
