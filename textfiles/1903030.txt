Editorial The mission of the divine Teacher introduces a subject... The mission of the divine Teacher introduces a subject that never grows old. The righteousness that it demands of man is that which has ever manifested itself in the spiritual resurrection order, or the life of Christ. 'Except your righteousness,' said he, 'shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of God.' This was, no doubt, said to the disciples, to stimulate them to greater care and faithfulness in keeping God's Law and in having a deeper regard for the admonitions of the prophets, that they might more readily accept his work, and bring their lives more in conformity to the life they had accepted. The Scribes and Pharisees, in many things, may have been faithful to the letter of the written law, and honorable in their relations among men, but their general course in life would not commend itself as a worthy pattern for the disciples of Jesus. The Teacher began his work by urging his followers to make their paths strait, by changing their minds, and instead of hating their enemies, to love them and pray for them, and instead of afflicting or murdering their fellowmen, to become peace-makers and children of God. To enter this new order of discipline was to become crucified to the life elements of the world and to rise with Christ into the gospel resurrection. This new life or new creation bore no likeness to that of the old creation. One had its relation in the Kingdom of God, and was pure and peaceable, while the other was born of the flesh and was earthly and sensual. It may seem strange, with all the plain declarations that were made by Jesus, as having reference to the life he lived and to that which should be the life of his followers, that so little of it is found to exist or even to be correctly understood. Self-renunciation as taught in the evangely of Jesus, is not very extensively accepted, not even by those who are the loudest in their proclamations of religious loyalty, and most devout in their rhetorical prayers. Infidels and Christians walk hand in hand when the subject is discussed, and all agree that Jesus, in his zeal for God, over-stepped the bounds of propriety. That some of his doctrines, if accepted, would destroy the whole system of domestic relations. Our Redeemer, the first-begotten son of God, of whom it was said, 'This is my beloved Son, hear ye him,' may now need a little of our advice, and we will say to him,�Not quite so fast! 'The Church cannot accept interpretations which would be injurious instead of beneficial to the welfare of mankind.' Of course not! The Church cannot accept the words of Christ if they do not harmonize with the life of the world, which governs the Church. Was it this uncalled-for zeal that broke forth with such a death knell to the relations of the flesh, when Jesus said, 'Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you, Nay : but rather division. The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father, and the mother against the daiighter, and the daughter against the mother.' This form of doctrine, most certainly, would produce a disturbance among the Christians who advocate the life of the world. The work of generation belonged to the first Adam and his disciples, while regeneration was the work of the Second Adam, and into which his disciples were called to enter. Jesus neither encouraged nor gave any instructions for the improvement or for the continuation of the work of generation, and his visit to Cana had no more to do with the institution of marriage, than the presence of a Christian would have in a saloon with the rum-drinking that was going on around him. Jesus went about doing good and whenever or wherever opportunity offered, he was found preaching his mission of the coming of the Kingdom of God, by making the lame to walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and by casting out demons, from among men and permitting them to enter the swine. So far was he from uniting with the world, that he even said to those who accepted his mission, 'Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.' But,' 'Ye which have f ollowed me in the regeneration and have forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life.' This presents to us the mission of Jesus, and into this he sought to gather his followers from the world that they might be one with him as he declared that he was one with the Father. But there are not wanting able and learned men, and those who may be called Rev. Christian guides, who stand ready to denounce any attempt to live a life of practical righteousness. These worldly-wise men are free to inform their hearers that, 'The transient and disastrous attempt at communism in the first dajTs of the Church of Jerusalem was always partial, was very early abandoned and perhaps had its share in plunging that church into a misery and pauperism deeper than prevailed in any other Christian community.' What a compliment to the apostles and to the Pentecostal Church! A disastrous attempt! ! That point, then, is settled,�What next? Jesus has said, 'If my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews.' But the worldlywise men inform us that 'under certain circumstances, war is justifiable !' With war comes all the horrors of brutality and lust, as its legitimate results, and over these the Christians pray, and call them justifiable. They have urged men to sow to the flesh, and of the flesh they must, now, reap corruption. St. Paul comes forward as our Christian advocate and very distinctly says, 'I testify in the Lord that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them. But ye did not so learn Christ.' May our God help the Believers to continue faithful in the work of their gospel mission and in the maintenance of an unflinching testimony against all unrighteousness.
