Beloved editor: I read the Manifesto... Shaker Station, Conn. Mar. 28, 1886. Beloved Editor :ï¿½I read the Manifesto every month with pleasure and profit. I always find much good in it and never anything bad. It comes as a faithful friend, whose aim is to encourage purity of heart. To me it is a model religious periodical. Best wishes. Daniel Orcutt.
