ANOTHER STORY OF THE SHAKERS Elsewhere may be found letters passing between E. McCormick and Elder Evans. It now appears that the information, which Editor McCormick has variously been seeking concerning the Shakers, was for the purpose of weaving the same into a story to appear in the Christian Union. We hoped it would not be ridiculous in its features, but rather ' Speak of us as we are, nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice.' We find it too silly for such a noble paper as The Christian Union.
