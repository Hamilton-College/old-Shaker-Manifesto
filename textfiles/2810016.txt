DONT TALK OF YOUR ILLS. 'Eveky one of us has his and her own ailments,' writes Edward W. Bok in the December Ladies' Home Journal, decrying the unpleasant habit many people have of discussing their bodily ills. 'It is enough for us all to keep well ourselves : to be compelled to listen to the ailments of others does not make that task any easier. Besides all this, these unnecessary narratives of personal ailments are positively injurious to ourselves. Physicians all agree that many of the slight illnesses, of which some people make so much, could be cured if they would but take their minds from themselves. Too many people work themselves into illnesses, or prevent themselves from getting well, by talking about a petty ailment, which, if forgotten, would right itself. It seems that one of the most important lessons we can all learn is to refrain from inflicting upon others what is purely personal to ourselves. Let us cease this tiresome, this inconsiderate, this unnecessary talk about our ailments. Cold and hard as it may seem, the fact is nevertheless true, and will ever remain so, that the vast majority of people are interested in what is pleasant in our lives, but not in what is unpleasant. l^ains and sorrows are elements in our lives which are sacred and interesting only to ourselves.' ï¿½Selected.
