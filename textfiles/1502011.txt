SPIRIT MATERIALIZATIO [Extracts taken from an article in ' Shaker Theology,' written by Elder II. L. Eads&gt;, of South Union, Ivy. Send for the book and read all he writes on the subject. Ed.] . None of the external senses are reliable in abnormal conditions, as persons can be made to see white to be red, and black to be white, to hear sounds Avhen none l'each the external ear, to taste food when none is present, to feel when no substance of matter is near. It is not strange that the simple are misled. No reason whatever is appealed to, to sustain the theory. Its devotees seem to rise on the wings of the wind and by imagination, and a love of the marvelous, and are carried away to the supersensuous and still find no solid resting place. That there is more than one substance, and not more thai) two in existence, I think, is self-evident. These are matter and spirit, and that one of these cannot become the other is also evident, but as others think differently, I propose to offer some reasons on the subject. First,�If there are two distinct substances they cannot be alike in any particular, else they would be but partially distiact�a inixture which would prove | them to be the same. Second,�If they are not alike in any particular, they are .contradictory. If they are- contradictory, it is impossible for them to affiliate, or for one to become the other. Oh, nay ; this must be set down among the things which arc impossible. Two substances that are in no respect similar are neither interchangeable nor interblendable. The conditioned cannot become the unconditioned ; nor the extended the unextended, nor vice versa. To admit this would be equal to asserting that a thing could be made to exist, and not to exist at the same time, which with bowed head, I must say is impossible with God. Thus we cannot foil to perceive the impossibility of a spirit materialization ; but if one can become the other, the one substance theory is proven to be true. Hence we have no God but nature, and to nature only are we accountable. Shall we become Atheists? Locke reasons thus : ' If matter were the external first cogitative being, there would not be one infinite cogitative being, but an infinite number of cogitative beings of limited force and distinct thoughts independent of each other. But unthinking particles of matter, however put together, can have nothing thereby added to- them but a new relation of position, which it is impossible should give thought and knowledge to them.' Thus the two substances are proved to exist, which at the same time proves also the impossibility of spirit materialization. Then I would say let not the elect be deceived by the weird, phosphorescent, moonshine ghosts and hob-goblins manufactured by spirit tricksters and jugglers in both worlds to make money and deceive tho race. Just take away all the money from this spirit circus and it would die in a fortnight. I am asked if I would not believe were I to see them myself? I answer, not at all. It would1 be impossible for me to believe, until 1 should be first convinced of the truth of the one substance theory, and that God and the thinking principle within me were matter and that I was not possessed of a spirit substance distinct from matter. Prof. Mapes says the senses are unreliable. In order to make a spirit materialization possible its advocates are driven .to the point of denying spirit existence altogether, hence leaving no spirit to materialize ( !) and thus knock out their own underpinning. They make it only the disappearance and re-appearance of matter, as that of water and vapor, and seem too obtuse to know they have stultified themselves. When we take a rational view we know matter is unintelligent�we look into nature and find it not,�but continue our mental vision up 'Through nature to nature's God.' We behold the two substances in bold relief, and are compelled to exclaim, in spite of every effort at unbelief: ki Spirit exists distinct from and with power over matter.' The exudation of. molecules of matter from the pores of a groaning medium, being spiritualized and becoming the spirit of one's deceased brother, sister, wife or child, is one o( the sheer humbugs and grandest impositions on human credulity with which the gullible can be gulled. Every one, or every thousand who see, hear, feel, taste or smell departed spirits, are abnormal and conditioned for the purpose. No person while in their normal condition ever saw a spirit, or ever will. Spirit seeth spirit,�matter seeth matter. We may become abnormal, and bv so conditioned by spirit38 the manifesto. power as to see, hear, converse with, feel and handle them ; but on returning to our normal condition they disappear, and we know not whither they have fled. Some arc more easily conditioned than others, not that they are more worthy. Spirits choose those organs that are most easily conditioned. Not content with this the highest phase and most reliable spirit action, some in their great anxiety for the marvelous, visit worldly cabinets in the shades of even, and pay their money to be deceived, and get what they go for. We should return to the New Testament, with Christ Jesus and Mother Ann Lee for our pole star. Leave the world's reformers to work out their own problems, and 'we preach Christ crucified to the world.' We can easily defend the gospel work against ail religionists, dogmatists, scientists, spiritualists, materialists or infidels, with uo fears of a single defeat.
