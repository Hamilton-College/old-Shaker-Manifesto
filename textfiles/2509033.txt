A RAILROADER'S PRAYER. A railroad man is responsibl for the following prayer: 'O Lord, now that I have flagged thee, lift my feet from off the road of life and plant them safely on deck of the train of salvation! Let me uze the safety lamp known as prudence, make all couplings in the train with the strong link of thy luv and let my lamp be the Bible. And, heavenly Father, keep all switches closed that lead off on the sidings, especially those with a blind end! O Lord, if it be thy pleasure, hav every semaphore block along the line to show the white light of hope that I may make the run of life without stopping. And, Lord, giv to us the Ten Commandments as a schedule, and when I hav finishd the run, and hav on schedule time pulled into the great station of death, may thou, the Superintendent of the Universe, say with a smile: 'Well done, thou good and raithful servant. Cum and sign the pay roll and receiv your check for eternal happiness.' ' Rehohoth Sunday Herald.
