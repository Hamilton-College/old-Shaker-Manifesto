FRIENDSHIP F. A. Case From heaven's garden God did take One of his choicest flowers, To plant it in the heart of man, And happier make his hours. Yet rarer flower can now be found, For choked and overgrown By thorns and weeds of selfishness That Satan's hands hath sown. God plants it first, in infant's heart, When pure and white as snow, Unspotted by the soot of sin Or tracks of human woe. When youthful days its life entwine. Deception's dirt ne'er chokes ; Its growth is like the Ivy vines That wind about the oaks. It lifts the fallen from disgrace, And makes their life anew. It heals the broken-heart and makes Its sorrow bid adieu. It hath great power to shape the end Of men, and nations too. Its scepter is of purest love. Its motto is 'be true. ' Yet oft like Judas' kiss it's used To gain one's selfish part, With sweetest nectar on the lips But a dagger in the heart. Georgetown College Magazine.
