Stewed tomatoes Stewed Tomatoes. — To stew tomatoes properly they should be cooked at least two hours; pour boiling water over them and remove the skin ; then slice them into a stewpan — porcelain is the best, although new tin will answer ; allow them to boil briskly for twenty minutes, then remove to the back of the range to simmer slowly until required ; season liberally with butter, salt and pepper. They will then be cooked to a thick, creamy consistency with few lumps and a high, fine flavor, and will not, therefore, need flour or cracker crumbs, which to our taste are no improvement.
