KINDLY REMEMBERED A few days since we received from an aged, gospel mother —Anna Williams —some lines expressive of her feelings concerning our little messenger—The Shaker. We give them below. While we call to mind many Sisters at Mt. Lebanon, who are more than 70 years of age, we are particularly reminded of Sister Sarah Bates, almost 90; Anna Williams, 93, and Dolly Saxton, who, ere these lines are printed, will celebrate her more than hundredth year! Not long since, Sister Abigail Munson did the same. It is very pleasant to know that these, and nearly all our aged, are especially attached to The Shaker.
