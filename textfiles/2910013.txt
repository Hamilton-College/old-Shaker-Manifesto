East Canterbury N. H. Sept. 1899. The foliage, already turning to view its fast fall colors, and the bleak winds, so familiar to September and its followers in New Hampshire, are striking the death knell of our short-lived Summer. Of small fruits she offered us a bounty, and we were quick to seize a goodly share during her prime. Now that she is leaving us, we are pleased to find ourselves entitled to valuable property in the shape of cranberries, grapes, butternuts, with a promise of our full share of chestnuts and beechnuts when Jack Frost is ready to help us. The cutting of ensilage is now in progress. 400 tons of corn, 15 ft. tall will yet come under the power of McCormick's Corn Binder. The more we use this machine the better we like it. Nothing that chews the cud and parts the hoof will suffer when supplies are safely stored in the three huge silos. While squashes are not considered in quality quite as good as last year, 1038 are now at hand for winter storage and demolition. Day school opens this month, in common with neighboring ones, twenty-seven pupils in prospect. Our full order of Ministry visited the Society at Enfield, N. H., between Aug. 28 and Sept. 15, and are now at home once more. Jessie Evans.
