41 West 26th Street, ) New York, Jan. 9th, 1875 Dear Father Evans :â€”Your note is at hand. I will try and prepare a short statement of my visit to Eddys for the Shaker and Shakeress. They have made a thorough convert of me. There are startling changes to take place soon now. The fundamental principles of the Shakers, it seems to me, will become more or less prominent in the new order of things. We must have a new religion, based on Physiology. Old things will pass away, and all things become new. A new Heaven and a new Earth are to be developed. There is a most gigantic power being manifest through these Eddy's, and if it can be controlled for good, it will be a great thing. I have arranged with Horatio to have a record kept of all their manifestations every day. I think it will be a matter of great interest to the whole human family. Dr. Beard is all wrong in his scientific exposition of these manifestations, and has shown himself a great-----, in my estimation in the positions he has taken. With kind wishes to all the friends there. I am truly yours, E. P. Miller
