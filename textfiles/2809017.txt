THE SHADOW OF SELF It is told of Michael Angelo, the greatest sculptor the world has ever known, that it was his habit to work much at night, when quiet hours gave him opportunity for the severest thought, which is so evident in all he wrought. He found, however, that night labor was not without its disadvantages. No matter where he placed his light, at some critical moment or in some unexpected place his shadow was sure to be thrown upon the statue he carved. But at last he hit upon a plan that did away with the difficulty. He fastened a candle to the stiff paper cap he wore while working, and then the light shone clear and full upon the portion of marble he was carving, with no shadow of himself flitting between his eyes and his work. There is a lesson here for all. The greatest hindrance to us as sculptors of life is this shadow of self which is so prone to fall in unexpected places, dimming our perception of the clear, sharp outlines of truth and duty, and spoiling by false proportions the dignity and beauty of the character we would portray as our own. To do a kind thing that we may be thought obliging, is to miss entirely the grace of the act, so far as we are concerned. To be generous for fear of being thought mean, is little if any better than downright selfishness. In short, to do right for any other reason than because it is right, is to fall short of the ideal, to make a false stroke on life's statue because the shadow of self has come between it and the light. Does some one ask, What is the light by which we may guide ourselves as day by day we chisel out character that must endure throughout eternity? There is but one answerChrist. And as the great sculptor placed his candle on the front of his cap while he wrought, so we must put Christ above our own preferences, our own wills. The clear shining of that Light upon each day's appointed tasks, and working ever in its radiance, we shall make no mistakes. Young People's Weekly.
