Love There is great power in love. Addressing his disciples, Jesus said, 'As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you ; continue ye in my love.' He was moved by this spirit of love when he said, ' Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.' He overcame the world in himself by energy of spirit; he wrestled against the temptations which were presented to him, and contended with principalities and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places; and by love to God, to truth and to humanity, he conquered the powers of darkness, and left an example that we all can safely follow. He was not content merely to love those who loved and honored him ; but he learned to 'love his enemies, to bless those who hated and persecuted him, and to pray for those who despitefully used him.' So strong was his love to righteousness that he laid down his life in its defense ; and all who find a true joining to Christ as the Head of the Church, must live as he lived, bear the same cross of self-denial, rise into the divine life and become one with him, as he became one with the Eternal Parents. Then, we shall so dwell in love that our offerings God ward will all be made in love. In love we shall serve and pray for one another and for all souls. Through love we shall intercede for the lost and erring, that God would send mediums to open the eyes of the spiritually blind, that they may behold the light of the truth, that the deaf may hear the sound of the everlasting Gospel, and be guided in paths of holiness and peace.
