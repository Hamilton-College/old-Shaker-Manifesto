OUR SINS ARE FOLLOWING US. By Edwin P. Sevester. I HAVE been reading an account of Frank James, ex-member of the notorious band of train robbers, and brother of Jesse James, late chief of said band. Frank James repented of his evil ways, living now for some years, an honest, an upright, a sincere, and in every particular, a good life. Nobody has any fault to find with his present conduct. That man complains that the newspapers of the West are constantly referring to his past life and in his despair he exclaims,�'Why can they not let me alone?' He is very anxious and ambitious to obtain an honorable position in society, aspiring to become Mayor Bourge-master of St. Louis, but he finds that his past life and bad record bars his progress, clouds his future, and prevents most effectually, his being taken into the circle of respectable society. Managers of Theaters and Shows have offered him a large salary if he would give himself to be exhibited on the stage, but he sternly and steadfastly refuses to do so. Thia account made a deep impression on my mind. We read in one of the Prophets,�'-Our sins are following us, are hedging us in, are fencing us in, are building a wall around us.'' How true this is! Not that our sins in themselves, as such, necessarily must follow us, for there is power in the gospel to overcome sin, but the consequences, the results of our wrong doing, are following us, are hedging us in. We can not escape them. When a man has pursued a wrong course and the angel of conviction touches his soul, he is then awakened and convicted of his sinful course and wishes to lead a better and a purer life before God, and before all men. It is then every one is distrustful, and does not believe he is sincere. Paul found it so. After his conversion, he wisht to enter the room where the Apostles were, but they were afraid of him; did not believe his reformation was sincere and closed the door against him. Those of us who are convicted and know of the better way must go straight forward, neither turning to the right nor to the left, being true to our convictions and living to our most holy faith, or publicans and harlots will enter the kingdom before us.
