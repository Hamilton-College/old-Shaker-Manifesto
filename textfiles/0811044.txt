The call for a new religion has been made... The call for a new religion has been made; but the bids are not all in. James Freeman Clarke read this at the last Unitarian Convention held at Saratoga : 'The New Theology will be Christian—that is still the greatest force of the world—but it will not be in the line of creeds ; it has outgrown them. The historic Christ is, however, not outgrown. He will still be the central force and pnver, as he is the central figure in human history. One life like that of Jesus lifts men forever to a higher plane. He brought and brings God to men, and all attempts to discredit.his work will be futile.'
