MEN WANTED It has been truly said that the great want of the age is men. Men who ai-e honest to the heart's core. Men who will condemn wrong in friend or foe â€” in themselves as well as others. Men whose consciences are as steady as the needle to the pole, men who will stand for right, if the heavens totter and the earth reels. Men who can tell the truth and look the world and the devil right in the eyes. Men who neither swagger nor flinch. Men who have courage without whistling for it, and joy without shouting to bring it. Men through whom the current of everlasting life runs still, and deep and strong. Men too large for sectarian limits, and too strong for sectarian bonds. Men who know their message and tell it. Men who know their duty and do it. Men who know their place and fill it. Men who mind their own business. Men who will not lie, who are not too lazy to work, nor too proud to be poor. When such men as these will fill places of trust and responsibility, we shall have a Christian civilization, the highest, the best the world ever saw. [Farm and Fireside.
