OUT WITH IT How many kind thoughts die unborn; how many kind words are stifled unspoken. Hearts hungry for a word of appreciation and praise, would leap for gladness if they knew the kindness that we feel toward them; but while they plod on in doubt and darkness, we stifle kindly aspirations, and the cheering thought and sympathizing word dies within our hearts and makes no sign. Why need we be so reticent concerning things thai are good? Most people are outspoken enough when angry and discontented. They find fault boldly, with a relish ;-. but words of praise are with them exceedingly few. It is true that he that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet. We are to avoid flattery and fulsome praise. But yet, when a glow of honest admiration or approval risea within our hearts, why not out with it, and let it gladden others as it cheers us ? How happy families might be if every thought of thankfulness manifested itself in speech and action from day to day. How many a home, now dreary and uncomfortable, might be made joyous with light and sunshine, if we would not only rebuke with fidelity, and reprove in love, but would also sho'w in words and deeds our sense of gratitude and approval when we can honestly do so. â€” Exchange.
