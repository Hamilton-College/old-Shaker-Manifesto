To editor of Manifesto;--This verse is taken from the 1st chapter... Pleasant Hill, Ky., Jan. 1888. To Editor of Manifesto ;ï¿½This verse is taken from the 1st chapter of the Gospel of John and the 14th verse, 'And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth. ' This I could never understand. I have read many an explanation but none seemed to satisfy my mind. How did the Word become flesh? How did it dwell among us? How did we behold its glory, as the only begotten full of grace and truth? It seems to be the word sent by the Angel to the Virgin Mary, that produced the Holy Son of God, as he was the first born in the new creation, lie was also the first one that preached the new birth. If he had been conceived in sin like the rest, how could he then preach the Kingdom of God? It has never been seen or heard that any oue could preach the Gospel without being born of the living word of God. Christ was the true living seed of the kingdom or new heaven. Any one that is born of the same seed he can both live and preach the new birth, and he could no more commit siu than Jesus could, because the seed of God remain eth in him And he loves God above all, and his fellow man as himself. This is the fruit that appears ia Jesus Christ, and the same fruit appears in all his followers. So we behold the glory, and beauty of that holy seed produced wherever it finds good ground. It produces Holy men and women progressing from one glory to another. Yours, Lars Erickson.
