Harvard, Mass. Oct. 1895. 'The harvest is past, and the summer is ended,' and all are saved who work in faith to that end. Nature has donned her gayest attire, a prelude to her long sleep beneath her beautiful white pall, an emblem of purity. We also are making preparations for the long inclement season by ploughing, pruning and harvesting roots and winter vegetables. About 35 tons of ensilage are nicely packed in the silo; 300 bushels of corn and 30 bu. of beans are garnered in good order. While gathered in our comfortable homes, enjoying the fruits of our labors, it would be well to remember the poor who are not so bountifully blest. Marola M. Hullurd.
