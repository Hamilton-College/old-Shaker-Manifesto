East Canterbury N. H. April, 1898. Into the arena of our ever busy home life, spring comes with added tasks for hand and heart. The supply of wood, to counteract the effect of next winter's bleak winds, has been sawed into convenient lengths, and awaits storage in well rooft sheds. The fanners have opened their spring campaign, and like the celebrated sower of old, 'went forth to sow' a few days ago. Eighteen rows of green peas are planted and rhubarb stood two inches high on the 8th, but the latter soon shrank away from the frosty air that breathed upon it, and we look for a more permanent attempt byand-by. As the seed is sown, we rind ourselves almost unconsciously humming: 'What shall the harvest be?' A bountiful supply of all things conducive to our material well-being, we trust, for 1897 gave grudgingly, and the effects upon a large family make us anxious that the present year may deal 'with a free and liberal hand' toward the inhabitants of the sterile Granite State. Sisters are in-the midst vi the inevitable 'house-cleaning' seeking to rejuvenate the noble old structures of a century's standing; and as hands keep time to the ever present needs of our dear earthly home, the hearts of the faithful ceaselessly pulsate toward the fullfilment of the prophet's message of old: 'Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts.'
