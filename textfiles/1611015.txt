'Killed by drinking ice water... 'Killed by drinking ice water, ' Dr. Kellogg thinks would be an appropriate epitaph for many people who will die during the hot weather. He says, and it but enfirms Dr. Jackson's argument on the same subject in the July Laws, ' that a stomach which is benumbed by ice water is practically paralyzed. It can neither secrete, absorb, nor contract upon the food.' And further, that i'the sudden chilling of the stomach by the drinking of ice water, eating of ice cream, swallowing pieces of ice, etc., is a very hazardous proceeding, and one which those who value health above the transient gratification of a depraved taste will sedulously avoid.' A weak solution of salt and water is recommended by good physicians as a remedy for imperfect digestion, and for a cold in the head it is a complete cure snuffed from the hollow of the hand. We have Known severe cases of catarrh entirely cured by persistent use of this simple remedy every night and morning for several months, when the best efforts of the best physicians failed to do any good. It should be used milk-warm. Bay Star.
