Correspondence. My Dear Friend, Elder John Whiteley:--I am becoming a convert to... Preston, Ont., July 2, 1888. My Dear Friend, Elder John Whiteley :�I am becoming a convert to the Shaker view of the celibate life. When I see the evils in society, arising from the indulgence of the animal passions, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion, than that it would be much better if men would strive to bring their baser passions into subjection to the higher laws of their nature, and try to live a nobler aud a more spiritual life. On this we are all agreed, but the difficulty is to get men and women to exercise self-denial for the happier enjoyment of intellectual life. There is hardly a great crime committed ag-iinst society that is not traceable, directly or indirectly, to the indulgence of the animal passions, and the unhappy marriages, separations and numerous divorces, show how impossible it is to regulate this evil by law. Against the celibate life there is no law, and the advantages of such a life over the married state, in properly organized society, are sufficiently obvious. Even in the world it may be said that tlp whilst he who marries doeth well, he who doth not marry doeth better ;' whilst in community life it seems almost a necessity that men aud women should not marry. Where marriage has been permitted or lawless intercourse indulged in, it seems to have been fatal to all community organization, and such communities have sooner or later been broken up. Not that marriage of itself is sinful, but it has led to a diversity of interests, and the increase of selfishness to so great an extent, as to be destructive of the unity and concord so essential to the community interests, so that it is quite possible that the Shakers are right in their views on this subject. No doubt the enforcement of the celibate rule is a great hindrance to many who would otherwise join your order, but whether you could safely alter or modify the rule, or abandon it altogether, would be difficult to say. I should be glad if something could be done to make your order better known, and more acceptable to the religious world in general. To illustrate what has been said I will refer to the dreadful incidents connected with Mr. G. of Aylmer, Ont. He was a man of good standing, the owner of two flouring mills with an interest in a third one, was fairly wealthy, and moved in the best society. He was a Freemason, an Oc'dfellow, a Workman, and a leading member of the Methodist church, as well as a man of social and political influence. His crime was that of incest. He was arrested at his own mill and while taking him to prison he asked to see his family. Soon as he entered the house he seized a revolver and instantly destroyed his own life. And yet this man stood up in the church only four weeks before, and said he never was so happy in his life, and hoped that many would be brought into the right way. What will not the indulgence of this vile lust lead to ! ! I have to thank you for sending me the Manifesto. It is an interesting journal, but I do not agree with all and everything that I read in it, but the moral tendency is good and the whole tone religious and elevating. With kind remembrances to all my good friends. Believe me Yours very sincerely J. H. Walker. The power that sweetens every duty, and lightens every burden... The power that sweetens every duty, and lightens every burden in life is true religion. H. A. J. J. H. Walker, Friend:--Your very interesting letter of the... Shaker Village, N. H. July, 1888. J. 11. Walker, Friend:�Your very interesting letter of the 2nd. iust. to our beloved Elder John Whiteley has been forwarded to us for perusal. It cannot be thought strange that we find in your communication, a common bond of sympathy, as we so clearly see the present state of society,�such sad departures from righteousness, and then allow ourselves to anticipate what it might be under the redeeeming influence of the cross of Christ. It is quite too true that there is a strong tendency in the mass of mankind to cling to the earth, and to become absorbed in its relations. Self-denial is not congenial, so that in the ruling of the animal propensities, over the moral faculties, many, very many pass on to destruction. We are not surprised that you see these things so distinctly, or that you should acknowledge yourself as becoming a convert to the testimony of Jesus Christ, which dwells so forcibly on the benefits accruing to those who follow after righteousness and who work diligently ' to become pure in heart. But there is a difficulty to get men and women to accept this better view of life. One of the great barriers is found in the fact that many of those who assume to be the guides on the highway to the kingdom, are quite as blind, or as unwilling to practice self-denial for the good of mankind, as are those before whom they stand as teachers. 'If the blind attempt to lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch,' and certainly, none are so blind as those who live in selfishness and sensuality. Just here the marriage question finds a place. That there is biblical authority for mar- riage is quite correct and Paul in his zeal to become all things to all men, that he might partiall) save some, admitted this life of the flesh in his Gentile, Christian Church, and then tried hard to justify it. There is biblical authority also for war and bloodshed and for slavery and for polygamy,�but it would be hard to find an authority for these things in the teachings of Jesus. There can be no truer saying than this, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that v/hich is born of the spirit is spirit.' We firmly believe, however, that any departure from the pure testimony of the Christ, would, at once, destroy our religious order and make us emphatically, as are the children of this world. As witnesses for the truth of God, the Shakers should, with their light and privilege, be able to speak with as much confidence as did St. Paul, when he said, 'They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.' 'God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.' Our success in maintaining our order and our prosperity as a Community must be by our faithful continuance in welldoing. Our duty is to 'preach the kingdom of God and its righteousness.' We appreciate your very kind remarks, having reference to our little journal, and only hope that it may be able to do much good and no harm. Accept with this our prayer for your prosperity in this life, and the blessedness of peace in that to come. Respectfully, H. C. Blinn.
