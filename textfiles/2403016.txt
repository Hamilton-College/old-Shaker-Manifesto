SHIELD. 'Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.ï¿½ 1 Cor. iii., 7. Canterbury, N. H. 1893. Live my soul, as peace shall follow And thine ev'ry walk control,Here in lies thy shield from sorrow, Here thy strength for growth of soul, Here thy strength for growth of soul. When thou goest to the battle, Gospel truth shall mark thy way, God may chasten, God may chasten; let thy spirit With the weak and erring pray,With the weak and erring pray.
