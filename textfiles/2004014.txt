THE THIRTY YEARS' WAR. Amelia J. Calver. This cruel and devastating war, caused by the contest between the Roman Catholics, and Protestants in Germany, began iu Bohemia in 1618, and ended by the Peace of Westphalia, at Munster iu 1648. By the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, sixty-three years previous, it was left to each State to prescribe the form of worship within its own boundaries, and all subjects were allowed to move from those Mates where their worship was forbidden, to those in which it was not. But Church and State, or religion aud politics, became iuvolved in so many controversies, that perpetual and bitter strifes pervaded the whole country, and it needed ouly a spark to cause the great conflagration of war; and the spark was given when Ferdinand of Styria, a fanatic, educated by the Jesuits, was crowned King of Bohemia, a Protestant State, as successor to rulers who had pledged themselves to support the laws regarding religious liberty. The war falls into four distinct periods. The first part extended to 1623, during which time the contestants were Frederic V., to whom the Bohemians offered their throne, and Ferdinand who had been appointed by Matthias. Frederic was defeated in 1623, placed under a ban, and bereft of all his possessions. The war which might have ended here, but for the improvidence and stubbornness of the emperor Ferdinand, took on a new phase. Two Austrian armies under Tilly and Wallenstein, now marched against the North German princes, who were under the leadership of Christian IV., of Denmark. In this campaign as in the other the Catholics were victorious, and the Peace of Lubec compelled Christian of Denmark to withdraw his assistance from Germany. Here again in 1629, the war might have closed, had it not beeu that Ferdinand confiscated all ecclesiastical estates in possession of the Protestants aud ordered Tilly to move northward and crush eveiy attempt at resistance. At this critical moment Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, stepped forward to assist the Protestants, and the third phase of the war commenced. It was during this campaign that the horrible plunder and massacre of Magdeburg, a Protestant city, took place, under Tilly, where 130,000 of the inhabitants were destroyed in three days, and only one hundred and thirty houses left. In November 1632, Gustavus fell at Lutzen, but the Catholics under Wallenstein were defeated, aud retreated to Bohemia. The war now changed character to one of political interests, where crowns and not religions were fought for. Here France stepped in, by the advice of Cardinal Richelieu, whose aim it was to humble the House of Hapsburg. The French fearfully devastated the country, and their participation is considered the worst chapter in the war. The last contest took place where it began, in Bohemia, and when the Swedish army was about to make an attack on Prague, news came of the Peace of Westphalia Oct. 24, 1648. The entire exhaustion of Austria, the offensive party, caused the final cessation of hostilities. The emperor Ferdinand did not lose his title, but was deprived of the greater part of his author- ity ; while the power of the princes was so considerably extended, that the empire became nearly dissolved. Holland and Switzerland were declared independent. Alsace was given to France, Pomerania to Sweden. Such is history. The pure aud peaceful religion of Jesus Christ, and its form of worship, taken as a pretext for the annihilation, by cruel war, of the very flower of civilized and Christian Europe, while the apostle says,�''The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy, and good fruits.' And the prophet declares that where the peaceable kingdom of Christ is established, on earth, '�The wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid ; and the calf and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
