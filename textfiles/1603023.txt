NOTES NO TIME FOR DOUBTING. The remarkable confidence which the Apostle expressed as he gave utterance to the fullness of his soul is what every Christian man and woman should be able to say in reference to their own course through life, 'We know that we are of God;' and we do not distrust his knowledge in regard to the remaining part of the sentence, ' and the whole world lieth in wickedness. ' On this point we have no doubt to express. To be in Christ was to be alive, while those not in Christ were dead. To be in Christ was to be in spiritual light, in the resurrection ; and those not in Christ were in darkness, in their sins. There can be no place for vacillation in the mind that expects to rise victorious over the world. To halt and make calculations, or to look back to catch the last sight of what we have left behind, is attended with fearful risks. A most remarkable case of this kind occurred in the early history of mankind, so says the good book. It was the last view of the dear old city while it was in flames. Jesus has not failed to make use of a corresponding warning. He evidently found human nature about the same in Jerusalem and Galilee as Lot and the angels found it in the city of Sodom. It was a strong inclination to maintain an interest in the old inheritance ; a strong desire to know of the success of those whom we left in the company of the ungodly. With a wonderful exactness these same conditions are repeated from generation to generation. The disciples could not avoid being more or less surrounded by this bewildering state of the mind, during their service of ministration to the people, and under this pressure John gave utterance to the inspirational text,�'We know we are of God.' This was the morning of a new day, the beginning of a new creation. It was the dispensation of light, and if there had been any light in the past it was at the present time, of but little use. This may not be considered quite as liberal as we would like to have it in this more advanced age, and a little modification might soften the conditions. The spirit of evolution is in the air. The wise ones of the earth are making astounding revelations and then as confidently enlarging on their predictions of the future. How successful they may be in their demonstrations must be determined by the results. It certainly can do no harm to anticipate better days for the race. The need is impera'ive. With this will come a better quality of spiritual attainments, and a more glorious church of Christ on the earth. Possibly the time may never be when all will be so gifted as to see eye to eye on this subject, any more than it is seen at present, on the subject of morality or of Christianity. It would not be a very difficult work to examine our hearts and from this determine the position that we occupy. If we could become as positive as the apostle and be as worthy of the confidence, there would be a strong evidence that the dawn of the millennium was near at hand. The simplicity of the Christian life must commend itself to every one, as there can be no mysterious conditions to effect it. It is the light of God that shines into the soul and cannot possibly be confined to any one person or place, but agreeably to the testimony, it is a light to all men. Goodness is godliness, and this examination will soon determine whether our life is spent iu doing good to our fellow man, and making this earth a better place through our presence on it. Those who delight in the will of the Lord, and treasure his law in the heart, who preach righteousness before the people and sin noi with their tongue, how �easily and readily they can harmonize with the apostle. This class do not stop and spend their lives over a system of questionable theology, which grows darker and darker the deeper it is penetrated. Life to them is a life in God, hopeful, prayerful and full of good works. We may boast of the light in which we live and yet we are not, even at this date, so far removed from the dark ages but that thousands may be found who dwell with more intense interest on some mystic system of theology for salvation, than they do on a life of practical righteousness. A word, a syllable or even the addition or suppression of a letter may determine, in their minds, the future happiness or misery of the soul. If any thing can be found in this that will in the least render assistance in helping one on the road to righteousness, it may have accomplished a good result. This however, is better, 'To live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.'
