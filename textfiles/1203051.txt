Sweet is the peace... O. C Hampton Union VILLAGE, Ohio. Sweet is the peace of the spirit resigned,â€”Giving to good every power of the mind; Will and affection surrender to God, Moving in charity, at home and abroad. In this love all is serene, Angel contentment, Love's brightest sheen Beams in the calm sky of the pure; Those who the yoke of Christ will endure.
