DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN. By Ada S. Cummings. 0 my soul, why need you falter, tho the waiting seemeth long ? Know you not the hour is darkest, just before the morning's dawn? What tho clouds are gathering round you,ï¿½clouds that speak of heavy storm It may be that they will vanish with the coming of the dawn. Yonder, in the dark horizon, even now there may appear, Glimmering through the lingering shadows, light that will your spirit cheer. Then, my soul, why need you murmur tho your pathway is not bright, For perhaps the sun is shining just behind the shades of night. Lo! the clouds are upward lifting and behold the sun shines through, Filling all the earth with gladness, ushering in a day that's new. And, indeed, the silver lining streaming through the mists afar, Make the clouds that once seemed darkest, glisten as a glowing star. Then, my soul, faint not, nor falter, tho the waiting time be long, But remember, 'tis the darkest just before the morning's dawn. Sabbathday Lake, Me.
