Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Mt. Lebanon : The new ' Zion's ' House is still an all-absorbing theme of the Church Family. They purpose finishing only the Sanctuary this winter, which will be ready for use by the early part of the new year, at leastâ€”warmed by steam, lighted by gas. Some minor, but necessary, buildings are now being built. The North Family have been doing a wonder. A large reservoir capable of holding more than 7,582 hogsheads, or nearly a half million gallons of water, has been built about 600 feet from the dwellings, and at a hight sufficient to throw, by its own weight, over the highest of their buildings. The reservoir is fed from a pond a quarter of a mile distant, and conveyed from the reservoir through iron pipes five and six inches in diameter.
