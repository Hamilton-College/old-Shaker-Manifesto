ACROSTIC. Henrietta Morgan. Consecration, precious virtue, Over all take full control; Not one talent for reserving, Sacrifice to God the whole. Every thought, word and action, Consecrate anew each day; Reward will crown the effort, And the right will bear sway: Teach us then, oh Consecration, In thy service to remain; Over every wrong we'll triumph, Never to retract again. West Pitt afield, Mass.
