WAR BY CHABLES J. BEATTIE War is man's masterpiece in crime, - - The scourge of every age and clime; It sweeps the fertile fields of grain, Destroys the city, wastes the plain, With battle storm and sulphur rain, While broken drums and battered shields Are trophies of its battle-fields Alike in every land. War's ministers of lust and hate Subvert the law, o'erthrow the state, Annihilate the church and school. Bring anarchy, with iron rule ; Murder their code, Mammon their tool; Pushing their carnival of gore, Sweeping the wide world o'er and o'er With fiery glare and brand. Down the dark cycles of the world War's shaft of rage and malice hurled; On land and sea, in sanguine strife, With fire and sword, with spear and knife, Preying on human peace and life. Its fields with dead and dying strewn, Soldier and steed together thrown In one dark charnel grave. Its hireling panders, trained in fight, Cast on the world war's vicious blight; By its dread mandate, madly given, The patriot from his home is driven And all the ties of kindred riven ; The orphans' sighs for loved sires slain, The widow's tears, that fall like rain, Fail to restore the brave. Its mail-clad hosts have left their scar In every land e'er cursed with war. Gaunt famine brooded o'er the land : Rank plague, with the destroyer's wand, And pestilence went hand in hand ; Stern desolation swept the track [black Where war's wild clouds rolled fierce and Above the battle's din. It is from chariots rolled in blood, Have crushed the gentle, pure and good; Industry vanished, morals died, Sweet charity was crucified, And all the streams of mercy dried, While headless trunk and sightless eyes Attest the glory of the prize, War's minions ever win.
