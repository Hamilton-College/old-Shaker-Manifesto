Dear Editor, As my age places me among the fathers... Shaker Village, N. H. Dec. 1877 Dear Editor, As my age places me among the fathers, And as good fathers always love to please the children, I have wondered if the boys and girls would not be interested with some account of my former life, as a sailor, and the events which conspired to bring me to my peaceful home with the Shakers. I offer some inci- dents connected with my experience, hoping, by so doing, to do a little good to those for whom I feel a father's love and interest. We will commence with the description of one little Coral Island in the midst of the Pacific Ocean on which we staid about nine weeks. Its position is about 4 deg., North latitude, 157 West longitude, from Greenwich, London, in England. The width of the Pacific Ocean is stated by Geographers to be ten thousand miles, and its entire length from North to South nearly or quite a thousand miles greater than its width. O, it is a vast Ocean! We have sailed on its waters, weary days, months and years; from the latitude of sixty degrees South, in doubling Cape Horn, to that of fifty-two degrees on the North West coast of America. But to return to our Coral Islands whose existence we first learned when a boy, about twelve years of age, from reading 'Fanning's Voyages.' Fanning, as perhaps some of the boys know was a Seal-man from Stonington, Conn, and visited many of the islands in the Pacific Ocean, situated in the South Temperate, and South Frigid Zones, for the purpose of obtaining the skins of the Fur Seal and other fur-bearing amphibious, animals, that were very plenty in these islands. These Seal men used to take their furs to China, and exchange them for teas and silks, which they shipped to Europe and America at an advanced price. It was while making a passage from the islands where he had collected his cargo of fur seal skins, that Fanning discovered the island that now bears his name. He went ashore in his small boat, and found the cocoa nuts growing so near the shore, and so abundant, that his boat's crew by forming a line, were able to pass the nuts from one to another, until their boat was filled. He remained but a short time at the Island, and proceeded on his way to China. Fanning's brother, afterward visited the island and remained three months; collecting Beech de Mer, or Sea Slug; a substance that looks very much like an old india rubber MAJsranffiSTO.

After this preface we will relate the cause of our being on this island, and what transpired there; classing our future correspondence under the title of the Autobiography of a Quondam Sailor.
