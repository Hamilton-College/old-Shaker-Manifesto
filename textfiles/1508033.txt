THE BEATITUDES. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. The pure in heart are blessed, For they shall see the God of love: Blessed are the merciful, For they have mercy from above. Blessed are they who thirst and hunger and righteousness ; Blessed are the meek hunger after truth Blessed are the meek after truth Blessed are they for they shall earth and heaven both possess.
