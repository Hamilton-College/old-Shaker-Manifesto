WE ARE BUILDING. [Contributed by Maria Wood.] are building our home on Eternity's shore While we dwell in our structure of clay; We are shipping materials onward before, With the close of each hastening day. We are sending the thought that our spirit has 'wrought, In the 'wonderful glow of the brain; And the timber is grown from the seed we have sown 'Mid the shades of our sorrow and pain. We are building our homes on the beautiful street While we dwell in the by-way of fears; And the roses that bloom there, so pure and so sweet Must be watered and nourished by tears; And the light that shall shine in aglory divine Must be found in the darkness and gloom, And the foundation laid, in the cloud and the shade Of the road that leads down to the tomb. We are building our home in the valley of Life By the side of Eternity's sea; And the work that we do 'mid the scenes of earth's strife Shall decide what that home is to be. Every thought leaves its trace on that wonderful place, Every deed, be it evil or fair; And the structure will show, all the life lived below, All the sinning and sorrow and care. ï¿½Selected.
