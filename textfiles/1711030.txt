CLAUS SPRECKELS' ENORMOUS INCOME When to this is added the fact that he pay? not one cent of duty on this crude sugar brought from the Islands, some idea of the enormous profits of the business may be gained. It was estimated three years ago, when the business was at its height, that Spreckels made six hundred barrels of sugar everjT day, each barrel worth thirty dollars, thus giving him a daily revenue of eighteen thousand dollars, or six million five hundred and seventy thousand dollars a year. His profits were a clear ten dollars on every barrel, making his yearly income two million one hundred and ninety thousand dollars. Now, however, the profits have dwindled sadly, as the railroad company can no longer make special contracts with him, and a rival sugar refining company is competing with him for the control of the sugar interests on the islands. King Kalakaua, after borrowing three-quarters of a million from Spreckels, has recently negotiated a loan of two million dollars with English capitalists, a proceeding that led to a violent quarrel between the monarch and his money lender. So leng, however, as the Reciprocity Treaty with Hawaii continues in force, Spreckels will coin money out of his sugar interests. It is estimated that he is worth twenty-five million dollars, a large part of which is invested in plantations, machinery, steamships, and sailing vessels. George H.
