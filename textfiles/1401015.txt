GOD'S SCHOOL: RECITATION FOR ADVANCED SCHOLARS One by one, as the days go by, To learn our lesson we bravely try: For every hour some task is set-— Difficult, easy, short or long; Whether we come to it weak or strong— Somehow or other it must be met. Graded well is this school of ours ; Each one's duties within his powers. His task the thing that he needs to know ; Many a time does the page grow dim— Before tired eyes the hard words swim, And the hours go by so slow—so slow ! Various ages the class room shareFlaxen ringlets, and thin, gray hair Both fall over the lesson books. Often the little ones laugh in glee As beautiful words their bright eyes see, Wliile the aged sigh with thoughtful looks. Skillful teachers assembled here Toil unceasingly year by year; Never mistake in their work was known. Only the scholars, weary and vexed— Idle, impatient, tired, perplexed— Suffer from errors all their own. The Spirit teaches the highest class ; Time takes all as they onward pass; Joy is claimed by the happy few, While Experience, Care and Pain Treasures of knowledge help us gain, And Memory hears the grand review. But patiently learning, day by day, We are waiting to hear the Master say That our school day's work on earth is done And after this last, long term shall pass To be transferred to this upper class, Where advanced work is begun.
