Sanitary. ONION AS A NERVINE Onions are almost the best nervine known. No medicine is so useful in cases of nervous prostration, and there is nothing else that will so quickly relieve and tone up a worn out system- Onions are useful in all cases of coughs, colds and influenza; in consumption, insomnia, hydrophobia, scurvy, gravel, kidney and liver complaints. Eaten every other day they soon have a clearing and whitening effect upon the complexion. N. Y. Med. Times. The above is opportune... The above is opportune. Many a reader will lovingly whisper thanks to the New York Medical Times for placing before him so delectable a dish, with the assurance that it will not only act as a panacea for our long catalogue of ills, but will a.lso rejuvenate the system and beautify the complexion. Indeed, whether boiled, baked, fried, roasted or even raw, onions must be the veritable 'Elixir of Life.' This will please our good brother John Bradford, who has raised hundreds of bushels of onions this season and obtained a premium for them at the Vermont State Fair. H. C. Blinn.
