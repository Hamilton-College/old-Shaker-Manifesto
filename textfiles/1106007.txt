WHAT GOOD CAN I DO NOW TO-DAY? JACOB S. KULP Dear Editor — I thought I would offer my mite to help build up the cause of good ; thus it is i send you my simple efforts in the form of an Acrostic. If you think them worthy a place in the Manifesto,publish them ; if not, consign them to the waste basket, and 1 shall be satisfied in trying each day to do what good I can. Wherefore should the people murmur? Have they any cause at all ? Are the crowd cot in the error? Take ye heed lest ye may fall. GS-od is good and wise and righteous, Over land and sea He reigns ; O'er the ocean and the dry land — Does He not His power proclaim? Cast your bread upon the waters, After days it will return ; Nothing doubting, but be cheerful ; It is not our lot to mourn. Do not fret nor grieve nor sorrow ; On God's providence depend ; ]STor be fearful for to-morrow, — Only trust : God is our friend ! We do all enjoy His favor, Though we may not sense His care ; O, may I receive forever, Divine blessings evermore; Amen ! let each one be thankful ; Ye who claim the Saviour's way. Strive to grow in grace and knowledge, Hoping for a better day. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
