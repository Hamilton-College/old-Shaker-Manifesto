Juvenile CATCHKG Sl'XSHKE My next door neighbor's little girl, A cunning two-year old, Wondered one day why drooped her flowers, And pleaded to be told. Then said her mamma :—'Here-in-doors The sunshine does n't come To warm and bless and gladden them And drive away their gloom. And so they droop, as children do Who get no tender love To cheer them on that upward way Whereon we all must move.' 18 SHAKER MANIFESTO. Next day, when mamma went to seek Her darling at her play, She found her standing in the sun In just the queerest way : For there she held aloft a cup Above her pretty head, 'What are you doing, LuLu dear?' Mamma, astonished, said. And she, her cup still held aloft— Bless her, ye heavenly powers ! 'I'm catching sunshine, mamma dear, To give my 'ittle f'owers.' Type of all children there was she; Who in life's garden stand, Still holding patiently aloft Their life cups in their hand. And so the world is kept alive, And freshened every minute, By the dear grace that overflows The children who are in it. Anon
