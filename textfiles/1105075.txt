The Unruly Member Thomas Adams who wrote about two hundred years ago, is quoted as thus describing the ' unruly member.' 'To create so little a piece of flesh, and to put such vigor into it, to give it neither bones nor nerves, yet to make it stronger than arms or legs, and those most able and serviceable parts of the body, required a God, ' Because it is so forcible, therefore hath the most wise God ordained, that it shall be but little, that it shall be but one, that so the depravity and singularity may abate the vigor of it. If it were paired, as the arms, legs, hands, feet, it would be more unruly ; for he that cannot tame one tongue, how would he be troubled with twain!
