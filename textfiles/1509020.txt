LIFE AND LIGHT. KANCT O. DANFOBD. 'In Him was life ; and the life was the light of man. ' John i; 4. 'Ye are the light of the world. ' It is evident from these texts that the life of Christ was called a light, and this same light he imparted to his followers, thus constituting them ' the light of the world. ' It is also evident that those disciples could not have that ministration except they followed his example by living strictly as he lived, renouncing all that might be called good or great by the proud and self-exalted ones of earth; bearing a full cross until the Master could approvingly say, ' Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. ' They had made a perfect separation from all the elements which constitute or sustain merely a worldly life. Their lives were so fully permeated with that living testimony which he preached that they stood forth as ' The light of the world.' It is thus that every Christian is called to live, that our lives may be, not merely a candle on a candle-stick, but shine forth with the beauteous rays of the morning illumined by the ' Sun of righteousness.' Then shall we be disciples in very deed. Canterbury, N. H.
