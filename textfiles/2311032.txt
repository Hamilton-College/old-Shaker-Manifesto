Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Center Family. Oct. 1893. We are in the midst of apple picking; commenced on Tuesday last and expect' to finish this week, so you may imagine a small crop for us; still I think there will be enough to make us satisfied and, we trust, thankful. Have had a large crop of pears and a ready sale, so far, with good prices averaging a little over one dollar per bus. Potatoes have been very fine and a large yield, the price on them has fallen off recently. 268 THE MANIFESTO. The foundations are being laid for an ice house to be located just below the pond where we usually get the ice, so there will be quite a saving of teaming. Brother Robert Valentine and some of the Brethren and Sisters are engaged in preparing lovage root for drying. The Central Ministry are now at Hancock which place they leave next week for Enfield Ct. We are, I regret to say, afflicted with colds in our family, still no one is confined to the Infirmary in consequence. Thus far there has not been enough frost to kill the tomatoes hence we are having fresh tomatoes from the vines. Timothy Rayson.
