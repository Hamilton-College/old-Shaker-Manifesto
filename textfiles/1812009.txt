BIBLE SCHOOLS. NO. 2. Dr. Carl. In continuation of the article we had in the October number of The Manifesto on Bible Schools we add. The pupils will fail to appreciate and value the beauty of a Christ life unless they see it manifested by their Christian leaders and those with whom they may mingle. In order that we may draw others into the Gospel Christ life we must first be drawn ourselves and then walk very closely to him, for Jesus says, 'If ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye wTill and it shall be done unto you.' These grand and glorious teachings of the Bible are Spiritual truths and that must be Spiritually understood and if the Holy Spirit dwell not in us how shall we be able to teach them aright. If our hearts are purified and we are truly made free because we know the truth then we can teach it to others. Again the teacher must be regarded as an instructor who should be throughout acquainted with the history, geography and ancient customs concerning the lesson and deeply conscious of the various duties taught in it and as much as possible be able to clearly communicate his knowledge and personally bring the truth to each pupil individually under his care. Much attention should be paid in questioning, which should not always be so simple as to call forth no mental effort neither should it be so difficult as to be impossible for the scholar to comprehend the principal object of the question, but to gradually lead the pupil to think for himself and to express his thoughts clearly. Teach your pupils how to study� assisting such at times will encourage them to investigate during the week. They should be made to feel that the Bible is the word of eternal life, the true source of comfort and strength to all who believe its precious Gospel promises. Long and tiresome exhortations are unnecessary to bring the child to the gospel truths. Careful, prayerful instruction will more frequently produce impressions that are lasting. Again we should endeavor to become familiar with I the character and circumstances of those whom we are to instruct. Watch their actions, win their confidence, sympathize with them in their trials, share their joys, be a sincere friend as a brother or sister to each one. Remember them in your prayers. Do not become discouraged because you cannot see the result of your labor now:�'Be ye steadfast, immovable; abounding in the work of the Lord, for of such as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the sight of the Lord.' Therefore let us make the Bible Schools in every family an earnest life-long work for truly the imprint made on their lives by our words and actions will not be erased during the time of eternity. It thus becomes us to devote nothing short of our noblest energies to building up the most holy faith the Gospel truths with those who are in our care. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
