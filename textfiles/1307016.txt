S. Mabee.—Dear Friend... Leadville, Apr. 23, 1883. S. Mabee.—Dear Friend ;—March number of S. M. duly received with thanks. My opinion of it, (so far meeting your request,) is, that it is all that it purports to be, Christian in its tenor and effect, its object being to inculcate and develop the divine principle innate with all, by inheritance, differing only in degree. This principle of goodness to which I refer, is eminently characteristic with those known as benefactors in all ages, of whom Jesus of Nazareth stood prominent. To deify Christ the crucified, as the 'very God' 'before all time, the redeemer of the world' etc., is a matter ot education.—His crucifixion a result, not a necessity. Bigotry crucified him and many thousands of his disciples, even as it persecuted the earnest, god-like Quakers of Salem. I am much opposed to organized creedal power. I believe in practical religion, which simply means, do good deeds, not creeds will save us, self redemption therefore is imperative. 'Work out your own salvation' is incumbent/upon all, by good works, inasmuch as 'faith without works is dead.' I am what may be termed an independent Spiritualist, have lived twenty three years in the Rocky Mountains, am an advocate of anti-creedism, regard all men as brethren, and God the Creator, as our father. Yours Truly, Jas. K. Jones.
