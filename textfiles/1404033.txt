Evans ;-In the New York Tribune, of the 23rd, I noticed an article over your signature entitled 'Land Limitation.' I would like to reach clear over (500 miles and shake hands with you, but in so doing I should reach over and past hundreds of other thinkers, who like you and me have caught the gleam of the coming dawn of the day of truth. I suppose the word Elder signifies that you are a follower and standard-bearer of the Nazarene. In my weak way I try to be the same. I believe that his word, his truth, will yet rule the world. And I am sure that ' Land Limitation' is precisely in the line of his doctrine. The Church is not up to the teachings of its great Head, nor will it be, I suppose, forever, for our progress towards the Infinite must needs be eternal. But I am persuaded the time is not far distant when all monopoly, and especially land monopoly will be reckoned, by our religious teachers, in the same list with robbery and extortion. This would be ' political preaching, ' it is true, but we all remember how the abolitionist preachers were reminded that 'Christ's kingdom is not of this world. ' And we remember too how they preached on, being assured that although not of the world, that kingdom must dominate the world. Those who feel the pressure of the tyrant's heel, can best describe his power. I know there are thousands, who like myself could tell bitter stories of seemingly unending strife against hard circumstances. Yet, to the cry of the monopolist, our condition is good enough. They tell me I can succeed if I work. I admit it. lean. I think I will. I can work. I am not afraid of self-denial. I can manage my farm. I say I will succeed. To the monopolist, this is enough. Having sold his own soul, and dwarfed and shrivelled every noble power of his being to gain wealth, he is not ashamed to ask me to do the same. So I toil on. I give the years, the best of my life, to get me a homeï¿½to gain the right to plow the land and make bread. Why, God gave me the right to plow. And while I am thus toiling for a foot-hold on the earth, and as the monopolist views it, it may be succeeding, what am I doing for my own soul? Joseph Cook lectures in the near village, on subjects I long to study, but cannot hear him. I have not the time nor the few cents to spare. There are Libraries within reach of me, but I must not read. Even cheap books are too dear for me while I am paying for the right to work. And if I succeed in heaping up a few dollars at such a cost, and then lifting my son out of the class of the oppressed into the class of the oppressors, then the monopolist thinks I ought to be satisfied. Why, sir, the mortgage-ridden farmers of this country are dead intellectually and morally, and do not know it. They think if they pay for their farms at the expense of half a life-time of toil, and throw their souls in, they are doing well. God prosper you, sir. With respect, James Marlin
