[As Br. Samuel did not intend the following for publication, we have only to say that we retained it for all the readers of the Manifesto, as it is well worthy of a general circulation. Br. Samuel is seventy-nine years of age, and yet quite active in all the duties of life. His early gospel home was in this Society, but in 1859 he removed to the Society in Gloucester, Me., where he at present resides, loved and respected by all who know him.ï¿½Ed.J
