Books and Papers. The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for February contains extra pages and exceptionally varied and interesting matter. Dr. H. S. Drayton in the illustrated opening article learnedly discusses the 'Brain of Woman Relatively,' and throws a clear lifiht upon that much mooted question. Dr. Edgar C. Beall's phrenograph of William Dean Howells, the famous novelist, from a personal examination, is an artistic pen picture and also closely analytical. Prof. Nelson Sizer continues his series, 'How to Study Strangers,' and contributes also a phrenological description of the well-known humorist, Marshall P. Wilder, from an examination. This will prove interesting as an echo from the consultation room of the veteran character reader. Horace Mann, one of the most eminent educators of America, is the subject of a sketch by Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells, in which the phrenological views and wonderful labors of the great philanthropist are appreciatively set forth. Child culture and hygiene receive attention as usual. The editorial columns contain an important testimonial from Dr. Lyman Abbott in favor of phrenology. Character sketches of Dr. Parkhurst, Supt. Byrnes, District Attorney Fellows, andDelancy Nicoll of New York, also Master Workman Sovereign, besides the field notes, etc., are new and attractive features. Price, 15cts; $1.50 a year.

V. Gifford &amp; Co., Kokomo, Ind. BREAD AND BUTTER LETTERS. More than once I have been seriously troubled because a young friend has failed to acknowledge to me her safe arrival at her home after visiting me, writes Mrs. Lyman Abbott in the February Ladies' Home Journal. The 'bread and butter letter,' as it is sometimes called, because it is supposed to be an expression of thanks for what bread and butter stands for, should be written within twenty-four hours after arrival at one's destination, to the hostess whose hospitality one has been enjoying. It is not quite enough for a young man who has been visiting his college mate to write to him alone; courtesy calls him to send at least a brief note to his friend's mother, or the lady taking her place. You think it is not an easy thing to do, and it is not altogether if you try to make your note unique and different from others, but the simplest way is the best way, and if you have had a pleasant time say so. An agreeable incident of your journey, or a few lines about the circumstances into which you have gone, will make a letter which your hostess will enjoy, and she will set you down in her selected list of well-bred young people. Besides that, you will have the consciousness that you have been thoughtful of another's feelings, and have not been guilty of the appearance of ingratitude. The New England Magazine OUR people ought to know more at this time about Brazil than most of them do,ï¿½about its history and its great resources. The New England Magazine does a public service in publishing in its February number a fully illustrated article on Brazil, which answers all the questions which one could ask. The article is by Mr. John C. Redman, who is as well qualified as any man in the country, by his long familiarity with Brazilian affairs, to write such an article.- - - - -Warren F.
