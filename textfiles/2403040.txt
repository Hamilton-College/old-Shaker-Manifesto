The New England Magazine OUR people ought to know more at this time about Brazil than most of them do,ï¿½about its history and its great resources. The New England Magazine does a public service in publishing in its February number a fully illustrated article on Brazil, which answers all the questions which one could ask. The article is by Mr. John C. Redman, who is as well qualified as any man in the country, by his long familiarity with Brazilian affairs, to write such an article.- - - - -Warren F.
