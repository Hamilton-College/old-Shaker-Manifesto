AIM HIGH. We often hear men sigh for riches, that they may become great. It does not require riches to aid the sorrowful, or to show others the way to lofty aims and noble purposes, and thus gain the love and esteem of all who know you. Why then settle down to a common place, unimp'-rtant life, when we can do our fellow creatures so much good, with so little exertion on our part? Place your stakes on a high point and climb to them, press upward toward the goal. No one need ever sit down and weep, as once a great conqueror wept, because of no more worlds to visit, no more wonders to contemplate, and no more glorious exhibitions of Divine power and wisdom to behold. Many men have spent long and useful lives, doing good and making those around them truly happy; in other words they have made the world better because they have lived in it, and yet they are unknown to fame. Make it a habit to aim high, for habit soon develops into a second nature, and naturally conforms to custom, and it is all important to strike the right track, for on that hangs our future destiny. Men of genuine merit have been looked up to by the masses as a model, a leader, a great man. Don't let our lives be passed in such a way that we shall say regretfully : ' 'Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours, And ask them what report they bore to Heaven, And how they inight have borne more welcome news.' Perform every duty deliberately, carefully and honestly. Be kind, be good, be true, and strive each day to become more and more like Him, whose example we should keep constantly before us. Then we shall be supremely happy. Selected.
