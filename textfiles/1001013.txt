A HAPPY NEW YEAE ! Now, and all through the year, does this department wish and urge upon all A Happy New Year ! to the old and young, readers of The Manifesto and the many millions who do not read it, but may hear that it urges a happy, Happiest Year during 1880, by the endeavors of each and all to live better than ever before; do more good than heretofore ; take upon self more cross to the denial of the wrong, and for the encouragement of virtue and exceeding righteousness. We ask your company in walking the narrow, Christ path â€” the path of present justification and happiness, and the fruition of all future happiness, enduring without end.
