THE ENDS HAVE GONE NAPOLEON BROWN The end of Gods has come. 'For the Lord our God is one Lord, and we have no others before Him.' The end of Idolatry has come, for we worship the Lord our God and Him only do we serve. 268 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. The end of Swearing has come, for our 'communication is Yea, Yea, and Nay, Nay.' The end of Sabbaths has come ; for we have come to the Lord of the Sabbath. The end of the Father and Mother has come, for we have given them up to follow Christ. The end of Killing has come, for we have put up our Swords into their sheaths. The end of Adultery has come, for we look not upon man nor woman to lust after either. The end of Stealing has come, for we 'covet not.' The end of bearing false witness has come, for we love our neighbors as ourselves. The end of Coveting has come, for we have no wives nor do we want any, being in the resurrection where they neither marry nor give in marriage ; but are as the Angels of God, having all property in common. The end of Sin has come, for Christ has appeared to us the second time 'without sin' unto 'salvation.' The end of the Law has come, for the Kingdom is set up within us, therefore we are a law unto ourselves. The end of our lives has come, for we have lost them for Christ's sake. The end of time has come, lor we have been begotton of God and born into eternity. Therefore the end of all things has surely come. Pleasant Hill, Ky.
