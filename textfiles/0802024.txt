DR. J. M. PEEBLES We have received a letter from Bro. Peebles, from Madras, in which he expresses his delight with the amount of mediumship, magic, and psychological phenomena he has witnessed. ' Casting out devils.' he says, 'It is as common in Southern India as it used to be in Palestine in Jesus' time.' He is much saddened by the sights of suffering incident to the prevailing famine, and expresses his deep sympathy for the sufferers. The following is from the Madras Daily Times: 'Three weeks ago we announced the arrival in Madras of Dr. J. M. Peebles, formerly an American Consul in Asiatic Turkey, and the author of several books. During the period that he has been in Madras he has M^nsriiPESTO. THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. Â¦4,1 \been most industrious in obtaining information from all sources, and the chapters of hi forthcoming work, devoted to Southern India, should be most interesting. Dr. Peebles flails on Monday next by the Suffolk for Natal and Cape Town, en route to England. The Doctor, during his stay here, has exhibited that push and energy which is characteristic of Americans. Though he has been, as we have said, hardly three weeks in Madras, he has managed to visit the famine camps, the Leper Hospital, the museum, libraries, all the public buildings and burning ghauts. He has witnessed the clever feats of magicians, seen the devil priests professedly cast out demons, looked into a higher class of psychological phenomena, difficult to get at and more difficult to comprehend, and met a good many native gentlemen of various castes. He has also received from the Chief Secretary to Government much kindness in the way of a sight of public documents, and in every conceivable way has had the opportunity of seeing all sides of our social life. Dr. Peebles was at the breakfast in the Banqueting Hall yesterday in honor of the Viceroy, and was charmed with the almost Republican freedom evinced. They have nothing of the kind in the West, he says, and he thinks he has a wrinkle from the ancient civilization of India to bring before the century-old Republic of the New World. We shall look forward to the publicaton of Dr. Peebles' forthcoming work with interest.'
