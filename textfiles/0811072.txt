Ethics of spiritualism Andrew Jackson Davis Religio-Philosophical Publishing House, Chicago, 111. ' have just read your announcement concerning the series of articles you will soon begin to publish from the ever-active and thoroughly honest pen of Brother Hudson Tuttle. He is a farmer, and knows how to plow and sow and reap; a grape-grower, and can discriminate between good and bad fruit. He writes from the fullness of the sj.irit, and therefore he constantly rises above the clouds of materialism. He is no sophist, no hairsplitting apologist for the loose practices of mankind, and so you may look for the highst and most philosophical statement of the morality from his faithful pen ; and the comfort is great when one reflects and knows to a certainty that Hudson Tuttle is no hypocrite, and hence is always personally as good as his written word.'Price in Cloth 60 cts. paper, 40 cts
