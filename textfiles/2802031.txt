The Ladies' Home Journal The wife of the President has given special permission to John Philip Sousa, The March King, to dedicate to her his new composition, just finisht, and which will be called The Lady of the White House. Mrs. McKinley forwarded her permission last week to the editor of The Ladies' Home Journal, which will publish the Sousa composition complete in its next issue. This magazine has also received for the same number a new and large portrait of Mrs. McKinley, taken a few days ago in the White House conservatory. This is the second photograph which the President's wife has allowed to be taken within ten years, the first portrait taken of her since 1887 having also gone to The Ladies'1 Home Journal, which publisht it in its last October number, causing the entire edition of that issue to be exhausted.
