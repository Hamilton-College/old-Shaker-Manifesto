Fashion We copy below with great pleasure from the Albany Evening Times—our most interesting local—that which should be preserved in letters of gold. It is from the facile pen of 'Will Wimble,' or F. W. White, whose future we will watch with brilliant anxiety. ' Strange, invisible power! A mythical queen, that has more followers than Christianity, and whose mandates are obeyed more blindly and willingly than those of the most august potentate; whose reign is perpetual, whose tastes are capricious and whose whims are preposterous L Whence she comes or where she abides, no human being can tell, but her will is communicated to mankind by some inscrutable instinct, and with a marvelous submission her subjects follow and yield to her wildest fancies. The rich and poor, high and low, intelligent and dull, saint and sinner, are slaves to her desires; the wealthy and independent are the quickest to fawn upon her, and no matter how tyrannical her reign, they glory the more in their idol, and are her most eager votaries. Should man in his greatness rise to overthrow her mandates, or refuse allegiance to her laws, Queen Fashion's premier, Society, frowns upon him and he is cast into the disgraceful abyss of old fogy ism and eccentricity. 'The notion is nearly everywhere prevalent that whatever is fashionable is right; it would have few objections made to it if the reverse were as true, that whatever is right should be fashionable. If such were the case, not so many, as now do, would leave unpaid the tradesman and the state, to worship long and lovingly at the shrine of fashion.'
