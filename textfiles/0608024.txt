CHRISTIANITY OF THE FUTURE DAVID SWING The last body has been racked, the last heart broken for religious belief. The State demands only peaceable citizens, the guilt of too much belief or too little, it leaves to be determined at the bar of God. To what shape of Christianity have we come ? Not fully to any form has our age come, but with slow and sure footsteps it is drawing near a religion of character. The pageantry'of the barbaric ages, the curious questions of the schoolmen, the mysteries of the old creeds rivaling the mysteries of Eleusis, the bloody struggles for temporal power, have all been turned aside or hurled into oblivion, that the human heart might see itself in the great mirror of Jesus Christ. At last, the world draws near the truth that Christianity is not an external architecture, or art, or scarlet robe, is not a speculation; is not a military conquest; but it is a washing white of self in the fountain opened in the being of Christ. The words, 'Blessed are they who do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates of the city,' are words that betray the genius of the coming religion. If our hearts are not too sanguine, we^are standing upon the borders of an age that will hold a religion of principle, not of form, not of curious or complex dogma, but of those deep principles that make the better man. It is daily becoming more and more evident, that what God demanded all through the Old and New Testaments, was an obedience of his law, the purity of human life; evident in all the reflections of reason, (hat religion must lie in the inner life; and now, it has become evident by the condition of society, that what is demanded is a religion of virtue.
