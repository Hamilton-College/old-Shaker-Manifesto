A VISION. MARION JOHNSON. I saw beyond earth's shadows A dawn of golden light; I saw the hill-tops gleaming, Enwrapped in radiance bright. I saw that from the darkness, Evolved a glorious morn; Kegnant with life and splendor Of earthly suffering born. The mist and gloom of sorrow Oft veils the sunbeam bright; Hope's many tinted rainbow Ne'er greets our longing sight; But when the cloud is lifted Disclosing, sweet and rare, The richness and the fullness Love bringeth everywhereï¿½ O, then our Father's goodness Eevealeth to our view, The gradual unfolding Of all life's grand tableaux; We see how Love hath led us By crystal waters pure, In paths unknown and hidden, To heavenly treasures sure. Canterbury, N. H.
