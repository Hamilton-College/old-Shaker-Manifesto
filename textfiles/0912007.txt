SHAKER THEOLOGY F. W. EVANS What Shakers have taught for one hundred years : 1.—Human beings have eternal existences, but immortality of soul life is the fruit of obedience to Christian principles,— soul death the fruit of sin. 2.—Probation continues in all stages of existence. 3.—The mercy of God is as eternal as the existence of God. 4.—God is male and female. 5.—The Trinity, Atonement, Vicarious Sacrifice—the Blood doctrine—Physical Resurrection, Deathbed conversions, Eternal hell and heaven for what men and women can do in the body ; Salvation, simply for believing sometliing, or damnation for not believing, are part and parcel of the old heavens passing away. On all these points, Shakers have fought the good fight of faith, and have won. Their ideas are becoming popular — millions are approximating the system of Shaker Theology. Sph'itualism is the solvent to disintegrate the false Christianity of the Constantine Church. With singing and dancing we rejoice before God, at the downfall of bloody Christianity— all Church and State systems. Inasmuch as the ' Great Whore' has lived deliciously, drinking the blood of Saints—-so much sorrow and trouble are hers, which we cheerfully accord to her.
