THE CHURCH SPIDER. Two spiders, so the story goes, Upon a living bent, Entered the meeting house one day, And hopefully were heard to say, 'Here we shall have, at least, fair play, With nothing to prevent.' Each chose her place and went to work; The light webs grew apace : One on the altar spun her thread, But shortly came the sexton dread, And swept her off, and so half dead, She sought another place. 'I'll try the pulpit next,' said she, 'There, surely is a prize : The desk appears so neat and clean, I'm sure no spider there has been; Besides, how often have I seen, The pastor brushing flies.' She tried the pulpit, but alas ! Her hopes proved visionary : With dusting brush the sexton came, And spoiled her geometric game, Nor gave her time nor space to claim The right of sanctuary. At length half starved, and weak and lean, She sought her former neighbor Who now had grown so sleek and round, She weighed a fraction of a pound, And looked as if the art she'd found, Of living without labor. 'How is it, friend,' she asked, 'that I Endure such thumps and knocks, While you have grown so very gross? 'Tis plain,' she answered : 'not a loss I've met since first I spun across The contribution box.'
