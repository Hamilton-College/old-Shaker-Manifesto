WARNING TO BIBLICAL SCHOLARS Biblical scholars are sometimes sadly entrapped. In a little town of Bavaria, the other day, sat an aged fraulein and her father confessor, who was, at least supposed to know the bible by heart. The fraulein enjoyed a practical joke iu spite of her age, and and the reverened father, although a thoroughly pious man, was not a whit behind her. Our fraulein said: 'Father, you may have heard that some of the persistent explorers in the Holy Land have just discovered a huge heap of bones which are supposed, on pretty good authority, to be those of the children which Herod killed.' 'Ah, indeed ! 'replied the pater, thoroughly interested. ' Yes, I had heard of it,' continued the fraulein, 286 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. ' and, strange to say, nearly half the bones were white as the snow of the Alps, while the rest were almost black as ebony.' 'Well, well,' exclaimed the good priest, 'that is certainly very remarkable.' 'And the problem to be solved is,' continued the fraulein, ' whether the white belonged to the girls and black ones to the boys, or vice versa. The explorers were greatly vexed by the matter, and could arrive at no satisfactory conclusion. Now, what do you think Father?' ' Oh,' wittily rejoined the priest, 'of course the black ones belonged to the girl babies, and the white ones to the boy babies.' We ask the same question of our readers, and they had better guess several times before they read the rest of this paragraph. When they have settled the matter they can refer to the answer of the fraulein, who, with a merry twinkle in her eye, said: ' Father, you must have read your Bible to very little purpose, for the account tells us that only boy babies were killed by Herod.'
