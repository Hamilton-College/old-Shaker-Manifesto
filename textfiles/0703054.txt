A Prayer [The following Prayer has something so real in it, that while we publish it, we would fain have all, with us, become better because of it. Possibly, none of us would look upon a faded, deathly face but would be moved to a compassion, even by that of a known enemy. Please read the last verse twice. Ed.'| If I should die to-night, My friends would look upon my quiet face Before they laid it in its resting-place, And deem that death had left it almost fair; And laying snow-white flowers against my hair, Would smooth it down with tearful tenderness, And fold my hands with lingering caress— Poor hands ! so empty and so cold to-night. If I should die to-night, My friends would call to mind, with loving thought, Some kindly deed the icy hand had wrought; Some gentle word the frozen lips had said; Errands on which the willing feet had sped. The memory of my selfishness and pride, My hasty words would all be laid aside; And so I should be loved and mourned to-night. I£ I should die to-night, E'en hearts estranged would turn once more to me, Recalling other days remorsefully; The eyes that chill me with averted glance Would look upon me as of yore, perchance, And soften, in the old familiar way— For who would war with dull, unconscious clay! So I might rest, forgiven by all, to-night. O friends ! I pray to-night, Keep not your kisses for my dead, cold brow; The way is lonely—let me feel them now; Think gently of me; I am travel-worn ; My faltering feet are pierced with many a thorn. Forgive, O hearts estranged—forgive, I plead ! When dreamless rest is mine, I shall not need The tenderness for which I long to-night.
