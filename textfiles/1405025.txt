READ AT THE FUNERAL OF POLLY ANN TAYLOR, MAR., 19, 1884. BY D. CLINTON BRAINARD. Duty again summons us to perform the last sad rites for one so dearly loved, so upright and faithful, who has earned the respect of all who knew her, and faithfully performed her whole duty on earth,ï¿½now enters the new life. Is she dead? Or has she merely laid aside the mortal part, as we would lay aside a garment for which we have no more use? Jesus said, ' I am the resurrection and the life, he that believeth on me though he were dead, yet shall he live. ' I believe our sister is with us, that her spirit will hover over us, urging us to persevere in the good work, to be true to the moral grandeur of the cause in which we have enlisted, and to have faith in God who alone giveth victory. When I see one after another of our faithful veterans and burden-bearers of Zion, leaving us for their spirit homes, their places vacant in our already depleted ranks, it fills me with sorrow and anxiety, and prompts my soul to entreat more fervently our Heavenly Father to hasten the work of redemption, to call mankind from their transient pleasures and vain aspirings, that they may prepare for themselves garments of righteousness and peace, although numbers do not always constitute strength. For ' the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. ' But it is in the rigid adherence to the p-inciples of righteousness, integrity and truth. In not being swerved from the path of stern duty, by the combined efforts of the world within or without; cultivating universal love for all and malice toward none. Stretching forth our hands and hearts to the poor, giving due heed to charity and friendly kindness, binding up the broken hearted, assuaging the grief of the mourner and, at all times, administering the truth. If this be our life devotion, though our numbers be few, yet when we assemble in Christ's name, He will be in our midst to bless. Let us not compromise one single vital principle, giving the enemy vantage ground. We can conquer though the conflict be singlehanded and alone. Who has not admired the heroic struggle of the brave three hundred Spartans, contending the narrow pass of Thermopyle, against the innumerable Persian host, whose very arrows darkened the sun? Shall we be less valiant in a much more glorious cause? ' If God be for us, who can be against us?' Let us take courage and contend valiantly, and victoriously for the right. 'For the righteous shall nourish like a palm tree, and shall grow like the cedar of Lebanon. For He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy way. The Lord is our defense, and God is the rock of our refuge. ' Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.
