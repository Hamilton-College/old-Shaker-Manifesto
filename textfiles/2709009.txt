Shakers, N. Y. August, 1897. The past month gave us a taste of tropical weather. One hundred in the shade! We were careful not to make any uncomplimentary remarks about 'Old Probabilities' for we might regret it when the blizzards of December were blowing; but we thought of the pleasure of Professor Andree's trip in an air-ship to the North pole or of Dr. Nansen's arctic explorations. But we will try and be philosophical and make the best of it whatever the variations of the temperature. Those grand and inspiring words of Gladstone in the Manifesto were like a benediction rebuking the narrow spirit of sectarianism that would contract the sphere of human thought making it less able to comprehend the universality of truth which is the true goal toward which life is advancing. We admire the character of the man and have his picture framed in oak guarding the doorway of our domicile. We think our little Manifesto is doing even better than the son of Erin's isle who said he had 'started with nothing and had held his own.' May blessings be with those who have the burden of its publication, and if interest could be quickened to the extent that would make it a semimonthly, its work in the missionary field would be strengthened.
