SUBDUE PASSION MARY WHITCHER Passions restrained, but not subdued, May yet o'errule the whole — Our common sense, our spirit life — The body and the soul. 'A word to the wise ' being sufficient, may be that our gentle hint, of the necessity of subduing the passions, may help some one. Our experience has proved that indifference to the curbing of the passions puts very far off the day of greatest victory. Our association witli the pure and good has not made us good and pure, unless we, like them, have ruled and subdued our passions. Let us work for the most desirable of harvest to the soul ; and we will joy in the reward of the wise, who, ruling his own spirit, can sing of triumph over death and the grave. Are we wise ? Then we will let no passions dethrone our reason. Are we the subjects of passion ? Where can be our reason, our conscience, our hope ?
