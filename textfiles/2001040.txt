THE GOOD SAMARITAN 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.'â€”Matt, xxv., 40. Canterbury, N. H. I will walk with you,when the shadows fall, When err ing steps ye would recall, When seemingly ye are by all Earthly friends forgotten. The Priest and Levite may pass by, And leave the wounded one to die; The good Samaritan coming nigh Brings mercy and forbearance.
