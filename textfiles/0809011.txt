DURABLE RICHES. Having completed three score and ten years the tenth of September I felt anxious to bless the Manifesto, its Editor, Publisher and every contributor, with a few lines of cheer; for I read every number and feel really benefited thereby.—Rhoda Blake. Look not in the earth for treasures that are hidden from 'the wise and prudent,' but strive to form by daily watchfulness and care a kingdom of uprightness within, that will make home lovely and life happy; give the feelings energy, with an increasing desire to do good; this strife is noble. Goodness elevates the mind, and gives us personally a lofty SHAKER THE SHAKER idea of true dignity. We must reap and garner with all the intelligence of our souls, the riches which will endure and furnish ourselves with excellent endowments that we may have these to bestow on the needy; and as it were, unseemingly shed beauty, sublimity and happiness through all the varied scenes of life ; for durable treasures will never fail while earthly riches will perish. I often reflect upon the vision of Judge Edmonds, where he saw the miser gathering and laying up riches by his side ; *'at length he turned to his piled up cherished treasure, and found that it was all gone, he threw himself in despair prostrate upon this useless emblem of his wealth, and howled wildly in the madness of his disappointed cupidity.' It was all left behind and nothing but a ferocious desire remained. While our hands are employed caring for the wants of the body, our hearts must be expanding in the free elasticity of spiritual elements ; and we must draw from the depths of the Infinite that inspiration which will lead us on to new glories, new manifestations of the durable riches, that are attainable and which it is our heavenly Father's pleasure to give mankind—those treasures of knowledge which will raise them to a state of exaltation, spiritually and intellectually, and give evidences of substantial truth that can never die.
