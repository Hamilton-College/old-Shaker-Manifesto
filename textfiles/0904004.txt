LOST-SAVED MARTHA J. ANDERSON Lost! lost ! in the by-way turns That meet in the downward road, When the soul the narrow highway spurns, Which upward leads to God. Lost! but a little slip at first, Then many a foot-fall down, 'Till the fair of earth with sin accursed, Miss virtue's shining crown. Lost! in the drunkard's shadowy path, First drawn by the sparkling bowl To enter the way of sin and wrath, That ruins body and soul. Lost! how the tempting gleams of gold Sets honesty aside, 'Till by degrees the heart grows bold In the stronghold of its pride. Lost! in the vain and fruitless chase For honor, and wealth, and fame, Where glory wrapped in selfhood base, Proved but an empty name. Lost! through the storm of passions wild Which led the feet astray. Unconsciously, through wrong beguiled, They passed on the downward way. Lost! for an awful dearth and blight Rests on the wayward heart, Who turned from a knowledge of truth and right And walks from good apart. Lost! there are stealthy, subtle foes Who bind their chains around, 'Till habits formed their power disclose, And the helpless soul is bound. Lost! to a sense of blushing shame With a conscience seared and scarred, Rises no holy incense flame, From out that vessel marred ? Lost! O ! shall we think for aye Are sealed their fate and doom ? That through the blackness gleams no day Their dark haunts to illume ? Saved! saved ! from the depths of woe And endless misery ; Saved, though fallen ever so low, Each human soul will be. Saved ! there are blessed angels sent From glorious spheres above ; Who cause the erring to repent Through the pleading voice of love. Saved! when the steps shall be retraced With a purpose to do right; Through sorrow alone is sin erased, Or the spirit robes made white. Saved ! for eternal justice grand, Rules all above, below Unchanged and true God's laws shall stand, ' We'll reap just what we sow.' Mount Lebanon, N. Y.
