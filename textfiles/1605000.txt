The Gospel Testimony of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee and James Whittaker. No. 2. No. 2. Published expressly for the several Communities of Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinn. This was the commencement of that great work which they had been waiting to see and which soon after filled the neighboring country with anxiety and alarm. Enquiries were made and people began to visit the Church from different places, particularly from New Lebanon. When they came to see Mother Ann and the Elders, they were filled with wonder and admiration at the gifts and operations which they were under, and the clear and pointed plainness of the testimony against all sin. The gifts of the holy spirit were evidently among the Believers, and these they manifested in their daily lives and conversation. During the season of religious devotion they were blessed with manifold gifts, each in its time and order. Some were in the making of exhortations, or shaking, singing, prophesying, or speaking as the spirit givefch utterance. The people asked Mother Ann and the Elders, why they maintained such a singular faith and manner of living. The Elders replied, 'We have been laboring for years in the work of regeneration, and have actually risen with Christ and travel with him in the resurrection.' People.�'If you have attained to that of God, which we have not, we should be glad to share with you, for Wa CONTENTS. want to find the best way to be saved from that which is wrong. ' Elders.�'If you are ever saved through Christ, it must be by walking as he walked, and if you have committed sins, you must confess them to those witnesses in whom Christ has taken up his abode.' People.�'We have had the power of God upon us and received light and conviction, and have felt great tribulation for our sins: after which we have felt great love and releasement, and we think we were converted and born oi God. Is not this the Christ?' Elders.�'The gifts and calling of God are given to souls in nature's darkness, not because they have repented, but they are intended to lead souls to repentance.' People.�'What is repentance?' Elders.�'To cease committing sin is the only repentance which God accepts, and this no one can do short of making an honest and faithful confession of all the sins he has committed in his whole life, to the chosen witnesses of God. ' People.�'It is God, alone, that can forgive sins ; where then is the necessity of confessing them to man?' Elders.�'God has established that order for all souls who have committed sin, that they must confess their sins before his chosen witnesses, as will be seen by the Mosaic law, and the case of Achan before Joshua. The baptism of John when the people came and confessed their sins and shoAved their deeds. All souls that commit sin are lost from God, and cannot know God. They that know God as he is, do not commit sin, for it is eternal life to knoAv God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent.' ' But those that commit sin are bound in death, and are not able to come to God, without help. When they come to Christ's witnesses and honestly confess their sins, they find a relation to those witnesses, that gives them a relation to Christ and in this sense, these witnesses become mediators between Christ and lost souls. ' People.�' Are you perfect? Do you live without sin?' Elders.�' The power of God revealed in this day, does enable souls to cease from sin, and Ave have received that power ; we have actually left off the committing of sin, that we may live in daily obedience to the will of God. ' People.�' Solomon ivas called a wise man, and he said, 'There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, aud sinneth not.'' Elders.�'Solomon Avas under the law of sin, and it is evident that he committed sin. He did not know Christ, for Christ had not then been revealed. Whatsoever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, but when Christ came, those that believed and obeyed him, ceased from sin. Those that are in Christ are not under the law of sin, because they do not commit sin ; therefore there is no laAv that can either justify or condemn them, but the law of Christ. Christ has delivered them from the law of sin, and given them the law of righteousness and made them able to Avalk in it. They that commit sin are always in danger of the judgment of God.' ' If we should be overcome and commit sin, our case Avould be deplorable, because we have tasted of the good word of God, and received of the powers ot' S8 the world to come : therefore if we should fall away it would be impossible for us to be renewed again to repeutanee.' First Interviews, of Different Individuals with Mother Ann and the Elders. The extraordinary intelligence which was circulated concerning this strange religion and the wonderful spirit that attended the subjects of it, drew many disceruing and inquiring minds to search into the truth of these things. Many inquiries were made, from time to time, by these individuals, during their interviews with Mother Ann and the Elders. Joseph Meacham and Calvin Ilarlow were among the first that visited the little Church for the purpose of becoming better informed in regard to the religious belief of the order. After many extended conversations, as well as critical inquiries on the several doctrinal points which made this people so marked in their lives, and so different from the other Christian denominations, these two visitors became convinced that the work was more in accordance with the gospel of Chri?t than any with which they had formerly been acquainted. The Elders, very kindly, gave plain and quite satisfactory answers to all the inquiries that were made. Among other subjects this was presented to Mother Ann, by Joseph Meacham. 'St. Paul says,'�'Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law. And if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.' 'But you not only speak, but seem to be an Elder in your church. How do you reconcile this with the Apostles doctrine ?' Mother Ann replied, 'The order of man in the natural creation is a figure of the order of God in the spiritual creation. As the order of nature requires the co-operation of the man and the woman, so when they stand in their proper place, the man is the first, and the woman the second in the government of the family. He is the father and she is the mother, and all the children must be subject to the parents. ' 'When the man has departed from the home, the right of government belongs to the woman, so is the family of Christ.' In this reply, Joseph and Calvin saw clearly that the new creation could not be perfect, in its order, without a father and a mother. As the natural cieation was the offspring of natural parents, so the spiritual creation must be the offspring of spiritual parents. Joseph having received from Mother Ann an established and well grounded faith, set out with his whole heart to obey the testimony. After the decease of Mother Ann and the Elders he was chosen as the senior Elder and soon after began the organization of the several churches or societies, that the people might enjoy the privileges of a life in a community and be better able to live in harmony with the gospel of our divine Teacher, Christ. Elder Joseph was unwearied and remarkably faithful in all th.3 duties that fell to his charge, and left nothing unfinished that was for the peace and prosperity of the sacred cause. (To BE CONTINUED.)
