Do not be troubled because you have no great virtues... Do not be troubled because you have no great virtues. God made a million spires of grass, where he made one tree. The earth is fringed and carpeted, not with forests, but grass. Only have enough of little virtues and common fidelities, and you need not mourn because you are neither a saint nor a hero.
