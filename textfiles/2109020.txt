Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Average of Weather at Mount Lebanon. July. Thermometer. Rain. 1890. 68.38 3%in. 1891. 60.83 4% in. Geo. M. W. Aug. 11, 1891. Looking over the monthly home notes, we find something in each so much like our unwritten ones, that it is very easy to say 'ditto' and let it pass. We too had an abundance of strawberries, and had they yielded according to the faithful care bestowed upon them, our twenty-three bushels would have been doubled; but either the dry weather or their close proximity to the salted asparagus bed, seemed to blight them. Cherries are so well graded in our locality, that in a fruitful year like the present, their season is from the middle of June until the first of August; and 'big boys, little boys, and middling sized boys' are faithful to gather them. The small boy and the cherry tree are agreeable companions in more ways than one. He can sway from the topmost branches to gather the luscious fruit without injury to himself or the tree. But no one speaks of the currants. Following closely as they do, in the umbra of the strawberry, their reputation, though not their worth, seems rather eclipsed. Our currant garden this year was a beauty. So neatly cultivated and such strings of pearls and rubies, from every branchlet in striking contrast to the verdant foliage. Apples, pears, x)lums and even our few peach trees are doing their best. This is the year 'we shall lose a thousand bushels of peaches for the want of trees.' Our apples are so carefully housed during the winter that there is seldom an apple vacancy the year round. The Roxbnry Russet of '90 docs not desert us until the early pippin is suitable to take its place in the apple pie. The three hundred windows of our brick dwelling- are being repainted by faithful home labor, which will save in many ways, we hope. The windows will be rescued from wear of time, and the money sometime paid to hired labor, will be doubled, since 'a penny saved is two pence clear.' Thus we are anxiously looking forward for means to repair the drainage of our Dwelling before another winter, and thus save the tax sometimes imposed by the Board of Health, as well as doctor bills. Since the irresponsible monetary monocracy adopted by Believers has devastated so much of the consecrated wealt i of our Communities, it comes very hard on those who, though on the same plan, are wise and skillful enough to be successful. We too have enjoyed the pleasant visits to our home. Br. Watson Andrews, the dear Sisters from Enfield, N. H.; Sister Anna Case from Watervliet; and are now made happy by the brief return of Elder Andrew Barrett to his former home. A. J. C. Center Family. Aug. 9, 1891. Deab Editob:ï¿½We have had the satisfaction of having had visitors here from four of our sister Societies who were welcome, thrice welcome to our home and hearts. It does us good to see the Brethren and Sisters from various branches of our communal interest, having a like faith, and actuated by motives springing from a good heart and true. Elder Andrew D. Barrett of Harvard is one of the number, a former inmate of this home, which was made dear to him through consecration. He is an earnest, warm-hearted, whole-souled man. We love him for his work's sake and glad to have him come among us for rest and recuperation. He has well earned it by devotion of body and soul to the well-being of the household of faith. We have finished marketing cherries and have commenced on the pears, which promises to be a good crop. Hay crop secured some two weeks or more since, expect to finish harvesting^ oats this week. Dear Elder Henry, if you should journey so far west as this place, we would be glad to give you hospitable welcome. The latch string hangs out and you have only to grasp it to have the door swing wide open. T. E. North. K'amily.

We put the hay-loader in operation and it did work splendidly, rolling up a load of hay in six or twelve minutes. It takes two good men on the wagon and a careful hand to drive the team. The reaper and binder, after about live days' experimenting and adjusting, was made to work very satisfactorily. Our rye was very heavy and crinkled badly; so that it was impossible for the machine to separate each bundle and a man had to follow behind and pull them apart; but in the straight grain, wheat and oats, it was just music set to harmony, to witness the operation; on quite a side hill and over some very rough places it kept in time, though occasionally a rest was introduced which only gave the more volume to the music. Have cut some twenty-three acres of rye, several acres of wheat and twentyfive acres of oats; have nearly twenty acres more to cut of oats and seventy-five of grass; hope to be done by the first of Sept. On the 29th. of July, the trustee of School District No. 12, (by mistake) called the annual school meeting. It was attended by a selected company who went through the legal forms, electing officers, etc. and not till near the close did we discover that our meeting was premature. We adjourned to the last Tuesday in August. Although the meeting was a legal mistake, it did good, and it is hoped, awakened an interest in school matters that will be felt when we meet again. The subject of education is one that all who take an interest in the rising generation, should study and exercise their minds upon; it is of great importance. The whole every-day life in our Community is industrial education, and it is firstrate; but industrial education, practiced mechanically, is drudgery in its lowest sense, even when exercised in that which is genial; while that which would usually be termed menial, if mind and brain are brought to bear upon it, becomes interesting and elevating. No labor, however disagreeable, if its end is use, is in any way dishonorable. But when the necessity of the labor is scientifically understood, the disagreeable is largely diminished. Our district, or home schools, should be so conducted that they will instill into the minds of the pupils the light of understanding, and made so interesting that the scholars will drink in by absorption. What a child understands it will remember, what is learned mechanically is soon foi'gotten. Last Sabbath, on account of the weather, our Society meeting was omitted. Elder Andrew Barrett from Harvard is making us a visit; he is all alone, which in olden times was thought not to be good; however that may be, I think it is better now, when Brethren visit, to have some Sisters along. We learned through Elder Andrew that some time ago, while Elder John Whiteley, with a company of Sisters were on their way from Shirley to Harvard, one of the horses fell; as he fell the harness broke, which let the wagon on the horse. The horse got up instantly while the wagon was upon him, and turned it over with all its occupants. A single horse was following and was so close to the team ahead that when the horse fell, stopping the wagon, the single horse ran into the wagon, breaking both thills. Fortunately no one was seriously hurt; they fixed up as best they could and returned home. We are called to learn by everything that passes before us; and two important lessons are here given. First, that when we take company riding the harness should be strong enough to sustain the horse, even though he fall: Second, that one team in following another, should keep at a respectful distance. On the 21st. of July we had a very pleasant visit with Br. Watson Andrews of North Union, Ohio. He was a very interesting visitor; but that interest would have increased many fold, if he had brought some Sisters along. I hope the Brethren will not do so any more. If business is the special object, there is some excuse; but when visiting is the business, there is no visible excuse. The August Manifesto came laden with treasures from the good editor's heart. In our 'Home Notes' what a lot of thought we gave to what we had to eat. Not however, for the gratification of appetite but for the honor and glory of God. Blessed be the Manifesto and all who contribute thereto. D. O.
