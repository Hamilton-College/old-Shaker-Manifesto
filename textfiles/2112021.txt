NOTES ABOUT HOME. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Average of Weather at Mount Lebanon. October. Thermometer. Bain. 1890. 50. 7.56 in. 1891. 47.41 2.22 in. Geo. M. W. Nov. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry :�If with the dial-plate we could say, 'I take no heed of time Save when the sun is shining,' we could impress upon each moment as it passed some interesting item; for surely so sunny an Autumn is -unprecedented in our history. Were the poet Hood to materialize in our locality, we think his negative description of November would be changed to the affirmative. Fourteen consecutive, clear, crisp, cloudless days, which really would be delightful, were it not that we think with a shudder�even on our hillside�of our almost dry springs, ponds, reservoirs and cisterns, and fearing a water famine, we anxiously watch for, and welcome the clouds. Such is life! But less sunny is our inner home. The rather sudden failure of our loved Eldress Ann, has gathered the nimbus clouds about us. Now, that she is released from public life and service, we had hoped, that as of yore, her sweet spirit would linger for a while in happy old age, with her own home friends. And it may be so yet; but now she is seemingly looking from life's west windows at a setting sun. To supply the vacancy left by her removal, we of the Church lose in Eldress Augusta, a valued friend, a firm pillar, and one as true as the needle to the Pole; and while1 others step to the front, we rejoice that in true worth we are still self-supporting. May it ever be thus, which will be, if each member of our home, feels as did Ruth of old that we have one God and one people, with interest undivided. Just at present we have with us from our sister Society at Watervliet, Sisters, Samantha Bowie and Ella Benedict. When the time shall come that we have more reunion, of our loved, our Community friends, our views will be broader, our heart-love stronger and our interest and life-work more to one purpose. A. J. C. Center Family. Nov. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�Our Home Notes are rather concise at this time. Am glad to report that fall work is pretty nearly finished so far as gathering in and housing the crops is concerned. Some plowing to be done and some necessary repairs of fences around home. We have added quite a number of sheep and cattle to our stock which we hope will prove profitable to the family. Health of our people quite good. Tour Brother, T. D. R. Sorrtli Family. Nov. 1891. The harvest time has come and gone leaving many grateful hearts and pleasant remembrances of the full reward of their earnest labors of fruits and vegetables. We can have no cause to complain. We have stored in the cellar over two hundred bvxshels of apples; seven hundred bu. were made into cider and we dried three and one. half barrels. Of black and blue huckleberries we gathered, preserved and canned one hundred and fifty gallons. One hundred and fifty gallons of tomatoes were put into stone jugs while there were preserved and pickled three gallons of each. Of potatoes three hundred bushels are placed in the cellar for winter use, while seven hundred bushels were sold. There were eight acres of corn which yielded a rich supply, enabling us to dry between thirty-five to forty barrels, the kiln being finished, afforded us an opportunity of using it which proved satisfactory. We have gathered for the winter three hundred hubbard squashes for home use. There is also an abundant supply of turnips, carrots and onions of which sixty bu. were sold. I think we have every reason to be thankful. A. W. Nov. 1891. so we are to round the last notes for 1891. But not till after Thanksgiving and Christmas, will the vibration cease. And after these have died away we shall long hear the echo. Thanksgiving is a good time, to recall the many blessings it has been ours to enjoy, and to bow our hearts in practical appreciation and gratitude. A good time to 'gather up the fragments that nothing be lost' Attention to little things is what assures our prosperity. Christmas time seems a very appropriate season to look back over the passing year and make note of all mistakes and blunders, in thought, word and deed; with an eye on the future. A good time to renew and strengthen all our good resolutions, and to form new ones. We have had most beautiful weather the past few week with some very sharp freezing. Our streams and springs are very low, and unless we get an abundance of rain before winter sets in we shall have considerable inconvenience. There is no time we so fully appreciate the value of water as when it is scarce. It is about the same with other good things. Our measure the past season has been filled to overflowing; and it would seem as though there was nothing good enough. The first Believers would say ' 'thankfulness made easy the way of God: and the unthankful were unholy.' With such a superabundance of temporal there is some danger of a wasteful manner being entertained; which in no wTise adds to out comfort or gospel travail. We have had a beautiful rain to-day for which we render grateful thanks. D. O.
