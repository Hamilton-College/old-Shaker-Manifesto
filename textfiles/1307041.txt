DR. JOHNSON'S PRAYER [Contributed by Anna Ervin.] DR. JOHNSON'S PRAYER. O Lord, my maker and protector, who hast graciously sent me into this world to work out my salvation; enable me to drive from me all such unquiet and perplexing thoughts as may mislead or binder me in the practices of those duties which Thou hast required. When I behold the works of thy hands, give me grace always to remember that thy ways are not my ways, nor thy thoughts, my thoughts. And while it shall please thee to continue me in this world, where much is to be done, and little to be known, teach me by thy holy spirit to withdraw my mind from unprofitable and dangerous inquiries ; from difficulties vainly curious, and doubts impossible to be solved. Let me rejoice in the light thou hast imparted: let me serve thee with active zeal and humble confidence; and wait with patient expectation for the time in which the soul which thou receivest shall be satisfied with knowledge. Grant this, O Lord, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.
