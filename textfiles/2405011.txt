FAITH. 'Let us holdfast the prof ession of our faith without wavering.'ï¿½Heb. x., 23. Enfield, N. H. Precious faith which hath sustained me 'Mid the changing scenes of life, Thro' thy ministry, I waken to a noble, Spirit strife, To a noble, Spirit strife. By this blessed light still guided, I shall sing the victor's song, Triumph with the faithful number Who the world have overcome,Who the world have overcome.
