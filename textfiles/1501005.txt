SCATTER THE GERMS OF THE BEAUTIFUL Scattek the germs of the beautiful! By the way-side let them fall, That the rose may spring by the cottage gate, And the vine on the garden wall. Cover the rough and the rude of earth. With a veil of leaves and flow'rs, And mark with the opening bud and cup, The march of Summer hours. Scatter the germs of the beautiful! In the holy shrine of home, Let the pure and fair, and the graceful there. In the loveliest luster come. Leave not a trace of deformity In the temple of the heart, But gather about its altar the gems Of nature and of art. Scatter the germs of the beautiful! In the depths of the human soul, They shall bud and blossom, and bear the fruit While the endiess ages roll. Plant with the flowers of charity, The portals of the tomb, And the fair and the pure about thy path, In the paradise shall bloom. Amos M. Kellogg
