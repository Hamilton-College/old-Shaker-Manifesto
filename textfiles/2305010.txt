Dearly Beloved Elder Henry... Shirley, Mass., April 3, 1893. Dearly Beloveb Elder Henry :ï¿½We do not forget you, or the labor of love in which you are engaged; but as we know that labor rightly directed is worship, that the promise to the faithful, 'As thy day is, so shall thy strength be;' and further, that the God we love and worship, is a just rewarder of each worker, according to his works, we can surely hope and trust for you and ourselves, and all who love and serve Him, according to their best knowledge and understanding, a blessing, a treasure that will more than compensate. In the great store-house of God's love, there is enough for all. None need grudge another; but according to the measure they have earned and received, so will their love be expansive, and the more earnest their desire that others should share with them. So in this sense and feeling we would try to be encouraged, and to encourage all to toil on to the end. On the 5th inst. the writer will have filled the seventy-fourth year of his probation in time; and in view of the departure of so many worthies who have been THE MANIFESTO. heroes in the strife, feels that there should be no slacking down, but a renewed energy and zeal to do battle for the truth and the pure way of God. We have been blessed by a short visit from our true-hearted friend, Elder George Wilcox, from Enfield, Conn., who gave us a rather thrilling description of his experience in going to and attending the funeral of beloved Elder F. W. Evans, who, it seems, departed without sickness or pain, the physical part worn out, and simply standing still like a clock run down; but the spirit alive and wide awake and passing on to wider spheres of usefulness. Thus may it be with all who are left. Joined in the bonds of pure love here, we can not be severed from those who have gone before, for in Christ 'There is no death,' except to worldly elements and the conditions they produce and foster. From all of which we pray, 'Good Lord, deliver us.' Spring-time is at hand. The wood yards are being cleared up, and active preparations being made for spring work generally. Small patches of snow still left. Too early to tell what the effect of the extreme cold in January, before the snows came, may have had on winter grains, of which we sowed considerable for a New England farm. We try hard to keep our union with each other and all that is good. Our town, at last town meeting, broke her clean record, and voted for license. We hope sincerely we may be preserved from the evil effects which ordinarily follow such action, and trust that one year's trial may be enough to satisfy a majority, at least, that weak humanity needs no such inducements to go the downward way. Shirley is a lovely town, in location and picturesqueness, and has some good, earnest men. The influx of a foreign element to help her growing manufactures, is a threatening danger to her record of a peaceful past. But as all things work together for good; to the good, we hope good may come out of even this. With kindest wishes from your Shirley readers and friends. Yours truly, John Whiteley.
