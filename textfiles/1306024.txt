Br. Albert, by urgent request from several of the societies... [From Elder Giles B. Avery.] Br. Albert, by urgent request from several of the societies has just got out a new edition of Plain Talks. He offers them for $4.00 per 100 copies. It seems, to us, that it is one of the very best pamphlets now out, for circulation of our testimony, and that for the interests of that precious, glorious Causeâ€”The Institution and establishment of the kingdom of Heaven upon Earth. Every society and family of Believers ought to have on hand a few hundred copies for circulation. The cost is trifling, and the good that we pray may be effected, great. Address, Geo. Albert Lomas, Shakers, Albany Co., N. Y.
