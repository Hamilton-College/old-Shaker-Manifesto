is Leptothrix vuccalis, appears under the microscope as a gray, finely-granular mass, with delicate and stiff filaments erected above the surface. It attains the greatest growth in the interstices of the teeth. An examination of the teeth of forty persons of different professions and habits of living, showed that on almost all of them there were vegetable fungi and animal parasites. In proportion to the want of cleanliness were the parasites. The ' moral ' of all this is that if we would preserve our teeth we must keep them very clean. The ordinary means of cleaning them will not do, as the parasites do not appear to be unfavorably affected by common or uncommon dentifrices. 'We must use soap,' says a writer on this subject, 'as an ingredient in our dentifrices, or in addition to them. It is not necessary to employ any of the so-called ' dental soaps.' We have found by experience that the imported white castile soap, which is probably the purest soap made in the world,—a fact worth remembering in other connections,—is quite tasteless, or at least has no unpleasant taste. Rub the wet tooth-brush over a piece of this soap before dipping it into the dentifrice you use, and you have the most perfect combination for thorough cleansing of the teeth and destroying the obnoxious fungus. We assume, of course, that the dentifrice itself is not one that injures the teeth, as many of those in common use do.'
