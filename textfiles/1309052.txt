REFLECTION. MARY WHITCHER. Life is much as we would make it, Turning labor into joy, And again as we would take it, More to please than to annoy. Friends are foes, when out of humor With ourselves and all around; But the dullest, darkest weather Has a brightness to be found. Let us count the gems of beauty, Bind the graces of the truth To the laurels of our duty, These the evergreens of earth. Canterbury, N. H.
