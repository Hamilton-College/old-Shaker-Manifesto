KIND WORDS. All who are interested in the prosperity of The Manifesto will be pleased to read what the Editor of 'The World's Advance Thought,' of September has so kindly said of it. 'The Manifesto' the organ of those truly spiritual peple, familiarly known as the Shakers, is always filled with matter for the benefit of humanity. It could not be otherwise, coming as it does from those who manifest only the good every day of their lives.' note goes out with kind thanks to Br. Henry Greene, from whom we have just received a thought of remembrance and a beautifully illustrated book of the Maplewood Hotel, at the White Mountains.
