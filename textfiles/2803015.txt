Enfield, N. H. Feb. 1898. From the heart of the Christian, swells out the anthems of gratitude; each stanza noted with good deeds to be done for the good of humanity. As a nation we can render tributes of praise to the noble workers in the field of life, for sacrifice given to better human conditions. Thankful that no blotch of cruelty smears our republic life, like that which defiles the Turkish nation, whose fanatical, blood-thirsty spirit, dealt death and misery to thousands of helpless Armenians and Greeks. Thankful that no tyrannical force has been spent upon subjects like unto that which the cruel Spanish executed upon our Cuban neighbors ; also thankful that no spirit of covetousness like the greedy European Powers has moved us to grasp the Hawaiian Islands. Thankful that at the head of the grandest cause of fellow helpfulness to souls struggling in the whirlpool of intemperance, stands a pure, intelligent and active woman, Frances Willard, of whom a nation may well be proud. Thankful that at the head of our government, is one we can look upon with respect, and trust his generalship in matters pertaining to America and her institution's welfare. Thankful that no famine like unto that which has smitten beautiful India, has spread a covering of woe upon our country, and very thankful for the encouraging signs that come from every field of Christian labor, that the past year excels any previous one in work done in the name of Christ and Christian brotherhood. Thankful for love and good wishes brought by our revered Br. John Cumings: from our Enfield, Conn, kindred at whose home he spent a few days. We extend our thanks and grateful feelings for kindness extended to him. An important and lengthy work, of painting the one hundred and eighty-twa windows of our Dwelling House, is being done by Sisters, Ann Cumings, Marinda Keniston and the writer. George II. Baxter.
