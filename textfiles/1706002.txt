Dear children: Hold fast that which is good... Enfield, Conn. 1887. Deak Children :- -' Hold fast that which is good ' To be good is to be happy. Do not, after making mistakes, give up striving to do right. Begin every morning and see how much better you can do each day. If you stop striving for one moment, you do not stand still, you fall back. It is the patient, constant toilers that gain and keep the prize. ' Never despair, ' is an excellent and useful maxim. Grow despondent never, for your 'star of hope' shines ever. If you fail, try again. u Those who win are those who try. ' 'Little by little the wrong gives way, little by little the right has sway. ' Don't stop to be discouraged when trials come. They show what you are worth. All truly noble characters have been tried. Would you shine with heavenly brightness in God's kingdom? Then ' think it not strange concerning the liery trial that is to try you, but rejoice that you are counted worthy to suffer.' None are made pure without the trial. First the trial, then the blessing. You wonder why there must be so many trials. They are all necessary for your spiritual growth. No portion of them could be spared. For the gold to appear, the dross must be consumed. Remembering the Savior's trials, sufferings, charity, and pity, nothing right should be too hard for you to bear, and wrong should be borne with meekness and patience, even as He bore it. He sends strength for every trial, and gives precious comfort and help. Look to Him for your sustaining and your guidance. His example should be your standard. His teachings should lead you from the wrong ever into the right. Your Brother, Daniel Orcutt.
