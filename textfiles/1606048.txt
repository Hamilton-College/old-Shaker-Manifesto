Deaths. Rachel Sampson A. D. Roxanna Dutton Rachel Sampson, Apr. 22. 188G, at First Family, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. Born Jan. 20,. 1804 in Marshfleld, Mass. She came among the Believers, April 1814. I think our sister is known among us as a true Christian, in the highest sense of the term. She was remarkably patient, kind, forgiving, industrious and fully consecrated to our cause. The loss of such is deeply felt although age may blanch the locks, and wrinkle the placid brow. A. I&gt;. Roxanna Dutton, Apr. 27, 1886, at Church Canterbury, N. H. Age 03 yrs. and 5 days.
