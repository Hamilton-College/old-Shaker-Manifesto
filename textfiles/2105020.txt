Harvard, Mass. I want to send my heart-felt thanks for the Autobiography of Elder Giles B. A very. ]STo doubt the compilation of it through your limited means has caused you much arduous toil and labor. The good that will be derived from reading it will not only be seen within our household, but it will be a living missionary to many who are looking into a knowledge of these principles. All who have known Elder Giles have seen that he has made the principles of Shakerism a perfect success in his life. And now as he has been called up higher, may his pure mantle rest on his successor, Elder Joseph Holden. For more than thirty years I have been closely associated with him in the duties of life and have always found him a stalwart for the principles of our blessed Mother's gospel and just the one to receive the blessing, strength and success of a dear brother. What have we to fear if God be on our side? Don't let us leave our alabaster boxes to be broken over our dear ones after they are laid in the coffin. Let us break some of them now and let the perfume fill the air, and make glad the hearts of those who are carrying along Zion's burdens. We are often exhorted to make our home attractive, to throw out sunshine and cheer in every department of life. If the kingdom of heaven is within us why not let some of it out and share together as Brothers and Sisters. They who tread life's pathway ever bearing on their faces an expression of cheerfulness, are radiant ministers of good to mankind. They scatter sunshine on all they meet, depression and gloom fade away in their presence. On Thursday the 2nd we had one more heavy fall of snow, so we resorted to our sleighs for traveling. A blizzard visited us in the evening and broke down one of our large fir trees and tore down six telephone poles between our place and Ayer. Health of Society quite good, no one confined to the sick-room, so the time is given to the physicians to play. A. D. B.
