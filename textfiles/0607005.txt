THE STORMY SEA E. A. SEDGWICK When troubles and rough feelings come upon our minds making them like the restless ocean, let Christ arise within us, and ' rebuke the wind and wave,' bringing a peaceful calm. Let reason have its rule ; then we will sail smoothly on the waters of life, unruffled by the tempests of passion. Let us try to live above trouble, counting ourselves the master and not the servant. If the principles of Christ are within us no trouble can sink our souls. West Pittsjield, Mass.
