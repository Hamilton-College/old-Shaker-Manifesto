THE DECAY OF SERIOUSNESS [Elder Henry;�The selection of the following article was made by our departed Sister, Martha Crooker. It so compares with the value of life to her, that we would re-read it often in her memory, giving broader circulation that many thoughtless minds may be benefited.�M.] One of the depressing signs of the times is the general decay of seriousness, which shows itself in many ways�in conversation, in literature, and in the occupations of life. How hard it is to engage anybody in a sober and earnest conversation! People like to talk well enough, and will talk without ceasing on the most trilling subjects. They are ready to gossip, to entertain each other with the small talk of society, but it is rare in comparison that we sit down with one who seems to delight in conversation of a higher kind. The mass of people do not even think seriously. They have no convictions, and do not care to have any, even while life is so solemn and earnest, and so swiftly passing away. They do not care to think deeply about anything outside of their special lines of business. They avoid the trouble of a real intellectual grapple with any of the great problems of life. They do not want to be burdened with opinions which are only formed as the result of thought, and which may compel them to some positive action or to sacrifice. They would get their views as they get their dinners, where they can be had the easiest, and take their creeds as they buy their clothes, 'ready made,' and as easy to put off as to put on. In politics they go with a party; in religion with a sect; to which they give up their own independent thinking, content to have it done for them. New York Evangelist.
