HISTORY OF SOUTH UNION, KY. No. 4. ON the 25th of Sept. 1811, an order of Ministry was appointed for the Society at South Union. Those forming the order at this date were Elder Benjamin S. Youngs, Br. Joseph Allen, Eldress Molly Goodrich, Sr. Mercy Picket. They were very kindly received and made welcome by the Believers who had anxiously waited for their arrival. On the 17th of October, 1811, the Society was organized and four families were arranged in the order of Believers, with Elders, Trustees, and Family Deacons. A Covenant corresponding to the one at New Lebanon was signed on the 4th of July by thirty Brethren. [We find no record of the signing of the Covenant by the Sisters, but this was, without doubt, attended to in due time. Ed.] The establishing of the Society in the order of Believers was attended with great anxiety, that all who had accepted the faith of the cross might be saved, and become an honor to the gospel work. With the spiritual order moved also the duties of the temporal interest, and while many were engaged in cultivating the land, and in the raising of stock, others must do the work of the blacksmith, the carpenter, the mason, and the mill-wright. All must be industrious to build up a home for the accommodation and the protection of so large a family. 26 THE MANIFESTO. Additional anxieties began to present themselves before the little Society, in the rumors of war that were being discussed more or less publicly, and which were fully realized on the 18th of June, 1812, when the United States declared war against Great Britain. Several of the Brethren were drafted, but preferred to hire some other person to do the fighting, rather than to shoulder the musket. In 1814 the Society at South Union contained some three hundred souls, and the Center family was able to build a large, beautiful, brick dwelling, which afforded ample accommodations for all at that place. The bricks were molded and burnt by the Brethren and were of a very nice quality. We find in a letter written by Joseph Allen in 1812, who was in the order of Ministry, some very interesting items. He says: 'South Union is thirtysix degrees and forty minutes north latitude and fifteen miles from the line which divides the state of Kentucky on the north, and the state of Tennessee on the south. It is two hundred and seventy-five miles southwest from Union Village, and one hundred afrd thirty miles southwest from Pleasant Hill. 'During three winters the earth at this place was never covered with snow. The ground is scarcely ever frozen. We begin to plow in February and to sow our oats and flax. So soon as this is done we begin to plant our corn, which continues from the first of April to the last of June, and frequently corn is planted in June, where flax was sowed in February, and if you should see this great field of corn, you would think it a very curious sight; one part of it would be higher than your head, another part as high as your knees, another six inches high and the last just coming from the earth; and yet it will all get ripe before the season closes. We usually plant two hundred or more acres.' 'The country is very good for some things, as corn, wheat, oats, hemp, tobacco, indigo and cotton, but we lack timber of all kinds and have but little grass. The soil is too dry for tame grass, but we have a wild grass which answers a good purpose in the forepart of the season. Early peas and potatoes are harvested in May.' 'We have planted fourteen hundred apple trees, have finished a brick dwelling 50x30 ft. and two stories high; also a stone building 45x34 ft. and are now making a tan yard. Have also laid the foundation for a meeting-house.' This year, 1812, marks a very singular visitation of sickness, which was designated as the 'Cold Plague.' It made its appearance in South Union on the 25th of March, when two persons were attacked. It was not confined to the Shaker Village, but was more or less prevalent through that section of the country. Between the months of March and June about one hundred and ten persons were on the sick list, which resulted in thirteen deaths. On the 30th of Sept. 1815, there was another visitation of the 'Cold Plague,' and fifty persons were more or less afflicted. It made a sad change THE MANIFESTO. 27 in the order of our business engagements. No sound of the hammer was heard on the anvil, no cloth was placed on the bars, and a few persons, only, were left at the brick yard to attend to that business. The harps were, indeed, hung upon the willows, and sickness was in every house. The Society was not only visited with sickness and made to endure many privations and much burden, but along comes an ungrateful horse thief ; a man who had left the family a few months before this date, where he had shared all the blessings of the home in common with others. Ke now returns in the night and steals one of our best horses. Two men were put on his track and after chasing him for two hundred and fifty miles, they secured both, the thief and the horse. A trial follows and a term in the state prison is the result. In 1824 another horse thief makes his visit at South Union and secures three horses. Five Brethren went in pursuit and overtook the thief in the state of Indiana, at a distance of one hundred and sixty miles. Taken entirely by surprise he gave himself up without the least resistance and returned with the Brethren to Russellville where he was tried and sentenced to the penitentiary. The recovered horses were much injured by their severe journey. A singular incident occurred from the bite of a spider. The poison was so active that in a short time the patient's life was in great danger. Quite a variety of remedies were administered and two weeks were consumed before health was restored. The gospel of Jesus the Christ which was to make both soul and body free, made South Union the home of both master and slave, and changed their relations toward each other quite essentially. Those who accepted the faith of the Believers, gave freedom to their slaves and permitted them to find a home as best they could. A negro, while held as a slave, would instantly take off his hat on the approach of his master, but would surprisingly lose all this so soon as he obtained his freedom. One negro on being asked by a former master to saddle his horse, made this quick reply,ï¿½'No, sab, tank God the time am come for ebery man to wait on heself.' Several of these colored people, either slaves or free blacks, were admitted into the family of the Believers. As one of the slave-holders had arranged to return to his former home, his four slaves were anxious to remain with the Believers, and the Brethren paid him eight hundred dollars for them. After the Brethren had finished the mill, which was begun the 23rd of July, 1812, they must have some millstones. To obtain these, five Brethren were sent to the quarry and after working four weeks, had prepared two pair of stones, one being 3 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and the other 4 ft. 1 in. in diameter. The two pair cost two hundred dollars. It required three Breth- 28 THE MANIFESTO. ren with two wagons and thirteen horses, eleven days to haul them from the quarry to the mill at South Union. At the time of gathering the corn we have a 'husking' as is the custom in most of the slave states. The corn is thrown into a long ridge and on a designated evening, all turn out to have a pleasant time. Two captains are chosen, and they alternately choose from the company till all are taken. The next object is to see which party will finish its husking first. Twice during the evening the party is treated to some wine, or something stronger, and they not unfrt quently work till ten o'clock. After the husking is closed a supper of roast pig with bread and coffee is served. At the close of this midnight meal all return to their several home s. The following was taken from the Bowling Green Gazette of Sept. 1835. 'Since our last, the Asiatic Cholera has raged with much less violence in Russellville, but it is probable this may be owing in pait to the fact that but few of her citizens have continued to remain in town. 'The disease was presented in its most frightful form, its ravages were almost unprecedented in its whole history, hence it is not a matter of astonishment that a general panic and consternation should have taken possession of her citizens, and this, no doubt, greatly added to its horrors and the number of its victims. 'At present we are advised that the citizens are returning to Russellville and resuming their usual business. Out of a population of four thousand, sixty whites and forty-three blacks were taken out of time! One fortieth of the whole population. The like is nowhere else on record of the frightful ravages of this fell destroyer.' 'During this panic, and especially the latter part of July and August, South Union has been greatly crowded upon, and the Trustees' Office has been filled to its utmost capacity by the frightened refugees from the vicinity of Russellville, seeking shelter and protection.' For the space of three or four weeks there were from twenty to thirty persons to cook for, daily. We could not turn them away, although some were already marked with the disease, and others were in a fair way to take it. The greatest burden was the attention that had to be rendered night and day, in the administering of medicines and food. Three deaths occurred among this class at our Village.' One young man, Mark McGraff, arrived here on the 29th of July. He was quite exhausted by the constant care that he had given to others. In the evening of the next day, fifteen hours from the time he arrived, he was a corpse. All possible attention was given to him, but all of no avail, as he continued to fail from the attack until he expired. He was kindly and carefully laid away in our cemetery. During the time of this sad affliction our Brethren carried a liberal supply of provisions to the poor people of Russellville. (To be continued.)
