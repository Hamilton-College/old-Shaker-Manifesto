THE TIME IS SHORT The time is short; the more the reason,then, For filling it as full as it can hold With thrills of beauty, yearnings for the truth, And joys of love and labor manifold. Then should it chance, as we would fain believe, Life's glory waits us in some other sphere, Its first great joy shall be we did not miss God's meaning in the glory that is here.
