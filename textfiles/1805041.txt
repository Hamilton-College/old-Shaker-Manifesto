WHEN I AM GONE. Helen M. Winslow. When I am gone, Dear friends will cluster round my silent form And say, ' How good she was! How noble, true, How quick to sympathize with others, too, And strong to battle life's severest storm!' My faults�so many!�will be all forgot: My temper�sometimes hasty�then will not Remembered be; for when our friends Lie dead, their goodness far transcends Their faults. O, friends remember this; Daily that tender sympathy I need Which when my deafened senses cannot heed; So give me now the lore I shall not miss When I am gone. Selected.
