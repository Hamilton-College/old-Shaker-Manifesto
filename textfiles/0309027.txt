HOME 0 HOME, blest home, where friends sincere, Life's weary pathway bless and cheer ! Where all harmoniously combine, In purity and love divine. Naught can compare with such a home, In palace fair, or splendid dome! Here true contentment fills the heart, And holy joy to each impart. Though they renounce all carnal ties, And worldly pleasures sacrifice, They find that tranquil peace of mind Which is to heaven-born souls assign'd. They seek no laurels of renown, No earthly coronet or crown ; But, in the heavenly spheres above, They're clothed with innocence and love. 1 love this quiet, peaceful home, Nor do I ever wish to roam, To seek for bliss in worldly gain, Or glittering honors to obtain. Here true confiding friends abide, Whose love no sorrows can divide : O give to me while here I plod, A Shaker home â€” a Home in God. Elizabeth Sears, Mt. Lebanon
