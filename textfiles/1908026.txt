Over Fifty Years' Experience .ï¿½Elder F.W.Evans, Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., writes: 'I am pleased to learn of the existence of such a society in the city where Wm. Penn established the first peace society. For over fifty years I have lived, whether at home or abroad a strict abstainer from food obtained by taking life. Am now 80 years of age.' F. H. and Garden.
