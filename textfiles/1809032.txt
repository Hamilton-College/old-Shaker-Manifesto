THE REVISED NEW TESTAMENT. After the immense labor and profound scholarship brought to the test, it was expected that the revised New Testament would take the place of the old, and become the standard authority. It was presumable that the most ardent believer well knew that there were errors in the King James' version, and would gladly have such errors eliminated. Such presumption has not been warranted by the facts, lleally, if there are errors, the believer does not wish to admit that there are. He prefers, like a young ostrich, to hide his head in the sand, and not be blinded by the light. In that condition he refuses to believe that there is any other light than that which filters through the sand which covers his closed eyelids. Those who expected so much from the new version did not take into consideration that the value of the Bible depended on its infallibility, and after many generations had received every word and letter as divine authority, and held that eternal salvation depended on belief in every text. Now to have that belief shaken by a new translation, by which passages considered of vital import are changed or omitted, is like the destruction of the Bible itself. If the old is not correct, what assurance have we that the new is more perfect scholarship? Was not the old surrounded by a halo of scholarship at its birth? If it depends on scholarship, and scholarship improves, how soon before still another new version will be required? True, in a certain way the new version has been approved by the Unitarians, because a certain strong passage favorable to Trinitarianism was omitted; by the liberal-minded ministers, because 'hell' is euphonized into 'hades,' and thus the repugnant doctrines of hellfire and eternal punishment cast overboard. Henry Ward Beecher pronounced it 'a first rate affair,' and many other advanced thinkers in the ranks of Orthodoxy agree with him. But Talmadge said ' 'it was already dead' before it was well published, and Spurgeon thinks the old the best, and nowhere, not in a church in all this country has the new taken the place of the old. The version is dropped deadï¿½it is not wanted. The Bible as it is, is sufficient, and to admit a better version is to overthrow its authority, and shake the old faith to its foundation. But the destructive work is done and casting aside the revision will not make the water flow back to its source. The whole world now knows that a great number of eminent scholars regard the translation of the Bible, which has been for centuries believed perfect to the letter, as very imperfect, as misleading, and removed texts which have been the rcot of dogmas held of vital import. Whatever the final conclusion of the laity, they know that there is disagreement among the doctors, and infallible authority admits of no disagreement. The support of the doctrines of hell and the trinity are taken away, and the worship of the Bible as a holy, inspired and infallible book, cannot long be maintained. Instead of blind worship, there will come rational study in parallel line with the literature of other races of mankind. in R. P. J. Hudson Tuttle
