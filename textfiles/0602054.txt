SEASON OF DEVOTION Jas. G. Russell. Enfield, N. H. Blessed season of devotion, When the saints in love do meet, Boundless as the waves of ocean, Plows the spirit pure and sweet. Zion's children raise your voices, Freedom's glorious strain prolong, While the heavenly host rejoices, Echoing back the conqueror's song. Angels from the realms of glory, Join our ranks in tuneful praise, Bringing blessings pure and holy From the heavenly Throne of Grace. Saints in darkness, bound no longer, Leave the shades of endless night, Never more in sin to wander, Join the chorus with delight. Bless the day, the happy hour, When tl*e gospel trump was heard, Bringing forth that light and power, That would reach a dying World. Sin-sick souls the call obeying, Find deliverance from the fall; While the faithless, still delaying, Lose their precious day and call. Shout again with deep emotion, Let the joyful accents roll, Blessed season of devotion, How refreshing to the soul. Heavenly guardians, now before us, Let your blessing crown the scene ; While we make sweet praise our chorus, And salvation's prize our theme.
