But there is a higher life revealed in Scripture... 'But there is a higher life revealed in Scriptnre—a life by which an individual may voluntarily forego the mystery of marriage, to become more and more absorbed in devotion to the duties of the spiritual union of Christ and Church; a life in which the love of the antitype may be even so great as to banish from the mind all thought of the type, concentrating all the affections of the soul upon the reality of the substance—a life so entirely free from the temporal, with all its joys, and cares, and entanglements, as to see nothing, to think of nothing, and to long for nothing but the eternalChrist Himself, and the fruition of his glorious Godhead ! How can it lie denied that the Scriptures do reveal to us the the possibility of such a life ; and tha it is the life of the celibate 'for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake ? '—not the life of the mere unmarried, which in itself considered is one of the most selfish of all lives, and which is not nnfrequently chosen foi the sake of selfish and criminal indulgence ; but the life of the celibate ' for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake?' Our blessed Lord said, indeed, ' All men cannot receive this saying, save they to u-hom it is given; bttt he that is able to receive it, let him receive it? ' —From Holy Matrimony, by Dr. J. A. Bolles
