The Knell of the Dying Year Hark ! what is that low, murihrtHng sound, That faintly falls upon the ear? So distant, yet it jars the ground,— Hush ! 'tis the knell of the dying year. ; All nature seems to hear the toll, The tempests pause in their wild career, E'er they have reached their destined goal, And list to the knell of the dying year. The stately trees of the forest bend To catch the sound, and, appalled with fear, A murmuring dirge in their sorrow lend, To bewail the knell of the dying year. The stars look down from the murky sky, Through a veil of clouds their sad faces appear, And the moon, enmantled with mists on high, Seems to weep the knell of the dying year. And wilt thon not join in the solemn scene O, man ! while thy death toll approaches near? And would'st thon listen with downcast mien, To the sorrow ful knell of the dying year ? ' Let thy footsteps tread pure virtue's way, And thou shalt never shed a tear '— A voice to my spirit seems to say— ' As thou nearest the knell of the dying year.'1 WILLIAM CALVER
