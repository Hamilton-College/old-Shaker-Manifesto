The Shaker to its Readers The present number of ourself completes the first volume. We have attempted, and have measurably succeeded, in giving correct information of the peculiar people whose nickname we bear. We might animadvert somewhat upon the writings of those who have filled our pages, but prefer to look with a i charitable eye upon those whose theology has j been unable to keep pace with the increase of j the revelations of the Good Spirit. We purpose being a special agent for the enlightenment of the household of Shaker principles, and with it, leaving the dead of the past, j 'go on unto perfection.' (Heb. 6:1.) We j have traveled far and wide before we are one ! year old. We have had more than seven thouj sands of ourself circulated each month—six j thousands and more reaching actual subscribers j and agents. We purpose, with the aid of every lover of virtue—every friend to the reform of vice and admirer of purity of life, to reach a circulation of ten thousand, the coming year, if possible. We mean to meet our patrons with an improved appearance, on superior paper, and with living and life-giving material of enhancing value, the coming year; we therefore beg to meet our old subscribers— every one—on New Year's Day. Our subscription price is the same; and, while it does not pay the cost, we are no poorer in spirit for all of ourself we have given away. Let each of the Shaker Societies give us a day's labor, or an acre of ground benefit, remembering the reward of giving to the poor. We know we are the advocate, in the missionary line, of principles that are eternal, that wilL not down at the bidding of worldly pride, lust nor selfishness. We mean to live—and by your help, kind readers, we mean to do a great deal of good. Though the following may seem a little irreverent for our pages, may not some of us find therein a valuable hint ?
