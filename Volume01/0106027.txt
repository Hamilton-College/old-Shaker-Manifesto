A living people will have a live religion... A living people will have a Iive religion ; this religion will resurrect them into life eternal; life eternal is a condition that is obtained by denial unto ourselves of practices we know the Angels oi' God do not, tootdd not engage in. How can we better make ''living sacrifices unto God,' than by so living, that evil in its every form is sacrificed, and the pure and lovely only, shine forth in their Christian splendor? Humanity arc getting thoroughly awake to the fact, that much that has been considered pleasure, is illegal for Christians to practice ; is corroding and corrupting to both body and soul. The name Christian signifies a follower of Christ. ' Who would be my disciple, must do as I do.' We will have no controversy with any ; but while we ask none to be Shakers, we ask them, for their eternal welfare, to live like him whom they profess to adore. 'Only introduce marriage into your institution, and we will become Shakers immediately, ' is the most common of observations. 'Come down from that cross and all men will believe on you,' was remarked some time ago. 'Do the Shakers want accessions?1' However this may be, we do not, nor ever will want accessions badly enough to recede from any principle in life, maintained by our great exemplar—Christ. Should we admit any, who would not confess and depart their sins—then there would be a humiliating spectacle—the Shakers joining the world.
