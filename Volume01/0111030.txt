The Shaker This is the title of an able periodical, published monthly at Albany, N. Y., under the direction of the Mt. Lebanon Bishopric of Shakers, and in the interests of that interesting people. While almost every other sect and ism in the United States has its organ, it was only last January that the Shakers established one of their own for the first time, and it was done in response to the urgent demands of the friends of reform, that they should give their ideas of life and happiness as viewed from the Shaker platform. The world at large is somewhat cognizant of the life and practice of the Shakers, but are almost entirely ignorant of their principles and doctrines. ' The Shaker ' gives information upon all these points, and is a very interesting paper to every inquiring mind. Fifty cents per annum. Address G. A. Lomas. â€”Springfield (.Mass.) Union.
