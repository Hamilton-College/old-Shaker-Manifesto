Innocence True innocence is like a bright, lovely jewel; this jewel is easily tarnished. How important then, that we keep it bright by a life, pure and unspotted. We should shun the very appear- ance of evil, even in thought and feeling. To my mind, true innocence consists in living a, life so pure, that nothing will enter the mind, but what is perfectly refined from all grossness and everything that would lead thereto, so that if our thoughts were written, there would be no occasion for shame. The innocent mind has needs of keeping no guard, nor taking thought, for fear of overstepping the bounds of modesty; for as the heart is, so will be our words and acts. Innocence will join us to the angels, and fit us to dwell with them. Julia E. Pierson, Shirley
