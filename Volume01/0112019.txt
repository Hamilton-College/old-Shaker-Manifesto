Making Her Fly Old Aunt Dina was a shouting colored saint of the city of Charleston, who would sing at the top of her voice and cry 'Glory!' above all the rest of the congregation. It was common at the missionary prayer meetings of the colored people to take up a collection while singing the hymn, ' Fly abroad, thou mighty Gospel!'' In the midst of which Aunt Dina always threw her head back, shut her eyes and sang lustily till the plate passed. The sable collector observed her habit, and one evening stopped when he came to her and said bluntly: ' Look aheah, Aunt Dina, you needn't be asinging ' Fly abroad, thou mighty Gospel' if you doesn't give nothing to make her fly !'
