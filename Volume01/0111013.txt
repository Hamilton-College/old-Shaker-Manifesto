Consecration According to Webster, means ' devoted to sacred uses.' Let us consider this important subject. We, as members of the Society of Believers, have covenanted to consecrate our ill to the upbuilding of the principles of Zion. This is a weighty obligation ! It signifies o-ir willingness to sacrifice our worldly inclinations, and yield obedience to a visible lead. These cannot be accomplished by following our own inclinations, unless these are consecrated and ratified by the Church. If I say I am consecrated, yet claim the right to dispose of my services as I think proper, I give the lie to my profession, for I have solemnly agreed to yield myself obediently to a visible Lead, and failing to do so destroys my avowal of consecration. No matter how talented an individual may be, if not consecrated, he may be the means of great discord, and the cause of Society's failure of blessing. Consecrated truly, will be the devotion of our all for the benefit of mankind, having no selfish objects in view, no personal desires to gratify; looking not for any reward, other than an approving conscience; standing firm for the cause of truth and justice; devoted to the right because it is right. Then are we truly consecrated. G. B. Price, Shakers, N. Y.
