The following is Prof. Bush's rendering... The following is Prof. Bush's rendering of Zach. ¦4:7:— 'MI ATTAUH HAUR GAUDOL LIPNA ZERTJBBABEL LEMISHOB HOTSIA EBEN KOSH TESHUA ANN ANN LEE.' Let us look into the next world : Bodily habits contracted here, will have no medium there ; and hence we will be necessitated to unlearn there, wrongs we have indulged in here. Is it not a wise choice, to engage in nothing here, but what we can hereafter ? The most useless of tasks is to save another from conditions we are lost in ourselves. Jesus first overcame the whole world of evil, before he encouraged his disciples to follow him. We are called to be Saviours; let us first seek salvation, not from penalties' but from practices of sin ; then can we help our fellows out of the pit. Parents should think, while teaching their children to confess to them their wrongs, that the gospel of Christ demands of Parents, confession unto apostles. *
