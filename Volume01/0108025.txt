NOTICES OF THE PRESS. The Shaker is the name of a new monthly, issued by and devoted to these faithful and honest devotees of their Christ. The first number issued for January, 1871, is a well got up and well filled sheet of respectable size, and cheap at fifty cents a year, and issued in Albany, N. Y., and edited by G. A. Lomas. We are glad these good people are now speaking to the public for themselves, and hope their paper will be largely patronized, that they may be better known and more appreciated thereby. They certainly have many virtues not common to Christians, and not appreciated as they deserve to be by other societies. It is not strange that there should be much sympathy with them among Spiritualists, since they had much of phenomenal Spiritualism among them, and most of them became convinced that spirits communicate before it gained much popularity among Infidels and other Christians.—Banner of Light. The Shaker, published at Albany, N. Y., is a monthly sheet, filled with words of love and wisdom. Its weapons of warfare are spiritual and mighty.— New Era, Cleveland.
