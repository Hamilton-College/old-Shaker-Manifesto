Blood signifies life... Blood signifies life. Blood is the life element. The blood of Jesus was earthly, and powerless for salvation ; his death on Calvary is not worthy of noticeThe blood of Christ is quite another element; it was the saving element of life that circulated in the soul of Jesus ; by it he became Jesus Christ. Being 'washed in the blood of Christ,' intends that we must die unto sin as did Jesus, and live the life of which he was the pattern.
