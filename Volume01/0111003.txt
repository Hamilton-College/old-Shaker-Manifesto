Hope On Hope on to the last, tho' the dark clouds may gather, Encircling thy course in tempest array; The storm shall pass o'er, and the sun in its splendor, Will brighter the beauties of nature display. Hope on to the last, tho' many oppose thee, Be true to the cause of justice anil right; For truth is a legion, and God will sustain thee, And turn in their souls the darkness to light. Hope on to the Iast, tho' the soft shades of evening, Are hidden behind the curtains of night, And the haven of rest, which gleamed in the distance, Enveloped in blackness, is hid from thy sight. Hope on to the last, there are joys in the future ; Weep not for those phantoms long since past away, For the pleasures of earth are exceeded in heaven, As the stars are outshone by the bright orb of day. Hope on to the last, for thy joys are eternal, And thousands shall join in thy welcome above, While the untiring strains of heavenly music, Announce thy approach to the regions of love. J. V. Calver
