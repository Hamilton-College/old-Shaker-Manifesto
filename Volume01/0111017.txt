Shakerism is a desperate remedy... Siiakbrism is a desperate remedy for a desperate disease. It is radical, certainly, and it is a question whether any less radical measure can meet the appalling character of the pas- sions, as they appear in the unvarnished manifestations of every day life. But whether it be a finality or not, it is manifest that there can scarcely be even a decent degree of saint- liness till men and women are able to live a celibate life, so long as duty, inspiration or reason shall dictate. If there be a possibility of living out a partial affiliation of fraterna love and sexual passion, without the cast iron rules imposed by monogamic marriage and the Shaker brotherhood, the road to it lies through Shaker grounds, at least.â€”New Campaign.
