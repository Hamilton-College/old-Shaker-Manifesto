Angel's Call Hear the voice of Angel spirits Calling1 loudly unto all, ' Come up higher—Come away from Sinful acts by Adam's fall. ' Leave behind all works of darkness— Leave a life of sin and woe! Live to God—live pure and holy, While upon tills earth below. ' God's right arm will guide you yonder, Far above earth's pleasures vain, Where pure joys, substantial, holy, With you evermore remain. ' Then let all be found advancing— Toiling with a heart and will; Laying waste the haunts of wll, And the Oil of Love distill.' Shakers, N. Y. Ann Buckingham
