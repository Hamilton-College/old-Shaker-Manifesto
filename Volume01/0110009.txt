Be strong, be steadfast... Be strong, be steadfast in fair virtue's cause. Nor fear reproof, nor covet vain applause; Heed not of evil tongues the envious strife, Nor the loud storms that rage in human life. On truth's firm basis let your hopes remain, And seas may rage and tempests roar in vain. 'Tis easiest dealing with the firmest mind; More just when it resists, and where it yields, more Blest are the lips that open but to bless! [kind. That never yet the gentle heart belied! Still prompt to smile, to praise, or to cares*, And ever slow to censure or to chide; Blest shall they be on earth by all who hear, Nor their vocation change in heaven above; For what do angel lips in that bright sphere, But sing of praise, of mercy, and of love. How terrible is passion ! how our reason Falls down before it; whilst the tortured frame, Like a ship dashed by fierce encounter's tide, And of her pilot spoiled, drives round and round, The sport of wind and wave.
