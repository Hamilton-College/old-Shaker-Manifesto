I Think The world demands a gospel of salvation, that will comprehend and meet its present con- ditions, physically and spiritually. No reliance can be placed on any faith in religion that will not bear the severest scientific investigation. No human soul ought to believe in any system of theology that will yield itself subserviently to the demands of human nature depraved; or which can be bought or sold as the commonest merchandise. Let the wThole world have a thorough knowledge of the true Christian faith, that will bring both body and soul up to the highest state of excellence; and may God speed the day. G. B.
