The Household of Faith As the Trinitarian God of the past; and the masculine church of the present, have neither seen fruitful of the power of salvation, nor grace to redeem humanity from degradation^ so will all religions, all systems, and all creeds srove themselves inadequate to the wants of ;he world, which fail to recognize and be governed by the living principle of duality. As natural things are but types of spiritual, and the more real is comprehended within the crust of the outer, so must the significant fact, underlying this so long negatived truth, be admitted, if we would see the advancement and spread of Christ's kingdom. Can the paternal influence alone beget and bring forth children in the natural order ? Neither can it in the spiritual. What is home without a Mother, either in the natural or the spiritual household ? And, when the true heirs are produced, and '''the sons and daughters of God without rebuke,' they will come of a parentage balanced as that which said in the beginning, ' Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; â€” male and female created he them.' A simple, reasonable, theological basis on which to rest the principles which are to redeem us from the thraldom of the earth-plane, and inspire us with the necessary fortitude and self-renunciation, to subordinate the natural to the spiritual, and thus be truly 'born again,' are essentials to the development and progress of the soul.
