'It is no more than bare justice to say, that we are indebted to the Shakers, more than any or all other social architects of modern times. Their success has been the ' specie basis' that has upheld all the paper theories, and counteracted the failures of the French and English schools. It is very doubtful, whether Owenism or Fourierism would have ever existed, or if they had, whether they would have moved the practical American mind, if the facts of Shakerism had not existed before them. While we say the Rappites, the Zoarites, the Ebenezers, Owenites, and even the Fourierists are all echoes of the Shakers, we must also say that the Shakers are the far-off echoes of the Primitive Christian Church.' â€” J.
