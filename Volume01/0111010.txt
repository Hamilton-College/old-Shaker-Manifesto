The following article speaks â€¢ for itself. Some of our correspondents need just this in- struction, with additions. We have some otherwise good articles*, on hand, which we know not what to do with, while very many have been reluctantly hurled into the waste basket: The Lowell Courier says : 'When will that millenium for editors arrive when correspondents and writers for the press will no longer fill their articles with such abbreviations as 'Sect.' for secretary, ' Pres.' for president, 'o'clk.' for o'clock and the like? when they will not interlard their sentences with nondescript hierogtyphics which they think answer for punctuation, but which are as meaningless to the typographical eye as an inscription from the Moabite stone ? when will they not underscore every third word under the mistaken notion that the italic fronts of type are as large as the Roman ? It is ordinarily easier for the journalist to copy a piece of manuscript than attempt to edit that furnished by those unaccustomed to write for the press. And yet the only directions to be followed are the simplest : to let the manuscript alone after putting down the words needed to express the meaning. As for not writing on both sides of the paper, we despair of ever beating that into the heads of correspondents.'
