There is all that is noble in living a life of self-denial —denying to ourselves affections of wrong ; and all that is lovely in the cultivation of something better— the beautiful, the good. Hard-feelings are the elements of worldly hatred. Worldly hatred derives its origin, often, from a wrong committed by those who hate, towards the object of their hatred. That which we ]ove best, will form the subject of our happiest thoughts ; we will give it the preference of all other themes in our conversation ; it will have the largest influence in forming our resolutions, anc of putting them into execution.
