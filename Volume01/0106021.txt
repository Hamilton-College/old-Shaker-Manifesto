Maxims A knowledge of our own weakness creates in us, charity for others. The imperfections we see and despise in others, we sometimes possess ourselves. A Christian will never despise the poor, unfortunate, nor fallen ; but will strive to reclaim them by their love of God. We may despise sin, but not the sinner. The most powerful lens is a humble spirit; it enables us to see ourselves. Make thy heart an abode for angels, not a reservoir for sin. What we gain by our own exertions we value ; while gifts bestowed are frequently squandered. E. F. H.
