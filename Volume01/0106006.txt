Was the God of the Jews, the Creator... 'Was the God of the Jews, the Creator of heaven and earth ? The Shakers say not. The God that directed the Jews was a tutelar divin ity ; not the Father of the Christ. One believed in and directed war ; the other taught Of an enduring peace. One permitted 'an eye for an eye;'1 the other taught, ''love your enemies.' Very many complications of opinions may be tm raveled by learning the distinction made by the assertion: ' The God of the Christian is not the God of the Jews.' *
