'Time is Money.' Seated in an easy chair, last evening, after the muscles had performed their share of the duties of the day, my eyes fell upon the above motto, ingeniously woven into an advertise- ment. It was an incentive to industry. Summing up the spare moments that frequently slip oy unimproved, I thought how much of the symmetry and beauty was lost from our ideal of perfect manhood. ' Time is money.' We can account for the origin of so singular a proverb, when we consider the fascinating influence of money on the human mind. Could three other words express so much of the hearts of men ? While it speaks to us of the virtue of industry, it would have us toil at Mammon's shrine ! The Angel of Wisdom lifting us upon the platform of the World! We will not object to the elevation. If we are below it, we must need come up; but I trust we shall not consider it the acme of human development. Sentiment is at fault if it points us no higher. If it provides only for the body, it leaves a void within. Industry should be one of the first lessons of life. It is the secret of growth; but if that growth is too much toward materiality, it blunts the finer feelings and develops the animal rather than the angel. When we Aveave our garland of mottoes to adorn the crown of Industry, we will write it, by putting our hands to work and giving our heart to God: Time is moiie than money. J. V. C.
