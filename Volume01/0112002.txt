True Wealth Be my mind a sacred treasury, Stored with gems and diamonds blight, Where no dross shall ever gather, That would dim their lustrous light. Garnered there the wealth of knowledge, Truth and Wisdom's golden sheaves, Kichest fruits and fragrant flowers, Not alone life's fading leaves. Walls of sapphire form the chambers, By eternal Goodness made, I will fill this heavenly structure With the sunsnine. not the shade. I will hang it round with pictures, That shall give me joy to see, Not the imagery of demons, That would haunt and follow me. Like the ghosts in ancient story, Protean forms of passions base, Sordid loves, and gross desiresâ€” These the temple would deface. Innocence and pure affection, Deeds in consecration wrought, Holy thoughts and aspirations, To this temple shall be brought. Germs of good my soul shall cherish, Spurn the false and jyrize the true, Look beyond the things that perish., Where bright glories rise to view. Brighter now appears the prospect, And the angel life is mine ; Growth and progress are eternal, In the spheres of truth divine. Martha Andebson, Mt. L.
