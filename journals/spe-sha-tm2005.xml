                            OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 11.</head><p TEIform="p">TANNING. In the first year of the Community a small building was used for
                            grinding bark, and for the finishing of leather. Several vats were made near the building,
                            and the business of making leather made good progress. The grinding of the bark was done by
                            horse power, and the machine was a circular stone. For twenty years these rude
                            accommodations were used with but very little improvement. After the introduction of a cast
                            iron bark mill, which was driven by water power, the business was greatly facilitated. In
                            1807 more additions were made to the buildings, and machines added for rolling the leather.
                            In 1813 a machine was.added for splitting leather. The business had so much increased by the
                            year 1834 that still larger buildings were needed and more ample provisions made to meet the
                            growing demand. By tins change the vats were placed in the basement of the building and
                            numbered not less than thirty-two. Every thing on the premises was made to correspond with
                            the amount of business, as well as with the quality of the work "demanded. The hides at this
                            date were softened in a common fulling mill, but in 1840 a wheel or cylinder jwas used and
                            considered a great im�provement. As the sales increased, [the old process of tanning leather
                            in ,cold vats was by far too slow to suit �the sellers and buyers of this fast age, and a
                            steam boiler was introduced in ;1850 for heating the vats and leaches, in order to force the
                            hides more expeditiously through the process of making leather. This branch of business has
                            been continued almost uninterruptedly, since the forming of the Community and has been quite
                            remunerative. THE MAKING- OF HATS. Experienced hatters were among those who accepted the
                            faith of the Believers, and the manufacture of fur and wool hats began with the beginning of
                            the Community. Th'es*e were jnade not only for New Lebanon, but for the Believers in other
                            States and for persons not of the Society. After a few years the business was all given in
                            the charge of the Society at Hancock, and for twenty years no hats<pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> were made iii New Lebanon. This branch of industry has never been
                            attended with that success which one might wish, and diminished gradually from year to year
                            till it entirely closed. THE MAKING OF PAILS AND TUBS. By the introduction of a small amount
                            of machinery, the Believers engaged in the manufacture of pails and tubs for their own use
                            and a limited number for the market. But little improvement was made in the machinery for
                            several years, but much good and substantial work was done, which found a ready sale. From
                            the scarcity of lumber, and other branches of business occupying the attention, the making
                            of pails and tubs, has been allowed to pass from the Community. THE MANUFACTURE OF CLOTH.
                            The making of cloth in 1787 was almost wholly the work of hand cards, hand looms and the
                            cloth was sheared with hand shears. In 1809 a machine was invented for shearing the cloth
                            and this was accepted as a great step in advance of what had been. Hand looms continued to
                            be used for many years. SADDLE AND HARNESS MAKING. This occupation was followed for some
                            years, and was to the Society quite a profitable business. But at the commencement of the
                            present century the .use of saddles became so greatly diminished, that in a few years the
                            business was wholly laid aside. One horse wagons were quite universally introduced, so that
                            the making and repairing of harnesses, became quite an active branch. BRASS AND TIN WORK.
                            The principal articles manufactured of brass were sleeve buttons. These were made in two
                            parts, and attached by a chain. These were largely used at the wristbands of the shirts.
                            Some were made of polished brass and others were covered with cloth. Shoe buckles were used
                            to fasten the shoes instead of strings. Knee buckles' were used to secure the legs of the
                            breeches at the knee, but on the introduction of pantaloons, the buckles passed out of date.
                            Stock buckles were also made and used to fasten the stock at the rear of the neck. Various
                            kinds of harness buckles were also made of brass, and the sale of all these articles was for
                            some years a satisfactory source of income. The Society made and repaired most of their own
                            tin ware, although some articles manufactured of brass or tin they purchased as they did
                            many other goods. CARPENTERING. This should be considered as one of the domestic branches
                            and from the origin of the Society has been of great value. In the construction of buildings
                            and in the multiplicity of jobs from necessity and for convenience, it has been one of the
                            greatest blessings of the order. In the early years when the work on a building began,
                            individuals from one or more Societies would assist till the job was completed. This
                            obviated the necessity of employing any hired help. As this volunteer work was reciprocal,
                            all the Societies were equally benefited as occasion offered. At this date the workmen
                                had<pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> but few tools and these were mostly of an inferior
                            quality. In 1813 a great improvement was accepted by the introduction of a buzz or circular
                            saw. A large amount of work was now done in the mill with a saw running by water power,
                            which was a great relief to the workman who had till now used his hand saw for this same
                            purpose. Planing machines, for the smoothing of boards and timber were introduced in the
                            year 18� and have proved to be of great value to the workman. At the time of the
                            organization of the Society, few buildings were on the place, and those were not as well
                            adapted as they should have been for required purposes. Many were subjected to much
                            inconvenience on account of the limited accommodations that could be afforded them. So soon,
                            however, as they accumulated sufficient funds, they began to accommodate themselves with
                            better buildings, both for dwellings and for workshops. In all this wo^k they studied a
                            rigid economy, in sifce and manner of finish, trusting that a future day would allow them to
                            do much better. Sometimes from lack of experience the.y increased the expense and amount of
                            labor on a building by making a&gt;curb or hip roof instead of a gable* roof. This,
                            however, was the custom of this part of the country and on this account generally adopted.
                            The halls of these buildings were quite narrow and the stairs very steep, in order to
                            economize the room as much as possible. Very few of these first buildings were ever painted,
                            as that was considered superfluous, and for many years after the custom had been introduced,
                            only the best dwellings were allowed to have a coat of paint. All the buildings made
                            previous to 1805 were very plain. The halls and rooms and all stairways were very
                            contracted, and on the outside no jets to the eaves, nor any trimmings about the doors were
                            permitted. Since the above date there has been a gradual change and in 1850 not a building
                            was left that had not undergone some change in its construction. In this change a great many
                            improvements were made, both for convenience and in the general appearance. The roofs, of
                            all these first buildings were covered with shingles, while many since 1810 have been
                            covered with tin or with slate. The Brethren's shop three stories in height, was built of
                            brick in the year 1826. The Trustee's Office was built of brick, in 1827. The meeting house
                            that was built when the Society was organized, was removed from its place and a much larger
                            building occupies the ground. The present structure is 80x65 ft. and' has a round roof
                            covered with tin. The roof was formed by arches of long planks, bent to a circle of about
                            forty feet radius. The inside is one entire room, having a height of twenty-three feet.
                            Attached to the south end is a building of 35x27 ft. and three stories high. The first loft
                            was for the accommodation of the Society when they came to Church, and the second and third
                            lofts were furnished for the Ministry and used as their dwelling. The family dwelling was
                            80x60 ft. and three stories high, above the base-<pb n="100" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> ment. It
                            contained twenty dwellingrooms, and in addition a large number of halls, closets and
                            permanent cases for drawers and cupboards. This building was destroyed by fire in the year
                            18�. The foundations of many of the buildings were made of natural faced stone, while others
                            were made of sawed stone. Wagon making and wheel and reel making have been carried on to
                            some extent from the first, for home use, and more or less for sale. Our first wagons and
                            trucks were all furnished with wooden axles, but these finally gave place to those made of
                            iron.

                            called forth, of happy times and of many instances of true parental care by those who were
                            my tutors and gospel parents. In obedience to their counsel I found comfort and peace. There
                            are many places and conditions which we must pass through, where Ave might falter by the
                            way, if we are without the aid of those who are our best friends. The way of the pure is the
                            only one in which we can overcome the enemy of our souls ; and may we, in the trials of our
                            daily life, unfalteringly stand the test and be able to say and feel, "Not my will, but
                            thine O God." It is the little trials we meet that will prove us. Can I love those who, I
                            think, do not love me? And yet Ave must learn to bear and forbear and try to do as we Avish
                            others to do by us. This is the gospel of the cross, and it teaches us to curb our selfish
                            nature and live for the higher life; having an open and justified conscience before God and
                            man. While in this state of mind we may be sure of the1 promise of our Heavenly Father, "I
                            will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Through an experience of many years I have known
                            this precious promise to be true, and can say as one in the Bible has testified, "I have
                            been young, and now I am old : yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed
                            begging bread." Psa. xxxvii., 25. 1 would ask those who are now young, in our Zion home to
                            meditate upon this subject. What motive could an}' one have in consecrating his wrhole life
                            to God and his people ; enduring tribulation and sacrifice, if not to do good to humanity,
                            and offer to others that which God ha&amp; so abundantly provided for us ? Indeed, this
                            must be the only motive. All are subject to temptations and to the desire for self-pleasure,
                            or the pleasures of a worldly life; but the blessing AA'hich we have found in the life of
                            righteousness, we want that others should share Avith us. We feel as did king David, when he
                            said, "O God, thou hast taught me from my youth ; and I have declared thy Avondrous works,
                            andnoAv, O God, forsake me not, until I have declared thy strength unto this generation, and

B. Avery.] I dreamed such a horrible dream
                                    last night, It smote hie through with a cold affright, And would not go with the
                                    dawning light like other lies; For in dreams men often meet a guess, Or a wandering
                                    thought in bodily dress, A visible "No" or a tangible "Yes" to some dim surmise.
                                    What was the horrible thing I dreamed? I met a man�or a man he seemed, As the
                                    noonday sunlight over him streamed, till, thrilled with dread, I saw when my soul
                                    looked his soul through. As only in dreams a soui can do, That, though brains and
                                    body lived and grew, His soul vas dead. Yes, there he stood, a creature indeed, That
                                    could walk and talk and drink and feed, And add up figures, and write and read, And
                                    work and wed� And all with automatic neatness, Smiling even with studied sweetness,
                                    And quite enjoying life's completeness, The life he led. Till at last as I saw him
                                    standing there, With never a hope and never a care, His dead soul set in a stony
                                    stare, �'Poor soul," I said, "And wilt thou never feel again Divinest joy, most
                                    God-like pain, Love in which self is lost and slain? Art thou quite dead? And then
                                    in my pity I cried aloud, "0 give to this poor dead soul a shroud, And hide him away
                                    from the living crowd In some narrow bed� Oh, merciful heaven, give him a grave, Or
                                    send some fire that will cleanse and save And quicken again the soul that God gave,

                            earth teems with his goodness. Realizing as I do the crowning work of God with man, which is
                            to culminate in the perfect redemption of the soul from all that is earthly and sensual, a
                            resurrection from dead works to a life in Christ, a virgin character, I feel the necessity
                            of ever keeping in view my Christian call and mission. For me as an individual, and for our
                            body as a Christian sect, a large field is open both for spiritual and physical labor,
                            requiring much sacrifice ; and as scripturally taught, and as exemplified in fruits, we reap
                            what we sow in all the labors of life. If we sow to the flesh, we shall of the flesh produce
                            the fruits thereof, fruits of the fall, emanations derived from elements as they exist in
                            ourselves, fruits of corruption. While if we sow to the spirit, our reward is eternal life;
                            we reap a harvest of divine excellence, a fruitage more than human, unmistakable proofs of
                            the veritable truth of the promises of the Most High. Although we are commanded to judge no
                            man, yet by the fruits of humanity, humanity is known, and character is comprehended by that
                            which is daily cropping out in life. If our strength and powers are given on the animal
                            plaue, though much good wTheat may be the product of our field, of -a character
                            praise-worthy and distinguishable in the Christ life, yet evidence is clear that the
                            conspicuous and most prolific crops of that field<pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> are
                            tares, which have nourished and cumber the ground for the want of proper cultivation of the
                            soil. As in the natural order, so in thcspiritnal,-there is a garden within ourselves to be
                            dug about and fed with the salt of the spirit, that it may grow good fruit and produce
                            spiritual outcomes; However great and impressive may be the call of God to the soul, however
                            favorable the opportunities for Christian life, however extraordinary and bountiful the
                            ministrations from the heavens to man, or however much he hath cried, Lord, Lord, prophesied
                            in his name and done wonderful works, if ultimately found a worker of iniquity, his sentence
                            must be the declaration of the Savior pronounced upon the foolish man,� "I never knew you ;
                            depart from me." Awhile on the other hand, those who have taken upon them the }^oke of
                            Christ and faithfully borne it, who have learned of him to be meek and lowly in heart, his
                            promise is,�"Come unto me and ye shall find rest unto your souls ; for my yoke is easy and

                            race is thus consummated in the following facts, and who will say they are not possible of
                            realization : Abolition of Wage Slavery. ' " Private Property. " " Money. " " Poverty. "
                            War. " " The Legal Fraternity. " " Taxes. " " The Jury System, and the establishment of the
                            social equality of the sexes, of Communism and the perfect enjoyment of life, liberty and
                            the pursuit of happiness by every human soul. Now do you realize that in this barbaric age
                            there is a people who have realized (as far as the moral and spiritual evolution of humanity
                            will permit) the facts that Bellamy in his "Civilization of the Twentieth Century" has
                            foreseen ' We do not wish to toot our own horn but to prove to the world what has been
                            accomplished. We have abolished poverty. There are no rich, no poor in a Shaker Community.
                            All enjoy the benefits of life equally. We have abolished War; will not under any
                            circumstances take up arms against our fellow men. Our testimony in that regard has been
                            very plain and decided. We have abolished private property. The brotherhood of man is an
                            accomplished fact with us. We have abolished wage slavery. True, we emp'oy some that are
                            n.it members of our Communities to work for wages ; and the sentiment is growing among us to
                            dispense with hired labor entirely, and some of our Communities have already done so. As for
                            the legal fraternity, we try to avoid the use of them as much as possible. In all the
                            affairs of life woman stands the equal and co-worker with man. It could not be other wise,
                            as our organization was first conceived and brought forth by woman�one that<pb n="103" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> we look upon as one of the most illuminated and spiritual minds
                            that has been produced on this planet for centuries. As we believe with Pope, that man has a
                            higher destiny than ''to propagate and rot," so a virgin life is the, basic principle on
                            which our Community rests. We draw our recruits from the generative plane of life, and as a
                            consequence take what is presented ; or in other words we dip our net into the great sea of
                            humanity and gather good, bad and indifferent; they must necessarily be sifted and those who
                            have evolved the higher life enough to comprehend our principles, remain to swell the ranks
                            of progressive thinkers, while the balance return to the sea from which they came. Our
                            testimony to the world is to have fewer and better children through a higher parentage.
                            Bellamy takes a very optimistic view of [the transition from the crude condition of society
                            of the present era to the social and economic society of the Twentieth Century and iu his
                            ''Looking Backward" predicts that it will come without strife or bloodshed ; let us hope so.
                            Fellow workers in the field of Advance Thought, we as religious Communists present the
                            foregoing facts for your c;iudid and unbiassed consideration: trusting that viewed in the
                            same light, and actuated by the same spirit that has prompted your investigations into the
                            causes and remedies for the woes that are the effect of false conditions that are at present
                            afflicting human society, you will see that we have pursued a course consistent with the
                            highest dictates of reason. And to those who have felt the call of the spirit to come up and
                            out of the rudimental sphere of existence, to you we ask a closer communion of spirit, and
                            make an earnest appeal to help bear aloft the banDer of truth and purity that sin-sick souls
                            may know where there is a haven of rest, where the grim phantoms of their former lives like
                            shadows are fleeing away before the brightness of the latter day, and a knowledge of the
                            truth and beauty of the higher life will be an abiding substance in the souls of our
                            resurrected humanity. Let us all work for the attainment of that ideal life for only by
                            labor can it be realized. Your friend in the cause of truth and progress. *� Sonyea, N.

                            spiritual worship, would have, with us, as with the outside churches, a decided tendency to
                            a dead formality. 2. Because, in a large degree it would prevent the exercise of the lesser
                            abilities that are needed, and which would die if there were no opportunity of exercising
                            them. 3. In a Believer's meeting, every soul should be reached; touched by the Holy Spirit;
                            this is often done through the medium of song, rendered by the unscientific singer, because
                            such singer has a soul, and is in union with the Heavens ; and by opening his mouth in song,
                            opens the spiritual avenues whereby all are blest. 4. Because it would tend to build<pb n="104" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> up the pride of the player, and the ambition of the few
                            singers, which had better be mortified, even by unscientific singing, than to grow proud in
                            the House of God. 5. Because instrumental music is, in every way, inferior to vocal music.
                            6. God is only worshiped in spirit, and in truth. Vocal music, rendered by soul cultured
                            human beings, breathes the spirit of truth which others can feel, while instrumental music
                            covers imperfections which should be revealed. 7. There is no objection to music, the most
                            perfect that science cau give, being sung in our meetings, think it might be profitable to
                            the whole congregation to listen, provided the singers were in a Gospel travel, under the
                            influence of our pure and holy faith, wThich mortifies the worldly elements of pride,
                            ambition, and vain glory. But, if the singers are not consecrated to the Gospel Cause, and
                            pride and vanity are not under a good degree of mortification, it were better to exercise in
                            a gift of shaking, than to listen to such singing; it would be more profitable. 8. Because
                            Believers should be transformed from the world, especially in the form, and manner,
                            pertaining to the worship of God. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            the lofty hills of pride and vain-glory, we have to feel as little children, who know
                            nothing and have to learn much. If a man thinks he knows it all and is able to do
                                everything<pb n="105" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> it will prevent him to enlarge his mind,
                            to be benefited by the knowledge of others. In fact the really great and wise men and women
                            of all ages, those who hnve been bright stars to enlighten the people, giving every branch
                            of science and art a new start and great improvement, these are the most humble and meek,
                            feeling that they only know very little. Because acquiring knowledge, they perceive what an
                            immense field of information there is before them to cultivate their minds. Beethoven, the
                            great composer of music, who has been a bright star in the world of music, said on his
                            deathbed : "Now I begin to see what can be done in music." He had a great misfortune to
                            bear, being deaf, all around him were delighted through his compositions, while he himself,
                            being surrounded by a gloomy silence could not enjoy the fruits of his labors. Milton, the
                            great poet, was blind; he dictated his sublime poem. "Paradise Lost," to his daughter.
                            Newton, the great astronomer, who traced the stars in their courses in the heavens,
                            discovering new stars and planets, testified feeling himself as a little child, just
                            beginning to learn. Such great and noble minds ascended a great elevation on the mountain of
                            knowledge, but this gave them only a better idea of the loftiness of the summit. We may
                            progress, progress greatly perhaps in every branch of science, art and literature, we may be
                            very learned, heaping learning upon learning, and yet not be in the right direction of mind.
                            If we are unable to make a proper and immediate use of our knowledge, all the time, spent to
                            obtain so much knowledge, is lost and it will prove useless, a dead weight that weighs us
                            down to earth, to earthly elements. Yea, the very things we have taken so much pains to
                            acquire will prove a hindrance, an encumbrance to the mind to make progress in the right
                            direction, a useful and honorable member of society. There are many who have drank deep from
                            out the fountain of science, but in the most common actions of life they are entirely
                            ignorant, in their sphere of action, or discussing with them sublime subjects, yea, there
                            they are masters of the field, displaying a powerful intellect. But, ah! if the rough storms
                            of life throw them out of their common course, if they meet misfortunes and are obliged to
                            work (which is a great blessing) with their hands to obtain a livelihood, what use, what
                            benefit is for them all their learning? They know everything except how to use their hands
                            how to make themselves useful. Spencer, (Henry) the great Educator of the people, urges that
                            the girls shall be taught at school the different household duties, and the boys one or
                            another trade according to their taste. In the Middle-Ages great attention ^vas paid to the
                            development of the body, at the neglect of the mind, and at present the mind is developed,
                            crammed full of knowledge, at the expense of the body. However I believe the best knowledge
                            is well, how to serve God, if I know this and bring it iuto practice in my everyday life,
                            carry it out in my daily deportment, I shall be useful to all around me. ; We have received
                            in some measure talents, some many, others less, not all are bright suns, but there are
                            planets ai.nd moons, that receive their light from the sun; God in his Wisdom has chosen
                            comparatively a few men and<pb n="106" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> womeu, and prepared them to
                            shine as bright stars and to diffuse their rays of light all around them for the delight,
                            comfort and benefit of their fellow beings. We are responsible for the talents God has
                            blessed us with, we must use them well and in God's service and for his glory, doing all the
                            good we can. Voltaire, the French poet and philosopher, was a bright, shining light, but he
                            was an infidel, an unbeliever, mocking and rendering ridiculous all that is sacred to the
                            sincere and devoted heart. With his extraordinary talents and eloquence he did much harm to
                            many, who found their only hope and consolation in the Christian religion, while on the
                            other hand if he had used his talents in the right direction, he might have been a blessing
                            to many. And besides him there are many, blessed with many gifts, but using them wrongly,
                            and giving away to their carnal appetites, sinking deep in sin and becoming so many devils
                            of darkness, while they could and should have been angels of light. I pray God that I may be
                            able to keep my holy Faith, not to make ship-wreck of my faith in God and his gospel of
                            salvation, that I may be able to do God's will and what is well-pleasing in his sight, that
                            I may gain purity of heari, and purity of mind. By so doing I shall become more and more
                            worthy of the manifold blessings with which I am surrounded. If I bend my whole soul to know
                            how to serve, how to please, how to love God, and carry this into effect, certainly I shall
                            not leave any room in my mind for evil thoughts, but God will send ministering angels to
                            minister to the needs of my soul, to teach me how to overcome sin in myself, to build me up,
                            to guide and direct me in the way of holiness, to protect me from harm, to shield me from my
                            own evil, wicked and perverse nature. Sonyea, N.

                            more of "the Ballston Shaker," as some in that vicinity are disposed to call her; while she
                            very wisely accepts the name, we are pleased to introduce her to you as our Gospel Sister,
                            Sophia Wayne. Three years previous to her uniting with Believer's testimony she was an
                            earnest investigator of the faith, and when convinced that it was right for her to obey it,
                            she did so without hesitation ; and the seed fell into a good and honest heart. Prior to
                            this, she belonged to the high Church of England and was thoroughly imbued with its tenets;
                            though of later years her eyes were opened to see that true religion was not to be found
                            within the pale of the Church, and that a more perfect form of Christianity was needed ;
                            this she partially found in the Swedenborgian doctrine, which prepared her for a superior
                            life in the resurrection Order. When brought in contact with the simple faith of the Gospel,
                            she being thus prepared� drawn by the Father�was led to a work of repentance and confession,
                            and this brought her into union with the Maternal Spirit; through this baptism she now
                            receives spiritual gifts. Circumstances beyond control prevent her being gathered into the
                            family, and consequently she belongs to the Novitiate class ; and as she meets with op-<pb n="107" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> posing forces, is ministered unto in a remarkable and
                            wonderful manner, very foreign from anything she ever before experienced. Hear what she says
                            : "While visiting at your home last Summer, I was kindly invited to join a company of
                            Brethren and Sisters in their pleasant evening entertainment. At the close of the meeting, a
                            dear Sister requested the prayers of the company for the new comer who had so lately been
                            accepted as a member of their Order. After my return, and while thinking of that kind
                            request, a wish took possession of me, that I might in some way be influenced to receive a
                            little of the power that led my chosen friends to compose verses in line, as they were
                            constantly doing. The thoughts in my mind did not run in a spiritual current, but seemed all
                            centered on Mt. Lebanon and its inmates. Then one night while thinking deeply of your
                            mountain home and of things pertaining to its surroundings, I was surprised to find that my
                            thoughts were forming into verse. I repeated them to myself several times, so as to retain
                            them in my memory, and in the morning wrote them down. It was about the same time that I
                            held conversations with our ministers, and I found to my sorrow that one im-colleged learned
                            heretic, could not compete with three college bred Divines. Then came your kind letter of
                            comfort and advice, "to let such things alone, and if I held the taith steadfastly, it would
                            be given me what to say." From that time I found my power to write in verse was increasing,
                            and what surprised me most was, that the very subjects which I had been advocating as my
                            ideas of right were being given to me in verse, via., those I call "Self Atonement" and "The
                            Orthodox Resurrection." That I am at times influenced by Believers' spirits may possibly be
                            true. I know there is some other power at work besides my own. But I claim that these
                            messages are sent to me on the spiritual telegraph from your mountain home ; though I am a
                            believer in spirit communication and may be a medium ; that those lines I call "Atonement"
                            should come to me in verse is to say the least, rather strange. I was thinking on that
                            subject, and how I had been told by our Minister that there was no other name given under
                            heaven whereby we can be saved but that of Jesus ; this thought came to me. Jesus took on
                            our humanity ; was tempted like unto us ; he retired to the wilderness and there fought
                            against the tempter by prayer and fasting. Now, if that was not self-atonement I do not know
                            what is. But our orthodox clergy tell us that Jesus was, and is God ; if so, why did he pray
                            "My God, why hast thou forsaken me ?" If Jc?us was God and born entirely perfect, wherefore
                            his temptation ; and if created with an impossibility of committing sin, whence his glory ?
                            In regard to a belief of the resurrection of the body, that belief of itself is of minor
                            importance unless it is joined to a belief in a general wholesale day of judgment; then we
                            must protest, for it is calling into question the righteousness of the Supreme Ruler. The
                            orthodox creed allows but two places for the spirits abode after leaving this earth; one,
                            the extreme of happiness, the other the entire reverse. We are also taught that we are not
                            to be<pb n="108" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> judged until the general resurrection day, and then
                            Christ is to judge us. We must then naturally suppose that some are allowed to be in glory
                            for per haps thousands of centuries, while others are in extreme anguish, and this without
                            being judged to see if they were worthy of glory or punishment. Then after centuries on
                            centuries have passed, we are to be called out of our separate places ; we must come back to
                            earth ; find the old body again, get into it as best we can and come to Christ for our
                            judgment; or, come to be told whether his Father�the Mighty Ruler of the universe�had
                            possibly made a mistake, by letting some live so long in supreme happiness, and others in
                            misery, without according them a judgment. I do not wonder that those who are taught such a
                            doctrine, fear and tremble at the idea of meeting such a Judge. And we might well ask these
                            faithless Shepherds the meaning of the beautiful words, "In my Father's house are many
                            mansions." I cannot go to Church to hear our heavenly Father's name traduced, and to be
                            taught that while some are allowed to go direct into the presence of God, others are doomed
                            to eternal misery. If our God is thought to be so stern and unrelenting, whence came the
                            Christ Spirit that would not break a bruised reed ; and the command to Peter to forgive not
                            only "until seven times, but until seventy times seven? Is the servant greater than his
                            Master? I never again can adopt the orthodox Church faith which allows Ministers and members
                            alike, to live in the works of generation, in idleness and luxury, and conforming to the
                            fashions and vanities of this wicked world. Though a lone passenger in a frail barque I am
                            assured of my union in spirit to the body of Christ in his Second Appearing, and of the
                            prayers of all my chosen people ; this is my hope and the anchor of my soul." Further
                            comments are not needed; as long as one soul can be touched by the power of conviction, and
                            come under the baptism of tlie Christ heavens, there is hope for the race and a joy for the
                            future Zion of God. In love that knows no shadow of turaiug, I am happy to be your Gospel

                            Church contentions, That grow from time to time; Do they not know that all the creeds of man
                            Cannot destroy the great Creator's plan? He works by laws divine. Then whats the use of
                            making such pretense Of numerous creeds not having common sense, Why not remain in peace?
                            For other ministers will have their say, And so it will go on from day to day, And strife
                            will never cease. For Presbyterians claim that their elect, Are only those who really may
                            expect To be the good and true. The Baptists claim immersion is the plan, Through it must
                            come the saving power of man, And nothing else will do. The Episcopalians tell us that we
                            must Return to earth to seek our forms in dust, Till Gabriel's trump shall sound. We may
                            live gaily till our latest hour, We then must claim the all-atoning power To gain the happy
                            ground. The Roman Catholics give their people hope, Providing, that they venerate the Pope,
                            As one divinely born.<pb n="109" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> Oh ye who claim to practice
                            Christian deeds, What need have you to follow senseless creeds , That are but empty sounds?
                            Why should you try to judge the Ruling Power? How will you feel when in the latest hour You
                            find yourselves mistaken? Learn to rely on Him who reigns above, Know that his judgments are
                            combined with love, His laws cannot be shaken. We know the loving Mother of our faith, And
                            trust Her mercy in the hour of death, And feel we are assured That if we earn that hope,
                            we'll surely find A j idgment just&gt; with pitying love combined, And heaven will be
                            secured. Then let us leave contention as a blight, To those who argue that the wrong is
                            right, And follow senseless creed; Adopt the glorious faith so good and true : Our
                            conscience tells us what we ought to do, And that is all we need. For we are taught that by
                            the golden law We gain our passage to the happy shore, To mingle with the blest. O trust the
                            righteous One who reigns above; Remember heaven's first laws are those of love, Then all
                            your fears will rest. Ballston Spa. 8ar. Co,,N.

                            promised abode. At last she's attained to that haven of rest' She has merited by her strict

                                acceptance of those views has wrought out, we think we are doing only our reasonable
                                duty. As God has blessed us in the choice manifestation of his holy spirit to see a
                                "better way" by which we may, as his children, accomplish more good upon the earth by
                                living in harmony with this revealed light, our duty is clearly set forth. The
                                simplicity of religion becomes, at once, the beauty of religion, and presents that
                                spiritual adorning which one may honorably covet, and to obtain it may with propriety
                                "sell all" and purchase the treasure, which moth and rust cannot corrupt. We need not
                                enter into controversy upon the right way or even the best way to maintain a relation
                                with God, or upon what may or may not belong to the Christian church. A satisfactory
                                solution to the point in question would be very difficult to reach if sought for in this
                                manner, as it is quite likely to open those "gates" tlirough which even the worldly-wise
                                would not elect to pass. Do we think that those are condemned who do not choose to
                                accept our religious belief? It is not our province to condemn anyone. Condemnation
                                arises from neglect of duty. If God gives us light that we may walk more uprightly, that
                                we may have a better government over our language, or that we may be better able to help
                                the erring, we must fall under the condemnation of our own conscience if we fail to
                                accept God's gift and use it to our best advantage. In this as in everything that
                                pertains to this life, we must have time to learn, righteousness does not fly tlirough
                                the air as does the pappus of the thistle in mid-summer, it is something to be wrought
                                out in the life. It was a special mission of the prophet to his people, as he would save
                                them from falling into wrong, to urge them to "learn to do well," and an essential
                                preliminary step to this commendable condition was to "cease to do evil." Those who
                                    do<pb n="111" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> not accept and live to their highest
                                possibilities as representatives of moral attainment are quite unworthy of the name of
                                man, and must be placed in that class to whom Jesus referred when he said they are
                                "condemned already." It may be very commendable to regard the advice of Paul as he says,
                                "�Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind," and "Let not him that eateth
                                despise him that eateth not. Rom., xiv. The same rule is quite as applicable to those
                                who think they have a possession a a phase of religious truth. If they are fully
                                persuaded that it is of God and that it is leading them from wrong to right, it is
                                certainly worthy of their whole interest and care. Are we saved ? A person is saved only
                                so far as he enters into the life of Christ. An essential test was given to the
                                disciples, "If ye love me ye will keep my commandments," and the willing obedience in
                                keeping these commandments, determines, at once, how much one is saved from the sins of
                                the world, from the sins of his own life, and the course that must be adopted in order
                                to secure the promised inheritance. To talk of salvation before one has even turned his
                                face toward the Kingdom of God is quite like those who cried, Lord, Lord, and for that
                                amount of outward demonstration, anticipated a reward in the Kingdom of God.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mt.

                                few months earlier, we too might have reported at that time, present home repair; of
                                debris removed, roads straightened, and other improvements about our Dwelling, made by
                                young and interested hands. But the end is not yet, and when proposed equal improvements
                                are made about our Office and its environs, we shall be happy to report. We look at the
                                notes carefully wishing to add a new item, but in vain. Our experiences are common to
                                all with the exception of no La Grippe. The physicians of Europe say it was hard to tell
                                where La Grippe ended, and where panic began. If the disease visited us it was
                                contemporaneous with its appearance in Europe, and before we knew enough to dread it.
                                Our neat wire street fence, with its black and white gates, has been standing eighteen
                                years. The maple shade trees by the roadside were set, from fifteen to thirty years ago
                                ; but the telephone poles on both sides of the street, (more useful than ornamental) are
                                of recent date. We are patiently waiting for the "Village Improvement Board" to organize
                                and run a good foot path through our beautiful village. We are fortunate in being
                                connected with the family on each side by such, but further than this we cannot report;
                                and the children coming to school must �"traipse through mud," and then lose several
                                days during a term, for the want of a decent path. The anxiety for an ice harvest has
                                been a matter of interest the winter past, but nothing has been said of the harvest of
                                pleasure anxiously waited for by the "wee small folk," who thought snow and ice came
                                because they "prayed for sliding;" and like the ice gatherers they laid aside all duties
                                possible, to attend to it as long as a slide was to be had; and were rewarded with
                                robust health and rosy cheeks. In the middle of January one of the Brethren gathered
                                some trailing arbutus, and after keeping it in water for a few days, the buds opened as
                                fresh as in May and<pb n="112" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> brought happy thoughts of an
                                eternal bloom, to the bedside of a dying Sister. Branches from a deciduous flowering
                                shrub were also broken off in mid-winter, which have not only grown leaves in water, but
                                produced a perfect bloom. When reading of "the bees in the chimney," we are reminded how
                                necessary it is, that to carry out the full purpose of our religious Community life we
                                must "Make home a hive where all beautiful feelings Shall cluster like bees and their
                                honey-dew bring, Make it a temple of holy revealings And love its bright angel with
                                shadowy wing." We are glad to see an increasing interest in the Bible questions. The
                                number of answers has increased from sixty to ninety. One important selected promise in
                                the last number we find omitted. It is indeed pleasant when the labor of life has been
                                arduous yet satisfactory, to think of rest; but if we are living, active workers
                                spiritually, we do not seek this. All we ask is a privilege to work, while so much labor
                                is needed; and imbued with this thought, six of us choose as the most comforting of our
                                Savior's promises "Ask and ye shall receive; seek and ye shall find ; knock and it shall
                                be opened unto you. * Center Famliy. We Closed our school on the 22nd inst. The teacher,
                                Elder Calvin Reed has been unwell recently from indigestion and heart difficulty. We
                                hope for his speedy recovery. Have finished our wood business it being all split, housed
                                and piled in good shape. We are now awaiting the spring season in which plowing and
                                sowing the garden and field seeds will be in order, so that we may have something by and
                                by to nourish these bodies of ours and make them strong to enable us to do good to the
                                household of faith. March No., of Manifesto contains some excellent articles, among
                                which I wish to name, Sister Anna B. Goepper's and Mary L. Wilson's, bearing on subjects
                                of vital interest to the young and rising generation, and all concerned in the
                                well-being of Society. Our young people are much interested in Sabbath day bible lessons
                                and Monday evening Lyceum. We think and hope both may be productive of good and prove a
                                blessing to all concerned. T. Kayson. April, 11. We have for several weeks been
                                preparing for spring. Have filled our woodhouse and are anxious for the weather to
                                enable us to put in crops. The roads and foot-paths through our Village have been, and
                                are in a very bad condition. We certainly should do something to make them better. We
                                have recently taken two boys from near Fortress Monroe Va., this adds a treasure of life
                                to the external and enables us to keep in a training condition. One thing I am quite
                                satisfied about; that fine houses with all modern conveniences do not make people any
                                more contented, or more willing to bear the cross. I sometimes think they may incline us
                                to be more at ease in Zion. : In passing through New York city recently, it was
                                distressing to witness the great gulf between the high and the low, the rich and the
                                poor. There must be something radically wrong in the laws and system of government that
                                permits of such extremes between man and his fellows all claiming to be the children of
                                the one Heavenly Father. Until this system is changed I have very little hope of a
                                religious revival that will fill our homes with earnest, unselfish, truthloving souls.
                                In kindest love, Daniel Offord.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hancock, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Hancock, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p">The mild winter sent the ice hunters into this section.

                                Duty is the watchword. Farm and garden work begins to press. A good garden is the gem of

                                seed is the basis of success, and we cannot afford to'j have any but the best. There is
                                more than one way of doing things, and it may be that there is a better one than ours.
                                If so, it is right to learn it. We should aim to make lets acres produce more, and with

                                to get enough of them. No matter about the fine points of hens if the egg basket shows

                                Not so this occasion, the pure presence and soulcheering ministrations of spiritual love
                                and confidence in God through these loved ones will live forever in the hearts of those
                                who have "ears to hear" and hearts to retain the seed sown. We saw and felt that their
                                staff was the rod and their crown the cross, yet we were blest and reconciled to take
                                our portion of both the rod and the cross. As a result of their co-operation, Elder H.
                                C. Blinn resigns the office of minister over the Societies of Canterbury and Enfield and
                                assumes the Eldership of our Church Family, William Briggs associate. Br. J. S. Kaime
                                succeeds Elder Henry in the Ministry. The Brethren who have carried burdens as Elders in
                                the Church, Benjamin H. Smith and Alexander Y. Cochran are appointed as Trustees of the
                                Church retaining Elder J. S. Kaime as special counselor. How satisfactory, when, at the
                                call of the "Good Shepherds," hearts and hands are for better, purer and more acceptable
                                service. In this spirit we find our faithful Brethren assuming new duties, in which they
                                are sustained and blessed* by those who have witnessed and appreciated past consecrated.
                                May our messenger, beloved Ministry, convey to you the thanks of a grateful people. Our
                                table is still spread with the choice fruits of the spirit from Brethren and Sisters of
                                Enfield, N. H., as represented by beloved Elder Abraham Perkins and Br. John Bradford.
                                Surely the Lord hath remembered us and his comfort is round about us. More than welcome
                                are such angel visitants and we trust other Gospel friends tnay come and "do likewise."
                                We thought to speak of a devotional religious service held during your absence of more

                                simply add that the maple harvest closed with the satisfactory result of over five
                                hundred gallons prepared syrup. Spring advances timidly. We would suggest that she be
                                allowed a free, liberal reign, for we covet the re-appearance of early vegetables as
                                potatoes were taken from our garden the first week in June, 1889. God bless our
                                gardeners and farmers, and hasten our crops. We prefer them ere they are made into

                                practised by our sainted predecessors, of turning everything up side down at the outset,
                                taking out windows when the weather is unsuitable, and thus inviting the grim angel by

                                New York, in their scramble for ice. While reading their pitiful story a company from
                                New York were housing from our pond, blocks of crystal coldness eighteen to twenty
                                inches thick. They finished cutting the 2nd. inst., having housed, altogether, over
                                40,000 tons. In answer to Br. Daniel's Sabbath query, we would say: If only those who
                                have so far consecrated soul and body as to be able to make their "labor worship," go
                                beyond the bounds prescribed by Moses, there would be but little danger of desecrating
                                the Sabbath. But I fear the "unprogressed humanity," who need the Sabbath to aid in
                                curbing the selfishness of their natures, would include the larger number among
                                Believers, as well as among the children of this world. Then comes the query, How far
                                Br. Daniel and the minority are obligated to set us an example of Sabbath keeping that
                                will be safe for us to follow. Winter continues to "linger in the lap of Spring." The

                                robins. The young Brethren have finished sawing the wood, notwithstanding, every other
                                day was stormy, and are now busy splitting the same. "Hands at work, and hearts to God,"
                                �I hope may ever be their motto. From our past Winter's experience, we would pray to be

                                has followed in the ways and by-ways of its three distinguished predecessors. December,

                                crossed. Through the timely suggestion of Elder Alexander, several barrels of water were
                                poured on the pond during the ice formation, which resulted in the yielding of ice to
                                    the<pb n="115" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> thickness of three and one-half to four
                                inches. The morning of the tenth ult. was the most fortunate for harvesting it. We
                                secured at that time nearly twenty tons of clear solid ice; the work had to be performed
                                rapidly, for as the sun rose higher its rays grew hotter, diminishing perceptibly the
                                work of previous days. So ended at noon (of the same day) our ice harvest for this
                                Spring. Could we have looked into the future far enough to have seen what the weather

                                for one of the days for gathering ice, bu* we did not foresee, so instead of gathering
                                ice, we gathered together and went to meeting, and ever since have been lamenting over
                                "spilled milk," or rather we should have said lamenting over thawed ice. If the Summer's
                                cold equals the Winter's heat we may find sufficient opportunity during the coming

                                garden house standing about a rod south of it and separated by a wagon road. The
                                wood-house was 90 feet long by 22;W&gt;' wide. The garden-house was 18 by 18, and
                                two stories; both frame buildings. The woodliouse stood 54 feet south of, and parallel
                                with our dwelling-house and the miracle of all miracles is, how we saved our dwelling.
                                The whole roof seemed covered with blazing cinders, and the belfry burned, and cinders
                                flew over to our Brickshop 8 rods to the North and set the roof on fire, and yet we
                                saved both buildings. The Center and North Brethren and Sisters, Ministry and all were
                                soon on the ground and for three or four hours we fought the ghastly foe and finally
                                arrested his ravages. The fire commenced about two o'clock in the morning and was
                                subdued about five A. M. Our good Brethren and Sisters from tin; Center and North,
                                remained with us, drying up inundated rooms and halls carrying in the furniture, bedding
                                &amp;c, which was carried into the street until we were all tidied up once more and
                                for their love and sympathy so practically demonstrated we say God bless them all. Also,
                                it would be wrong to fail in giving just and righteous credit to our hired friends for
                                their almost super-human exertions in saving us from temporal ruin. I can say in truth
                                if it had not been for the assistance of the hired help from our own,<pb n="116" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> and Center and North families our whole premises would have
                                gone down before the devouring element. If the property had been their own they could
                                not have exerted themselves more to save it. Finally, as Eldr'ess Adaline said to me,
                                the next morning, "We still have a beautiful' home" and that is so many fold better than
                                it might have been, that we feel able "to raise a tax on our calamity" and feel thankful
                                for this sweet Home and the blessings left to us. The damage done to our Dwelling House
                                will amount perhaps to fifty dollars fully covered by insurance. Happening to be flush
                                of water, the wet winter and spring which we complained of so much, was the very thing
                                that saved us, for all our exertions would have been futile without an immense amount of
                                that grateful element. The fire is a profound and inscrutable mystery. No one can tell
                                how it came. We planted a patch of early potatoes last Friday. The Center family are
                                planting four or five hundred young apple trees and some cherry and plum trees, to make
                                up the deficit, caused by the Cyclone. We are about to plant some cherry trees ; and
                                already have several hundred apple trees. Now dear Elder Henry this is about the best we
                                can do in the way of tidings this time. Love to all. Pray for us. O. C H.

                            We listen with astonishment and disgust to the oft-repeated story of the weak-minded
                            inebriate, clinging to the cup, when he knows that utter ruin of both soul and body is the
                            result; yet how little we think that an equally overpowering foe, is our assailant in a
                            depraved and excessively indulged appetite. When we hear the remark, "I know such food is
                            unhealthy, but I like it and must eat it," can we not class the temptation of eater and
                            drinker together, and wonder where the difference lies, when the weight of self-denial, is
                            in the balance. ' 'Let no man call himself free, who is a slave to any passion," are the

The true fear of God is
                                not to be understood in the sense of terror nor slavish droad. Good people possess the
                                true fear of God, but the bad do not. The true fear of God is perfectly consistent witli
                                true love; you can cherish this^ar, and yet love God, as did Jesus and the Apostles.
                                "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." It is the highest kind of wisdom.
                                Job's language agrees precisely with this: "Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is
                                wisdom, and to depart from evil, is understanding." The fear of the Lord is to hate
                                evil, and those who do this will have great spiritual prosperity. "Wisdom is profitable
                                to direct." 1 "With conscience clear, you have no fear." Where humility is there is
                                wisdom. Humility is a beautiful ornament, and very much you need it. Be early wise and
                                shun the pitfalls of sin. Strive for the crown unfading. In wisdom's path ever abide,
                                spotless, blameless, purified. Guard your virtue as the "pearl of great price." Only by
                                unremitting watchfulness can your innocence be protected. You often feel the greatest
                                security when you are in the greatest danger.. Watch and pray, day by day. Better
                                acknowledge your faults than try to conceal them. Improve the flying moments and your
                                lives will be filled with good deeds. What saintly characters you meet as you journey
                                along'! Walk in their footsteps. So live that others may imitate your example and be
                                virtuous. The making the best use of the talent you have, instead of wasting time in
                                sighing for what you have not, is wisdom in the highest degree. Think of the parable of
                                the talents. How frequently the beautiful lesson is veri fled. To those who improve the
                                one little talent will other talents be given. What an easy lesson to learn. "Little by

                                efforts in this line, and should you not deem them worthy of a place, we can try again,
                                and not feel hard about it. The month of March has come in with a little snow, and we

                                naturally very wicked. The lad saw the opposition to his father; he heard the many
                                quarrels in the surrounding churches discussed; he beheld the sensuality and drunkenness
                                of the town; while he noted the comparatively slight moral effects of his father's fiery
                                preaching; and naturally he came to think the world a very wicked place and the natural
                                man a very fiend. In that parsonage-home, where total depravity was used to explain all
                                actual and imaginary sins, where the comparative failure of a gloomy theology was
                                attributed to the native wickedness of the heart, what could such a lad think except
                                that men are indeed by nature vile and miserable wretches? And this gloom of Calvinism
                                which shadowed Jonathan Edward's boyhood was intensified by the prevailing mood of
                                feverish superstition, fostered by the monotony and hardships of that pioneer life and
                                by the constant fear of the Indians, whose ravages Windsor Farmers felt for many years.
                                There is no richer soil for the growth of superstitions than the constant dread of the
                                cruel redskins, under which those early settlers lived,� a fact which has been too
                                little taken into account in treating of the delusions of New England ; a fact also
                                which only those who have had experience in a similar situation can fully appreciate.
                                from "Jonathan Edwards," by Rev. Joseph II. Crooker, in New England Magazine for
                            April.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Praying and sinning will not work together..." TEIform="index"/> Praying and
