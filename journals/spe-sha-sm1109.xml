                            faith ! We know Thine ear is not heavy that it cannot hear. We come to Thee hungering in
                            spirit, and ask that our immortal spirit may be fed. In our Father's house there is bread
                            enough, and to spare. If we ask Thee for bread, Thou wilt not give us a stone; and if we ask
                            for a fish, we will not receive a serpent. We are thirsty ! Do refresh us. Give us, O Lord,
                            we pray, the waters of life everlasting ; may it flow in pure and living streams from Thy
                            heavenly fountain. We are needy. We ask in earnest. We will not let Thee go so long as we
                            have life and breath. We will offer up to Thee, before Thy throne of grace, our humble
                            oblations of prayer, and praise and thanksgiving. We thank Thee, O heavenly Father, that
                            Thou hast revealed unto us that which Thou hast kept from the rich, the great and learned of
                            this world — the way of salvation from sin. Through faith and obedience to Thy pure way, our
                            souls may reap a rich reward. Send down Thy fire from heaven upon us., that unquenchable
                            fire that will destroy, in us, every thing that is displeasing in Thy sight. May this fire
                            burn, and continue to burn in us, until we have made a full sacrifice of our own wills and
                            our own ways, then will we take pleasure in doing Thy 'will and keeping Thy pure way. We
                            have examined our own hearts, and find them much unchasteiicd and unredeemed from elements
                            opposed to Thy righteousness, and still prone to err, in Thy sight, frequently, so that when
                            we would do that which is pleasing in Thy sight, evil is often present, and we are in danger
                            of transgressing Thy laws. Save us, O save us! In the dawn of the morning, at noon-day, and
                            at even-tide, minister to us, through Thy guardian angels, Thy redeeming grace and power;
                            and though mountains sink, and valleys rise, and kingdoms to destruction go, help us to
                            stand fast, and through faith and prayer our deliverance from evil find. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            cast, so in a spiritual point of view. In construction, he possesses a soul life, inspirited
                            by and embodying all the attributes of a divine paternity, and is the macrocosm of universes
                            of mind and clarified matter in interior worlds. Spirits, when separated from material
                            bodies, still have need of souls, or spiritual bodies for their spirits to inhabit and act
                            through, that the germs of immortal life and love may find development from stage to stage,
                            unto a full and perfected fruitage. We live in an era of free speech, of platform and pulpit
                            utterances, and book making to a marked degree. Words fitly and wisely spoken are of great
                            value to those who have ears to hear and hearts to understand what Gfod's true messages bear
                            to them from higher realms of thought, whether it be truth pertaining to physical life on
                            the earth plane or to spirit life in regions beyond ; but words without wisdom, whether
                            written or oral, only serve to darken counsel and confuse the understanding; and even if
                            knowledge is increased thereby, they are like clouds without water, carried hither and
                            thither by the storm tempest, and are often harmful in results. The more we study God's laws
                            as revealed through His attributes, and feel the kindly parental spirit that is manifest in
                            all His works, the more convinced we are that He is not vengeful like mortal man, and does
                            not send judgments upon the earth vindictively; but they come as come they must, to one and
                            to all as they placed themselves in false relations with divine laws. Every man and woman
                            has a throne of judgment within their own hearts, and conscience is the judge. Before that
                            throne and that judgment every one stands approved or condemned. It is impossible to get
                            away from ene's conscious self-hood. Feelings, thoughts and deeds are an outflow from the
                            inner life, and they leave an impress upon our spiritual beings; and of such thoughts and
                            deeds character is made, good or bad, for weal or for woe. The record thus formed, every
                            individual must meet. It is God's law, and will pass equally upon all regardless of wealth
                            or position. We may be surrounded by all the luxuries that earth can produce or bestow, if
                            the heart be not right before God, and our own consciences condemn us, we cannot rest nor be
                            happy. The ever-present consciousness of wrong done to our own being, to our neighbor or
                            friend, will follow us whithersoever we go, and will be our accuser day and night. We cannot
                            forget it nor obliterate it, except by repentance. Then, how important it is that we are
                            true and sincere in all that we say and do, and present one character, one likeness at home
                            and abroad, and let that which is without be as that which is within. If we possess the
                            Christ-spirit which taught and controlled the lowly Nazarene, we shall find that true
                            religion will ever be a statf upon which we may lean for support, our bread of life and
                            sustainer on life's journey below, and will enrobe and be our diadem in our future home.
                            Deeds done or left undone is a proof of our love to God and to humanity ; for in this we
                            show how much we are willing to renounce of self for the good of others Works, not words,
                            will be the test. Justice and judgment may be deferred for a time, when wrong acts are
                            performed ; if we throw our influence on the wrong side of the scale, it is not only an
                            injury done to ourselves but also to the race. When we do right, though the acts performed
                            may be small, yet we cast our mite into the Lord's treasury, it is a good seed sown and in
                            good time it will bring forth fruit. It is not an easy task to convince the natural mind —
                            and more especially the gross and sensual mind — of truths pertaining to the immortality of
                            the human soul, and of the grand destiny that awaits those who voluntarily leave the lower
                            plane of life, its selfish loves and affections, and commence to climb the high hills of
                            endless progression. Each step that they take their spiritual vision grows brighter and
                            clearer, and the atmosphere becomes more sublimely ethereal. It remains a truth, that the
                            natural mind has no clear perception or discernment of spiritual things; they are
                            foolishness in their estimation. <pb n="195" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 195 We might
                            almost as well talk to the brute creation of astronomy or geology, and expect an intelligent
                            response, as to the sensualist of unimpassioned love in its highest sense, as being a
                            concentration of all the d ivine attributes that can be transmitted from the Infinite to the
                            finite mind or soul. It is not the Creator, but the vivifier and vitalizing principle that
                            energizes immortal spirits and weaves a web of celestial beauty for beautified forms to
                            wear. Let every thing be called by its appropriate name, and applied to its proper uses in
                            the sphere to which it belongs. There is a natural and a spiritual love ; the natural is
                            first, has its place on the generative plane, and was God-given to subserve useful purposes
                            in that order. The love existing be. tween parent and child was given for a noble purpose ;
                            it is a bond that holds them to the performance of duties while necessity lasts, and
                            although that bond is oftentimes severed in an untimely season, yet it is good in its place.
                            But when the spirit calls souls to a higher life — into the resurrection order in the Christ
                            sphere — the natural which was designed to pass away, after having performed its uses, gives
                            place to the higher spiritual love, which infills and permeates the whole being, and is the
                            beginning of eternal life in human souls. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Christian progress" TEIform="index"/>CHRISTIAN PROGRESS</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bullard, Marcia M." TEIform="persName"/>MARCIA M. BULLARD</byline><p TEIform="p"> It is a recognized fact that all nature is constantly changing and progressing. Under her
                            wise laws inertia is unknown. The human mind is incapable of inactivity ; therefore through
                            its mediumship the lightnings are chained, the elements forced to serve, and the bowels of
                            the earth give up their hidden treasures. Though man has progressed from the thatched hovel
                            to the stately mansion ; from the slow plodding to fifty miles an hour; from the beacon
                            light to the electric flash ; yet, where is the finite mind wise enough to penetrate the
                            arcana of infinite wisdom ? And where the savant so steeped in knowledge, so imbued with
                            power, or so familiar with Divine plans, that he can limit the revelations of progressive
                            truths ? Did God stamp progress on all the visibilities of nature, and form man with powers
                            to penetrate her most hidden secrets, and leave his immortal intelligences dormant ? Has He
                            so limited the comprehension of spiritual truths as to render them unprogressive, or
                            reserved unto Himself the power of conferring the boon of knowledge upon a favored few ? Is
                            truth universal, and is its revelation within the reach of every spiritual mind ? One star
                            differs from another in glory, yet all shine ; so one organization comprehends more of the
                            Divine than another ; yet all truths are of God. The agitation of thought develops mind. A
                            rap on the head set Newton to thinking. So prone is the human mind to the narrowness of
                            educational prejudices that it often requires severe raps to break the old shell of
                            conservatism and let in the new light of progressive truths. It is a wise provision of
                            nature that we differ, and a revelation of truth that we agree to differ peacefully. Here is
                            the patience of the saints, and herein is the wisdom of the saints, that difference of
                            opinions does not hinder conformity to the good, the pure and the true. Neither will it
                            impede the flow of those Divine influences that rill the soul with wisdom and love — God.
                            When revelation ceaseth, the people perish, starve, spiritually. " A famine, not of bread
                            and water, but of hearing the word of God." The soul then becomes hungry and seeks the
                            Egyptian food of fashion, popularity and ease. When the ancient Israelites tried the
                            experiment of popularity and made themselves a king, they lost their spirituality. When the
                            Quakers so far forgot their union that they wrangled about doctrine, they sank into
                            worldliness. When the Methodists tired of their plainness, and ran after the fashions of the
                            world, they no longer had spiritual gifts, nor came under the influence of the power of God
                            ; and the Shakers should profit by their example. But how shall Christians progress ? Shall
                            they be wafted about by every wind of doctrine, or, stand stiff in conservatism ? Shall they
                            run after the fashions, follies and gaie- <pb n="196" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. ties
                            of the children of this world, or shall they attire themselves in plain, neat apparel,
                            corresponding with their profession, becoming a living testimony of the Christ-life, and a
                            swift witness against the vanities of worldliness ? It is often remarked that among an array
                            of ideas, which ones shall be adopted ? But here is a criterion by which to try the spirits.
                            Every spirit that saith come up higher, bear more cross, practice more self-denial, live
                            more separate from worldly influences, is safe to follow. Should not Christians, in times of
                            prosperity, as well as in days of adversity, be known by their garb, and should they not be
                            so innocent of the sin of covetousness that they would not accumulate to themselves more
                            than forty-nine changes of raiment ? In former times Wisdom required the whole heart. How
                            can Christians devote the whole heart to God and godliness when so much of it is given to
                            the unnecessary things of this life ? For artificial wants far exceed the real needs in the
                            earth-life.

                            still remain in the valley of the Nile, Religion and Science were united in a male and
                            female priesthood. In confirmation of this view, the principal pyramid of Gizah, it is
                            affirmed, is a stone record of the solution of some of the most abstruse problems in
                            astronomy and geology, mathematically demonstrated. Admitting that such was the case, and
                            then assuming that in the modern Egypt of the time of Moses, a state of degeneracy existed
                            that the true knowledge of God had been lost and a spiritual, scientific, rational worship
                            was turned into a depraved, idolatrous worship of inanimate things, crawling serpents, or
                            four-footed beasts, we have a good reason for the introduction of a new dispensation by a
                            new Revelation that commenced in a wave of spiritualistic power which passed over the whole

                            would throw off a new swarm. If Moses was learned in all the learning of ancient Egypt, had
                            he not a fountain of knowledge to draw from somewhat analogous to the modern Christian who
                            is learned in all the learning of primitive Christianity? The kingdom of heaven is like a
                            man who draws from his treasure-house things new and old. Moses drew from the traditions and
                            stone histories of his people (being for 400 years Egyptian) a knowledge of the past, and
                            through Spiritualism (see his doings in that line) and by a Divine Revelation, he saw a
                            pattern in the mount of what his new colony should attain unto in the latter days of their
                            history. Results of a practical character were attained through these several agencies. The
                            laws went up — Egypt went down — Egypt had been the granary of other nations whence they
                            drew their supply of bread-stuffs, as America is fast becoming the world's granary in our
                            own times. Now, Egypt is a physical and moral desolation, her people a by-word, her
                            government a misnomer. In ancient Egypt women and men were equal, and united like their
                            Science and Religion In the regenerative, reconstructive process of Moses, this truth was at
                            once made prominent. No sooner were the armies of Egypt, with the chariots and horsemen
                            thereof destroyed, and Israel set free in a land all their own, than Miriam took a timbrel
                            in her hand and went forth in a religious dance — all Israel, with Moses at their head,
                            following her. Some four thousand years afterward, another woman did the same thing, when
                            celebrating deliverance from the so-called Christendom, the Egypt of her day and time, and
                            the beginning of an epoch quite as unique and divergent from the old order as was the new
                            departure of Israel from Egypt. Now, as then, the new swarm had a new Queen. As was Miriam
                            so was Ann Lee, a woman to be wondered at, as Moses and his archetype, Jesus, were men to be
                            wondered at. Both of those women went forth in the religious dance of those who make merry.
                            196 <pb n="197" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 197 In the grand march of humanity toward a
                            new millennial Era, Dispensations are the mile stones of progress from faith to faith, and
                            systems of Theology and of Science, falsely so called, are the steps they take. Naturalists
                            affirm that Queen Bees are evolved from the larva of common bees, by the superior quality of
                            food that they are fed with. Neither do they raise one single Queen, but a number of them.
                            They depend upon the survival of the fittest, for the Queens strive for the mastery until
                            only one is left to direct the hive. Thus also was the whole house of Israel fed upon
                            angels' food— Manna — until they were developed into a nation of spiritual Rulers, a royal
                            priesthood, whose province it was to govern the nations. Their God was a God of the gods of
                            other nations, who would rule the nations as with a rod of iron, her people to be kings and
                            priests unto God, over all other people who would be blessed or cursed according as they
                            blessed or cursed Jews. Yet, like the multiplicity of Queens in a hive, not all of them went
                            into the land of promise to rule who came out of Egypt, They were destroyed by successive
                            slaughters in the wilderness where their carcases fell to enrich the desert land, that
                            nothing be lost — and of all the Egyptian colony and the mixed multitude who followed them,
                            only two were counted worthy to enter the land of Canaan as leaders, and those two were men.
                            The Queen was to be evolved from the mass of humanity, by successive cycles of progress in
                            coming ages. The King of the Jews was produced by the Eastern world — the Queen by the
                            Western or Gentile nations. The Queen was two thousand years growing up out of the Gentile
                            races. In the commencement of an epoch, Science and Religion are born by Revelation, like
                            soul and body. It may be through a learned man like Moses, or an unlettered man like Jesus,
                            or an ignorant woman (ignorant scientifically) like Ann Lee. Of Jesus men asked, " Whence
                            hath this man this knowledge, seeing he knoweth not letters?" When Science is falsely
                            so-called and Religion is turned into tithes of Cumin and Avis, Theology becomes senselessly
                            ridiculous or absurd, and Science simply bewildering. They are then the old Heavens and old
                            earth which pass away with much noise and opposition, giving place to the newT heavens and
                            new earth of the coming Epoch — new Science — new religion. The new comes gradually, with
                            many reactions and backslidings. Without a living, zealous testimony, any body of religious,
                            progressive people will leven back to the weak and beggarly elements of the world--the order
                            out of which they were rising — as easily as the south would go back to slavery but for the
                            Constitutional amendment. When such a people are sustained by generation, birth-right
                            members, it is only a matter of time when they will cease to be. But if sustained by
                            conviction and conversion of souls, they will increase with the increase of God, because
                            such souls bring increase with them. It is give and take — those who shall come from the
                            east, west, north and south will come as sinners, with weeping and supplication. Let him who
                            standeth take heed lest he fall, for God is impartial and good — is spirit, knowing no man
                            after the flesh —is exacting according to the light imparted. All should so live that none
                            be cast out of the kingdom to make room for others.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Soul travel, no. 2" TEIform="index"/>SOUL TRAVEL, NO. 2</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B."

                            and oft review the journey of the soul, and in some, aye multitudes of instances it ¦will be
                            found like unto the journey of the Jews in the wilderness of sin — extremely tortuous and
                            indirect in its heavenly compass. The history of soul travel of nations, and sometimes of
                            individuals, manifests a series and succession of differing beliefs or faiths, concerning
                            the relations of man to his fellow and to his Creator, interspersed with periods of
                            skepticism. In the progress of Grecian culture we have manifest in its evolution, first the

                            speculation—sophistry. Next the inspired Socrates asserts the importance of virtue and
                            morality, thereby introducing an age of faith in a Supreme Being. But this the schools
                            subsequently converted into an age of pleasure-seeking and self-gratification. In this age
                            the soul is starving. As a normal demand in the evolution of humanity, next comes an age of
                            soul life, and spiritual philosophy mounts the stage of human progress introduced by Plato,
                            But as the pre-Socratic phase of travel ended in sophistry, so the post-Socratio ended in
                            skepticism, introduced by Pyrrho, and again was repeated the same results exhibited in
                            former times. This experience had its origin in the opinion that the intellect of man
                            possessed no criterion of truth, and as a consequence, nothing remained to man but doubting.
                            This system was carried so far by the Greek philosopher Pyrrho, as to deny that man could
                            ever know the truth of any thing. This conclusion led the Greek nation to the resolution to
                            take life as it comes, and Epicurus, at a period 342 years before Christ, introduced the age
                            and phase of what might be denominated universal abandonment to the pleasures of the senses,
                            taking no thought nor concern of consequences, but thinking that a tranquil indifference is
                            best for man. Succeeding this phase, for a short period, existed an age of probabilities,
                            introduced by one Carneades. This philosophy taught that whatever had been most perfectly
                            analyzed, examined and found to be devoid of improbability, was the most probably true.
                            Thus, as one age of speculative heterogeneous philosophies ended in sophistries, a third age
                            ended in final despair of finding truth, and induced entire skepticism. But the soul could
                            not tarry here, and now commenced the Greek age of reason, introduced by Aristotle, a
                            physician and a materialist. He insisted that all man's knowledge must be supported, if
                            supported at all, by his experience in facts ; but not finding a supply of these, his system
                            runs into speculation. Yet, as the spiritual life of man must occasionally, even in these
                            germinal stages of its progress.make demands for life, so the pendulum of progress swung
                            from epicurianism, and the phase of speculative philosophies, sophistries and materialism,
                            to stoicism taught by Geno. Thus Epicurus found his rival antagonist, and virtue and honor
                            began again to knock at the portals of human progress in soul travel and it is said, " The
                            passage from Epicurus to Greno is the passage from sensual gratification to self-control."
                            In this era of soul culture, the philosophers taught that the condition of the soul was
                            characterized by the deeds of the body and mind, but that the soul was a material substance,
                            yet, harmony between human will and universal reason constituted virtue. But the
                            developments yet manifest in hundreds or thousands of years of revolutionary progress did
                            not reach deep enough to establish a solid conviction that such a basis and degree of truth
                            was found which, when applied to man's culture, ransomed him from the power of sin, both
                            against himself, his race and his God. The philosophies of Greece and Rome which had been
                            their power and pride now died and left the nations in their weakness, blindness and
                            disappointments, seeking the jugglers, the conjurers and high priests of nature for help.
                            There was now a melancholy age of inquiry after truth, and the vast products of thought,
                            mental and spiritual—Labor of past centuries—was looked upon as an ancient, but almost
                            forgotten revelation from heaven ; men were unable to resist the pressure of decadence, "
                            Tranquillity could only be secured by passiveness." In this age, the thinking of men was do
                            ne for them by their peers, or, if they thought at all, it must be done by a prescribed
                            formulae. The moral and especially the spiritual condition of the European world was
                            antagonistic to progress either in science or religion. Now succeeded an age of intellectual
                            and spiritual decrepitude; the strong philosopher, the stoic, sinks into imbecility, and is
                            settling into a dotage, full of admiration for the past and disgust of the present; men
                            recoiled from investigation and discovery. Last scene of all that ends this phase of
                            eventful history is second childishness, or mere oblivion. " Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans <pb n="199" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 199 taste, sans every thing." Whatever
                            knowledge of truth there was in the world at this time was not the product of the present
                            thought and investigation, but the remains of an ancient and now almost forgotten revelation
                            from heaven. The mental and spiritual momentum which had accumulated for ages at once
                            appears suddenly lost. Now Christianity is introduced to man, and looks back to the
                            tutorship of Moses for wisdom as its schoolmaster thus looked to the Orient for light and
                            the revelation of truth. Now Philo, a speculative Jew, ascribes all the powers of God to the
                            Logos, or^Holy Word. Possibly from this idea arose the declaration of St. John. " In the
                            beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, the same was in the beginning with God." Now
                            arose one Apollonius of Tyana,who aided in the introduction of Orientalism. By Philostratus,
                            Philo's biographer, a parallel was introduced between this man and our Saviour. Herein is to
                            be seen what has been manifest in all ages of the world's progress, namely, the existence of
                            parallel workers in the Lord's cause, as witnesses of the true leading evolutionists of the
                            ages. . All this class of persons have ever been ascetics, and lived lives of abstemiousness
                            from pleasures and creature comforts. This man attempted a reformation of religious rites
                            and morals, denied the efficacy of sacrifices, substituting for the same simple worship and
                            pure prayer, scarce even needing words. But this man taught the transmigration of souls, as
                            a means of evolution, purification and development for future bliss. Now arose a series of
                            philosophers who figured several centuries, leading back the public mind to the Oriental
                            philosophies, sophistries and vagarious speculations. About two hundred years after Christ's
                            advent, a Neoplatonic philosophy arose in Alexandria.which continued about three hundred
                            years and conflicted with Christian principles. This was the expiring effort of Grecian
                            philosophy. Through a lapse of many centuries a trinity of basic principles, creative, or
                            governing powers had been taught and believed by nations, extending from the second to the
                            fifth, century of the Christian era ; ideas of God, or Creative Powers, modeled in a degree
                            according to time-worn Oriental philosophy, obtained a credence, and thus, the human mind
                            was wandering in all the meanderings of sophistry, as the Jews wandered in the wilderness of
                            sin before reading the promised land of Canaan. About the year 529, the Emperor Justinian
                            closed the schools of Grecian philosophy. And now preparation was made for crowning faith in
                            her stead. Now the grand attempt was to found a system which should be in harmony with a
                            feeling of religious devotion which now possessed the great Roman Empire. Here, soul-life
                            again crops out and demands sustenance, because a delusive air of piety had settled upon the
                            whole pagan world. This age of faith was the third age of Grecian development. This,
                            however, ended in necromancy and superstition. Then commenced an age of reason ; the
                            ultimate of this age resulted in pantheism, but this does not satisfy the attributes of
                            soul-life. Man now commenced to retrace his steps and subordinate his reason to his soul
                            sensniions and demands of instinctive life. He now recognizes a spirit God, but still
                            incomprehensible by man. And still the soul is pleading for a nearer relation to its Creator
                            and for light, more light, and with light, life, love and liberty. The soul's travel cannot
                            be halting here. Succeeding ages record her onward march toward her millennial goal. She is
                            not even yet privileged, after her ages of wanderings in the wilderness of sin, to see as
                            did Moses from Pisgah's top the promised land of liberty and redemption. True, her prophets
                            and visionists visited it in their trance flights, and foretold its beauties and
                            enchantments, but the masses were plodding still in darkness drear, yet seeking to satisfy
                            themselves with material treasures—delusive hopes. Soul will not, cannot tarry here. Mount

                            and to lean upon the staff of truth, and have faith in God and in His promises. Then, with
                            spiritual telescope in hand, they may look for the first signs of the coming of a new day.
                            We may not justly compare the present time to a night of spiritual darkness, but rather to
                            even-tide, when it is twilight, neither light nor dark; the closing up of one day or cycle,
                            preparatory to the commencement of a new epoch. As the shadows of evening gather around,
                            there seems to be a sort of chilliness in the spiritual atmosphere ; a torpid indifference
                            nearly allied to infidelity. The war spirit claims a large share of the attention of what
                            passes under the name of civilized, and shall we say Christian (?) nations ! Logic, debate,
                            theoretical speculations, theological disputations, and political strife, control the heads,
                            steal the heart's affections, and demand the services of the larger portion of the human
                            family at the present, irrespective of and at the expense of the inner soul-life—the
                            conscience. The churches, claiming to be the repositories of Divine truth, are so completely
                            draped in false clothing and fashionable trappings, and so wrapped in creeds and dogmas,
                            that the rays of light from the Sun of Divine revelation cannot shine within their walls to
                            warm and vivify ; and they become as dark caverns, befouled and unhealthy ; living waters
                            from the eternal fountain do not flow through them ; neither do the purifying, invigorating
                            breezes of (rod's iove and truth rind entrance ; and souls famish and die for lack of
                            spiritual sustenance. Yet there are van-guards, tilled with the spirit of progress, in the
                            scientific, moral and spiritual realm of thought and action, steadily advancing onward, and
                            they must of necessity clasp hands and march forward together, else little would be
                            accomplished. God being the source and center of created intelligences in all worlds and
                            spheres, and the prime-mover of all, inharmony in any department would block the wheels and
                            bind the course of the progressive spirit of the age. Down through the rolling cycles of
                            time that have passed God has worked through mediators best adapted to the condition of the
                            race, and has never left the earth without some witnesses who were as guidingstars, emitting
                            light to weary, way-worn travelers, altheugh many times the night seemed long, dark and
                            dreary ! And when the spirit of persecution raged relentlessly, and the oppressor's hand was
                            raised in God's name to strike a deadly blow and extirpate those witnesses, they were nerved
                            and clothed with the martyr spirit, and stood b Idly in defense of true principles as
                            revealed to them ; and cheerfully endured pain rather than accept pleasure at the expense of
                            the dictates of conscience, and convictions of right and justice* Their highest ideal and
                            conceptions of God's attributes may have fallen far short of the knowledge, wisdom and grace
                            of the present age ; yet they will be looked upon by incoming generations with admiration,
                            and be honored for their spirit of self-sacrifice and devotion to principle, and their
                            willingness to suffer rather than to bow to the exactions, and obey the behests of
                            tyrannical rulers and ambitious leaders, civil or ecclesiastical, or both powers combined.
                            When we contemplate and take cognizance of the great political struggles and hardfought
                            battles for place and power, through craft and cunning device, by designing men in the
                            earth-sphere, the question would arise how far the same spirit will extend into the unknown
                            and boundless regions of the uuseen world ? Death will not change the desires of human
                            heart, nor quench the unhallowed fires that burn there, nor destroy the motives which prompt
                            to action and to satiate their cupidity. America at her present time counts her tens of
                            thousands and millions of inhabitants—through dishonest means, are drawing support from the
                            public treasury, striving to enact new laws to strengthen them in pursuit of unjust claims
                            and love of dominion. That a better and higher code of civil jurisprudence is needed, no one
                            will dispute ; <pb n="201" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. 201 the progressive spirit of

                            of true liberty will not rest until the banner of freedom waves in triumph over all American
                            citizens, high and low. As our thoughts reach out into the boundless realms of immortal
                            existence, where are gathered innumerable hosts of nations, kindreds and tongues, we marvel
                            and query concerning the vast empire, its laws and government, and how the wheels are kept
                            moving. If our world is a reflex of the inner worlds or spheres, then may we conclude that
                            congresses, higher and lower tribunals, resembling those in our own country through which we
                            are now journeying, exist there, only perhaps called by different names. We read about
                            altars and white thrones in that land ! We could wish there were none but white thrones on
                            our earth, where Justice, clad in robes of Love and Mercy, might sway the scepter.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Marriage of the lamb and bride" TEIform="index"/>THE MARRIAGE OF THE LAMB AND BRIDE</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B." TEIform="persName"/>GILES B. AVERY</byline><p TEIform="p">Let us consider how this subject is to be understood : St. John denominated Jesus, " The Lamb
                            of God," " Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world." John i, 27. "
                            Again, the next day after, John stood and two of his disciples, and looking upon Jesus as He
                            walked, he saith,' Behold the Lamb of God,' " John i, 35 and 36. To the understanding of
                            every enlightened biblical reader and true follower of Christ Jesus, in His anointed
                            capacity as Christ, manifested in the male order, was the Lamb of the marriage twain
                            denominated in these Scriptures, Lamb and Bride." And if the Lamb recognized in Scripture as
                            the commissioned agency " to take away the sins of the world," is to be understood in any
                            sense other than directly personal, it can possibly be in no other than the church of
                            Christ's first appearing. How the Law, which made nothing perfect, can be a " Lamb of God to
                            take away the sins of the world," may be a question for even the gods to settle, if they
                            can. Paul truly says, " For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the
                            flesh, God, sending His own Son (the Bridegroom) in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for
                            sin, condemned sin in the flesh." Rom. viii, 3. . Again Paul truly says, " For there is
                            verily a disannulling of the commandment going before," (which is the Law) " for the
                            weakness and unprofitableness thereof. Rom. xvii, 18. Now the work of the Bridegroom, and
                            His dispensation is to beget the children of God, in the gospel life of the regeneration,
                            which is a spiritual, not a fleshly and carnal creation. To any enlightened soul it must
                            appear very difficult for that which is " weak through the flesh," " disannulled because of
                            its weakness and unprofitableness" and " a law of a carnal commandment." Heb. xvii, 16. To
                            perform the work of the Bridegroom, the Christ, in begetting souls " after the power of an
                            endless life." Heb. xvii, 15 and 16. How then can it be possible for such a Law to be a
                            bridegroom, and wedded to the Heavenly Bride ? The faithful flock of Christ's second
                            appearing will not lose sight of the simple fact that Christ, manifest through Father Jesus
                            (as He became by baptism), and the church of that dispensation, was the Heavenly Bridegroom
                            — the Vicegerent Father of the New Creation. A spiritual organization, to introduce which
                            the Law was but a school-master, not a Bridegroom ! Nor will they lose sight of the equally
                            important fact that Christ, manifest through Mother Aim, after she received her spiritual
                            baptism, was the Heavenly Bride, and the church of this latter day dispensation of Christ,
                            in the second appearing, still manifests the same Heavenly Bride character — the Vicegerent
                            Mother of the New Creation " Jerusalem which is above, is free, which is the mother of us
                            all." " For it is written, ' Rejoice thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry thou
                            that travelest not ; for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an
                            husband," (after the Law <pb n="202" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> 202 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. of a carnal
                            commandment). Gal. iv, 26 and 27. This " above" is truly entirely above the Jewish law
                            sphere, a carnal commandment for carnal men, and which to them, and to sucJi only, was
                            necessarily applicable. The righteousness of generation, in its most perfect state, is,
                            nevertheless, not an elementary righteousness of the work of the Heavenly Bridegroom a'nd
                            Bride, and cannot, therefore, be wedded to the Gospel of Christ in any sense. It must,
                            therefore, be protested that the " marriage of the Lamb and Bride " does not mean an " union
                            of the Law and Gospel." With honest souls, begotten of the Christ the Bridegroom, and born
                            of the Christ Bride (a spiritual creation), there cannot be in exercise any personal strife
                            and ambition to be greatest ; nor can there be contention and ill-feeling; while each one,
                            in efforts to set forth the truths of the Gospel of Christ, will feel himself or herself a
                            learner forever, as we are all only children in the school of Christ. New Lebanon, N.

                                flattering lips. Of a truth, the best and most acceptable worship of God, or the
                                Christ-spirit, is in living a thorough Christian life. Lip service, unaccompanied by
                                living demonstrations of individuals, which compare well with the life of Christ, is not
                                acceptable praise. Let us compare our lives and our professed Christianity with the same
                                of Jesus. Are we given up to be the subjects of similar selfdenials ? Have we the
                                purity, the peace, the unselfishness and extensive love of humanity that Jesus possessed
                                ? Have we the life and testimony against war, family quarrels, slander and unfriendly
                                gossipings that He had ? Does our relinquishment of family ties, worldly attachments,
                                sexually, socially and politically equal the same of the Master ? Does our love for our
                                fellow men and women forbid in us, as in Jesus, the hoarding of selfish possessions, at
                                the expense of those less fortunately organized? Do we become poor with the poor,

                                noble pattern, a perfect examplerin Christian life, Jesus sustained through life the
                                condition of the Celibate for the kingdom of heaven's sake ; and then turns to His
                                would-be disciples and explicitly says: " Who so is able, let his Christianity in this
                                compare with mine !" And the large multitudes of professedly Christian people prefer to
                                think they are not able, and decline to draw comparisons. Where is the church, adoring
                                the Christ career, that would hold a similar admiration of Jesus, had He married, reared
                                a family, accumulated personal wealth, mounted to a kingship, led warring hosts in
                                battle, and been the popular hero of the worldly, pleasure-seeking rabble ? Not one, and
                                if for His unworldly distinctions, He is our acceptable Lord, Master and Example, how
                                far, in these same distinctions, does our Christianity demand the following Him ? The
                                bright and beautiful Christian life, lived by Jesus, and taught in his testimony, is the
                                only true life-line for us, and by which to compare our Christian profession. Would we
                                evade the living issue of the Christian profession, and cling to the deathly creeds
                                thatbearno comparison to Jesus' life ? Let the subject be brought up between "My soul

                                this world, Selfishness. Deprived of this monster, gloom disappears, hatred, envy,
                                jealousy and all evils leading to murder vanish away ; and the glorious day of God is
                                ushered in. With selfishness denied, we'll have no need of the wide phylactery, the
                                stubborn fast, nor stated prayers, we'll judge the tree by what it bears. The whole sin
                                of the world is comprehended by the term Selfishness. The only hindrance to a genuine
                                religious revival that would be eternal in length and consequences is found bounded by
                                the same term. The great gulf between God and the soul is measured by selfishness ;
                                while the approach to heaven on earth, or in future worlds, is only made possible by the
                                practice of its opposite. Ungodliness and worldly lusts define selfishness : while rigid
                                self-denial to this, acts as a dispelling influence upon those. There can be no
                                selfishness in the Heaven of Christ. There may be <pb n="204" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 204 THE SHAKER
                                MANIFESTO. and probably is a godly emulation there ; but this emulation will be a strife
                                as to who can be the most unselfish. All the taught self-denials of Christ were directed
                                against this giant enemy to human peace and happiness. The love of our neighbor measures
                                the honor we have for G-od, and in the degree we are selfish, we hate our brother and
                                dishonor our Maker. The worship of Grod then does not consist in prayer-making nor in
                                psalm-singing, so much as living in the happifying, religious element of unselfishness.
                                Does any one ask how best to gain this element? Follow Christ. "If any one would be a
                                disciple " of the most unselfish, happiest individual known to history, " let him deny
                                himself" just as Jesus did, take up the same crosses He did, and "follow Him." Let
                                everyone, in every possible way, fight this giant enemy of humanity, and begin the fight
                                in his own breast, and then will the age be one of glorious religious elements and the
                                fruits of peace. ^r</p></div3><div3 type="editorial" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Notice" TEIform="index"/>Notice</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Editor" TEIform="persName"/></byline><p TEIform="p">. — Will those yet in arrears for The Manifesto kindly and promptly " step up to the

                                proper respect, coming from a sympathizing heart. The "old limpy" in this case was none
                                less than our old time friend, Erastus Corning—a noble millionnaire. Let us use all

                                conductor to an aged, plainly-dressed lame man, standing on the platform, waiting for
                                the signal to depart; " get aboard, old limpy, or you'll be left." At the signal, the
                                old gentleman quietly stepped aboard and took a seat by himself. When the conductor, in
                                taking up the tickets, came to him, and demanded his fare, he replied : " I do not pay
                                fare on this road." " Then I will put you off at the next station." The conductor passed
                                on, and a passenger, who had seen the transaction, said to him : " Did you know that old
                                gentleman ? " " No, I did not." " Well, it is Mr.-----, the president of this road." The
                                conductor changed color, and bit his lips, but went on and finished taking up tickets.
                                As soon as he had done he returned to " old limpy," and said : " Sir, I resign my

The trains trundled over it. Carts and cabs and wagons rumbled
                                under it. Men and women, and children too, more than ever he counted, went past that
                                arch to the station. And just at the corner, on the flag-stones under the arch, stood
                                Kif, ready to black anybody's boots. Blacking boots is not easy. Not many boys and girls
                                like the job. Kif did not like it at first. Only, you see, he had to do it. Eh ! What

                                should any boy be ashamed to help make some of those feet nice ? Any way, that happened
                                to be the bit of work that Kif Diamond had to do in this world. And I want to tell you
                                how he did it, and what came of it. At first, I said, Kif was not fond of the work. He
                                was only ten years old, remember. Play was just as sweet to him as to you; and he liked
                                it better than work. But his father was away at sea these years, and his mother had got
                                hurt and had to keep at home. So there was nothing for it but that Kif must work. One
                                morning Kif was at his corner early. He didn't know that there had been a great meeting
                                in the great hall of the town the night before. He was just standing looking at the old
                                church clock, watching a sparrow trying to perch on one of the golden figures, when
                                Kif's eye caught sight of a tall stranger looking at the church and walking along
                                slowly. " Shine, sir ?" The stranger started. He was almost frightened. He didn't know
                                there was a boy so near. But when the tall gentleman turned round, he found Kif ready
                                with his box and blacking-pot, and a brush in each hand, saying : " Shine, sir ?" The
                                gentleman looked down at Kif and smiled. He was on his knees already. He was ready to
                                begin. The gentleman's boots had not been cleaned that morning, or else he had soiled
                                them again. So, almost before he thought of it, Kif was brushing away at the boots of
                                the tall stranger. And the gentleman had to lean his back against the wall of the arch ;
                                and he held his foot up on the shoe-black's box, and began to talk to Kif quite
                                friendly. They talked a long time. " There's your penny, see," said the gentlemen, just
                                as he was going. Kif smiled, but didn't take it. " It's twopence before eight, sir, he
                                said. "Oh!" laughed the gentleman, "is that it ? Well, Kif, you are a boy. There you are
                                now ; don't forget what I told you." And the gentleman walked away, seeming happy that
                                he had seen Kif. And Kif would have been happier still had he known that he had just
                                been speaking to one of the greatest men in England. What did that great man say to Kif
                                Diamond 1 I cannot tell. But this I know, that Kif began to black boots better than
                                ever, after that. He didn't use to mind much if he could just daub on the blacking, and
                                rub one or two shiny places on the tops of the boots, and get his penny. Kif had got a
                                new idea into his busy head now. He would never " cat-lick " a boot again. He would do
                                all around the heels and the edges, and the creases and the niches. No matter how dirty,
                                no matter how dull the boots and shoes were, Kif set himself to make them shine, clean,
                                bright, or, as he called it, "boot-i-ful." I wonder whatever it could be that the great
                                man whispered to Kif. Was it something about doing his work well ? Did he tell him not
                                to be ashamed of it ? Perhaps he told Kif that everybody should work. Perhaps he
                                whispered to him that Prime Ministers have to work. Perhaps he showed Kif how the great
                                round world is like a clock; it must go. And there are little wheels and large wheels in
                                it, and there are springs and chains and weights in it; and, unless all these work, the
                                clock won't go, the world will stop. I wonder did he tell Kif that Jesus was once a
                                carpenter, and how He came to be after that the Master and the Christ. How He worked,
                                and how the great God is always working. I dare say he was sure to tell Kif to black
                                boots well ; and Kif Diamond began to be merry at his work, after that. His work was not
                                a bit easier, but he sometimes sang to it, and he sometimes whistled to it. And see! I
                                want to tell you a secret. This, when Kif whistled over his work, he always whistled
                                quick tunes. Do you know why ? Because it seemed to put oil into his elbows and music
                                into his muscles. Slow tunes made him work slow. Quick tunes made him work quick.
                                Another good thing he did was this : he always kept his own shoes clean and bright. So,
                                when any one was coming down the station steps into town, Kif would be there at his
                                corner, a brush in each hand; and <pb n="207" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKEE MANIFESTO. with one
                                hand he would point down at his own bright shoes, and with the other he would point down
                                at the traveler's dull, soiled boots, and Kif would say : "Shine, sir?" And who could
                                help but have his boots blacked by such a boy. " Kif," said I one day, " what's the
                                grandest word you know ? " And he out with it at once : " Shine." In front of a big
                                factory. There was a girl just coming out of it one evening. She shook her shawl and
                                threw it round her shoulders, then she stood outside, waiting for some one else. It was
                                a boot and shoe factory, and I think the girl's work was to stitch that pretty flowering
                                on the toes of the boots. Another girl came running out, and she said : " Nell, have you
                                heard the news? " "No ; what?" asked Nell. " Why, our master's going to be made mayor of
                                the town; and he'll be magistrate, and have a grand robe on him, and a gold chain, and
                                be called ' Your Worship,' and I don't know what. Just fancy! " And Nancy's eyes danced
                                full of pleasure while she told all this to Nell. Indeed, both girls looked well
                                pleased. They seemed to straighten themselves up quite proudly. And, as they walked down
                                the street toward home together, they couldn't help swaggering, and they couldn't help
                                talking about it. " And see," said Nell, " they say that when he come here first he
                                hadn't never a penny in his pocket." " But he's lots of money now," broke in Nancy. "
                                Yes," replied Nell. "Look at his big house he built, beside the factory. Did you ever
                                see master's mother ? " " His mother ? No ! You mean his wife," exclaimed Nancy. " No,"
                                said Nell, " I mean his old mother. She's lame. She came to church one Sunday, and the
                                master's boys, all six of 'em, were wanting to take a hand at helping her. You would
                                have laughed. Only I cried," whispered Nell, for she had a tender heart, " to see them
                                all loving her so. But they say the boys never saw their grandfather. He never came back
                                from sea." "Do you remember," said Nancy, " the Christmas supper master gave us ? Wasn't
                                it jolly? And what he told us about that little boy. See, I believe it was him. And he
                                makes his boys work now. And he won't have any work done bad. And he gives away such
                                money ! And he does like to talk to children ; and everybody likes him." And so the two
                                separated. And it was as they said. Their good master was chosen mayor of the town. All
                                men of all sorts did him honor. Working-men honored him, too, for he was himself a
                                worker. Some great man had spoken a good word to him once when he was a boy. He never
                                forgot it. He did three things, he worked, and learned, and saved. Shall I tell you who
                                he was ? Did you ever hear of Kif, the shoeblack ? It is the same boy. " For men are
                                only boys grown tall, And hearts don't change much, after all." And I wonder if, when
                                Christopher Diamond, Esq., sat in the splendid chair, and they robed him in splendid
                                robes, and adorned him with a great gold chain, and he rode in a splendid carriage, and
                                the people cheered, and the great men bowed to him, and " His Worship " was to have
                                spoken and he couldn't find the words, I wonder which place he liked best: under the
                                arch, cleaning shoes, or in that grand seat of honor, governing a town ? Boys, which
                                would you choose ? The last ! But, mark you, the first must come before the last. How
                                did Kif Diamond come to be mayor ? By blacking boots well. By doing his work well. And
                                that's the secret. Try it! Say to your little self that, wherever you be, your motto
                                shall be : " Shine 1" — Christian Register. Let no one ever repudiate an honest effort,
                                nor ever ask to have the truth veiled behind ambiguous sentences of honeyed words,

He was one
                                        of the early settlers of Grafton, Lorain county, O He was, by profession, a
                                        Methodist classleader, and served in this capacity with marked zeal. On the loth
                                        of March, 1825, he united with the Shakers in Warrensville, and became an active
                                        member of that community. His experience in pioneer life, and his avoidance of
                                        marriage while a Methodist, seemed to prepare him peculiarly to become a Shaker.
                                        He was soon appointed farm-deacon, and filled that place for about three years.
                                        When the church was organized he was appointed one of the trustees. In 1838 he
                                        was appointed first elder in the center family, and in 1858 became first in the
                                        ministry. In 1862 he was again appointed first elder. In all these capacities he
                                        served with a fidelity which won for him universal esteem. He abounded in good
                                        works. In the midst of all his official duties he found much time for the
                                        discharge of those gentler acts of kindness which so adorn a noble manhood. His
                                        death occurring on Friday, August 5th, was the consummation of a long,
                                        well-spent, and fruitful life. The Shaker community of North Union will not soon
                                        forget the eloquent example of this life of fifty-six years spent in
                                        consecration to their faith, and the service of mankind.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Cleveland herald" TEIform="index"/></bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The last, best fruit, which comes late to perfection..."

To read it would be the best thing a searcher for scientific,
                                religious truth can do. If facts and logic will lead him or her to conclusions upon
                                which the mind can rest, as firmly as their physical feet can rest upon a granite rock,
                                it will be done. First. That from nothing nothing can come. Secondly. That what is,
                                apparently, is but the image or shadow of what exists in reality. Thirdly That God is an
                                entity—an organized, substantial being, male and female, as really as are any pair of
                                human beings, whether in or out of the body. There " is an incorporeal, substantial
                                soul, within the human form," and " all material forms are an affluence of God, or
                                immediately the result of a succession of gradual condensations (I add, or
                                materializations) from the more attenuated conditions of physical substance ; these,
                                from the still rarer elements and forces of substantial nature, and these, finally,
                                including the vital and mental forces of the organic world, from the Omnipresent,
                                substantial entity of the Deity himself." If that be unorthodox, let the orthodox make
                                the most of it. It is fact and logic— science, truly so called, and religion in reality.
                                But this is a large volume of 523 pages. Its table of contents is a marvel. Darwinism is
                                disposed of; materialism is turned against itself; the popular theory of sound is shown
                                to be as illusory as popular theology. The existence of a Supreme, intelligent Being
                                mathematically demonstrated. Huxley's lectures in New York turned against Darwin, Darwin
                                against Haeckel, and all against each other; spiritualism made a necessity by all forms
                                of human life and physical organisms. But what can I say ? The best way to review this
                                book is to quote from it, and when you begin to quote you don't know where to stop. Just
                                read : " This view of God and man gives the Theist something; in the former, worthy of

                                can be predicated. To suppose that the human soul is bodi" less, formless and organless,
                                is about as unsatisfactory as to try to conceive the immortality of a rubber balloon.
                                How can an immortality of man worth hoping for be predicated, if the soul is not to see,
                                feel, hear, taste and smell ? And if these powers, even in our most exalted conception
                                of them, are to exist in the eternal state of man, he must possess the essential organs
                                by which such faculties are to be exercised and enjoyed; and this implies that the soul,
                                which is ko vaguely talked about as a principle, destiued to immortality, is, in
                                reality, the inner man, the internal, incorporeal organism as perfect in form as the
                                exterior structure, and alone the entity which animates our physical bodies. The view,
                                thus imperfectly taken, of the soul of man is applicable also to God Himself, with His
                                infinitely extended attributes." Address: Hall &amp; Co., Publishers, New York

                                Attendance does not always indicate the true strength of a church. There are churches in

                                thus restoring the trees to a healthy condition and improving the quality of the fruit.
                                As a wash for mossy trees he gives the following: Heat an ounce of sal-soda to redness
                                in an iron pot and dissolve it in one gallon of water, and while warm apply it to the
                                trunk. After one application the moss and old bark will drop off and the trunk will be
                                quite smooth. All soils are improved by mixing. The physical properties of the soil have
                                an important influence upon its average fertility. The admixture of pure sand with clay
                                soil produces an alteration which is often beneficial, and which is almost wholly
                                mechanical. The sand opens the pores of the clay and makes it more permeable to the
                            air.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Request by a young sister under infirmity" TEIform="index"/>REQUEST BY A YOUNG SISTER UNDER

                                    the changing shore of time ; The World was singing a giddy song, And the Church a
                                    hymn sublime. " Come give me your hand," cried the merry World, " And walk with me
                                    this way ;" But the good Church hid her snowy hands And solemnly answered, " Nay— I
                                    will not give you my hand at all, And I will not walk with you ; Your way is the way
                                    to endless death ; Your words are all untrue." " Nay, walk with me a little space,"
                                    Said the world, with a kindly air ; "The road I walk is a pleasant road, And the sun
                                    shines always there ; Your path is thorny, and rough and rude, And mine is broad and
                                    plain ; My road is paved with flowers and dews, And yours with tears and pain ; The
                                    sky above me is always blue ; No want, no toil I know, The sky above you is always
                                    dark; Your lot is a lot of woe, My path, you see, is a broad, fair one, And my gate
                                    is high and wide; There is room enough for you and me To travel side by side." Half
                                    shyly the Church approached the World, And gave him her hand of snow ; The old World
                                    grasped it, and walked along, Saying, in accents low, " Your dress is too simple to
                                    please my taste ; I will give you pearls to wear, Rich velvets and silks for your
                                    graceful form, And diamonds to deck your hair." The Church looked down at her plain
                                    white robes, And then at the dazzling World, And blushed as she saw his handsome lip
                                    With a smile contemptuously curled. " I will change my dress for a costlier one,"
                                    Said the Church, with a smile of grace ; Then her pure white garments drifted away,
                                    And the World gave in their place Beautiful satins and shining silks, And roses and
                                    gems, and pearls ; And over her forehead her bright hair fell, Crisped in a thousand
                                    curls. "Your house is too plain," said the proud old World ; " I'll build you one
                                    like mine ; Carpets from Brussels, and curtains of lace, And furniture ever so
                                    fine." So he built her a costly and beautiful house. Splendid it was to behold ; Her
                                    sons and beautiful daughters dwelt there, Gleaming in purple and gold ; And fairs
                                    and shows in the halls were held, And the World and his children were there, And
                                    laughter, and music, and feasts were heard In the place that was meant for prayer.
                                    She had cushioned pews for the rich and great, To sit in their pomp and pride ;
                                    While the poor folks, clad in their shabby suits, Sat meekly down outside. The Angel
                                    of Mercy flew over the Church, And whispered," I know thy sin ;" Then the Church
                                    looked back with a sigh, and longed To gather her children in ; But some were off at
                                    the midnight ball, And some were off at the play, And some were drinking in gay
                                    saloons, So she quietly went her way. Then the sly old World gallantly said to her,
                                    " Your children mean no harm, Merely indulging in innocent sports ;"_ So she leaned
                                    on his proffered arm, And smiled, and chatted, and gathered flowers, As she walked
                                    along with the World; While millions and millions of deathless souls To the horrible
                                    gulf were hurled. " Your preachers are all too old and plain," Said the gay World
                                    with a sneer ; ¦** They frighten my children with dreadful tales, Which I like not
                                    for them to hear. They talk of brimstone, and fire, and pain, And the horrors of
                                    endless night; They talk of a place that should not be Mentioned to ears polite. I
                                    will send you some of the better stamp, Brilliant, and gay, and fast, Who will tell
                                    them that people may live as they list, And go to heaven at last. The Father is
                                    merciful, great and good, Tender, and true, and kind ; Do you think he would take
                                    one child to heaven, And leave the rest behind ? " So he filled her house with gay
                                    divines, Gifted, and great, and learned ; And the plain old men who preached the
                                    cross Were out of the pulpits turned. " You give too much to the poor,'" said the
                                    World, " Far more than you ought to do; If the poor need shelter, and food, and
                                    clothes, Why need it trouble you ? Go take your money and buy rich robes, <pb n="212" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> 212 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. And horses and carriages fine, And
                                    pearls, and jewels, and dainty food, And the rarest and costliest wine ; My children
                                    they dote on such things, And if you their love would win, You must do as they do,
                                    and walk in the ways That they are walking in." Then the.Church held tightly the
                                    string oi her purse, And gracefully lowered her head, And simpered, "I've given too
                                    much away I'll do, sir, as you have said." So the poor were turned from her door in
                                    scorn, And she heard not the orphan's cry; And she drew her beautiful robes aside,
                                    As the widows went weeping by ; And the sons of the World and the sons of the Church
                                    Walked closely hand and heart, And only the Master who knoweth all Can tell the two
                                    apart. Then the Church sat down at her ease and said, " I am rich, and in goods
                                    increased ; I have need of nothing, and naught to do But to laugh, and dance, and
                                    feast." And the sly World heard her and laughed in his sleeve, And mockingly said
                                    aside, "The Church is fallen, the beautiful Church, And her shame is her boast and
                                    pride." The angel drew near to the mercy-seat, And whispered in sighs her name, And
                                    the saints their anthems of rapture hushed, And covered their heads with shame ; And
                                    a voice came down through the hush of heaven From Him who sat on the throne, " I
                                    know thy works, and how thou hast said, ' I am rich ;' and hast not known That thou
                                    art naked, poor and blind, And wretched before my face, Therefore, from my presence

                            communication, that we think it will appear to all as an acceptable gift, properly
                            appropriated by our columns. Ed.] There are many things that I would like to say to the
                            inhabitants of earth — especially to the loving brothers and sisters who in private and
                            public assemblies name by name. Let me admonish them to persevere— to patience under
                            trials—to continue constant in prayer, and to give little heed to familiar spirits, who
                            while really of the world stand behind a screen and delight in much speaking. Though
                            spirits, their Spirit-world is the earth plane of existence. And any communication
                            purporting to come from me that would loosen moral obligations or lower the standard of
                            personal purity is from the adversary. The beloved apostle well said, " Believe not every
                            spirit; but try the spirits." Permit me to further say, what has been often said, yet too
                            little heeded by the world, that freedom 'is the natural result of virtue, love and harmony,
                            guided and controlled by wisdom. All true finite freedom is withiK the limits of Divine law
                            and obedience to law must precede the ripening of the soul. God is infinitely free. That
                            which worldly men call freedom, meaning the full exercise of the propensities without
                            restraint, is the deepest and most deadening form of slavery. Such putrid waters drown the
                            soul, and such teachings drag it to perdition. Envy, jealousy, lust and kindred passions are
                            not to be modified and regulated, as some blind teachers have taught; they are to be
                            extirpated, annihilated! Freedom, based upon obedience, practical goodliness, with the
                            exercise of prayer, brings the soul into communion with the Christ-angels. And these often
                            draw near to you in your devotions, and shed upon you their sweet and heavenly influences.

                            surely bring golden sheaves to Zion. And then the fullness of time having come, shall the

                            understanding; worship, in song and speech, in march and dance, with enthusiasm. Shake away
                            all vain worldliness, and struggle to conquer the apathy and vile selfishness of yourselves,
                            strive to be living stones of crystal whiteness in the temple of God, and fruitful branches

                            the law and the testimony — walk humbly, trustingly by the still waters — yea, walk and
                            worship in the heart of holiness — walk too, in the waves of simplicity, and keep the faith,

                            throwing off many pounds of leaves each year, but itself weighing several tons. If an orange
                            twig is put in a large box of earth, and that earth is weighed, when the twig becomes a
                            tree, bearing luscious fruit, there will be very nearly the same amount of earth. From
                            careful experiments made by different scientific men, it is an ascertained fact that a very
                            large part of the growth of a tree is derived from the sun, from the air, and from the
                            water, and very little from the earth ; and, notably, all vegetation becomes sickly, unless
                            it is freely exposed to the sunshine. Wood and coal are but condensed sunshine, which
                            contains three important elements, equally essential to both vegetable and animal
                            life—magnesia, lime and iron. It is the iron in the blood which gives the durability
                            necessary to bodily vigor, while the magnesia is important to many of the tissues. True it
                            is, that the more persons are out of doors, the more healthy, the more vigorous they are,
                            and the longer will they live. Every human being ought to have an hour or two of sunshine at
                            noon in winter, and in the early forenoon in summer. — Hall's Medial Adviser.</p></div2><pb n="214" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Love realm" TEIform="index"/>THE LOVE REALM</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Collins, Elvah F."

                            die. Where the cold breath of hatred, malice and envy, Debarred from an entrance are doomed
                            to pass by; There, every thing smiles in an eternal summer, As cycles and seons forever roll
                            on, Defaced not by history of carnage and bloodshed, That blackened the pages of time that
                            is gone. Let us live in the love realm ! Where brotherly kindness Is painting Samaritan
                            deeds on the walls, Of temples held sacred to kindly affection, Where never a frown or an
                            erring one falls. O! the beautiful love realm, where men walk as angels, Whose words in a
                            language all silent, express The wealth of their souls—forgiving, forgetting, Sung to the
                            strain "God is Love"—He doth bless! Let us live in the love realm ! nor fold to our bosoms
                            This heaven-born treasure, to dwell there alone; But give it expansion in hearts warm and
                            tender, Give fruit unto others from seed God has sown. Aye! the sweets of the love realm are
                            ever in waiting For those who are ling'ring just outside the vale, Who feel many longings to
                            join with the ransomed, Yet cling to the treasures that constantly fail. Let us live in the
                            love realm ! Behold, in all nature The grasses and flowers in unison blend! 'Tis only in
                            animal life that we witness, The elements that to contention would tend ; As the spirit
                            expands in the knowledge of wisdom, The few petty trials of earth-life seem vain, And
                            grievances that unto us once were heavy, Our memories then would no longer retain. If we
                            live in the love realm, our fingers with magic Will touch the right chord on the harp of the
                            soul, And waken response in a tone, of life better Than in spheres where the spirit of
                            tumult controls ! And the cross that before us seemed stern and forbidding, With budlets and
                            blossoms of joy will be twined, And life once disconsolate, hopeless and dreary, Grow bright
                            as the sky full of clouds silver-lined. Let us live in the love realm ! the golden rule
                            heeding, To do unto others as we'd be done by, And scatter the clouds that o'er us are
                            pending, As the north wind drives southward, the storm gath'ring nigh. Our home may be
                            heaven, and life, one of pleasure, By giving a kind word or smile as we go, And thus bear
                            aloft Love's beautiful banner To wave in the triumph of victory below.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sorrows of genius" TEIform="index"/>THE SORROWS OF GENIUS</head><p TEIform="p">Homer was a beggar.

                                    drinking, yet this is not always true, as in the cases of Dickens and Bayard Taylor
                                    ; but these men died long before their time. Careful living would, without doubt,
                                    have enabled them to extend their lives many years, and to give much riper
                                    productions to the world. Sir Isaac Newton was a close student, and lived to be more
                                    than four-score years of age. He used to say that he could not think clearly until
                                    more than five hours had elapsed after a meal. The most eminent men of our time are
                                    very careful livers. A. T. Stewart, the merchant prince of America, lived frugally,
                                    and Jay Gould, the richest man on the continent to-day, is said to be the most
                                    abstemious. Commodore Vanderbilt was exemplary in this respect, as were Horace
                                    Greeley, Abraham Lincoln, Solon P. Chase, Edward Everett and John C. Calhoun. It is
                                    said that when Henry Ward Beecher expects to make an unusual effort in public, he
                                    postpones a meal, if it comes near the hour for his lecture, and waits until he is
                                    rested afterward before he eats any thing; and he has every prospect of being a hale
                                    old man. We might mention Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bronson Alcott, who are among the
                                    wisest men of their time, and whose wisdom takes in the very best sense. People
                                    cannot eat their loaf and keep it at the same time. They cannot squander their vital
                                    force in high living and continue to give their best effort to the world. A man
                                    ought to be able to write his best after he is seventy, for then he has had
                                    experience enough to show him how to begin to live. When we think of such men as
                                    Humboldt, Longfellow, and Whittier doing their best work in the evening of their
                                    lives, we feel conscious of a lack in the abridged existence of Dickens, Poe and
                                    Byron. We feel satisfied when men die of old age ; but mourning memory lingers long
                                    at the grave of genius, cut down by dissipation before its time.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Walter's health journal" TEIform="index"/>Walter's Health Journal.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="People's intentions can only be decided by their conduct" TEIform="index"/>People's intentions can only be decided by their conduct

                            discover better the errors of others' speech and, at the same time, conceal his own. We clip
                            from an exchange the following gem on the same subject: " Have you learned the secret of
                            silence ? Silence under injuries, when speech would breed wrath; amid discouragement when it
                            would spread fear? Silence through welldoing, which speech would mar by telling ; after
                            successes, to trumpet which were to fail ? There are times enough for speech ; times when
                            silence is false, cowardly, treacherous. To know when to be silent, and how to be silent,
                            neither defiantly nor artfully, but gently, truly and strongly ; a silence of the mouth
                            uncontradicted by look of the face or thought of the heart; this is one of the finest of the
                            fine arts, one of the most beautiful of the beauties of holiness. ' He shall not strive nor
                            cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.'

This proposition holds good as a general principle. Money
                            is by no means the only thing to give in this world ; neither do large gifts necessarily
                            contribute more to the happiness of the receiver than small gifts. Go into any country and
                            converse with the people. Ask who ministers most to their happiness. You will very likely be
                            told of some venerated clergyman, whose salary has never been more than enough to barely
                            support him; or some poor widow, who goes from house to house, like a ministering angel,
                            wherever sorrow and suffering demand consolation and relief. It is astonishing how much one
                            without money can give. A kind word, a helping hand, the warm sympathy that rejoices with
                            those who do rejoice, and weeps with those who weep. No man is so poor, no woman is so poor,
                            as not to be able to contribute largely to the happiness of those around them.</p></div2><pb n="216" id="p28" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Call of the spirit" TEIform="index"/>CALL OF THE SPIRIT</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Sawyer, Otis" TEIform="persName"/>Otis Sawyer</byline><p TEIform="p"> Aug.
