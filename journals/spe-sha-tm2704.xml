                            regulations, it has been found necessary to appoint directors over the several departments.
                            The Covenant * belonging to the Order, determines clearly and fully the course to be
                            pursued, both for the establishment and perpetuity of the several departments and their
                            officers. THE MINISTRY. This Order consisting of Brethren and Sisters, is the leading
                            authority of the Society. Extracts from the Covenant. ARTICLE I. Section III. "It becomes
                            the special duty of the Ministry to guide and superintend the spiritual concerns of the
                            Society as a body of people under their care and government, and in connection with the
                            Elders in their respective families and departments, who shall act in union with them, to
                            give and establish such orders, rules and regulations as may be found necessary for the
                            government and protection of the Church and Society within the limits of their jurisdiction,
                            and also to counsel, advise and judge in all matters of importance, whether spiritual or

                            invested with authority in connection with the Elders as aforesaid, to nominate and appoint

                            to such Brethren and Sisters as they, the said Ministry and Elders shall judge to be best
                            qualified for the several offices to which they may be appointed." This order of ministers
                            may have the oversight and direction of one or more Societies. THE ELDERS. These are
                            appointed as the directors of each family. Their office is to take charge of the spiritual
                            protection of their respective families. It is their duty to instruct the members in their
                            duties, to counsel, encourage, admonish, exhort and reprove as occasion may require; and to
                            see that the rules and regulations pertaining to their respective families are properly
                            regarded. THE TRUSTEES. "The Trustees are invested with power to take the general charge and
                            oversight of the property, estate and interest, dedicated, devoted, consecrated and given up
                            for the benefit of the Church, to hold in trust the fee of all the lands belonging to the
                            Church; also all gifts, grants and donations, which have been or may hereafter be dedicated,
                            devoted, consecrated and given up as aforesaid, and the said property, estate, interest,
                            gifts, grants and donations shall constitute the united and consecrated interest of the
                            Church, and shall be held in trust, by the said Deacons, as acting Trustees, in their
                            official capacity, and by their successors in said office and trust forever." DEACONS AND
                            DEACONESSES. These are appointed to take charge of the domestic affairs of the family where
                            they reside. These several orders of Officers constitute the general government of the
                            Community. MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. A person receiving faith and still preferring to remain
                            within his own family, may hold his union with the Society. In this case he will continue
                            the management of his own business, having the entire control of all his property. It is
                            expected that such persons will conform, inasmuch as they are able, to the principles taught
                            by the Society. They are to provide for their family by honest and industrious labor, and to
                            watch over their children with a faithfulness that belongs to the gospel of Christ. Those
                            receiving faith but who are under no embarrassment to the world, through the relations of
                            business, or the burdens of a family, may prefer to <pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> enter the Community
                            and enjoy its benefits and privileges. This class agree to devote their time and services to
                            the support of the family in which they are members, stipulating at the same time to claim
                            no pecuniary compensation for their services. They also have the privilege to give to the
                            family, the improvement or any part of their property as a free-will gift. Members of this
                            class may retain the lawful ownership of their property, so long as they choose. After
                            having a clear and full understanding of the Community life they may dedicate a part or the
                            whole of their property and consecrate it forever to the support of the Community. COVENANT
                            MEMBERS. Those who have become sufficiently acquainted with the religious and social life of
                            the Society, and have accepted the faith, are prepared to enter fully into a united and
                            consecrated interest. These covenant to dedicate themselves, with all that they possess, to
                            the service of God, and support of the gospel forever, promising never to bring debt nor
                            damage, claim nor demand against the Society, nor against any member thereof, for any
                            property or service which th2y have thus devoted to the uses and purposes of the Community.
                            OBLIGATIONS OF COVENANT MEMBERS. "The united interest of the Church having been formed and
                            establisht by the free-will offerings and pious donations of the members respectively, from
                            the commencement of the Institution for the object and purposes already stated, it must be
                            considered a consecrated whole, and devoted to the uses and purposes of the Gospel forever,
                            agreeably to the establisht principles of the Church. Every member, while standing in Gospel
                            union and maintaining the principles of this covenant, shall enjoy equal rights, benefits
                            and privileges, in the use of all things pertaining to the Church, according to their
                            several needs and circumstances ; and no difference shall be made on account of what any one
                            has contributed and devoted, or may hereafter contribute and devote to the support and
                            benefit of the institution." "It is also stipulated that the benefits and privileges secured
                            by this covenant, shall not be considered as extending to any person who shall refuse to
                            comply with the conditions of this association; or who shall refuse to submit to the
                            admonition and discipline of the constituted authority of the Church; or who shall willfully
                            depart from the principles and practice of those religious and moral obligations which have
                            been establisht in the Church, of which refusal or non-compliance the leading authority
                            acknowledged in the first article of the covenant shall be the proper and constitutional
                            judges."</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="If the whole world should become Shakers, what then?" TEIform="index"/> If the Whole World
                            should become Shakers, What then?</head><p TEIform="p"> If�and that diminutive word�if�admits of so much doubt. It is surprising to see upon how
                            small a pivot some of the greatest works in this <pb n="52" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> world will so readily
                            turn. Other vital questions like the above might be raised with equal propriety and yet they
                            would vanish as the morning mist. No one would care to give them a second thought. If all
                            men should insist upon following one occupation, what then? An 1 if the whole world were
                            anxious to live on some special island in the Pacific Ocean, what should we do? These are
                            very singular interrogations, and yet about as momentous as the first. The Shakers are not
                            particularly interested in holding a controversy on the subject of marriage. As it is a
                            civil right and is held under the law of the civil government, every person of lawful age
                            can enter the marriage relation if he so chooses. If and if�it should honor God's law,
                            through nature, God's law will evidently honor that relation through the laws of nature.
                            Jesus when he referred to the kingdom of God, and defined very particularly what all must do
                            to enter this abode, closed by saying,�"All men can not receive this saying save they to
                            whom it is given." He knew quite well that his testimony would not be received, except by
                            those who are prepared for it. Mankind, as a whole, care but very little about what may
                            become of the world, if it can be made subservient to their selfish ends, and the plea so
                            often and so carefully presented for their maintenance of God's laws, is used only as a
                            convenient quibble. God's laws are carelessly thrown aside whenever they are found to
                            enforce a disciplinary order of life, and the sins of indulgence among the pleasure seekers
                            of one generation are without reserve transmitted to the generation which follows. It is not
                            especially necessary that we enter into lengthy details upou this subject, as all professors
                            of Christianity, as well as all readers of the New Testament must unavoidably come to the
                            same conclusion. The subject of generation and re-generation are so distinct one from the
                            other, that there need be no danger of confounding the terms. The first is universally
                            understood as belonging to this present life, and that it forms the foundation pillars upon
                            which the world stands. The other is "the entering into a new, spiritual life, a principle
                            of supreme love to God and his law," through which the sons and daughters of the New
                            Creation become heirs to the Kingdom of Christ. Adam and other sons of God, lived in and
                            encouraged with eommeudable zeal the order of natural genei'ation. It has been, largely, the
                            life work of all races of men, and continues unchanged with those who hold a relationship to
                            the old inheritance. So far generation may have been honorable, in that it conformed to the
                            laws of nature. At the advent of the Christ a new and living way was opened in which all
                            souls were invited to walk. The kingdom of God was establisht among men. A new heavens and a
                            new earth were formed wherein should dwell righteousness. In this kingdom, old things would
                            be done away and all <pb n="53" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> things become new. The voice of Jesus was heard to
                            say, "Follow me and you shall find rest to your souls." How should we follow him? Not in the
                            order of generation, for he never walkt there, nor did he encourage others to walk there.
                            Not among the military heroes, for he deprecated war. Then how shall we follow him? We can
                            follow him by entering the order of the spiritual resurrection and rising from dead works to
                            serve the living and true God. By becoming a disciple of the Christ and under the discipline
                            of the testimony be made able to care for the things that belong to the Lord. By living in
                            that ministration, that the world may be crucified unto the world. Among the many who are
                            called to step forward into the elements of a new, spiritual life, but few avail themselves
                            of the privilege. The cares of this world have so absorbed their minds that they have no
                            time for religious contemplation. Again the Christ speaks to us;�"Ye that have followed me
                            in the regeneration and have forsaken houses and lands, or brethren and sisters, or father
                            or mother or wife or children, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred fold and shall
                            inherit everlasting life." "When Jesus Christ came among men, he promulgated not the work of
                            generation but of regeneration. It was the resurrection to a new and spiritual life. This
                            life was brought to light by his gospel, and the laws of nature with regard to this
                            generative work were clearly denned. The children of this Christian resurrection neither
                            marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels. They are not called into the work of
                            generation. That mission belongs to another class." Altho the Gentile Christian church have
                            tried hard to amalgamate the two orders, that of generation and regeneration, they can never
                            succeed so long as the testimony of the cross of Christ is maintained in the soul. That
                            which is born of the flesh, is flesh, and following the testimony of Jesus through the
                            apostle, "They that live in the lust of the flesh can not please God." And "that which is
                            born of the spirit, is spirit," and these conditions will not be very likely to
                        amalgamate.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="O my Father! My Father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof" TEIform="index"/>

                            midway between the street gate and the house, in the air above the house these words were
                            repeated,�"My Father, my Father! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." These

                            be in the Bible, and found it as quoted above. I questioned what the meaning of this
                            manifestation could be, and was strongly imprest that it referred to Br. Frederic's demise.
                            I returned to the Infirmary and said to the Sisters, "Frederic is not long for this world,
                            he will soon pass away." He deceased Wed. Jan. 27, at 4 o'clock p. m. The poem is the result
                            of this revelation. I do not now call to mind any incident of my life that has so deeply and
                            almost uncontrollably affected me as this has, and still does. The <pb n="54" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>

                            Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen thereof.�2 Kings, xiii", 14. By Elder Calvin G. Beed.
                            This passage I heard in the midst of the alrT As tho it descended from regions on high. I
                            lookt for it seemed that a spirit was- there Repeating these words.;�Tho I could not desciy
                            The form or the visage. But the letters were plain; They were written with light,
                            transcending In brightness, the light of the sun 1 They remain In my mind, as I saw them
                            that day,�pending On air. But what was its meaning? thus written So plain ! so radiant t so
                            impressive 1 so- grand I So presented with pathos 1 I was smitten With awe 1 The sublimity
                            caused me to stand,, And view it, as the Sovereign of Israel did The Prophet Elisha;
                            repeating the word ; uMy Father, my Father I the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof

                            imprest on, my mind ? I reflected with heartfelt emotion ; enquiring; What import the
                            manifestation designed ? The mystery opened. The true revelation Unfolded the vision, as
                            clear as the light Of the sun at noon-day. The presentation) Removed the obscurity blinding
                            my sight. It brought two conditions thus plainly to view ; Elisha was closing his labors in
                            time, And the Patriarch Frederic was bidding adieu To all that is earthly, for regions
                            sublime. As Israel of old, bound by Syrian ehainsr Appealed to Elisha to guide her aright,
                            In her efforts for freedom from Syria's domains ; The Prophet directed her how she should
                            fight � Not alone by the weapons of human device, But by obeying the wisdom directing� She
                            thus should be able o'er Syria to rise, Instead of obliged her will to subject to- <pb n="55" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> Ah,�has not our Israel need of assistance, To help her to wrestle with
                            powers, that would fain Bind her with bands to prevent her resistance, To hold her in
                            darkness,�in death to remain. Does it not behoove us, in humble submission To seek for
                            assistance from powers divine ? Shall we not appeal to our Father,-�ascending To join our
                            relation in regions sublime, In that blissful sphere of joys yet unspoken To more earnestly
                            labor,�unflinching, ne'er yield But keep the pure laws of Mount Zion unbroken, Make them our
                            phylactery, signet and shield? Shall we not appeal as did Israel of yore; With the very same
                            message she then humbly bore? Shall we not appeal to our brother, ascending To dwell in the
                            mansions of life never ending, Shall we not repeat,�"O my Father, my Father! The chariot of
                            Israel and the horsemen thereof! " That he may present it to each loving brother, And
                            kind-hearted sister in mansions above ? And to our fathers and mothers who suffered, And
                            stood as firm pillars in gospel relation ? By sacred devotion and toiling they proffered And
                            reared up the standard of the New Creation. Ah! will they not listen to our intercession And
                            kindly assist us in this hour of need, To climb the high hill of unsullied progression And
                            join the bright ranks of those truly agreed? And will they not in their wisdom direct us,
                            And shower upon us divine inspiration That will enlighten, guide, protect, And clothe us, at
                            last, with the robes of salvation? If we truly follow the heavenly Instructors ; Are careful
                            to stand in unsullied light, They never will fail to be our Conductors, They ever will guide
                            us in paths that are right. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dreadful things slip off one's tongue when angry..." TEIform="index"/>

                            These are the words of the angel to Joseph the father of him whose birth nearly nineteen
                            hundred years ago, is kept in remembrance by all Christian natious. Perhaps in some cases it
                            is carried out in a spirit of selfishness, giving gifts to those of whom a return is
                            expected or to those bound by natural ties only, instead of to the poor and needy. This day
                            brings to our minds the manner of the birth and the lowly surroundings amid which our Savior
                            was ushered into this world. Instead of a palace of wealth and luxury he had a manger for a
                            birthplace, and his associations and work through life were among the lowly. The Jews had
                            long lookt for a Ruler who was to come in great pomp and splendor, under whose leadership
                            they were to become the most powerful nation of the world. When Jesus the son of the lowly
                            carpenter declared that he was the long lookt for Messiah, they were filled with wrath, and
                            would have killed him, had he not escaped from their midst. It also brings to our minds what
                            the mission of Jesus was. He was sent to bring about a new older of things. The old Mosaic
                            law was "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," but Jesus said, "love your enemies,"
                            and do good to those who persecute or wrongfully use you ; to love, not only those who love
                            you, but to love all. If some one injures or wrongs us, the natural man says, "Resent it;
                            injure him; pay him back." The spirit of Christ says "forgive him," "render good for evil."
                            It was this spirit he carried out in his daily life, so that he was able to pray for those
                            who crucified him, "Father forgive them, they know not what they do." He was to save his
                            people from their sins. To a large part of the profest Christians of the world this means
                            being saved in their sins, or in other words, being saved from the awful punishment that
                            would otherwise be meted out to them for their sins. That they were to be saved from
                            sinning, by accepting Christ's life and ceasing from all sin was too much for the natural
                            man to accept. By placing Jesus above his fellow men, and proving that he was born perfect,
                            some even went so far as to call him God himself come to earth in human form and therefore,
                            impossible for him to sin. Thus it was no use for poor fallen man to try to live as he
                            lived, but that his death on the cross paid the whole debt. Altho sin they must; they will
                            be saved from the consequences of their dpeds and get to heaven at last by simply,
                            "accepting Christ," as they term it and believing on his blood that was shed on Calvary.
                            Jesus said, "Unless a man deny himself and take up his cross and follow me, he can not be my
                            disciple." These words were true then and they are <pb n="57" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> true to-day. No one
                            ever was or ever will be saved from his sins, except by ceasing to sin and accepting
                            Christ's life and teachings and putting them into daily practice. Let us accept the spirit
                            of the Christ with the resolve to bring our lives nearer to Christ. If we are inclined to
                            speak hasty or unkind words, or to have hard or unkind feelings toward a brother or sister,
                            think of him who could forgive even those who were cruelly taking his life. If some of us
                            think that our lot is a hard one and we have more to contend with than others, let us think
                            of what his trials were. We nerd more of the earnestness and zeal of those early saints who
                            were ready even to the laying down of their natural lives for the cause of God, and the
                            saving of their souls. When we think of the haidship and persecution they were willing to
                            bear and of their thankfulness if they could but gain their soul's salvation, our greatest
                            suffering seems small in comparison. I want all the world to know that I am striving to be a
                            Christian and in this work I will go with you, dear gospel friends, through all the years to
                            come, even to the end.

                                Migration and transmigration is the spirit that inspires people of to-day whether
                                political, agricultural, scientific or spiritual. All are on the "qui vive," as
                                unsettled as the waves of the sea. The religious element is all in a foam. Even the
                                Shakers are affected with the mania. One family after another is seeking other quarters
                                or regions. The South family of Canaan formed the introduction; next the Center family
                                became non est; and now the North family of Canaan are vacating and casting their lot
                                with the people at Enfield, Conn. What next stands on the program of revolution? This is

                                some of these have become extinct and others stand on the verge of an avalanche. Our
                                founders predicted seven essential changes would take place among us in spiritual
                                degrees of evolution. The spirit world appears to be aroused with various aims for the
                                improvement of mankind. The Lord of all who reigns above, Does, from his heavenly
                                throne, Behold what children dwell in love, And marks them for his own. Then let us
                                strive while here in time To make our birthright sure; That we may dwell in realms
                                sublime Among the just and pure. Calvin G. Heed. South Family. Mar. 1897. Dear Editor:�I

                                dough. But my occupation will soon change, in this place, and other business must be
                                lookt after more closely, as we can not yet live without the "mighty dollar" and must
                                obey the injunction, "keep out of debt." We still find time to read and write, as we do
                                not wish to be behind the times. The Christian Herald and Ladies' Home Journal are our

                                Zertucha. Deliver us from traitors,�from one who violates his trust. When the millennium
                                is fully ushered in, fighting will be no more, and the truly good and loyal will have
                                peace and joy. Lord, hasten the day when revengeful, grasping natures will have an end.
                                This is an individual work and what people want they willingly suffer for. If the gospel
                                work is the object of life, they will do the work it requires. They will gather the
                                fruits of the Spirit,�"love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
                                meekness and temperance." "My brain power may be very small, No matter,�it is mine, And

                                unity of all the forces that emanate from the Divine mind. "Nothing useless is, or low;
                                Each thing in its place is best, And what seems but idle show, Strengthens and supports
                                the rest." The faculty that is termed the sense of beauty manifests itself in various
                                forms to different minds. To some the beauty of flowers is the ideal to which they are
                                attracted; some, of which our poet is an example, see it illustrated in varied forms and
                                none can be rejected that tend to unify and exalt the life, bringing it nearer that
                                universal mind, which from the crude material, is developing the beautiful and true. We
                                can not but realize the unequal balance of life's necessities, when with the appalling
                                famine in India our western farmers quote corn at eight cents per. bushel and are using
                                it for fuel. When will the balance be adjusted? Echo answers, When? We can only realize
                                with more clearness our own blessings and give our sympathy to the suffering altho
                                unable to render them tangible assistance. To be able to view the problems of life
                                seriously, does not imply that we should look1 at them with a sense of gloom and be
                                misanthropic, but while realizing them in their importance take a cheerful, prospective
                                view of the situation and look up through the clouds, to the sunlight of heaven. But
                                with the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars that were recently spent on a dress ball
                                in New York, the flaunting of such immense wealth in the face of gaunt poverty, rousing
                                passions that will only give might the power to grasp it regardless of laws divine or
                                human; to see the multitudes who are so absorbed in the rush after wealth as to give no
                                thought to the many moral and social problems of life that are calling for adjustment,
                                causes us to have serious thoughts as to the result.

                                thinking of the maple syrup harvest, altho we may not be able as a Society to enter into
                                its manufacture. We are thinking of the return of the singing birds, as their presence
                                exerts a salutary influence upon a great many minds. We are thinking of milder weather,
                                after a long, northern winter and of the flowers that will very soon bud and blossom to
                                our very great pleasure. Already the days have increast in length (March 8,) two hours
                                and thirtyone minutes, which blesses us with so much additional light; and light adds
                                much to the life of the world. When this number of The Manifesto reaches its readers,
                                the day's increase will have reacht not less than three hours and forty minutes and the
                                sun will shine upon us so <pb n="60" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> early as twenty-nine minutes past five,
                                in the morning. Before that date reaches us, we are promist more snow-storms, more high
                                winds and more rain, with an accompaniment of colds and coughs. As they can not all come
                                on any one day, we must devise plans for our personal protection. We will think kindly
                                of the winter that has given us a liberal supply of snow, and made many hearts glad, and
                                has also frozen the water in our lakes some sixteen inches, so that our ice-houses have
                                been filled with an article of the best quality. Henry C.

We have made for ourselves and others a happy little home, from which will
                                pass the testimony of everlasting truth. We have not been dilatory in sowing the seed,
                                and have distributed many of our publications to those who are interested to read them.
                                About 100 rods from our dwelling is a house that was formerly owned by a family of
                                Swedes. It is now rented to a man, a leader of a Society of celibates. He has several
                                followers, and is expecting others. They are strictly non-resistant. It is astonishing
                                to see the rush of people to the shores of Florida. Many who have good, comfortable
                                homes in the north are leaving them for the sunny south. We have been fighting pine
                                trees and palmetto roots for two years, and we think we are coming out on the right
                                side. One year since we planted three acres of sweet potatoes. We have sold 100 bu. at
                                forty cents per. bu. and shall sell as many more at a later date, and still have enough
                                left for our own use. We sold 100 pineapples at fifty cents each. From the same piece we
                                sold considerable garden produce. We had a slight frost, which did some injury, but by
                                building fires on the lot we saved most of our property. We planted two acres of
                                northern potatoes, and th ese are doing nicely. We now have 600 peach trees, and about
                                one third of these will bear fruit. 100 orange trees are growing, but we must wait a few
                                years before we can gather much fruit. We also have 00 guava bushes. We are intending,
                                by and by, if prosperity attends us to put up a dwelling near Alligator lake, some two
                                miles distant from our present location. That will be a much better building spot and
                                may be better every way. We have just put up a Fairbank's wind-mill and a 5000 gal. tank
                                for irrigating and also for domestic purposes. A pipe passes 150 ft. into the lake and
                                this gives us the best of drinking water. In our Sunday service we sometimes read from
                                the book of "Living Witnesses." Some of our neighbors from our other house attend
                                religious service with us and we sing or speak as imprest by the good Spirit. Andrew

                                was the rendering of a dialog by thirteen Sisters, the subject, "Ye Hatchet Partie."
                                Representing presidents from George Washington to Millard Fillmore. The hatchets were
                                designed to cut down the huge tree of intemperance, the speakers giving information how
                                the cause of temperance took root on American soil and of its branches which have borne
                                such prolific fruit of reformed souls from the deadly sap of inebriation. A thorough

                                necessary to us, that we may be able to give an intelligent reason for living as we do.
                                The last Sabbath service in February, was markt with appropriate songs and testimonials
                                adapted to the memory of Ann Lee, of whose life mission we can not have too much
                                knowledge, as the principles she advocated form the basis of our Church and afford a
                                sanctifying power which liberates the soul from error and the bondage to sin. So long as
                                wrong exists the true spirit of peace can not bear sway; there will be a contending for
                                right till the cause of wrong is removed. So let us continue to hope that our country
                                will soon pass from the school of independence, into the university of universal
                                brotherhood, where nation will walk hand in hand with nation, manifesting a broad

One week of March has already sped away, but we are still having zero
                                weather. There is more snow on the ground now than there has been at any time this
                                winter and the lumbering business is booming. Large loads of logs are being hauled to
                                the saw-mill daily. We have been very fortunate in the sale of our Baldwin apples,
                                getting over $2.00 per. barrel while our neighbors have been selling for 75 cts or less.
                                Notwithstanding the cold weather we have two toads in the green-house, that are enjoying
                                themselves very much. They were not observed until about a fortnight ago when one was
                                found on the flower bench close beside the roots of a large pink where on looking closer
                                we found he had a fine warm home and a safe retreat from the cold. Later another one has
                                come and both must be getting a good living as they are fat and ungainly-looking. The
                                blessing of health has been ours for some time past; a blessing we know how to
                                appreciate as in times past we have had our share of affliction. We united with the
                                Society at Mount Lebanon, in favor of theTreaty of Arbitration, and sent our petition to
                                our Senator Hon. W.n. P. Frye for its speedy consummation. He has presented the petition
                                to Congress and written us that he thinks the Treaty will be ratified by the in-coming
                                administration. Thus the day will behasteued when the nations of the earth will learn

                                        may be purified by putting into it about two grains of alum. The alum acts as a
                                        sort of coagulum on this matter, causing it to curdle, and settle to the bottom
                                        of the vessel. No taste or unpleasant effect is produced, as the alum goes with
