TEIform="persName"/> By Elder Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> IT was Jesus that complimented a rich publican whom he met on one of his journeys, and made
                            of him a friend and an assistant in his religious work, instead of provoking a controversy
                            and making him an enemy. Jesus evidently had some knowledge of this rich man previous to the
                            visit, and felt quite well assured of a kind and pleasant reception. The singular story of
                            their meeting, the informal manner of introduction and the final closing of the scene,
                            evinces a care in both persons of well-directed self-government. It is a lesson that is well
                            worthy of a Christian mind, and that need not diminish in its application to our daily life.
                            From the earliest history of the race, throughout all the savagery and ignorance that has so
                            plainly markt its passage, and through all the dominant influences that have been exercised
                            by the strong over the weak, there has always been found a growing, manly regard that has
                            lookt upon the government of one's own mind as being much in advance of the most refined
                            slavery. The selfish influences in man, like the same qualities in the beasts of the field
                            will ever struggle for the mastery, as these for ages have been, largely, the ruling power.
                            The march of man, however is upward into better regions of thought, into higher moral and
                            spiritual conditions, which aids in the unifying of the race, more closely, and makes it
                            more dependent as individuals upon each other. Thousands of years ago this excellent lesson
                            was learned and placed on record as follows;�"He that is slow to anger is better than the
                            mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city." SEPTEMBER, <pb n="130" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Any savage conqueror, with a sufficient following might destroy many human
                            lives and much valuable property, and then pLce himself as a ruler over others, who at once
                            are made slaves to his dominant passions. In many cases the family of man has adopted this
                            extremely seiiish course, a:id made "Might to be right," and through this power of
                            usurpation governed accordingly. On the introduction of the Christian religion a better
                            system of procedure was initiated and men and women were urged to change their minds by
                            leading a higher order of life, and by walking in a new and narrow way. Instead of being so
                            anxious to dominate over each other, for selfish interests, they were incited to treat
                            others as they would wish to be treated if placed undt r similar circumstances. At the same
                            time that this Christian faith was made manifest it was found that two classes were now
                            permanently placed before the world. The one to continue its ruling through inordinate
                            selfishness, so far as was possible which was done in multiplied ways as the strong opprest
                            the weak. The other class, under a different ministration was instructed to deal justly, to
                            love mercy and to minister deeds of kindness to all of God's creation. As human nature is
                            quite the same in all ages of the world, and the selfishness of man so like the selfish,
                            dominant nature in all the animal creation, it is sure to assert itself unless ameliorating
                            influences of a strict self-denial are brought into daily practice. A professing Christian
                            who fails to live in the spirit of gentleness and meekness, becomes a sorry specimen of a
                            disciplined order, and the religion which is supposed to be the active exponent of an honest
                            heart, is at best but a faint imitation of the Christ spirit. One of the Apostles in his
                            illustration of religion, said it was to miuister to the needs of the afflicted, and so to
                            live as to keep unspotted from the world. And if a man thought himself to be religious and
                            did not bridle his tongue, his religious experience was of little or no account. More wounds
                            have evidently been made by unguarded expressions and sharp speeches than were ever made by
                            poinards or daggers. A sacred writer also says, "the tongue is full of deadly poison," and
                            this is literally true, when we make reference to an unbridled or undisciplined tongue. An
                            education in ribaldry whether among the rich or poor, young or old becomes a prolific source
                            of uncleanness and makes infectious even the atmosphere around us. History informs us of a
                            class of low, ignorant and selfish persons, whose disreputable language received the name of
                            Billingsgate from the district where these people resided, so that now the coarse,
                            undisciplined, vulgar language of one person to another is known by that name, to the
                            disgrace of the one from whom it proceeds. It is quite unfortunate that any circumstance
                            should ever arise to call forth any expressions otherwise than those that have been well
                            matured under the influence of a good spirit, as such things may be so thoroughly imprest
                            upon <pb n="131" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> the minds of the young, that even in old age it may not become
                            obliterated. The Shakers in the early days of their organization dwelt long and earnestly
                            upon the necessity of kindness of speech. In forming the Societies, their members were taken
                            from the several Christian churches, as good men and good women, zealous for the honor of
                            their religion and for the forms and ceremonies which were demanded. The baptism of the
                            body, however and the fear of losing their place in the resurrection, had all failed to
                            baptize many of them into an element that would wash away the selfishness of the human
                            heart, or cleanse it from that inheritance of the flesh which abounds in the language not
                            congenial to the spirit of the church of Christ. The Shakers believed as was written by the
                            prophet, that God would turn to his people a pure language, as well as clothe them with a
                            pure spirit. They not only talkt about it, but they sang about it. They were emphatic in
                            their declarations of right over wrong and testified that even a Christian faith was of no
                            value only so far as it had an influence for good on the daily life. To make this change of
                            the mind more effectual for good the testimony was clothed with musical harmony, to the
                            decided advantage of every one. And here fellows one of the simple lessons so potent for
                            good. "With a new tongue I now will speak, My words shall be both mild and meek, A gospel
                            union I will seek With all my dear relation." Other minds in other walks of life have been
                            imprest in the same manner and have given voice to their anxious hope, through these simple
                            ministrations to cultivate the beautiful spirit of kindness. "Speak gently, it is better
                            far, To rule by love, than fear, Speak gently�let not harsh words mar The good we might do
                            here." No better admonition than the above could be placed before those who have accepted
                            the testimony of Jesus the Christ which is the gospel of love, and the members of every
                            Community of Believers should seek to emulate each other in the cultivation and use of a
                            language so pure that it may be publisht to the whole world, to their honor and glory. East

                            Self-abasement leads to active exertions to detect and prove our unrighteousness and if by
                            reason of faithfulness this can not be done in any matters of importance, then will there be

                                H. June 27, 1897.</dateline><p TEIform="p">Our Absent Sisters ;�You may be a little surprised to learn that this letter was written
                                by one who gives you so little attention at home, and yet you may have heard that
                                distance lends enchantment, and it may prove so in this case. At an earlier date we
                                visited Enfield where we formed new friendships and learned new lessons and made new
                                resolves. May you do no less. Our pilgrimage through this life is not upon flowery beds
                                of ease, neither are we obliged to wear a crown of thorns. If the thorns are our choice,
                                we must submit to the pain they cause us. You all, doubtless, admire the rose, but did
                                you ever examine it closely in the different stages of its growth? As you read this do
                                you not call to mind the little rosebush all covered with thorns up to the very buds.
                                What do you find ? A bush without beauty, without fragrance, but not without form. All
                                that is lovely, all that is fragrant, all that is beautiful is developing within. Here
                                then is the lesson. From a rough exterior, you can develop a well ordered and
                                symmetrical character. From the rough ledges of granite and of marble have been wrought
                                the most wonderful pkces of mechanism and art that the human mind is able to comprehend.
                                Is this grand power of fashioning and forming to be left to be displayed on inanimate
                                things ? Is there not a possibility that the good things of God's Kingdom can be
                                realized and perfected to the honor and glory of a virtuous cause by those who have
                                shared the blessing of spiritual guidance for so many years ? As you walk over the
                                consecrated grounds in the Community at Enfield, think of those devoted souls who have
                                given their lives for the upbuilding of the Zion of our God, in that beautiful valley. I
                                have nothing very sentimental to say and I need not tell you that my only anxiety is
                                that you walk worthy of the vocation vrhereunto you are called. Be an honor to
                                yourselves and to the Society that you represent, and whatever you may chance to see <pb n="133" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> even if it be of a worldly character, that may attract your
                                attention from the path of duty, remember, that beneath every rose however beautiful,

                            reacht the increase�vision seen By the prophets biding but in tents? Have we access to the
                            fountain clean At whose touch the soul to Grod repents? Blessed sister, simple and sincere,
                            Precious link between us and the past, May we often draw thy spirit near, May thy brave
                            example with us last. Sacred consecration unreserved, In a gift of faith by thee was made,
                            Never from thy youthful promise swerved, Never let thy soul's white lilies fade. To thy
                            parents happy was the choice, In the hour when nature's claims assailed, On this mountain
                            thenceforth to rejoice, More than Jeptha's daughter e'er bewailed. Christian sacrifice they
                            understood, Adverse logic gained but doubtful place, T'was a hawk that would destroy their
                            good . E'en though high and circling in its grace. <pb n="134" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> What a triumph when
                            a holy child Filled with courage helpt her parents on, Turned herself from sin's deluding
                            wild Where so many purblind ones had gone. What the pain and marvel still through life, When
                            companions sometimes broke their clasp, And went down to earth's bewildering strife, Phantom
                            joys and sorrows real to grasp. What straightforward loyalty was thine, What pure charity
                            that seemed like prayer, Or like sunshine on a pagan shrine, With a smile concealing folly's
                            glare. E'en when souls long cherisht in thy love Gave ingratitude, thy lips were dumb, Thy
                            reward was with thee from above, While thy thought was but for good to come. Faithful with
                            the faithful hast thou been, Long thy home shall miss thy pleasant ways; Farewell dear one,
                            till we meet again Safe within the pearly gates of praise. As the ancients silently depart,
                            Shall we die in ignominious calm? Make no struggle to sustain our part And ignore the gift
                            containing balm ? Look we up to heaven, or down to earth For the impulse that shall mould
                            afresh? Shall we draw from life's immortal worth Or be swamped in fallacies of earth ? As
                            new palms of victory we take, As we lift the spotless banner high, Every effort doth our
                            souls awake, And we know God's work will never die. O, I hear sweet music roll and swell,
                            Through the life-cloud screening from our view, That fair realm where our beloved ones
                            dwell; Hark! each cadence will glad hope renew . Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Annas, Lydia" TEIform="index"/> Sacred to

                            she might give them a fuller understanding of the saving principles of a Christian life.
                            Possessing the wisdom gained through long years of toil and self-devotion to the good of
                            souls, and deeply solicitous for their future good at all times, she drew them to her as
                            with a magnet and they loved her with all the affection they could have shown a natural
                            parent. She had lived among Believers for over seventy-four years ; was acquainted with many
                            of the early founders of the society in Watervliet, and often spoke of the suffering they
                            past through in those early days, when they lacktmany of the temporal comforts they now
                            enjoy. She ever manifested a spirit of thankfulness for her gospel call to prove herself a
                            child of Christ and a daughter of Mother Ann. I had the pleasure of her acquaintance for
                            over thirty years, and during that time I never saw an element of weakness in her life, but
                            she always rejoiced that she had set out in the way of God in her early youth, and had
                            strength given to carry her safely through her earthly pilgrimage. She often gave a strong
                            testimony in favor of a Christian life saying she thought the life taught by Christ if truly
                            lived was the only one that could yield perfect happiness and justification to an
                            intelligent being. Faithful in the performance of every duty appointed to her, she was one
                            we shall truly miss in all the relations of life. Kind and charitable to all, a peacemaker
                            at all times, loving with an unselfish love for one common humanity, I do not think the
                            person exists, however low in the scale of humanity they might be who was beneath her love,
                            or too inferior for her tender ministrations. Farewell to thee Sainted one, we shall often
                            miss thy cheering voice, and while we feel that our great present loss is thy eternal gain,
                            we know that thy gentle Spirit will not leave us, but will often hover near to cheer us as
                            we bravely bear the trials of life through the few short years of Time, so that when called
                            to our Eternal home, it may be said of us as of thee, "Well done thou good and faithful

                            desire to receive the indwelling spirit can it be given. The tendency of the materialistic
                            mind even when cloakt under theological teaching, is to look away from the internal and
                            spiritual life for a manifestation of the divine. <pb n="136" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> To those who are
                            dwelling on the materialistic plane of their being, the divinity that dwells within is as
                            foolishness; but we address thus.? who have tasted of the fruits of the Spirit and without
                            the shadow of doubt and with a knowledge of the truth have felt the opening of the internal
                            sense, and know that to be "spiritually minded is life, joy and peace." That faculty in man
                            that causes him to look above the conditions of physical existence, altho through his
                            ignorance and inability to comprehend that faculty and in its manifestations it may appear
                            vague and unreal, is, nevertheless, as permanent and reliable a condition of his life as
                            those that are more directly connected with his existence. The highest intellectual
                            development is not always the one that has the largest scope and most expansive vision that
                            enables it to grasp and view spiritual things ; many times it is very crude, delighting in
                            that which abounds in mystery and unexplainable power ; but it satisfied for the time that
                            internal longing of the soul wThich could not rest contented with dead forms or lifeless
                            creeds and as the spiritual became unfolded what was once the sustenance upon which it
                            maintained its life, proved to be worthless. In the acceptance of the truth its possessor
                            becomes as a little child, as it brings the soul into the conscious presence of the Infinite
                            spirit, removing all egotism and pomp and self-laudation, at the same time imparting a
                            dignity and grandeur to the life that the worshipers at mammon's shrine, are unable to
                            understand or accept. The saying that "speech is silver but silence is golden," has its
                            basis on truth, but needing the exercise of wisdom to know when to give utterance to thought
                            and when to remain silent. Many times the most effective method of bringing the soul into
                            conscious communion with the Divine preseuce is silent meditation, gathering the sense away
                            from the distracting influences of the outer life that it may accumulate a reserved force to
                            be used when duty calls to enter the arena and grapple with the opposing forces. The
                            beautiful example and counsel of the Divine Master can be practist with profit by those who
                            are desirous to develop their spiritual life. "When thou prayest enter into thy closet and
                            when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
                            seeth in secret shall reward thee openly." Altho the elements of spiritual decay have to a
                            greater or less extent permeated their life, the monastic retreats when first establisht
                            were based upon the necessity of having a place of retirement from the inharmonious
                            conditions of the world; and the unsettled state of human society during the time in which
                            they were organized, testified to the wisdom of their building. But "man shall not live by
                            bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." While it is right
                            that there should be seasons of retirement, it is also necessary that the soul should at
                            times come forth where the conflict is waged the fiercest. The law of action and rest is as
                            operative in the spiritual life <pb n="137" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> as in the physical. When the race has
                            developt more harmonious conditions than at present and the indwelling spirit has asserted
                            its right to rule the temple of life in both the inner and outer courts; when in the
                            dealings of man with his fellow-man truth prevails and to do "unto others as ye would have
                            them do unto you," is the rule and not the exception; then he will be enabled to enter into
                            such close communion with the Divine that the exclusive retreats which were intended to give
                            an opportunity for spiritual development will not be needed. The admiration of the world has
                            been given to those who have in a large measure attained unto that exalted station ; but to
                            fully comprehend that life, it must be evolved from out of the crucible of suffering, and
                            each individual must for himself test the virtue of that power. When Savonarola was to
                            suffer martyrdom on account of his testimony against the corruptions of the church, on being
                            led to the stake the Bishop, in his excommunication said, I expel you from the Church
                            militant and from the Church triumphant." Savonarola exclaimed, "not from the Church
                            triumphant that is beyond your power." Every one who has experienced that divine
                            illumination has at some previous time had to ascend the mountain and have the kingdoms of
                            the world and the glory thereof presented to him and told that all these would be given if
                            he would fall down and worship them. Those who refuse to give that homage know the joy that
                            comes when "holy angels minister unto them." Admittance into that temple whose occupants
                            have received the divine illumination, can only be through the gate-way of self-abnegation;
                            but to those who have arrived at the inner court and have for their, guide the light of the
                            Spirit, can view with pity the multitude that are groping in the dark, but are unwilling to
                            accept the light. What can be the force that is impelling human life onward, urging it to
                            reach higher than the present plane of thought and life? It is the indwelling spirit, that
                            is the motive power which inspired the heroes and martyrs of the ages to deeds of
                            self-sacrifice and a willingness to suffer for the truth; to give their whole life to the
                            uplifting of the race. It is the power which at present is causing efforts to be made to
                            cleanse the temple of life that its occupants may not be bound in slavery to the passions
                            and influences that keep them from asserting their right to be sons and daughters of God.
                            Altho at times this divine overshadowing may come, lifting the soul above its present state
                            and enabling it to realize what is possible for it to attain unto, but for it to permanently
                            abide, there must also be the garden of Gethsemane, and through it each individual soul
                            shall pass and the experience that is gained there, will enable it to realize the fact that
                            "life is more than meat and the body than raiment." There is a condition the materialistic
                            mind can not understand and only by obedience to the highest promptings will it be enabled
                            to advance into the perfect light. Shakers, N.

                                very unpropitious month for either farming or gardening. Grass crops have been very
                                abundant, but the month has been so very wet we have barely commenct harvesting the
                                crop. 16 rainy days giving us 15 inches of water, averaging about half an inch a clay
                                the entire month. One continuous rain gave us *l% in. in twenty-four hours causing the
                                water to overflow our dams, and making the valley below a lake from two to four feet
                                deep. It has been such a month that we desire never to see another so destructive and so
                                wide spread. It has spread E. W. N". S. destroying millions of property and multitudes
                                of lives. One woman with her two children and house were taken by a tornado, carried to
                                the center of the Hudson Hirer and sunk and they were drowned. There might be a volume
                                written if the entire sr.d catastrophies were chronicled that have occurred during July
                                1897. With all the prevailing destruction, we are very much blest. At present we have
                                plenty to eat and to drink. We are well clothed and housed from the storms. We have
                                purchased cement and paint to preserve the roofs of the Meeting House, Office, Infirmary
                                and Laundry, so they will not leak, if paint, cement and solder will prevent it. A half
                                mile more of the State Eoad between us and Hancock is being constructed. This will prove
                                an additional blessing to travelers. We have gathered from our garden thirty-three
                                bushels of strawberries and nine bushels of raspberries and have more of the last named
                                to gather, then will come the blackberries. The early apples are fit for use. Cherries

                                shade! We were careful not to make any uncomplimentary remarks about "Old Probabilities"
                                for we might regret it when the blizzards of December were blowing; but we thought of
                                the pleasure of Professor Andree's trip in an air-ship to the North pole or of Dr.
                                Nansen's arctic explorations. But we will try and be philosophical and make the best of
                                it whatever the variations of the temperature. Those grand and inspiring words of
                                Gladstone in the Manifesto were like a benediction rebuking the narrow spirit of
                                sectarianism that would contract the sphere of human thought making it less able to
                                comprehend the universality of truth which is the true goal toward which life is
                                advancing. We admire the character of the man and have his picture framed in oak
                                guarding the doorway of our domicile. We think our little Manifesto is doing even better
                                than the son of Erin's isle who said he had "started with nothing and had held his own."

Beloved Bkotheb;�It has been some time since we heard anything through
                                The Manifesto about South Union. We have past through a very heated and dry season, the
                                thermometer ranging from 100 to 105 degrees. From the first of May to the 10th of July
                                we had but very little rain and the land was intensely dry. Within the last ten days we
                                have received about one inch, with a prospect of more. As it is we have great reason to
                                be thankful. We have been bountifully blest in a good wheat crop, and the Society has
                                thresht some 5700 bushels. This we now have on hand waiting for a satisfactory sale. The
                                prospect for a fair corn crop is good, but the hay harvest is quite limited. Our home in
                                the valley will afford us but few peaches, but there will be a better <pb n="140" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> crop on more elevated land. Apples will also be scarce. Of blackberries
                                we shall have an abundance and then best of all, our Society is not in debt. In the East
                                family we have canned not less than fifty gallons of blackberries, while the other
                                families may have done as much or even more. John W. Perryman</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mount Lebanon, N.

                                secure, but tons of the best garden soil and some of their produce have been swept to
                                other regions. Hay and grain have been greatly injured, some entirely ruined; damage to
                                fruit has been as yet, comparatively slight. Trees and shrubs are being much benefitted
                                under skillful pruning by one of our young Believers, our lawns and gardens by the care
                                of others, while a markt interest is manifested by all in adding to the attractiveness
                                and comfort of our home. Many pleasant hours have been spent in the associated labor of
                                Brethren and Sisters in gathering fruit, also when the entire family have met for
                                pea-shelling where singing added much to our enjoyment. Twice we have assembled to have

                                epoch in history which we believe will be much more widely and clearly appreciated in
                                future years than at present. It seems a fitting time for all Believers who realize the
                                value to mankind of the Gospel testimony, to recount the accomplishment of the past,
                                consider the means of success and the causes of failure, distinguish between customs and

                                freshets for this season of the year, have visited the valleys of New England. At our
                                own home the roads and gardens have suffered the most. To "make hay while the sun
                                shines" has been a difficult matter for the farmers, as the showers were of daily
                                occurrence. As a climax to this "down pour," we must note the 23rd of July. The heavens
                                became darkened by the accumulation of clouds in the north, and at the same time in the
                                southwest. One could hardly have believed that the winds would, in a few hours bring
                                these together and form the severest thunder-storm of the season. However, at 10-30 a.
                                m. the clouds had met directly over our village. The "windows of heaven were opened" and
                                the thunder and lightning of that hour, we would not wish to have repeated. Our large
                                barn, 240 ft long, received one thunderbolt on the center cupola and passing down an
                                iron rod into the barn, it made kindling wood of several boards, and in some mysterious
                                way hurled a fire brand into the hay. The bolt then past out of the barn at the lower
                                edge of the cupola and markt its path by splintered boards on the roof. Two young men
                                were in the building on Since <pb n="141" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> the lower floor, and both were
                                rendered unconscious for a few moments. A second thunderbolt immediately followed, but
                                this was at the extreme east end of the barn. It was a mischievous flash as it tore the
                                shingles from the side of the barn, demolisht a window sash, splintered the boards, and
                                then spent itself by splitting some timbers. The young Brethren soon recovered
                                consciousness and found the hay on fire and the smoke pouring out at the windows. By
                                wonderful self-possession they were enabled by the use of water and a fire grenade which
                                were near at hand, to subdue the flames, and fortunately to save the building from
                                destruction. Through the ringing of bells and the cry of fire, there was for a short
                                season an intense excitement in our home. Many of our kind neighbors, altho living one
                                or more miles distant, hurried to the Tillage to aid in preserving the property, and
                                this friendly care was much appreciated. Henry C.

Happy are they who can see the nobility of living like Christ, tho their lot
                                is pitched in among the pines and palmettos of Middle Florida. They receive the
                                hundred-fold reward for the sacrifice of a life of transcient pleasure and animal
                                sensation. It is well worth the labor to be so consecrated that place noi condition will
                                take away the enjoyment of a contented mind. Nothing in this life, will spoil the peace

                                day. It is now about three years since we struck the first ax and bog hoe into the pines
                                and palmettos of our new home, and to-day we are receiving the reward of our labors with
                                much satisfaction. A good comfortable house has been built and painted and ten acres of
                                land have been cleared. A pinery built and planted and now we are harvesting the crop
                                which will be about seven hundred good, saleable apples. Four hundred peach trees have
                                been set out, from which we expect a small crop, another year, Rice, orange, semen,
                                persimmon, with smaller varieties of trees and pines fill the gap. The garden in which
                                the writer has toiled with unbounded patience, begins to show the bright side. With the
                                addition of our wind mill, tank and water pipes, we feel we are well fortified against
                                the coming drouths which invade Florida during the months of February, March and April.
                                The past month has given us plenty of rain to put in winter crop of sweet potatoes, also
                                to re-set the shoots of pine-apples, from which we expect a crop the coming year. We
                                have had two valuable additions to our numbers, Brother Egbert Gillette, a noble young
                                man from Alabama, all ripe for the sickle of truth, and our well tried, veteran Sister,

                                fills a niche in our little home that but few can fill. Why need we fear the future as
                                "Heaven helps those who help themselves.1" There is virtue in suffering patiently and
                                cheerfully. When the trial comes look up, take in a long breath and go forward. Dear

                            chief cause of so much misery in the world, we never depreciate the movement because it
                            comes from this or that particular creed or sect, we are only glad that it conies, only glad
                            to help it on by our prayers and support. We are thoroughly acquainted with the high
                            standard of moral training which prevails in Catholic schools and colleges. The pupils are
                            taught to regard the holy virtue of purity as a thing divine, before which angels prostrate
                            in adoring love. They are taught to believe that its observance constitutes the no. blest
                            manhood or womanhood that this world has to offer. It is not surprising that such a magazine
                            as the Ave Maria should issue from such a source. While we may differ from the Ave Maria in
                            our views of the eternal truths of Christianity, yet we are one in our belief that sin is
                            detestable, that it is man's worst enemy, and that the only power that can conquer it is the
                            pure gospel of Jesus Christ. These being our sentiments we can say with all sincerity, God
                            speed the good work of the Ave Maria. The following is the note referred to<cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> The editor of our Shaker contemporary, The Manifesto, explains how the United
                                    Society of Believers came to be called Shakers, a nickname they have since adopted.
                                    The founders of this sect were God-fearing men, who dwelt much on the severity of
                                    the divine judgments. One of their most familiar quotations was from the prophet
                                    Aggeus, and from it their name is derived. In the Protestant version of the
                                    Scriptures it runs; "Thus saith the Lord: It is a little while and I will shake the
                                    heavens and the earth, and the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and
                                    the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory." The
                                    Anglican sect used to be known as King Henry's Church; the Methodists were called
                                    Ranters, and the Baptists were called Dippers; but the Shakers were the only sect,
                                    we believe, who meekly accepted a nickname invented in ridicule We wish we could
                                    share with our readers the pleasure derived from a letter lately received from the
                                    editor of The Manifesto, asking an exchange with the Ave Maria�a letter breathing a
                                    beautiful spirit of Christian charity. It affords another proof that God's flowers
                                    bloom upon every soil, and that many who are geographically outside the Church are
                                    not culpably outside of it. If all Shakers are like the pious, prayerful, peaceful,
                                    Godloving, sin-hating Community from which The Manifesto emanates, they can not be
                                    far from the Kingdom of God.</quote></cit></p><pb n="143" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/> HEALTH.</head><p TEIform="p"> A means of preserving health is the having a constant supply of fresh air in your bed

                                often breathed of a close chamber. It is recorded of Methuselah who lived to a great age
                                that he always slept in the open air for when he had lived five hundred years, an angel

                                hundred years longer. But Methuselah answered and said,�If I am to live but five hundred
                                years longer, it is not worth while to build me a house. I will sleep in the fresh air

                                        and there are New York doctors who indorse the declaration. It is well known

                                        in their bazaars and drink coffee continually during the day. It has been
                                        noticed that almost invariably when these coffee drinkers reach about the age of
                                        40 their eyesight begins to fail, and by the time they get to be 50 years old
                                        they become blind. One is forcibly imprest by the number of blind men that are

Do you keep in mind when you buy
soap, that it is Clothes you are buying,
not soap.
Most soaps destroy many times their
cost in wear of the clothes on tie washboard.
Most washing powders destroy many
times their cost by the powerful chemicals they contain which eat and rot all
fabrics they touch.
A Good Soap, is one which will remove
the dirt easily without rubbing, and without boiling, and will not injure the clothes.
Such a soap more than doubles the life of
the clothing aud household linens.
When you buy MOTHER HTJBBARD
SOAP, you get for a trifle extra paid for
the soap, very many times its cost in the
saving of your clothes�to say nothing of
the saving in labor, coal etc.
