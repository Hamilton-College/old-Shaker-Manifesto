THE NEED OF IT.
Articles of great value are constantly appearing'
in the secular and religious periodicals, and any
one who does not save valuable newspaper matter
is losing a great denl. The words of One wiser
than Solomon are pertinent here�"Gather up the
fragments that remain that nothing he lost."
But all the methods for preserving newspaper
clippings previously in use have serious defetix�
take too much time to find them, to fold, refold,
and replace, them, and are not handy for rapid reference.   Now the
TOPICAL SCRAP-BOOK SYSTEM
does away with all these difficulties.
It is the best system ever invented, and has the
indorsement of hundreds of prominent literary
men, among them being: Ex-Presidents Andrew
D. White of Cornell, and Martin B. Anderson of
Rochester: Presidents Dodge of Colgate University, and Francis L. Patton of Princeton College;
Rev, Wm. M. Taylor, D. D., Rev. Phillips Brooks,

                            though in great distress, or would be seen bowing the whole body, for a long time, or
                            turning with great velocity, or lying motionless on the floor. Those in a trance state would
                            deliver their messages, or relate what they had seen in the spirit land and then return to
                            their normal condition. Some who had cherished a lukewarm or infidel spirit, were arrested
                            in astonishment and began to reconsider the position they had occupied. This was a
                            manifestation that they had not anticipated, and were quite unprepared to solve the problem.
                            To those who were spiritually minded it was a comfort and a staff. It increased their joy as
                            they moved on their heavenly journey, and enhanced their anticipations of a future,
                            spiritual kingdom, "a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." Every
                            manifestation seemed designed to inspire a deeper love for sacred and divine things, and to
                            establish a greater confidence in the beautiful gifts. The wonderful exercises of the
                            Instruments, gave evidence to the many witnesses, of a supernatural power, which was passing
                            among them. Sometimes several persons would be in the entranced state, and without a word of
                            introduction, engage in a new and intricate exercise with the most exact precision. They
                            passed and repassed each other with the greatest care as only those could who were under a
                            more exalted influence. During all this time, their eyes were closed, and yet, they were
                            never known to stumble over any object that intercepted th^ir passage, or to move in a wrong
                            direction. The singing of new songs, and of spiritually improvised Anthems, some of which
                            were attended with beautiful and intricate motions and all brought forward with remarkable
                            composure and exactness, was additional evidence of the work of the spirit. A large part of
                            the service was now occupied in these wonderful manifestations of the unseen power, which
                            became very interesting to those who remained as witnesses. These gifts were also manifested
                            more or less during the day, and yet did not trespass on the time of the daily avocations.
                            The visionists were, sometimes, led by their guides to visit those who had<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> entered the spirit world, and were engaged in worship, and then would be taken
                            into their dwellings, and gardens, and at such times, they would speak audibly of what they
                            had seen and heard, but were wholly lost to the things of this earth. The descriptions which
                            they gave, of their interviews, were expressed in the choicest language as they referred to
                            the spiritual blessings of those who were faithful to bear the cross of Christ. At other
                            times the visionists were conducted to the dwelling places of unhappy spirits. Some of the
                            conditions in this place filled them with fear and horror, while many of the spirits uttered
                            solemn warnings to those who were unfaithful to the voice of God. It was not our province to
                            judge this work, as we could know of the spirits, only as we learned from the visiouists.
                            The Second and South families at Watervliet, N. Y., were the first places where these
                            singular manifestations were witnessed, and for months they were of daily occurrence. As no
                            one could determine the reason for this sudden outpouring of visionary gifts, and especially
                            as it came, first, through thi children, it was permitted to work its own development, and
                            be, as it really was, a blessing to the Society. In January, 1838, not less than eight,
                            individuals were under the visionary in fluence and eighteen visits were made to the spirit
                            land. Many of the Believers from other Societies visited Watervliet to witness the strange
                            phenomena. They did not go because they were entire strangers to spirit manifestations, but
                            this was new in that it corresponded so well with the prophecy of Joel, "And it shall come
                            to pass, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your .sons and your daughters
                            shall prophesy, and your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions." Joel
                            ii., 28. During the period from August, 1837, to April, 1838, the manifestations at New
                            Lebanon, were very limited, but many were praying for their revival and great increase. Jt
                            was a time of anxious anticipation, particularly, with those who were residents of the first
                            family. After waiting, patiently, fur several weeks, a word was received from the East
                            family at New Lebanon, one of the least in the Community, that they were the recipients of
                            many beautiful gifts, in songs and visions. The Church or first family at New Lebanon, was
                            actively interested in the reports that were received from Watervliet, N. Y., and from other
                            places. The songs were learned aud used, the visions were read and re-read and a general
                            desire to share more and more fr" these precious gifts. A deeper devotiou was manifested in
                            the work of consecration, and through this an ont-pouring of the spirit of God. All the
                            gifts, that had up to this date, been received, seemed well calculated to enliven and
                            encourage all who shared in the blessing, and to convince many of the reality of a future
                            state, as well as to stimulate an interest in sacred things. This was, however, a
                            preparation for the mind to be able to receive a deeper iuward work. Messages. 1838. After
                            waiting, in suspense for a few months, a wave of inspiration broke over the Society, and its
                                manifestation<pb n="243" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> in the first family was quite different from what had
                            been anticipated. Its introduction was by the speaking of solemn messages, during the hour
                            of worship. It was the visitation of guardian angels, and the word was spoken in the name of
                            our Heavenly Father, of our Heavenly Mother, and of the saints and angels of God. It was a
                            season of deep tribulation, which caused great anxiety for those who were absorbed in the
                            work of the spirit. '1 he purport of the messages was that our Zion would be searched as
                            with the caudle of the Lord, and it would be shown how she had departed from that perfect
                            order in which she was established. The time had come when .an advanced work must be done.
                            This must be a deep, heart-searching labor of soul, and the putting away of all that was
                            sinful. God's house must be a house of order, and his people must walk in the light, by
                            honest confession and repentance. Messages were also delivered to individuals, for blessing,
                            for encouragement and for a better understanding of spiritual interests. Many signs were
                            manifested and a greater freedom obtained in the deliverance of exhortations, in time of
                            worship. Singular demonstrations were sometimes made, and by those from whom we might the
                            least anticipate. But it had already been written that, �'Pride goeth before destruction,
                            and a haughty spirit before a fall." It was not uncommon to see some led into a gift of
                            violent shaking, of turning or bowing, and for these to continue a long time. Some were
                            thrown into a trance state and would lay as one in death. Those who spoke by inspiration
                            would generally be seized by that mysterious power or influence, and tremble or shake before
                            they gave utterance to the words of the spirit. This was followed by a more passive
                            condition, during which, the "Instruments" would speak with great clearness and composure.
                            We were often favored with reports which informed us of a corresponding work among the
                            Believers in other Communities. Of course it was pleasant and interesting to learn that such
                            was the case. In June 1838, these gifts and messages were less frequent, having as we
                            supposed fulfilled their mission to the people. During the month of August, we experienced a
                            revival of the manifold gifts, as before, both in exercises and in doctrine. Many evidences
                            were given that Mother Ann was still solicitous for the spiritual prosperity of her gospel
                            children. Special blessings were conferred upon those who were agod, and a prayerful hope
                            expressed for the young. One of the remarkable features of this work, was the deprivation of
                            speech which, on some occasions, continued several days. Not a word of the English language
                            escaped their lips. During this time, at extended intervals, they would for a few minutes
                            use a form of speech, but it gave no intelligence to the general compaay. Some who were not
                            able to converse with their companions, would sing beautiful songs. Some became speechless
                            and helpless, under which influence they would remain for several hours. (To BE

                            quotations from Emphatic Diaglott. A popular Editor of a widely read magazine, wrote
                            "Shakerism is good for nothing if it is not good universally� if it ought not to be adopted
                            universally. But universal adoption would be the suicide of the race, and a race has no more
                            right to commit suicide than a man." This string of assertions by proving too much,
                            overthrows itself. It makes propagation over-ride every other consideration, and the
                            paramount duty of every human creature. A conclusion opposed to the common judgment, to
                            which the sophism is addressed. If it were true, it would make Jet*us Christ and all who
                            follow his example, guilty of suicide. Moreover, the finest moral consciousness of the best
                            minds of the race, condemns the act of suicide, while the same consciousness approves the
                            act of virgin continence, in a life consecrated to God, from a desire to purify one's soul,
                            and to benefit others. If any feel that it is their duty to multiply their species, after
                            hearing the gospel that Jesus Christ lived and taught, Shakerism says to such, "by all right
                            means discharge that duty first; for no one who believes that to be an obligation, is
                            prepared to receive Christ's gospel in its purity." The fallacy of Dr. Holland's reasoning
                            will appear in the following syllogism. It is not good to make wheat into bread unless all
                            wheat should be made into bread. But if all wheat were made into bread, it would end
                            propagation, contrary to the Divine plan. Therefore, no wheat should be made into bread.
                            This represents the gist of his argument, whicii is commonly regarded by the ignorant as a
                            knockdown against the gospel of virgin brotherhood aud sisterhood. The possibility of a
                            higher use for life than to propagate species, seems not to have penetrated their thoughts.
                            Incontestibly, the highest use for wheat, is as food for man. Take this away, and the main
                            ^ause for its propagation, ceases. By applying a part to seed the ground, a large surplus is
                            liberated to be used as food without periling the existeuce of the species. Here we perceive
                            propagation is not the chief end for which life exists, but is a means only for multiplying
                            individuals and continuing a species. It is thus with man. The highest use of his existence
                            here, is not to propagate his species iu mortal bodies, nor to augment physical existence,
                            but to prepare for a new and superior life in Christ, the Harvester of the world, iu which
                            earthly generation can no more exist, than reproduction of wheat, exists in bread. The
                            elements are there, but not the function ; they are disintegrated by the woman's "leaven,"
                            aud recombined for higher uses. Hence, to forbid converting one's life to its highest use in
                            the service of heaven, because it disqualifies him for animal propagation, is to destroy the
                            real use of propagation, by preventing advance<pb n="245" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> to the higher life, the
                            true end for which it was instituted. We say animal propagation, because continence and
                            elevated aims, controlled by a holy Spirit, do not destroy propagation, but eliminates it
                            from the animal, transfers it to mind, and sublimated in quality, it propagates a heavenly,
                            incorruptible life, in lieu of the earthly and perishable. The procreative function in man,
                            was made subordinate to the dictates of wisdom in rational understanding, and designed to be
                            controlled by the will. Man practically iguores this radical law of his being, by utterly
                            disregarding the order of seasons and times implanted in nature,�the fitness or unfitness of
                            parties and circumstances�the rights of offspring to be well born- -and more, by making
                            pleasure and not posterity, his object in this relation. At the same time, he practically
                            admits that tie possesses the power and responsibility of self-control, by enacting
                            statutes, attended with penalties for violations, to operate as substitutes for the higher,
                            wiser and more efficient restraint to use for offspring only, which a due culture and
                            illumination of the moral principle, establishes in the mind. Generation being an animal
                            function, is confessedly inferior to the wisdom faculties, which are commanded by their
                            quality and office, to subdue and have dominion over the animal. Hence, when the latter is
                            exalted above Reason, the order of creation in man is inverted, the government through
                            reason and judgment subverted, and the mental eye is baffled and confused into substituting
                            effects for causes, pleasures for uses, and means for ends. He who discards the true uses of
                            life and makes pleasure his leading pursuit, has or will have ample cause to ask himself, "
                            Is life worth living?" For by subordinating intellect to passion, he becomes a slave to "the
                            beast" that is in him, and is a worshiper of "The Beast and his Image," in his own
                            imagination. It is written "His servants ye are to whom ye yield yourselves to obey, whether
                            of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness." Jesus declares "He that doeth sin is
                            the slave of sin." These are truisms, not annulled by rejecting the authority which
                            formulated them in speech. "And the whole world wondered after the Beast. And they worshiped
                            the Dragon (fierce devourer) because he gave authority to the Beast, saying, Who is like the
                            wild Beast? And who is able to make war with the Beast ?" that giveth pleasure and preserves
                            the species. "And all those dwelling on the earth will prostrate to the Beast, whose names
                            are not written iu the book of the Life of the Lamb, slain from the foundation of a world."
                            The foundation of this world is generation, and the social relations thence arising, from
                            which the Lamb, Jesus and his virgin followers, are slain by the daily cross, and the
                            testimony which they bear. "Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
                            alone, but if it die, it bears much fruit." As the grain must die to its first state, in
                            order to multiply and transmit life to offspring, so must the human soul die to life in the
                            auirnal propensities, which pertain solely to the earthly and rudimental state, in order to
                            rise in the life of those heavenly graces and virtues which come down from above, and crown
                            the victor over the beast within<pb n="246" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> him, with immortal glory and honor.
                            �'For whoever will save his [animal] soul, shall lose it, but whoever will lose his soul for
                            my sake and the gospel, shall find it." Mark viii. "He, loving his [animal] soul, shall lose
                            it, and he, hating his soul in this world, shall preserve it unto aonian life.*' John. It
                            should be observed in this connection, that the ancients applied the term soul, [psucheen]
                            to the seat of appetite and passion, and ascribed souls to animals. In Jude 19, it is
                            translated sensual, marg. animal. Those who are called by the gospel in this life, and are
                            faithful to overcome the world and conquer sin in the flesh while clothed with earthly
                            tabernacles, sit spiritually upon white horses, as when heaven opened to the vision of John.
                            These transform their affections, and conserve and transmute those vital forces pertaining
                            to generation, into mental and spiritual powers and virtues, and raise them from the
                            earthly, on to the Divine celestial plane. This transformation is typified in the conversion
                            of the reproductive elements of wheat or other grains, into animal tissues and instruments
                            of thought in man. Emerson's fine intuition bears witness to the law of the harvest, which
                            we have here endeavored to expound, as follows. "The human body is a vessel in which the
                            Elixir of life is stored. Will a man spend for pleasure ? 'i he way to ruin is short and
                            facile. [He glides down into the animal and becomes a slave to "the Beast."] Will he not
                            spend, but hoard for power? It passes through the sacred alchemy according to that law of
                            nature [and also of grace] whereby all life [disciplined on a lower,] cb'mbs to higher
                            platforms, and bodily vigor, becomes mental and moral vigor. Alimentation becomes in higher
                            laboratories, imagery and thought, and iu still higher results, courage aid fortitude."
                            Infused here, with a holy spirit from above, it becomes charity, beneficence and liberality,
                            and more aud more unfolds till it is complete iu every virtue, and dispenses the
                            all-healing, creative power of eternal life, in the perfect liberty of the children of God.
                            ��True thrift, is to ^pend on the higher plans ; namely, in spiritual creation, and not in
                            augmenting auimal existence. Man is not enriched unless through new powers and ascending
                            pleasures, he knows himself by actual experience of higher good, to be already on the way to
                            the highest." Certainly no true disciple of the Divine Teacher will deny that, the highe-t
                            good is found only in Christ. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            What must his blessings be." These two quotations, though diverse in spirit refer to the
                            same principle. The first taken from the most ancient Christian literature portrays the
                            undeveloped condition of the people of that day, when mankind considered manual labor a
                            curse of God, sent as a condemnation for their disobedience. This idea has been handed down
                            through the ages, though somewhat modified, and those who have been so fortunate or rather
                            unfortunate as to be placed in circumstances that did not require bodily exertion to sustain
                            their physical needs, have deemed labor a degradation, and looked down upon those that the
                            decrees of fate had placed differently, as inferior beings, unworthy of their association.
                            What a misconception of that glorious blessing, that God ordained should be a mercy instead
                            of a curse ; we are glad that such sophistries hoary with age are giving place to progress
                            and enlightenment. Wealth and idleness have been the monarehs that have ruled the world with
                            relentless sway ; they have won honor, fame, distinction ; while plodding hard labor, the
                            rightful inheritor, has been degraded and oppressed by the power of accumulated wealth. What
                            means this great agitation of thought that is going on in all civilized countries? what mean
                            the strikes, the great labor organizations ? they seem to me the commencement of a great
                            volcanic eruption, that is yet to shake the whole fabric of monopolies to pieces ; then, can
                            we build a structure whose foundation shall be equality ; procuring equal rights to all and
                            privileges to none. I feel utterly incapable of solving this vast problem, but the deep
                            conviction of my heart is, that as more of the divine spirit of love seeks to rule human
                            hearts, selfishness and avarice will give place to its indomitable sway, and mankind will be
                            lifted up above petty personal interests, thus striving for a universal Brotherhood and
                            Sisterhood, where the welfare of each shall be bound up in the welfare of all. Just now I am
                            strongly reminded of Peter the Great, the Czar of Russia, who reigned in the sixteenth
                            century. Though charged with many obnoxious qualities, there was one trait he possessed that
                            is truly worthy of a noble mind. Wishing to enrich his empire with the knowledge of more
                            civilized countries, he left the luxury of a court and traveled through various places as a
                            private person, employing him-elf as a workman at the dockyards, laboring with his own
                            hands, being fed and clad<pb n="248" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> like the rest of his fellow-workmen. Thus he
                            gained knowledge, and a practical experience ; the fruits of which he employed for the
                            benefit of his kingdom and its subjects. Many of his successors might pattern from this
                            example, instead of living in luxury and extravagance, obtained by the oppression of the
                            lower classes. Labor is worthy of all honor ! Stop the brawny arm of labor and the world's
                            commerce is paralyzed. It is true that we havs chained the lightning's flash, ;md bound the
                            forces of steam to do our bidding ; but what are they unless directed by the hand aud
                            intelligence of man. It is labor that has builded cities and towns, reared lofty structures
                            that are the glory and pride of nations. It is labor that has turned a "rocky soil to gold,"
                            and made the wilderness fertile ; it has spanned mighiy rivers, tunneled mountains, banded
                            continents with steel, joined hemispheres with electric wires, and channeled the ocean's
                            tide to bear its fleets of oak and iron and their cargoes to distant lands. Reverting to the
                            second quotation at the commencement of this article, its beautiful sentiment speaks to our
                            souls, and we feel that labor is an imperative duty, devolving upon us all according to
                            ability. The bee gathering the sweets from a thousand flowers, the ant toiling over its
                            miniature burden, the beaver at his dam, and all the active forces of nature tell us that
                            man is made for labor. The formation of the body, its muscles and sinews ; the construction
                            of the hand, and the divine law of right and duty, written on our own souls, issue the same
                            edict. Idleness is the parent of all evil; while labor is healthful and developing to the
                            soul and mind,�the "great principle that carries men and nations onward ;" it is only when
                            there is no heart or mind in it, that it becomes mere drudgery. No matter how humble our
                            avocations, let us vitalize them with earnestness, devotion and intelligence, thus proving
                            to our satisfaction the true nobility of labor. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="From our diary" TEIform="index"/> FROM OUR DIARY.</head><p TEIform="p">Sept. 30. Early on the morning of the above date we, (the Ministry of Canterbury and
                            Enfield,) left our beautiful home on the hills of N. H. to make a visit to the Society of
                            Mt. Lebanon, in the state of New York. From our Village to the city of Concord is twelve
                            miles. A carriage ride of two hours, over the hills and dales, proved to be very agreeable.
                            At 10.20 we were in the cars and on our way to Nashua At this station we had the pleasure of
                            conversing with Elder John B. Vance for a few minutes, before he took the train for Boston.
                            Our company, at this place, change cars and leave the Concord R. R. for that of the Boston
                            and Maine. On reaching the Junction in Ayer, our train, agreeably to the usual custom, stops
                            about ten minutes. During this time Elder Elijah Myrick of Harvard calls to see us, and his
                            angel visit made our hearts glad toward our gospel relation of Harvard. Again we are passing
                            rapidly on our way and at 2.15 P. M., we enter the Union Station at Worcester. Once more we
                            are to change cars, and this time enter those of the Boston and Albany. Tickets must be
                            bought, checks for the baggage changed, and we must go into the dining room and purchase a
                            lunch. In this Station, we have a forced rest of more than two hours and although hundreds
                            of people are coming and going we find ourselves in a world of strangers. While we are
                            waiting the moments pass slowly away till<pb n="249" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> 4.20 when we enter the
                            express train for Springfield. At 5.55 we are at the new station, and soon find, that in so
                            large a crowd, we are in sad need of a guide. We might have lost our way but for the timely
                            presence of Br. Daniel Orcutt who gave us safe conduct to a place where Elder George Wilcox
                            was in waiting with a carriage to take us to the Cooley Hotel. The presence of two angels
                            with wings could not have been more welcome, than was the company of these beloved Brethren.
                            At the Hotel, Sisters Sophia Copley and Caroline Tait met us, who with their Brethren had
                            come a distance of nine miles for a few hours of social converse. We formed our circle in
                            the parlor of the Hotel and our little meeting of seven souls did not dismiss till 8.30. It
                            was a very interesting season, and to the delegation from New Hampshire it proved equally as
                            profitable. Elder George is not the man to hide his gospel light under a bushel, and the
                            testimony that he delivered would bear repeating before a larger audience. Our visit over,
                            the friends from Enfield were soon in their carriage and on their way to Shaker Village. It
                            was dark, quite dark, but with a kind horse, and a correct knowledge of the whole road, they
                            entertained no fears. The good-byes all said and we return to the Hotel. The R E. track was
                            only a few feet distant and with the rumbling of the cars, the ringing of bells, the blowing
                            of the whistles and the puffing and snorting of the engines, the time for rest was quite
                            different from that described by Montgomery. Oct. 1. With the dawn of a new day we made
                            preparations for continuing our journey. At 9.05 we were to leave Springfield. The tickets
                            were bought and pocketed, the trunk checked and the Sisters on board of the cars. By advice
                            we had left a large valise at the Hotel which the porter was to take to the Baggage-room and
                            have it checked. But the baggage and the porter delayed their coming. Patience must be added
                            to patience. The last signal was given and away went the train. The writer now had ample
                            time for sober reflection as the next train would not leave till 11.30. When the conductor
                            made his visit the Sisters were obliged to excuse themselves, by saying that they had no
                            tickets, that the Brother who had purchased them had missed the train. With a courtesy
                            characteristic of the conductors on this road, he asked if the man who had bought the
                            tickets was a Shaker, and receiving an answer in the affirmative, he said it was "all
                            right," as he should, very soon, hear from them. After passing the station in Huntington the
                            conductor informed the Sisters that two tickets had been deposited in the office at
                            Springfield. Patient waiting, however, is no loss, and the journey to Pittsfield on the
                            express train was far preferable to the one that stops at every village. Br. Ira Lawson,
                            very kindly met the writer at the station, and after a ride of about four miles, over a good
                            road, we reach the village of Hancock. Dinner over we enjoy a visit with our gospel friends.
                            We walk out to see the round, stone barn. It is a curious structure. All the stoc c stand in
                            their stalls with their heads toward the center of the building. There is a passage way of
                            some four feet in front of the cattle, around the entire barn, while the hay occupies a
                            place in the center. The feeding of the stock and general attendance is made very
                            convenient. On the loft above is a driveway next to the walls. The teams enter by a large
                            door, unload, drive around the barn and pass out at the same door. This arrangement has some
                            advantages that may not be found in buildings of a different shape. We pass through the
                            building used for the cutting and drying of sweet corn. Every convenience is at hand to make
                            the business a success. The season for drying was over, but the corn was passing through a
                            winnowing mill where all the hulls, &amp;e. &amp;c, were thrown out and a beautiful
                            article for food was being barreled for the market. Such care in the preparation of an
                            article that was to be sold, reflects honor upon the Society and brings to mind the course
                            pursued by the early Shakers. In the evening we enjoy a visit with several of the Brethren
                            and Sisters, which closes the duties of the day. Oct. 2. Among other places we make a short
                            visit to the school. Some eight or ten pupils were present. The teacher, very<pb n="250" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> kindly, changed the programme of the day and during our visit we were much
                            interested in the exercises. The reading, writing and drawing were especially interesting.
                            Passing from this place, other visits were to be made and other dear friends to be seen. At
                            3 P. M., a span of horses, with a covered carriage and a youthful driver, from Mt. Lebanon
                            was at the door of the Office. A cold breeze was blowing over the mountain from the N. W.,
                            and we found that a few extra wraps were quite acceptable. The mountain passage was rough
                            and muddy. As we began to descend the mountain, we thought of our dear boy who had taken us
                            in charge, then of the horses, good, faithful old servants, and then of our carriage with
                            its inefficient brake for the wheels. We talk of mountain rides in N. H., but we should be
                            obliged to travel many miles from Canterbury before we should find one that could equal this
                            mountain pass, between the Villages of Mt Lebanon and Hancock. As we go down, down, down,
                            passing one steep declivity after another, and find that our heart still pulsates as usual,
                            we begin to think of the Arab, who on his escape from danger, cries out, "Allah be praised
                            !" Our driver suddenly becomes a man, and a skillful guide, the horses understand their
                            business, and hold the carriage as carefully as though it was made of glass. They have not
                            made one false step nor manifested any nervousness on account of the burden that was
                            pressing upon them, and our comfortable carriage moves along so easily and quickly that we
                            almost forget the discomforts of the trip, and enjoy with admiration the wonderful landscape
                            that is spread out before us. We are at the Office, and soon surrounded by some of the dear
                            friends in this beautiful, gospel home. Oct. 3. We meet in conference with our beloved
                            Ministry, Elder Daniel Boler, " Giles B. Avery, Eldress Ann E. Taylor, " Harriet Bullard,
                            and confer with them upon those subjects which are of interest to the Societies in N. H. In
                            the P. M. we make a visit to the workshops of the Sisters. As the time was limited to two
                            hours the visits were necessarily brief, still it was pleasant to see and converse with our
                            gospcA mothers, Betsy Crosman, Eleanor Potter, Matilda Keed and others, so comfortable in
                            health and happy in spirit. In the Bakery we met a company of young Sisters who were
                            preparing food for a picnic as six Brethren and seven Sisters were anticipating an excursion
                            to Perry's Peak on the following day. It had been arranged by the Elders of the family, that
                            those forming the company should have the pleasure of preparing their own food. We half
                            wished that we were to share the enjoyment with them, of climbing tlnj mountain and viewing
                            from its summit the many beautiful scenes. As Mt. Lebanon is the parent Society, the
                            Believers situated in other states often visit this place, and present their reports to the
                            Ministry, who stand as their spiritual leaders. The spirit of love must be the governing
                            power of our religious Community and without this, there can be no life. Oct. 4. The signal
                            for rising in the morning, is a few strokes of the large bell. It is five o'clock. At six
                            o'clock the same bell calls the family to breakfast. This over and all are now ready for any
                            duty that may demand their attention. As our home during this visit is in the Trustees'
                            Office, and we are sharing their kindness and care, we shall take great pleasure in calling
                            them to mind. Br. Benjamin Gates, '* Robert Valentine, Sister Mary Hazzard, " Tabitha
                            Lapsley, " Emma J. Neal. At 2 P. M. we visit the Center Family. Among the aged sisters we
                            find Sisters Rhoda Blake, Hannah Blake, and Hannah R. Agnew. These occupy a place among our
                            faithful gospel mothers, who have earned an inheritance in all the choice blessings that
                            abound in our Community. We have the pleasure of seeing many others who reside in this
                            family. This season was very much appreciated and the time passed pleasantly while in the
                            enjoyment of social and profita. ble conversation. On former occasions we have visited the
                            laboratory, where large<pb n="251" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> quantities of medicinal extracts are made, for
                            home and foreign markets. Also the printing establishment, where much of the printing is
                            done for the'Community. They have also a good fount of music type, and for several years
                            furnished that department in the Manifesto. Jn the evening we return to the church office.
                            Oct. o. At 10 o'clock we walk to the North Famiiy, and spend the day among our gospel
                            friends at that place. We listen, with deep interest, to the remarks that flow from the
                            spiritually developed mind of our beloved Elder Frederic. Even at the age of 81 yrs. he
                            conducts an extended correspondence and receives many beautiful and interesting letters. We
                            visit a building, the cellar of which, has been rebuilt for the keeping of apples and other
                            fruit, at the cost of $1000. As this is a vegetarian family, where but little if any meat is
                            ever eaten, they go to more expense in the cultivation and preserving of fruit. The apple
                            harvest, this season, has been considered very good, and many of the specimens which were
                            brought to the house were unusually large. Elder Frederick believes that the day is coming
                            when "nothing shall harm or hurt in all God's holy mountain." We passed through the large
                            stone barn, where all the stock are comfortably housed during the winter season. Everything
                            was arranged in the best of order, and worked to the advantage of the herdsman, and for the
                            protection and comfort of the animals. Three large silos occupy sufficient space at one end
                            of the barn to hold hundreds of tons of ensilage. The great value of this article for food
                            during the winter is fully appreciated. In the P. M., we enjoyed a pleasant season of social
                            communion with the Brethren and Sisters. Br. Henry Cantrell called to see us. He is now in
                            his 82nd year, and although feeble in health, is alive in the spirit. For many years, Br.
                            Henry has been a faithful laborer in the vineyard of the Lord, and his reward is with him.
                            Br. Daniel Fraser, at the age of 85, is still more feeble in body. We found him at the
                            Infirmary, waiting patiently for the good angels to accompany him to his heavenly home. His
                            spiritual vision was clearly denned, and he conversed as pleasantly and with the same deep
                            interest for truth and righteousness, as was his custom in former days. Fortunately for us,
                            Br. Levi Shaw reached home just before we left the family, and we had the pleasure of a
                            short but very interesting interview with him. Oct. 6. It is the Sabbath! Xo work is to be
                            performed in the Community that can consistently be deferred till another day. "The day is
                            to be sacredly kept for the worship of God." Literature that develops a moral education and
                            cultivates an interest in spirituality should be selected for study or perusal. The
                            Believers had anticipated a meeting of the whole Community in the Church, and the large room
                            was kept warm several hours for that purpose. By nine o'clock the rain came down so
                            liberally, that the order of the day was changed, and the meetings were held in other
                            places. At 2 P. M., many of the Believers assembled and held their service in the Hall at
                            the First Family. The singing and speaking, and the silent influences of the love of God,
                            made the season one of spiritual prosperity and an aid to practical righteousness. A social
                            visit with the Brethren and Sisters, at a later hour of the day, was a season of pleasure
                            and profit. A gospel relation can never grow old or become unmindful of each other, as it is
                            formed in the union of the spirit of God and in the bond of peace. Oct 7. At ten o'clock,
                            Br. Daniel Offord is at the office with a span of horses and a nice carriage to take our
                            Sisters to the Family in Canaan. Eldress Anna White accompanies them. The writer, who has
                            accepted the companionship of a severe cold, is doing penance by fasting, and must stay at
                            home. Br. Rufus Crosman, who is 91 years of age, calls at the office, and we enjoy a very
                            pleasant, social chat. Br. Rufus enjoys excellent health for one so aged, and is still able
                            to do considerable work in his shop. During the past year he has made a large number of
                            fancy pails. He also makes all the bales, ears and hoops. The staves are<pb n="252" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> from some four or five kinds of wood, and when finished are very pretty. Br. Rufus has no
                            machinery in his room, but does all his work with a few hand tools. He has no use for
                            spectacles, and taking up the Manifesto, read with ease the finest print. His hearing is
                            equally as acute, and he enters into a conversation with the ease of a person carrying a
                            much less number of years. We visited several of the workshops of the Brethren and Sisters,
                            and found faithful, industrious laborers in every place, and many thoughtful souls who were
                            earnestly praying for the peace and prosperity of our Community. The Sisters return at five
                            o'clock and report the day well filled with prosperity and happiness. They had a pleasant
                            ride of three miles to the family in Canaan. Br. George Clark, the director of the family,
                            made them kindly welcome to the home of the Believers. Every thing in and about the
                            premises, bore the mark of neatness, and a general prosperity was a prominent feature of the
                            place. This family, liKe that of the Novitiate order, is strictly vegetarian. In the
                            evening, we were invited to attend to the exercises of the Bible class. Sister Amelia Calver
                            officiated as the director, and manifested a deep interest in the work. The pupils numbering
                            nearly thirty, of both sexes, were correspondingly interested, and their recitations and
                            singing and reading, gave evidence that they were willingly and earnestly pursuing their
                            studies, on the subject of Sacred History. One feature of the school was particularly
                            interesting to us, as the selections for reading were taken from the Manifesto. It was an
                            appreciation of the labors in our own home, and an exercise that was worthy of commendation.
                            Dr. Carl, a Brother in the first family was also present, and took an active part in the
                            exercises. He illustrated the lesson of the evening by some pleasant, timely and
                            clearly-defined remarks. With this privilege, and the untiring interest of the teachers,
                            these pupils in Biblical literature, will, and must remember these seasons for education
                            with a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction. It is a study that will never grow old, and
                            imparts a knowledge that is never out of place, in any order of society, whether in the
                            palace or in the cottage. We ask God's blessing on the whole school, for its present and
                            future prosperity. Oct. 8. At 8 o'clock we are taken to the South Family, a distance of
                            nearly a mile, and almost to the foot of Perry's Peak, of which we have so interesting an
                            account in the Manifesto of Sept. Elder Win. Anderson and others met us with a cordial
                            welcome, and we were soon engaged in an interesting conversation. This family seems to
                            occupy a curious place. High and steep mountains rise on the east and on the south. and
                            leave only a diminutive strip of land, adjacent to their buildings that is suitable for
                            cultivation. Their farm lies beyond the mountain on the south, at a distance of one or two
                            miles from, and wholly out of sight of the Family. The farmers take their dinner on going to
                            the field in the morning and do not return to the house till the close of the day. This
                            Family manufactures the Shaker Chairs. Of these they say, "We have spared no expense or
                            labor in our endeavors to produce an article that cannot be surpassed in any respect, and
                            which combines all the advantages of durability, simplicity and lightness." The largest
                            chairs weigh only ten pounds and the smallest less than five. The Believers began the
                            manufacture of these chairs in 1776, "and chair-making has always remained with us an
                            occupation to the present date." Br. Wm, Thrasher, who is 95 years of age, resides in this
                            Family. His activity and endurance are surprising. He is still able to engage in an animated
                            conversation, and his sight is excellent. In his walks over the mountains, which are taken
                            quite frequently, he would outstrip many a man of one half his years. Br. William thought
                            people ought not to talk about being old, till they were ninety. Old age means inaction, and
                            the laying down of the duties of life. At 1.30 P. M., we ride to the Second Family. Former
                            visits have made us feel so much at home, that we need no formal introduction. Elder Clinton
                            Brainard gave us a very cordial welcome, and with the addition-<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> al
                            company of the Eldresses we were most pleasantly entertained. As we had only about an hour
                            to spare before returning to the Office, our visit extended only to a part of the family.
                            Those whom we did see were social and interested in the prosperity of Believers and in the
                            promulgation of the gospel testimony. This family has a nice fence which runs, a few feet in
                            front of their buildings, the whole length of their dooryard. A Brother was engaged in
                            re-painting the fence, and it will, when finished, lork very neat and pretty. We only had
                            time to shake hands with Br. Charles, and to recognize other Brethren at a greater distance,
                            as we rode to the Office of the First Family, having Elder Clinton as our guide, and a span
                            of beautiful horses to take us over the road. As this was the closing day of our visit, we
                            found it necessary to make some arrangements for our return to N. H. Oct. 9. At 7.30 Br.
                            Henry Cantrell, Jr., was at the office with a carriage, to take us to the Station at West
                            Pittsneld or about one half mile east of the Society at Hancock. After returning many thanks
                            for many favors, and saying our last farewell, we left the beautiful friends, and the
                            beautiful village of Mt. Lebanon. In a few minutes we were rising from degree to degree, on
                            the steep mountain side, and resting in all security, with the skill of the horseman, and in
                            the assurance that the horses never swerved from their duty. We have seen horses that would
                            not hold the least load on descending a hill, that would not pull a load up a hill, and
                            indeed, horses that wouAd methodically arrange to do whatever th^y might choose. But these
                            horses really astonish us; they are so kind, so sure-footed, so faithful in the management
                            of their burdens, whether ascending or descending, that we want to thank them for their
                            animal kindness. One of our dear Brethren was on a journey and had two Sisters in the
                            carriage. The good old horse, that is good nine times out of ten, stopped on the hill-side
                            and looked around to the carriage. He concluded he had too much load, and no amount of
                            coaxing could induce him to move. So soon as the Sisters stepped from the caraiage, the
                            horse kindly and gently went on his way up the mountain, allowing the Sisters to have an
                            invigorating walk of half a mile. The horses that Br. Henry drove, at this time, entertained
                            a high regard for their master and for themselves. They moved along up the mountain without
                            a faltering step, and carried us safely over the summit and as safely down on the other
                            side. In due time we reached the station and concluded that we had enjoyed a very pleasant
                            and agreeable ride. Br. Henry entertained us with some very interesting items having
                            reference to the Western states by comparing the scenery of those broad, level fields with
                            that of the Berkshire Hills, over which we were now traveling. The picture was so pleasant
                            that we were almost persuaded to wish that our lot had been cast in that El Dorado of the
                            west when he suddenly said, "After all, taking all things into consideration I would sooner
                            live at Mt. Lebanon than in any place at the west, as our state, our town and our Village
                            has many advantages, and then it is our' gospel home, and 'there's no place like home.'" We
                            bade good-bye to Br. Henry, with many thanks, and he was soon out of sight. As our first
                            change of cars would be at Worcester, we could obtain tickets only to that place. We step on
                            board of the train at 8.52 and are pleased to learn that our genial Br. Washington Jones,
                            having business in that city, will bear us company. Tn Worcester we are to wait just one
                            hour. After obtaining a lunch, we bid farewell to Br. Washington and enter the cars for
                            Nashua. Here we again change to another road and finally reach Concord at 5.45. In a few
                            minutes we find ourselves comfortably situated in the Eagle Hotel, and soon retire for the
                            night, quite weary from the long journey. Oct. 10. At 10 o'clock a carriage arrives from our
                            own home, and we are soon on the road. A little more than two hours passes on the dial while
                            we are traveling these twelve miles. If it was slow it was safe, as safe as has been our
                            whole journey, for which we have great reason to be thankful.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="As you salute, so you will be saluted" TEIform="index"/>

                            right."�Paul. "What is the matter with the Churches?" Is a question often asked and the
                            reply might be given "-The matter with them is that they cleave to the letter rather than
                            the spirit of their profession and prefer material and visible prosperity to spiritual
                            grace, growth and knowledge," and the consequence is that even the dull world itself is able
                            to perceive the absence of that spirituality which "giveth life" and the deadening presence
                            of worldliness which kills the God-ward aspirations of the soul. The tendency of man is
                            toward the visible and enjoyable. He naturally shrinks from anything which requires the
                            sacrifice of self. He avoids tribulation even though he knows intellectually, if not
                            instinctively, that humiliating exercises tend to final elevation and that the denial of
                            self opens the way for spiritual growth. That which is next to his hand he avails himself of
                            to enhance his self-importance even though he is aware that to allow himself to drift
                            produces weakness and effeminacy. The spirit points the way to a "rough and rugged road" but
                            man tries to avoid it, he hates to travel that way, and attempts to compromise the matter by
                            making a picture of it and then he sits down to the contemplation of what he has made,
                            hoping to obtain all the advantages of travel while he stays at home enjoying himself. It is
                            a burlesque of religion ! To bow down before the figure of a cross is idolatry even though
                            the act may awaken tender emotions. The real cross is in the life, and it is not of our
                            making. It chooses us, we do not choose it. The cross is not a matter of mere sentiment but
                            it is a serious and stern reality. It is a hard fact which often produces anguish of soul
                            and sends forth the agonizing cry "Let this cup pass from me" rarely with the submissive
                            addition "Nevertheless not my will but Thine be done." A symbol, though good as a symbol, is
                            not the thing symbolized, and an illustrative story, although it be paraboK ically
                            excellent, (possessing deep significational truth) yet when received as a literal fact it
                            becomes like dry-rot in sound lumber. A book may be suggestive and contain beautiful and
                            appropriate passages but lo reverence a book, because it teaches, or a man because he
                            preaches is of a piece with the act of employing an automatic praying machine to grind out
                            our supplications. But milk is good for "babes" and some people must be startled into
                            believing and then held to it by some figure on the blackboard which the eye can see and the
                            wwenlightened mind can contemplate. "To defiue God" said Spinoza "is to destroy him." True!
                            for who by searching can find him out? What language can explain the "Sacred Mystery?" The
                            Divine recognizes the Divine and soul speaks to soul but worldly wisdom is foolishness with
                            God, (who has hidden "these things from the wise and prudent,") and material gain and
                            worldly honor weigh light, indeed, in the balances of Heaven. Concerning God, Hark says in
                            the "Unity of the Truth" "We no longer<pb n="255" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> ask for or need any feeble
                            definition of Him. We see Him. We feel Him. We love Him. Undefinable, because like only to
                            himself. Incomprehensible because himself comprehending all things." Let the church people
                            realize this, thinking less about themselves and the world and more about the welfare of
                            their fellow men and the ''mystery of Godliness" and the inquiry will cease to be made "What
                            is the matter with the churches." In a modern novel "A Midsummer Madness" occurs this
                            suggestive passage. Mrs. Este. "Everybody does everything for money now-a-days." Rodney. "No
                            they don't. Women marry for money I know and men accept the grossest materialism as the rule
                            of their lives. But good, honest, fair work is never done for money and for money alone."
                            "Religious" work done for money and prestige is not honest work. The man who preaches and
                            enforces doctrines, the truth of which he has never fairly enquired into, and even doubts,
                            is not an honest, fair man, he "accepts materialism as the rule of his lifr." And the
                            enquiring world knows it. There is a hidden "force" which separates the Divine wheat from
                            chaff� there is an "occult" understanding which detects the tares amongst the growing grain.
                            But merely eloquent preaching does not make it apparent� gorgeous church edifices do not
                            stimulate Christian humility, nor can "growth in grace" be purchased with the contents of
                            overflowing cash boxes. Yet there is perhaps no class of men more entitled to public
                            sympathy than the preacher class of America. The 1st. Napoleon once said that "too much was
                            expected of ecclesiastics and it made hypocrites of them." Let the men have liberty, liberty
                            to think and liberty to announce their convictions. Let them not be pinned down too closely
                            10 their creeds, let them feel that their honesty will not jeopardize their standing or
                            endanger the bread of their families. Should that day ever come there will be fewer
                            enquiries of "What is the matter?" For "where the spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty."

                                always be classes of decided good, and decided bad with a great variety of shades
                                between. From the origin of mankind to the present day, remarkable examples of
                                self-sacrifice and of righteousness have been wrought out, in whose path multitudes have
                                followed more or less correctly, and through this means preserved the government of man
                                from falling wholly into the charge of the destroyer. So early as the days of Abel, if
                                we may accept the history of those times, men began to call upon the name of the Lord,
                                for protection and guidance. They were soon designated by classes and probably were as
                                well known at that date, as we at the present time know the Christian and the Infidel.
                                One class styled themselves the sons of God and called the other class, the sons of men.
                                Special spiritual favors were conferred upon the first order, while the others were
                                sadly neglected. The wicked and those who love to do wickedly, have by no means been a
                                small company. They have at times filled the world with dreadful forebodings, especially
                                at that date when it was said of them, "Every imagination of the thought of his heart
                                was evil continually." This was, indeed, a dark day, as only one righteous man could be
                                found in all the earth. ISoah excites our interest, and we read with astonishment of the
                                wonderful work through which he passed in his anxiety to save himself and others from
                                destruction by the flood. Through all the earlier ages of mankind, and even to the
                                present, with all that might have held man in an uncivilized state, he has been moving
                                onward and upward toward a more liberal government and a higher state of morality. To
                                those who dream that a golden age has been with us and gone, no more to return, and to
                                those who picture to themselves the great glory of a future era this may not be accepted
                                quite so readily. The garden of Eden may have been to its possessors the loveliest spot
                                on the earth. God planted it, and coming directly from his hand it must have been
                                preeminently beautiful. Noah and his family may have sailed in the best vessel that the
                                world afforded, and yet the garden of Eden and Noah's Ark might not afford<pb n="257" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> much satisfaction to the people of today. We have that which belongs to
                                our age, and we trust that it is the best that can be at this time. A careful study of
                                the race, however, will be likely to throw much light upon the subject and show us that
                                with all the ills of this life, we are now in the enjoyment of more and greater
                                blessings than ever were known at an earlier date. If it so happens that a few persons
                                may be found, who are always looking on the dark side of life, and feel assured that
                                this world is full of iniquity, it does not prove their statements to be positively
                                true, but offers the chance for an investigation. Evil influences may be abroad in the
                                earth to an alarming extent, as they have been since the day that Cain and Abel held
                                their religious controversy. Goodness, however has always been in the ascendency since
                                the days of reliable history, and today, in a special manner, is seen on every hand,
                                exerting a controlling influence over the affairs of man. Man's humanity for man is
                                enlarging. Societies are forming or in active working order that carefully provide for
                                the poor, the aged and even for the abused little children. Domestic animals, those
                                faithful servants of man, that are not able to plead for themselves are also cared for
                                as never before. Indeed, God is good, in that he has provided for us a world so
                                beautiful, and in that he so kindly cares for all the objects of his creation. As
                                children of a merciful, heavenly Father, we should learn these lessons of goodness and
                                love, and make the work of righteousness the leading feature of life, that the record of
                                our journey in time may be a safe rule for all to follow who may pass over the same
                                road.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p"> Articles published in the Manifesto must be referred to the authors for any explanation that

                            Springs, N. H. Aug. 1889. A carriage drive through the country�this I have always regarded
                            as the pleasantest and most satisfactory way of traveling in the summer seaso::. Today we

                            Shirley Shakers, near Shirley Village, Mpss., giving a little of their surroundings and
                                history.<pb n="258" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> T have had the pleasure of au ac quaintance for inauy
                            years with John Whiteley. the elder arid deacon or temporal manager of this family of
                            Shakers. Mr. Whiteley often favors the Christian Union with a call when in Boston on
                            business. We were most cordially welcomed as we drove to the front door of th^ headquarters
                            by Elder Whiteley and Sister Mary Elston, who soon after took great pains to show us through
                            the several departments and buildings devoted to their work. Neatness, order, cleanliness,
                            quiet, with busy industry, impressed us on every side. This family of Shakers was gathered
                            in 1793. The chapel waa erected iu that year, a neat, pleasant room. It now has the same
                            paint on the walls and ceilings as put on so faithfully in 1793, and has never been touched
                            by the brush since that time, nearly 100 years. The farm contains 2500 acres. Hay crop this
                            year from 150 to 200 tons. They have a herd of Guernseys, Jerseys, Ayrshires, in all about
                            forty. Their principal barn, 120x42, is built near the foot of a high hill. The loads of hay
                            are driven in at the tipper part of the barn, the hay thrown off down the sides, the team
                            having space at the front end to be turned and then driven out at the entrance. They have
                            beautiful apple orchards; last year they gathered 1000 barrels. John Whiteley was born in
                            Yorkshire, England, not far from the birthplace of Rev. Robert Collyer. He was in Manchester
                            the day Queen Victoria was crowned, and joined in a temperance procession in her honor.
                            After coming to this country he engaged in wool-pulling. What led him at first to take any
                            interest in the Shakers was in the fact that one day his employer told him to buy for him in
                            the village some garden seeds, and to be very particular to buy thost^ put up by the
                            Shakers, as those they could always depend upon for a crop. This led him to look into their
                            religion, that he might learn ''why they were so honest in their dealings with the world.''
                            After much thought and study he gave up his work and became one of the Shirley Shakers. This
                            was forty years ago. Sister Mary Elston gave up her home at Lowell, and has for 40 years
                            been of this family at Shirley. Isaac Bailey is the eldest man of the family, being 84 years
                            of age, has been a member of the family 52 years (since 1837.) He said to us, '"I came from
                            my home in England to America before any steamer ever crossed the ocean ; was on a packet
                            nine weeks from England to Boston, and was settled here with this family of Shakers 'before
                            the Queen was crowned.' " The old house now stands in which Ann Lee was hidden away in a
                            closet when the furious mob assembled, determined to carry her away. This was in 1783. Mr.
                            Whiteley read to us a very interesting and thrilling account of the cruel and inhuman doings
                            of that wild mob of men who seemed to be filled with the very evil spirit of destruction to
                            this, then, small body of peaceful and orderly men and women.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="B., W. H." TEIform="persName"/>W. H.

                                the North Family of some sixty people, there are but few who use flesh meat, and these
                                few but little. Our experience is that vegetables, fruits and farinacea affoid ample
                                nourishment for all the normal wants of the system. The laborer is well supported and
                                the cook is much relieved. The moral and spiritual advantages are just what any
                                thoughtful person would naturally expect. With more freedom from disease comes more
                                comfort and cheerfulness ; peace flows easily, like a river toward the great ocean of
                                universal love to God, and good-will to the animal creation, including all the races of
                                mankind." Oct. 11. We have had a splendid Fall; no frost to do any damage. Have finished
                                picking our apples to-day and have about 600 bushels for winter. Potatoes will yield us
                                about one half a crop. Corn is first-rate. We cut up about all we raised, stalks and
                                ears and put it in the silo. It makes the nicest ensilage and yields the largest amount
                                of milk of any fodder that we have used. Corn put in the silo in this way, we think,
                                makes more butter, or full as much, as unripe corn-stalks with eight quarts of wheat
                                bran, to a cow. On the 5th we had a lovely visit with the Ministry from Canterbury who
                                unconsciously are commencing the second travel or cycle. The testimony of the first
                                cycle was against the life of generation, and the lusts of the flesh. A glorious
                                foundation. The testimony of the second cycle is against a carnivorous life, and the
                                lusts of the stomach. Funeral of Br. D. F. on Sabbath-day. Elder Frederic says, "There
                                is no mourning in our house to-day, because a long-tried, faithful soul, has passed from
                                this old earth away. He passed through Father�Heavens, above, to Christ�the Resurrection

Beloved Editor ��Your correspondent from this place in Sept. No. of

                                We find it costs less to paint the buildings once in five or six years, than to wait
                                lunger. From eighteen acres of sweet corn, planted, we carried to Ihe Corn Factory,

                                which yielded but half a ton of hay to the acre, gave us forty-five dollars worth of
                                corn per acre with no manure, except 700 lbs. of Buffalo Phosphate to the acre. From
                                this corn planted, we had more than one hundred tons of silage, which we consider is

                                attention of the young people among Believers, who are interested in the study of the
                                Scriptures, which we are sure must be the case in every Society. We have asked a
                                question which will take research, thought, and spiritual jugdment to answer, and we
                                would like to hear from each one their own decision, and the result will be published in
                                the next Manifesto. We would like all answers to reach us by the fourteenth of the month
                                that they may be ready for the next issue. Let each answer be upon a separate slip of

                                appears before me. I seem to be in one of the main streets of a small village; children
                                are playing about the doors of the cottages. Before me a rod or two away in front of one
                                of the largest houses stands a group of men who s&gt;eem to be discussing some important
                                question. What is it? I draw nearer. In the center of the group sitting on a large stone
                                served as a step I see a man who seems to be instructing those around him. I look at him
                                more closely. I notice the high forehead, the bright blue eyes, the wavy hair and noble
                                form. His hand is raised as though to give more force to what he has to say. My eyes
                                turn towards one of two houses out of which comes a motherly looking woman. She is
                                leading a little girl by the hand while in her arms she holds another still younger
                                whose little eyes look up into her mother's face as though wondering what it all meant.
                                She walks toward the crowd. As she reaches the outer edge one of the men speak to her in
                                a reproving tone. I do not catch the words, but I see the eyes of the woman drop and her
                                face assumes a distressed look as she turns to go. But hark! the teacher in the center
                                has over-heard; he calls to the woman in a gentle tone and the crowd making room for
                                her, she .returns. He takes the children on his knee and places his hands on their curly
                                heads. His eye is lighted up with loving tenderness. He turns and addresses those around
                                him. The children look up into his face with innocent glee and many of the eyes of those
                                around him are moistened at the sight. By and by other mothers come, bringing their
                                children, and soon the gentle teacher is surrounded, not by gray-haired men, but by
                                laughing boys and girls. Can the imagination picture a more beautiful sight? A man in
                                the prime of life whose dark hair is spotted hc-e and there with gray from the many
                                cares already borne, surrounded by innocent childhood which knows nothing of the cares
                                and trials of life. But this scene cannot always last, soon it is interrupted and the
                                children go bacK to their plays all unconscious of the effect they have made on the
                                hearts of those around them, and the lesson they leave to be learned wherever the gospel
                                of Jesus is taught. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            leader of all opposition to religion, and always ready to publish abroad the inconsistencies
                            or short-comings of any who were professors of religion. After a time he concluded to remove
                            from the place to a distant part of the country, and meeting the leading minister of the
                            village one day, after the usual salutations, he said, "Well, I suppose you know that I am
                            going to leave town soon, and you will probably be very glad of it." "Glad of it? Why no,"
                            said the minister, "you are one of our most useful men, and I shall hardly know how to spare
                            you." Taken aback by such an unexpected reply, the other immediately asked, "How is that?
                            What do you mean by saying I am useful, or that you will miss me when I am gone?" "Because,"
                            said the minister, "not one of our sheep can get foot out of the fold but you bark from one
                            end of the town to the other, and so show yourself one of the most useful watch-dogs that I
                            ever knew. I don't know where we shall find any one that can supply your place." The rebuke
                            struck home, and the fault-finder, with a crestfallen look, went on his way.</p><pb n="263" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/></div2><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beautiful shore" TEIform="index"/> BEAUTIFUL SHORE.</head><p TEIform="p">Andante.

                            satisfaction. As diminutive as it externally appears, it is a luminary, a star in the
                            heavens of no ordinary magnitude, which I hope may never be suffered to go down. Its light
                            cannot be mistaken, and serves as an important missionary in the field of true Christian
                            progress. The late addition of Society items, are of interest, and like a dessert at the
                            feast-table. By these histories, as brief as they may be, we have epistles which serve to
                            bring kindred souls nearer to each other, and well calculated to increase our interest in
                            each other's welfare and to strengthen our holy union. I trust each Society of our order
                            will be liberal in its contributions. Enfield N.

2.    Die   um    Aufnahme   Erfuchenden

Seele   und  bes   K�rpers  f�r  die   edlen
Grundf��e, nach welchen die Gefellfchaft
gehalten wird.
  3. Alle, welche fich bei uns aufhalten,

5.    Eltern, die MitgIieder werden, m�gen
die Dbhut ihrer Kinder behalten.   Minderj�hrige werden nie in die Gefelfchaft aufgenommen,   ausgenommen   auf   Erfuchen
oder  Einwilligung  jener,   die   gefe�liches
Anrecht auf fie haben.
6.    Keine f�rperliche Strafe wird in der

11.    Wir erwarten von �erfonen, welche

daher ift es ein wichtiger Grundfa� in der
Shafer-Gemeinde,   ein   S�nden-Befenntni�   zu   Gott   in   Anwefenheit
eines Zeugen abzulegen.
