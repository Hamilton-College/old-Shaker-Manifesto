                            Columbia Co., N. Y., in the eighty-fifth year of his age, without sickness and without pain.
                            The North Family at Mount Lebanon, where Elder Frederick had remained for sixty-three years,
                            may never produce a more remarkable or notable character. He presided as Elder of said
                            family for fifty-seven years and until last November. Some years ago by invitation of a
                            friend, he wrote his autobiography for the Atlantic Monthly. This article was afterwards
                            republished with a compilation of other articles relating to Shakerism, in Glasgow,
                            Scotland, in 1888, in a book of two hundred and seventy pages, under the title of "The
                            Autobiography of a Shaker." From this book we quote the following: ' 'I see great importance
                            in a principle�very little in an individual. Not of myself should I write of myself, but in
                            the hope that others may be advantaged thereby, I acquiesce in the foregoing suggestion. I
                            have always lived much in the future, yet my present life has been a practical success;
                            while my work has ever been before me, my reward has always beeu witli me. 1 am satisfied
                            with the continued realizations of the prophetical spirit within�of the abstract principles
                            that have been my inner life." "My father's family were of the middle class in England. They
                            were long lived, my grandmother reaching the advanced age of one hundred and four years, and
                            my grandfather approaching one hundred. My father, George Evans, was the youngest of twelve
                            children, and died comparatively young. He was sent into the English army; was under Sir
                            Ralph Abercrombie in the Egyptian expedition, co-operating with the fleet under Nelson, and
                            held a commission in the service. My mother was of a class a little above, so that the
                            marriage caused a perpetual breach between the two families. Her name was Sarah White. I was
                            born in Leominster, Worcestershire, England, on the 9th of June, 1808. The first fact that I
                            can remember may be of some interest to the student in anthropology. When I came of age, and
                            on my return to England in 1830, I was relating to an aunt on my father's side, whom I
                                had<pb n="106" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 106 THE MANIFESTO. never before seen, that I had
                            always stored up in my memory one thing which I could not account for; I could remember
                            nothing before or after it to give it a meaning, and none of my mother's relatives knew
                            anything about it. I saw the inside of a coach, and was handed out of it from a woman's arms
                            into those of some other person. My aunt was utterly astonished and stated that my mother
                            was coming down from London to Birmingham, when I was not more than six months old, that
                            something happened to the horses which frightened the party badly, and that I was handed out
                            (just as I had seen and remembered) by my mother into the arms of another person." "When I
                            was four years of age, my mother died and I was thrown among her relatives, who sent me to
                            school at Stourbridge, where there were some two hundred scholars; and the position the
                            master assigned me was that of the poorest scholar in the school, which effected my release
                            from the school-room, to my great satisfaction and peace of mind; for if there was one thing
                            more than another that I hated, it was school books and an English school master with his
                            flogging proclivities. I was then about eight years old." He then gives an interesting
                            account of how he was cast among his uncles and aunts; of the farm life at Chadwick Hall and
                            how he rebelled at being educated; of his father and brother visiting him and his choice to
                            go with them to America, when twelve years old. He describes his brother, George H. Evans,
                            the great land reformer and associate of Horace Greeley, and his home at Binghamton, N*. Y.,
                            where an aunt of his made the remarkable prophecy that of all the young people belonging to
                            the three families of his father and his uncles, Frederick, though then a black sheep among
                            them, "would yet occupy the most desirable position in life," which came to pass. He goes on
                            to say: ' 'I now took a sudden turn in respect to books and learning. I saw that knowledge
                            was not only power, but that it wag also respect and consideration. I made up my mind that I
                            would learn to read and love to read. My first dose was the 'Life of Nelson;' then I set
                            myself to reading the Bible through by course; and I did it. And here I made a discovery (or
                            rather my friends did,) that my memory was so retentive that whatever I read was, as it
                            were, pictured on my brain. I had only to look at the picture to see it in all its minutest
                            particulars without any effort. And (as Lincoln would say) this reminds me of what a woman I
                            met on a Hudson river boat said; that in coming from California, she was nearly drowned, but
                            before consciousness was gone0 all the sins of her life were present to her view ; not one,
                            however small was missing." ' 'I next went to Ithaca and put myself to school to an
                            Episcopal minister, who proved a real friend. One of his first lessons was to teach me how
                            to think. He had only a dozen scholars and we were all well attended to. I became with him a
                            great favorite, and the times of intermission were largely devoted to my special instruction
                            and benefit. At parting, he advised me<pb n="107" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 107
                            always so to live that I could respect myself, and that has ever since been my life motto.
                            Next, I apprenticed myself at Sherburne Four Corners, N. Y., to learn the hatting business.
                            There, I had access to a library of valuable books, and I took to reading -Rollins' Ancient
                            History,' 'Plutarch's Lives of Great Men,' the 'Tattler' and the 'Spectator,' and Zimmerman,
                            Shakespeare, Watts, Young, Thomson, Socrates and Plato. I also took up theology and asked
                            myself, why I was a Christian, and not a Mahometan, or a follower of Confucius ? for I ha*d
                            read the Koran and the Bibles of all peoples that I could obtain. I read Locke 'On the Human
                            Understanding,' and 'The Being of a God.' This laid in me the foundation of materialism. For
                            I came to the conclusion that matter was eternal, had never been created. Thomas Paine's
                            'Crisis' and 'Rights of man,' together with Volney and Voltaire, were also among my
                            friends." "I became a settled and firm materialist�a believer in matter, as I then
                            understood it, the object of my external senses ; for I did not then know that I had any
                            other senses. This continued to be my condition until I met with the Shakers, some five
                            years afterwards. I possessed this one great advantage, that what I did believe was true,
                            however much there might be true that I did not believe." In the following chapters, Elder
                            Frederick tells of his conversion to the socialistic theories of Robert Owen and to
                            communism, and of his visit to a community of this kind at Massilon, Ohio. On this journey
                            to the West, he traveled mostly on foot in preference to any other way, walking sometimes
                            forty miles a day. In 1829, he returned to England, where he remained about a year. He then
                            came back to New York and assisted his brother, George H. Evans and others, in perfecting
                            plans for a new community, and was deputed to travel for information and to find a suitable
                            location in which to start. "At this time, we had in New York," he says, ' 'a Hall of
                            Science, and Robert Dale Owen and Fanny Wright were among its great lights." In the year
                            1830, he called to see the United Society of Believers at Mt. Lebanon, and was directed to
                            the North House, as the proper place for inquirers. Here he was agreeably surprised and
                            impressed by the air of candor and openness and the quiet self-repose with which he was met.
                            After a week's inquiry, he pronounced the Shakers a Society of infidels, and declared that
                            it was the first time he had found religionists who were also rationalists, ready to render
                            a reason for the faith and hope that were in them. He further says: ' 'The Shakers prayed
                            for me and I was met in my own path by spiritual manifestations during several weeks, until
                            my reason was as entirely convinced by the evidence I received of the existence of a spirit
                            world, as I am by evidence presented to my outer senses, of the existence of our material
                            earth." "After three month's absence, Ireturned to New York, to face for the first time my
                            astounded materialistic friends, to whom a more incomprehensible change could not have
                                happened<pb n="108" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 108 THE MANIFESTO. than my apparent defection
                            from their ranks. As soon as my arrival in the city was known, there was a gathering at my
                            brother's office. The room was well filled; many older than myself, to whom I had looked as
                            my superiors in knowledge and experience, were present. At first there was a little
                            disposition shown by a few to be querulous and bantering, while the greater part took it as
                            a serious matter to be righted by solid argument." "I called the attention of the company,
                            and inquired whether any of them wished to give me any information concerning
                            materialism�its principles ? All said, 'No ! you do not need it.' I then inquired if any one
                            present was acquainted with Shakerism? and again the answer was 'No!' Then, gentlemen, I
                            rejoined, it is for you to listen and for me to speak. And I did speak ; and gave them as
                            simple an account of my experience thus far as I was able." "I also had a separate interview
                            with Robert Dale Owen at the Hall of Science. At its close he remarked: 'I will come up to
                            New Lebanon and stay two months, and if I find things as they now appear I will become a
                            Shaker.' I still await his arrival. In course of time all of them became Spiritualists. Who
                            sowed the seed?" ' 'I joined myself to the order and became a Shaker. I have now (1868) had
                            thirty-eight years' experience and feel satisfied with the goodness of God and his people to
                            me. I have gained a degree of victory over self which causes my peace to flow as a river,
                            and which fills me with sympathy for all seekers after truth and righteousness." In the
                            transition of Elder Frederick, ends the career of a prophetic, inspirational man of God�a
                            man, as a dear friend lately expressed it, wiio always found the seed that grows the broad
                            leafed and glowing tasseled flower. In his public capacity as a minister of the gospel of
                            Christ in his second appearing he was equaled by none. Twice he has been on a missionary
                            trip to England, in 1871 and again in 1887, the last time visiting Scotland also. Upon both
                            occasions he was accompanied by our friend and brother James M. Peebles, M. D"., the
                            "Spiritual Pilgrim," for whom he entertained the warmest sympathy and love. Physically,
                            Elder Frederick was strong and vigorous, and remarkably well preserved for one so advanced
                            in age. This condition may be measurably attributed to his hygienic manner of living, having
                            been a vegetarian for about sixty years, and to his regular and systematic habits. With a
                            nature susceptible to the weal or woe of mankind, a heart full of love, compassion and
                            charity, and a soul redeemed from the lusts of the flesh and of the mind and made clean and
                            white, he could the more readily perceive how to reach the hearts of the people and make
                            them feel the truth for which he pleaded. His plain, straightforward arguments could not
                            well be disputed, and if they were, discussion of some length was sure to follow. Tenacity
                            for the right, as he saw it, was a prominent feature in his character, and so clearly was it
                            defined to him that he would fain have every one believe as he believed. Happily his faith
                            was founded on the truth,<pb n="109" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 109 based upon
                            the rock of divine revelation. Many a time-worn, weary traveler has stopped amid the fevered
                            heat and rush and wrangling of the surging crowd, to drink of the cup and to eat of the
                            testimony of truth, of which he was an exponent, till it became their life, even as it was
                            his. It was his meat to do the will of his Heavenly Father, and his drink to feel the love
                            of his Heavenly Mother. This was his treasure, and for it he sacrificed worldly honor, fame
                            and renown. His many friends in the outside world will miss the noble form, the kindly face
                            and the proffered hand of the grand old man. As a reformer among reformers, he saw afar off
                            the danger signal and promptly gave the alarm. He led the opposition to the Sunday closing
                            of the world's fair and was emphatic upon the separation of church and state, and not less
                            so in demanding equity as the only solution of the labor problem. The leading topics of the
                            day in the world of social and political thought constantly occupied his mind and moved his
                            pen. A few days before passing out, he made these remarks: "We are living in a world of
                            ideas. Napoleon said in his day the next war would be a war of ideas; how much more does it
                            apply to this, our day ! " To the Society of Believers, he was a watchman on the tower of
                            Zion, one of her main standard bearers and a mouth-piece from which issued words of eternal
                            truth. To his own home and family he was strongly attached and the attachment was mutual. We
                            loved him as our father; he loved us as his children. We saw in him a life hid with Christ
                            in God, a life made manifest by good deeds, a life ever green, even as the groves about our
                            home which he planted, trimmed and cultivated with his own hands. And now the silver cord is
                            loosed and the golden bowl is broken at the cistern and the pitcher broken at the fountain.
                            The spirit will not only return to God, who gave it, but also to his own, and his own will
                            receive him and know him ; for is he not now, as always, a ministering angel, sent to us who
                            shall be the heirs of salvation? The spirit of prophecy was upon him to the end. At times
                            during his last hours, he sung parts of the following verses, which he wrote and published
                            in "The Shaker," when he was editing that publication about twenty years ago under the

                            human soul, is very ancient. It has and does exist among barbarous as well as highly
                            cultivated races. Its basis seems to be the instinctive belief in a continuous existence,
                            influenced by the fear of death and the desire for life. It has given rise to the noblest
                            thoughts and profoundest speculations the unaided human mind is capable of; and the*
                            grossest superstitions and the most absurd puerilities are founded upon it. In the Phsedo of
                            Plato, treating of the Immortality of the Soul, the Greek intellect reached high-water mark;
                            modern philosophy can add nothing to it, except it be derived from another source. But it is
                            among the swarming millions of India that this doctrine has found its most numerous
                            adherents and reached its fullest development. The Brahminical and Buddhist religions teach
                            that the soul must undergo an almost endless cycle of births before it becomes fitted for
                            union with Brahman, or reach Nirvana; that conduct in this life will determine the nature of
                            the next birth; if good, a higher grade awaits it; if evil, a lower condition will result.
                            They have constructed an elaborate system that assumes to decide the penalty or reward for
                            every action. He who steals a Brahmin's money will pass a thousand times into the bodies of
                            spiders, snakes and other unpleasant things; if he steals grain, he becomes a rat; if milk,
                            a crow; if sirup, a dog, etc., etc; while virtue will cause souls to re-appear in the form
                            of teachers, hermits, kings, and demigods. Buddhaism holds that a man's-demerits may change
                            him into a woman, a slave, an animal, a plant, or a stone; he may make his appearance in one
                            of one hundred and thirty-six hells where the shortest term is ten millions of years; or his
                            meritorious life will land him in one of the many heavens where the least duration of
                            enjoyment is ten billions of years. But no matter what his state of misery or happiness has
                            been, or how long it has endured, it must come to an end and he must be born again, and then
                            his position may be completely reversed. One who has been a blessed spirit may be
                            transformed into the vilest object on earth, and an inmate of hell may become a god. No
                            wonder that their one chief desire is to become mergad into Nirvana, a state of which
                            forgetfulness, rest, sleep and absorption, seem to be the constituent elements. Some
                            features of this system are not without usefulness. It is related of Buddha that in order to
                            call the attention of the monks of a monastery to the importance of maintaining order and
                            cleanliness, he pointed to a broom<pb n="111" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. Ill and
                            told them that it had once been a monk who had been negligent in his duty of sweeping the
                            hall of assembly. Now let me refer you to that memorable night interview between Jesus and
                            Nicodemus. "Except a man be born again he can not enter the kingdom of God. That which is
                            born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit," are the
                            Master's words. Read of God's infinite love for the world, sending his son to save it, not
                            to condemn it; not to subject his erring children to hopeless despair and endless torments,
                            but to make it possible for all to be saved from their sins by faith, repentance and good
                            works. Plato reasoned high and well of immortality, yet he was but groping in darkness till
                            the Light of the World illumined the path of man; Buddha might honestly seek by prayer,
                            fasting, meditation and poverty to gain a little better state for the next birth, but Jesus
                            teaches that whosoever believeth in him shall have everlasting life. This change of purpose,
                            heart and life, this faith, cometh even as the wind bloweth. There is no time set for it, no
                            place appointed, it cannot be bought, learning will not obtain it, self-torture will not
                            gain it; only the abiding faith and trust that blossoms into a continuous righteous endeavor
                            secures the second and final birth that leads to full redemption and immortality. How
                            beautiful this is, how completely according with the design of a wise and good God; how
                            sublimely spiritual in conception and operation, how plain and simple, adapted to the needs
                            and understanding of poor mortals; and how ludicrously wretched and absurd, how fatal in its
                            consequences, dividing the people into inseparable castes, degrading woman, destroying hope,
                            paralyzing industrial activity and intellectual effort, how grossly materialistic, is this
                            cruel, God-less Eastern nightmare of re-incarnation! And, finally, since the experiences of
                            all these multitudinous births are lost and forgotten, they are valueless, and the miserable
                            soul becomes the mere plaything of fate and chance; while he who is spiritually born again
                            is fully conscious of having entered the higher life. These lines have been written because
                            of the frequent anouncement in a Western paper which is advocating a new system of theology
                            and cosmogony, including apparently the doctrine of re-incarnation, that Believers
                            unqualifiedly endorse that system. The editor and his friends have a perfect right to their
                            views, but they should not make claims which can not be substantiated. It has long been the
                            boast of Believers that they had no written creed, but they did have very decided opinions
                            as to theological ideas and a practical religious life. In the authorized publications we
                            frequently find the phrase "the present faith of the Church," which of course was the
                            logical development of the faith taught by Mother and the first Elders, which faith was
                            based upon the gospel of Jesus Christ. Is it not time yet to get together and formulate the
                            present faith and further development from the platform of former days ? We don't want a
                            cast iron creed, but we need a statement of principles upon which all can<pb n="112" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 112 THE MANIFESTO. agree, leaving plenty of room for individual
                            opinions, but avoiding confusion and looseness of essential doctrines, which inevitably
                            result in laxity of discipline and disregard of essential precepts and requirements. West

                            remembrance. She entered the Community at White Water, O., about forty-seven years ago? and
                            after living there some ten years, she moved to Watervliet, O., which has been her home from
                            that date. Our Sister has always been a faithful Believer, and her kindness was to all
                            without partiality. Her spiritual interest in the prosperity of souls remained active during
                            all of her gospel experience. Although of such an advanced age, she remarked a short time
                            before her death;� "I believe in doing all the good I can, and I think that is the way to
                            gather souls to the work of the gospel." She was faithful in every duty. The temporal and
                            the spiritual interests were all carefully considered, and she would say:�"We must not be
                            idle and rust out. We must be interested for the good of our gospel home." Sister Mary now
                            goes to receive her great reward, and in this there can be no doubt. What is one profited if
                            in gaining the treasures of this world, the soul is lost? We want to save our souls, and
                            assist in the saving of other souls, so far as we are able. The world has nothing for us,
                            and our time is lost in seeking for those perishable treasures. We will search for spiritual
                            treasures that we may enter the kingdom of heaven. Let us keep ourselves pure and clean that
                            we may be able to meet our Heavenly Father, and his chosen flock. Glory to God in the
                            highest. Watervliet, O.</p></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">[We are pleased to present to our readers, the letter written by Elder Harvey L.

                            sit down to write to you can not be described, and you will not think strange of it, I
                            presume, when you learn the reasons. I arrived at this place in good health and without
                            harm, on Thursday evening the 28th inst. and found the Ministry and people in health and
                            prosperity, so far as I have been able to learn. On Friday morning, the 29th, the Ministry
                            informed me that it was felt best for me to be released from all burden and care, and to
                            make my home at Union Village. Notwithstanding it is the greatest cross that I have ever met
                            in my life, yet you see, I have no choice left me. Yet this is the gift of God for me and I
                            submit to it with as much cheerfulness and fortitude as I am able and trust and believe that
                            you all, my dear gospel friends will do likewise. 1 always believed in going with the gift,
                            in simple obedience to that which was before me. I never found comfort nor blessing in any
                            other way, nor ever expect to, hence, I would sooner lay down a half dozen lives than to

                            think or say, "If he must be released, why not stay at home ?" My natural reason would be as
                            ready to ask this question as any one of you, seeing that T feel in myself that I could walk
                            in simple obedience in any order then. But these things are not for us to ask or question.
                            And now permit me, I beg of you, my good Brethren and Sisters, to give you one word of
                            counsel in this my last and farewell address :�"Have faith in the gift of God. Be cheerful,
                            knowing that we are God's heritage and that He will take care of his own, and will not
                            neglect, nor forsake them. Do not judge the gift of God, I beseech you, nor cast reflections
                            on any one in regard to this change. Remember, the greater our crosses and tribulation, if
                            we bear them cheerfully, the brighter we shall shine. Do not reflect on any one. Censure no
                            one, for you will be sure to be wrong and on whomsoever the anointing may rest, gather to it
                            in love and respect, and God will respect and reward you in so doing. You may know and feel
                            assured that the hand of God is in it, and who can withstand God? Who can search out his
                            ways? no one;�therefore touch not the Ark nor look therein, lest his displeasure rest upon
                            us as a flaming sword. Receive these my farewell words to you, my love and blessing. I feel
                            a glow of comfort in Qne reflection, that is, I leave you without a single unpleasant
                            feeling against any soul, and I believe you all love me, and O may it never grow cold. I
                            will only add,�I was doing and had done the best I was able in supporting the order of the
                            gospel and work of God while I was with you, nevertheless I do desire in humbleness of body
                            and spirit, to say, that if I ever have said or done any thing, at any time, that has been
                            any loss to any one, or that has hurt the feelings of any one, aged or young, Brother or
                            Sister, I do beg of you to be so kind as to forgive me, and I promise I will be no dishonor
                            to you wherever I may be called. It is not necessary to add more, but I desire to be
                            remembered in your prayers. Farewell, Most Affectionately,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Eads, Harvey L." TEIform="persName"/>Harvey L.

                            you are engaged; but as we know that labor rightly directed is worship, that the promise to
                            the faithful, "As thy day is, so shall thy strength be;" and further, that the God we love
                            and worship, is a just rewarder of each worker, according to his works, we can surely hope

                            knowledge and understanding, a blessing, a treasure that will more than compensate. In the
                            great store-house of God's love, there is enough for all. None need grudge another; but
                            according to the measure they have earned and received, so will their love be expansive, and
                            the more earnest their desire that others should share with them. So in this sense and

                            renewed energy and zeal to do battle for the truth and the pure way of God. We have been
                            blessed by a short visit from our true-hearted friend, Elder George Wilcox, from Enfield,
                            Conn., who gave us a rather thrilling description of his experience in going to and
                            attending the funeral of beloved Elder F. W. Evans, who, it seems, departed without sickness
                            or pain, the physical part worn out, and simply standing still like a clock run down; but
                            the spirit alive and wide awake and passing on to wider spheres of usefulness. Thus may it
                            be with all who are left. Joined in the bonds of pure love here, we can not be severed from
                            those who have gone before, for in Christ "There is no death," except to worldly elements
                            and the conditions they produce and foster. From all of which we pray, "Good Lord, deliver
                            us." Spring-time is at hand. The wood yards are being cleared up, and active preparations
                            being made for spring work generally. Small patches of snow still left. Too early to tell
                            what the effect of the extreme cold in January, before the snows came, may have had on
                            winter grains, of which we sowed considerable for a New England farm. We try hard to keep
                            our union with each other and all that is good. Our town, at last town meeting, broke her
                            clean record, and voted for license. We hope sincerely we may be preserved from the evil
                            effects which ordinarily follow such action, and trust that one year's trial may be enough
                            to satisfy a majority, at least, that weak humanity needs no such inducements to go the
                            downward way. Shirley is a lovely town, in location and picturesqueness, and has some good,
                            earnest men. The influx of a foreign element to help her growing manufactures, is a
                            threatening danger to her record of a peaceful past. But as all things work together for
                            good; to the good, we hope good may come out of even this. With kindest wishes from your
                            Shirley readers and friends.

                            we often realize, and it is as truly applied to earthly existence. Though seed-time is here,
                            still we are in the midst of winter, the ground being cold, frozen and unyielding, like too
                            many of mankind, unwilling to receive the good seed, and if sown will not grow. But as the
                            Lord sends his rain as well as sunshine to the just and unjust we shall have to abide in
                            patience, for the sun's rays to warm the earth and make it fit for the growth of vegetation.

                            the harvest is great we have to struggle to keep the separation, for there are always some
                            that seek for self-ease and selfish comfort, rather than sacrifice all for Christ's sake and
                            the gospel. Perhaps there are too many anti-shakers that expect to get to heaven through the
                            labors and exertions of those who have gone on before, and by their good works beg St. Peter

                                over again, to the end that it may be established in the heart, there are some things
                                that being less understood than others, demand more attention through extended
                                illustrations. Some of these may appeal so directly to the order of mind that exists at
                                the present time among men, that the thought of controversy on the subject may never be
                                entertained. The commandment which says,'Thou shalt not kill," has become so thoroughly
                                engrafted into the life of the civilized and religious classes that a trespass on this
                                point shocks our whole being, as something awful, and a crime against both God and man.
                                Less depth of thought may hold us in contemplation, on the growth of acquisitiveness;
                                and the order, "Thou shalt not steal," grows so dim in the eyes of the majority that
                                they often lose sight of the command and accept it as a mere suggestion, convenient
                                under certain circumstances, but of no especial value. Jesus, however, was very explicit
                                on these subjects, and gave his disciples to understand that all these moral precepts
                                were essential, and should become a part of the life of those who wished to grow into
                                the spirit of righteousness. He spoke of the Law and of the necessity of keeping it as
                                it was given through God's ministers, that it might be fulfilled in the lives of those
                                who professed to be his disciples. Although the Law was the life saving work to those
                                who accepted it, yet "a more excellent way" was being revealed in this jnew
                                dispensation, having in it more of the blessings of humanity, with the added, crowning
                                grace of an inspiring spirituality. The disciples were instructed to regard these moral
                                precepts of an earlier age, while at the same time they were urged to love their

                                them as they did for themselves. Jesus brought forward, very carefully, some remarkable
                                instances of self sacrifice, by which to illustrate this Christian principle, but
                                through the selfishness of the human heart they have failed, to a large extent, in
                                becoming permanently interwoven into the interests of life, and even at this date the
                                saints and sinners are equally at a loss to determine who may or who may not be a
                                neighbor, while there are about as many shades of conjecture on the point as there are
                                individuals. A more familiar acquaintance with the spirit of the gospel of the New
                                Testament, may lead us into new, and better relations with mankind, and be to us a
                                Teacher of righteousness. On some of the lines of gospel teaching, either through
                                ignorance or by willfully perverting the text, more or less obscurity is found to exist
                                and the truth is sometimes glossed over to that extent that it is made to present a very
                                different aspect. Jesus through his faithfulness in obeying the voice of God, was early
                                called a son of God, and pre-eminently occupies that position, although others who have
                                accepted and been led by the spirit of God have received the same honorable name. His
                                life so wrought out in righteousness, so consecrated to God and to the good of humanity,
                                was to all others who should love him, and believe on him, an example, a pattern, a
                                spiritual physician. To follow him into the many duties of life, will insure success. To
                                emulate his wise and powerful course as we walk among men would, indeed, lead us on to
                                become the sons of God. His life was a life in God or a life in regeneration. It was a
                                new, spiritual life, made so by the renewing of the Holy Spirit. As was his life, so
                                should be the life of his discipleGeneration, so closely allied to what some love to
                                denominate "the first, great command," belonged to the teachers of another order. The
                                Mosaic Law recognized the generative relation and encouraged it, and in God's name
                                surrounded it with laws and ordinances to keep it, if possible, within the boundaries of
                                propriety as understood in that age of the world. If by any means Moses can be
                                denominated a Messiah, then he was the Messiah of generation, while Jesus being educated
                                under a very different ministration was the Messiah of regeneration, or the Messiah of a
                                "new and living; way." By many who enjoy the name of Christens or of antichristians,
                                this seems to be one of the mist obscured subjects, and they seem determined to make
                                Jesus a teacher of generation, the same as was Moses. Occupying, themselves, a low,
                                sensual plane, they are far more anxious to<pb n="118" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 118 THE
                                MANIFESTO. draw the Son of God down to their own level, and to their works of darkness,
                                than to take up their crosses and rise to the plane on which Jesus the Christ has laid
                                the foundation of his church. Dunlavy with characteristic plainness says:�"Marriage and
                                the order of the flesh have neither part nor lot in Christ, as is proved by the doctrine
                                of Christ." Paul, through force of circumstances, felt obliged, no doubt, to lower the
                                standard of the cross of Christ, as he preached to the Mormons of Corinth, through the
                                hope of saving some to a higher spiritual work. And many Christians of the present day,
                                seemingly enjoy the idea of making generation and generative Christianity of superlative
                                value in the redemption of the world. Generation may be all well enough for the class to
                                whom it belongs, and under the rule of God's laws for man, it may still be the "very
                                good" of Genesis, but it can not be called Christian nor in any way be after the example
                                of Jesus the Christ.</p></div3><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p">Please write the articles that are intended for publication on slieets of

                                poet, and so we say, when realizing how little we know from hour to hour what weather to
                                expect. Mark Twain in humorously describing New England weather, says he has counted one
                                hundred and thirty-six kinds of weather inside of twenty-four hours. This can be
                                literally true when we consider that all the weather we have is inside of some
                                twenty-four hours; there is no other place to have it. Be that as it may we agree with
                                Mark Twain when he says, that New England can not hold all her weather, it is bulging
                                out on every side, and that is why we, who are so near the border line, are favored with
                                such a variety. On the 4th inst. the mutterings of distant thunder were heard, and the
                                air seemed sultry. On the morning of the 6th we awoke to find one of the most beautiful
                                weather pictures of the year, spread out before us. The ground was covered with snow
                                eight inches deep, which had fallen so lightly, that the most slender twig had its
                                share, without disturbance. When the sun rose the clouds fled, and over all this
                                whiteness, was the brightest blue dome of sky that ever bounded our vision. As we gazed
                                about us with delight, we could easily imagine that we were in fairy land, or were
                                looking at a panoramic picture, so perfectly calm were all the forces of Nature. But
                                this part of the panorama was soon designed to move on, and at noon of the 7th we were
                                wading knee deep in as severe and blinding snow storm as we cared to experience, over
                                paths which an hour before were innocent of even moisture enough to call for rubber
                                overshoes. This, too, soon passed away, and the 8th gave us a succession of electric
                                storms with heavy rain, from 11 a. m. until 3-30 p. m. This is variety enough, we think,
                                to suit even the most changeable, and we can all enjoy the part we like best. But what a
                                commonplace subject for Home Notes. The weather�which all know so much about. What else
                                can we write of? Spring? Every one knows about that also. Wood is being sawed and split?
                                That part of the programme always comes with the bluebirds and robins. One special
                                blessing is ours. Beautiful flowers in our dwelling house all winter, made a possibility
                                by our steam heat. If steam heat does have its unpleasant feature, we forgive and forget
                                it all, when we realize that no place is too cool for the growth of some plant. The best
                                part of it all is the interest and care given them by some of the elderly people, who
                                intend to live in the beautiful Now, ignoring the custom of frequent comparison between
                                Now and Then. Those who live in Tuen, will never see the advantages of Now. Says the
                                writer, "We need not be prophets, or apostles. The commonest life may be full of
                                perfection. The duties of home are a discipline for the ministries of heaven. Amelia ,/.

                                notes in the early morning. The robins and bluebirds are among the best of our native

                                business. Left the 13th of March, but we have not been without a shepherd. The more we
                                study the subject, the more convinced we are that psychological influences are a strong
                                factor, and wield an important influence in human lives. Ever since our admittance into
                                the Society, we have realized to a greater extent than ever before, the influence of the
                                Mother spirit. Being the earthly home of our founder, her strong personality has
                                impressed itself upon the place. May we that are young drink deep of that maternal
                                inspiration to the uplifting and consecrating of our lives to this holy faith. How
                                blessed it is that Brethren and Sisters can dwell together in the bonds of pure love,

                                prepare the soil and sow seed. This we are actively engaged in. But not material seed in
                                earthly soil alone would we sow, we have sowing and planting of a superior kind to
                                attend to. We have an interesting company of young people in our family, who form what
                                they call "Our Educational, Ethical, Floral Circle." Educational, because it afford;
                                opportunities for education. Ethical, because good manners and morals, culture and
                                refinement are included. Floral, because each member is designated by a flower name
                                symbolic of brightness, cheerfulness and innocence. The circle denote equality as all
                                have equal opportunities, equal advantages and are equally compensated by making equal
                                exertions. They hold meetings bi-weekly in which very interesting original articles are
                                read, poems and dialogues recited, and one subject discussed verbally at each meeting.
                                Music vocal and instrumental is added. One of the members is chosen to preside over the

                                sow this garden with good seed, to have the rain of heaven (spiritual baptism) descend
                                thereon and the bright rays of God's sunshine (eternal truth) beam upon it, that
                                beautiful plants may be brought forth of knowledge, wisdom, righteousness and peace;
                                blessed fruits of the heavenly kingdom, and we therefore humbly and earnestly solicit
                                the prayers and good feelings of our gospel relation in our and their behalf. We can not
                                afford to give all our time and attention to the maintenance of these physical bodies.
                                We feel pressing upon us the responsibility of transmitting the testimony of this
                                beautiful gospel to other souls that they with us may help to carry on the grand work of
                                human progress and redemption. We fully indorse the ideas of Elder O. C. Hampton and are

                                advantage. Brain work tells better than muscle. We should not try to till too much land,
                                to do less and do it better may be the wisest. When spring comes it does not last long,
                                so we must spring to the work. Nothing is gained by planting too early. The secret of
                                having eggs in winter is to have pullets hatched in March or April that they may be
                                fully matured before cold weather. Leghorn pullets hatched in April should lay by the
                                first of November. The profits in poultry as in everything else, depends on proper
                                management. Hens pay cash for all labor bestowed on them. Good judgment in feeding hens
                                will produce good results. Too many chickens should not be kept in one flock. Daniel
                                Orcutt. April, 1893. We once more welcome the spring days with the merry voices of the
                                buds, and gladly bid adieu to ice and snow, although the past week there has been a cold
                                storm with three inches of snow which hastily disappeared being rather late for service.
                                The roads are now passable. Spring work will doubtless come forward rapidly as ploughing
                                has commenced. Our potatoes have sold readily the past month without any effort to
                                dispose of them. Painting and repairing our dwelling hotise &amp; being pushed
                                forward with rapidity, and the improvement of the heating apparatus is now considered a
                                good labor saving improvement and gives perfect satisfaction. Health prevails, and this
                                blessing with every other so bountifully bestowed, causes our hearts to overflow with
                                thankfulness and gratitude to God for his love.

                                removed. No one can so well help you as you can help yourself, unless they are equally
                                interested in you. If you have a job of work in hand, put yourself into action and do
                                it, and you will find much better results than to wait for some one to come along and do
                                it for you. The man or woman that is to succeed in tliis life must be filled with push
                                and principle. Be it spiritual, intellectual or physical gains,�they are as sure to
                                succeed as night is to follow day. In a more worldly point of view, it is not the man
                                nor woman who has had a thousand or thousands at the start of life, that has benefited
                                mankind the most; but it is those who have worked their way to the top of the mountain.

                                is by decision, by character and by courage that the price is won. We must have decision
                                and courage in a spiritual growth. Let us show our courage and our strength of
                                character. We have placed before us principles far more precious than gold or silver.
                                Let us contend for the imperishable treasures with the same zeal as did our forefathers,
                                that we may inherit the legacy that they have left for us, as disciples of the Christ.
                                We gladly welcome the merry songsters of the spring, after a long and severe winter. Our

                                unknown to us in the several months that have passed; and now we may speak only of the
                                living whose presence we are blest daily to enjoy. Nothing of remarkable interest is
                                moving at present date; each succeeding day brings its measure of care and burden with
                                willing hands and hearts for needed service. We are now in the midst of the maple
                                harvest anticipating everything sweet for a time at least. About seven hundred trees
                                were tapped which, for the most part, have yielded quite abundantly. If the weather
                                continues favorable we may derive some profit over and above the time and labor given.
                                We are likewise having some repairing done incident to this season of the year. The
                                bakers' oven is undergoing repairs; also masonry work at the laundry which required
                                greater safety as well as convenience. Other improvements are under consideration and
                                may receive attention in course of time adding beauty to our home and surroundings.
                                Sisters are as ever engaged in their several occupations where duty calls, striving to
                                keep the house in order as best they may. Health of our family quite good at present

                                thankfulness to God for his �wonderful workings in the hearts of his people, which are
                                abundantly manifested in our hours of worship. The sharp and powerfully inspired
                                testimonies of consecrated souls must be of a cleansing character for the holy, living
                                temple of God, whose temple we are. The world looking for something it can not find,
                                must yet come to Zion to hear the living word of the Lord. As Brethren and Sisters in
                                Clmst, O let us all be fully alert to duty's call and to our active possibilities, that
                                we may be able, when souls flock to our open windows, to have suitable abodes of
                                righteousness, where we can receive and successfully care for them. The little leaven
                                possessed by the small band of Believers on earth is to be the redeeming substance of
                                lost humanity. The pearl of great price has been entrusted to our keeping; let us make a
                                wise disposition of its benefits. As the seasons revolve bringing us the anxious
                                seedtime, let us as expert sowers, give due attention to the thorny and stony places as
                                well as to the good ground, and we can come again with rejoicing from a plentiful
                                harvest bringing our sheaves with us. Although we are emphatically told to put our hands
                                to work, it is not in the faithful performance of the daily duties alone, but when that
                                is supplemented by giving our hearts to God, then we secure the full results of our
                                mission. Our dairy supply of milk, cream and butter has maintained a uniformly superior
                                showing, all through the late severe winter, thanks to unusually good stock management.
                                The dooryard is at present the scene of some degree of activity in sawing, splitting and
                                housing about six hundred cords of fire wood, the work being done by the Brethren, with
                                the help of several hired men. Spring being backward with us, ploughing will not
                                commence for some time yet. Our water supply naturally gave us considerable anxiety
                                during the intense cold weather of the past winter; but trouble was altogether averted
                                by the adoption of timely preventive expedients. The water<pb n="123" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 123 used in all of our houses and barns is forced to a

To-day the weather seems a little flattering and we are too
                                ready to believe that winter is over. Cold weather has continued up to this time with
                                but few moderate days; and spring is surely a month later than it was last year. We have
                                lived through a very cold winter. Is the earth approaching another great glacial period?
                                It seems like it. The night of the (5th inst., about midnight, we had a storm of rain,
                                then hail and snow, with heavy thunder and lightning. The barn of one of our near
                                neighbors was struck and a cow killed, but the barn was not burned. On reading the notes
                                of last month's Manifesto, we see that our Brethren and Sisters, generally, have
                                experienced trying times with the freezing up of the water pipes. We have had the same
                                trouble with ours. Pipes laid four feet under ground have frozen and it will be some
                                weeks yet before they can be repaired. Our Brethren have lately purchased an eight H. P.
                                portable engine to take the place of a smaller one, which was considered unsafe, from
                                the throwing of sparks; and had to be forced to do the work required,�that of sawing
                                wood and cutting ensilage. They would like to be running the sawmill, but the logs are
                                encased in several feet of ice which has not even begun to break around the shores of
                                the mill-pond. Last year they commenced sawing the fourth of April with no ice to be
                                seen. We have lately received a large order for sweet corn seed, which we shall furnish
                                at three dollars per bushel, and the Brethren are hastening to have it in readiness when
                                called for. All are aware that the season is approaching when we shall be surrounded by
                                people from every nation, and realize the importance of being armed with that spiritual
                                strength which will administer to them instead of receiving of their spirits. Ada S.

The days pass swiftly and each day brings its round of duties,
                                still there seems to be little of interest to write about. The cold weather wore its
                                welcome out long ago, but it lingers with us. Here and there can be seen snow, just
                                enough to remind us of what has been. We would like some warm, pleasant weather after
                                all the cold we have had. Brethren have finished sawing and splitting the wood, and will
                                soon be busy on the farm. Strangers often inquire about our school, so think it would be
                                well to copv from the Town Report, what it has to say about it. "This school in its well
                                furnished and neat room, thorough and experienced teachers, tidy and obedient pupils,

                                It unroofed a part of the dwelling at the East family, and damaged the dwelling at the

No. 9.</head><p TEIform="p">What is sin according to the Shaker faith? Sin is a deviation from right, while
                            righteousness is to do right, to think right, to speak right and to act right. To pursue any
                            other course is wrong, crooked or sinful. Jesus says, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
                            his paths straight." To make crooked paths is not as Jesus taught, it is unrighteousness or
                            sin. To the Jew, sin was a transgression of the Mosaic Law. This was given of God for the
                            prosperity of the children of Israel and to hold them as a peculiar people, among the
                            nations. God wrote the Law on tables of stone, but at a later date he promised to write his
                            law in the hearts of his people, with this assurance, "I will be their God." To keep this
                            law is the beginning of wisdom, and no less a valuable lesson in practical righteousness,
                            while to depart from it inculcates unrighteousness, and is consequently a sin. This law so
                            essential to the Jew, was a system of discipline for a more advanced order of life, or it
                            served as a schoolmaster to bring the soul to Christ. Here was a higher light, a deeper
                            religious teacher, who carried his disciples into a righteousness that demanded of them a
                            greater self-denial and a closer walk with God To accept Christ we must accept his life, and
                            this becomes our salvation. Any neglect on our part to fulfill these sacred obligations, is
                            unrighteousness or sin against the light of God. A Christian Community must be established
                            on the foundation of righteousness, and its rules and regulations must protect it against
                            the elements of a worldly life. The spirit of God must enter into its government and be the
                            ruling influence of the whole order. To trespass upon this government, to teach contrary to
                            the protective principles of the Community is a trespass upon our religious obligations, an
                            injury to our God-given home, and consequently a sin against the Community and against God.
                            "Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life." Righteousness makes a
                            strait gate or path, but sin makes the path of life crooked. In the loving kindness of God
                            he promises to take from the Jews all the diseases of the Egyptians if they would<pb n="125" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 12fi only keep the Mosaic Law. It was indeed, a
                            very close test of a nation's righteousness, and yet it proved to have a very salutary
                            effect upon this wonderful nation. To see a sick Jew was, at once, an evidence that sin was
                            at his door. Jesus, after healing the sick man, said to him, "Behold, thou art made whole :
                            sin no more lest a worse thing come upon thee. This sick sinner must then go to the priest,
                            confess his sin against the Law, and make his offering of atonement. He possibly may have
                            eaten a piece of pork and as that was forbidden by the Mosaic Law he had need to confess it,
                            as does every Christian who eats the scrofulously diseased animal. Dr. Foote says, "Both man
                            and hog are intemperate eaters, and addicted to filthy habits, and while mankind are injured
                            by eating hog, a healthy animal to-day, would in time become diseased by eating man."</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="What is progress?" TEIform="index"/>WHAT IS
                            PROGRESS?</head><p TEIform="p"> [Contributed by H. DeGraw.] Extracts from Archbishop Ireland's Columbian Address. Progress is in man, it is
                            the growth of. man in the facilities and powers of his being, in his empire over inanimate
                            and irrational creation. There is no progress deserving the name where no provision exists
                            for the growth of man's spiritual nature. Progress is the continuity of creation, to arrest
                            it through malice or indolence is a crime against Creator and creature. Christ's gospel is
                            throughout a gospel of progress. I will never believe that good must necessarily yield to
                            evil�and hence I shall never cease to put my trust in the progress of humanity. The path
                            that has once been trod Is never so rough to the feet; And the lesson we once have learned
                            Is never so hard to repeat. Though sorrowful tears may fall, And the heart to its depths be
                            riven With storm and tempest, we need them all To render us meet for heaven.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Self-consciousness..." TEIform="index"/>Self-consciousness...

                                Co.,) the elaboration of character discussion is more than usually pronounced and more
                                than usually interesting. The editor of the Christian Union and preacher in Plymouth
                                Church, Dr. Lyman Abbott, is accorded first place with a sermon that exemplifies the
                                principles of mental science in a notable fashion. How they have accorded honor to Miss
                                Frances Willard in England is warmly stated by Lady Somerset over her signature. Orange
                                Judd is sketched appreciatively, with a portrait of the progressive advocate of American
                                farmers. F. Marion Crawford, the well known novelist, is carefully "phrenographed" from
                                life and an excellent portrait given. Professor Sizer continues his very taking series
                                on "Heads and Faces," and illustrates the woman's side of organization convincingly. Dr.
                                J. L. Capen talks of the objections of certain doctors that don't seem much like
                                objections when analyzed. A clear statement of what Psychometry is, answers a question
                                on that point. Mrs. C. F. Wells gives sketches of Mrs. Sarah Jane Hale, the Rev. Lucius

                                those in Audubon's great work, and am free to say that they are more accurate in outline
                                as well as more faithfully colored to nature." "A careful examination of this beautiful
