"OCR HEART'S DELIGHT" compiled
by Prof. Charles F. Escher, Jr. comes in
for a kind expression which, with the "pardonable pride" expressed by the Publishers, we give, for we possess the book. The
Author's aim to collect the gems of song
into a handy casket can but be highly appreciated by those who have been troubled to find the right piece at the righ fc time
and place. This excellence enhauces the
value of the book immensely. The portraits of the distinguished composers, together with the Biographical sketches are
especially to our liking. Veritable speaking pictures. This feature enables one to
read of, sing with and look into the faces
of these our musical friends with much
gratification. We could select other excellencies but it may be sufficient to say
that good paper, good music and a, good
deal of both, with fine workmanship in
printing, make a heavy and valuable
book, which we recommend to our friends
with genuine pleasure.
Buy it, and you will see why we speak
well of it.

Any Article that has outlived 22 years of competition

merit. Dobbins' Electric Soap

THAT   ARTICLE.       Those   who
use it each week, and their

the work. All that we can
say as to its merits, pales into

you will give it one trial. Ask

Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 9. Concerning the New
                            Lights, Continued. "April 21, 1804, John Miller, Amos Valentine and Joseph Stout, publicly
                            related the circumstances of their conversion, with which the clmrch was well satisfied and
                            gave them the right hand of fellowship, as worthy members of the suffering body of Christ.
                            Samuel Kimbel informed the church with tears, that he had wounded his own conscience and the
                            cause of God by associating with the wicked in a tavern, and tossing a dollar for whisky;
                            professed his abhorrence of such conduct and his determination to be more guarded in future.
                            The church was satisfied with his repentance and agreed that the offence be forgiven." J. F.
                            informed the church that he had been overtaken in a quarrel, in which he suffered anger to
                            rise in his breast, whereby the holy spirit was grieved. Yet as he did not manifest that the
                            leaven was purged out in such a manner as to feel the fellowship of that spirit which turns
                            the other cheek to the smiter, loves an enemy, and returns blessing for cursing ; the church
                            agreed that he be kept on suspense till further satisfaction be obtained." Observe, it was
                            upon the supposition that Christ was in this body of people, that transgressors came forward
                            and confessed their sins, and such confessions were not considered as being made to men, but
                            to God, and the forgiveness to proceed from that spirit, which was at one with the Father
                            and the Son. In this mode of government, the republican body was filed off in a separate
                            capacity, and the surrounding multitude were considered as belonging to a different family,
                            and any one might have the privilege of coming over, confessing their wickedness, professing
                            their repentance and uniting with their spirit as far as they chose. The way was as free and
                            open for any to change sides in a different manner. These churches still retained the use of
                            the sacraments, but from the change which had taken place in the ministry, the end and use
                            of the sac-<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> rament was very differently considered. When the imputed
                            righteousness of Christ, the satisfaction made to justice in behalf of the sinner, and the
                            imputed authority of the standing clergy to minister in the name of Christ, were set aside,
                            the former use of the sacraments must of course go with the rest, for there remained no one
                            regularly ordained to administer them. It may be enquired whether these churches did not
                            consider themselves authorized to ordain ministers. I answer they did not, as appears
                            evident from the tenor of their faith on that subject, as stated in the "Observations on
                            Church Government,"- as well as from th/1 manner in which they acted in relation to that
                            important matter. The farthest that they went was to express their satisfaction with, and
                            encourage those whom they believed had power and authority given them from heaven, as
                            appears from the following minute, dated Sept. 29, 1804. "The church took into consideration
                            the case of Brother Worley, relative to his laboring in the word. He was examined as to his
                            soundness in the faith, with which examination the church was satisfied :" and he was
                            encouraged to exercise his talents in public exhortation, as Providence might call and
                            direct. The Schismatics had too fresh a remembrance of the sufferings they had undergone in
                            obtaining liberty from the reputed vicegerents of Christ, acting in his room and stead, to
                            allow them to lay hands suddenly on any one, and especially as they conceived it necessary
                            that the Holy Spirit should be given in the important article of ordaining a true minister
                            of the Gospel. In consequence of encouragement from the republican body, there were certain
                            individuals who took charge in public exercises, which leads me to state some of the
                            peculiarities of their worship. From their gens-rid faith that God and Christ had their
                            abode in the soul of man, and from those inward feelings of love and power which they
                            occasionally felt, through the medium of a lively faith, they were led to believe that
                            whatever exercise was congruous to that inward feeling, and had a tendency to increase it,
                            was acceptable to God, as true worship. Hence, by giving the right hand of fellowship to
                            those who were admitted into the community, and finding that it tended to increase the
                            inward workings of the spirit, it was gradually introduced as a common act of worship, in
                            concert with singing hymns and spiritual songs. The whole society, old and young, would
                            commonly unite in this mode of worship and taking each other by the hand, would shake not
                            only their hands but their whole bodies, with such violence that the place would seem to
                            quiver under them. This the}?- called rejoicing, and in this worship they considered it the
                            privilege of every one to unite who believed the new doctrine of atonement. Admitting that
                            God was love, could not be changed, was the same to one soul as another and would have all
                            to be saved. Nothing remained but for the soul to love God and rejoice in confident hope of
                            salvation, and manifest its faith and confi-<pb n="195" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> dence by every such bodily
                            exercise as had a loving or joyful appearance. The New-Lights had considered it presumption
                            to perform any of these bodily exercises voluntarily, into which the}7 were forced by a
                            supernatural power, but this kind of faith appeared childish to the Schismatics. They
                            supposed that whatever God moved the creature to by his irresistible power, must be
                            acceptable to him. Therefore, it was their privilege to do voluntarily what was acceptable
                            to God, rather than be once in a while dragged to it, and the rest of their time offer up
                            such voluntary worship as was 4 'full of unbelief and sin." The I\e\v-Lights, struck down
                            and held under the power of death for a time, then raised as in a new world of light and
                            vision, and carried away with such raptures of joy, could not possibly conceal their
                            conversion. Such a conversion and way of manifesting it, however acceptable it might be to
                            God, as being the effect of his irresistible power, yet the Schismatics conceived it to be
                            more acceptable to God, and not without good reason, for one who was convinced of sin and
                            had turned from it, to rise in the assembly of those who were like-minded, testify his views
                            and feelings, and declare his intentions boldly and voluntarily. Again if he was overtaken
                            with a fault, if it should be so small a thing as tossing a dollar for whiskey or suffering
                            a little anger to arise in his breast, that he voluntarily confess it in the open light and
                            profess his abhorrence of it. There must appear a very marked difference between this
                            worship and that in which the sinner was overtaken with the power of God, and constrained to
                            do what he did not love, and might afterwards excuse himself that he could not help it, and
                            still claim his union with the world by a voluntary profession that he was yet a sinner,
                            prone to evil and no better than any other. All that distinguished him from others, was the
                            lighting down of a sovereign power upon him which he could not avoid. The Schismatics
                            conceived they were worshiping God to acceptance, while relating their conversion,
                            expressing their abhorrence of sin, and singing spiritual songs to that effect, "I shall be
                            holy here," shaking hands and shuddering with indignation against their soul-enemies, and
                            crying out for final liverance from them. "Make me, Savior, what thou art: Live thyself
                            within my heart." Leaping and skipping voluntarily in the joyful hope ; "Then the world
                            shall always see, Christ the holy child in me."

                            they tend in many ways to increase the material prosperity of the country, and must
                            therefore meet the approval of political economists ; because, while taking no part in
                            politics, they sympathize with every moral, social, and political progressive movement;
                            rejoice to see the governments of the earth tending to the freedom of the people, and to
                            their releasement from oppression. The}' recommend moderation and temperance in food and
                            drink, and would be glad to see the manufacture of all intoxiicating drinks prohibited; they
                            are fast tending to vegetarianism; they will not follow the fashions of the world in apparel
                            and conversation, but s ek oniy for cleanliness and comfort ; they rejoice to see old
                            credent forms breaking away in the minds of men, and to see a growth into more of the
                            simplicity and life of Christ which consists in repentance for wrong, Matt. xxi., 31, 32,
                            that leads to amendment of the life. They think that man should bear the moral consequences
                            of sin equally with woman ; being the originators of the sublime idea, that God is as much
                            Mother as Father: justice is at once established in the mind, and equality of the sexes
                            accorded. The founder of their institution was a woman, and their sisters are equal in
                            rights and authority with the brethren, and have been for one hundred and twenty years,
                            since the founding of the community ; they sympathize with every effort to place woman on a
                            legal equality with man, believing primarily in the justice of such equality, and as a
                            consequence that much moral im-<pb n="197" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> provement would follow in the world's
                            social structure, consequently they are spontaneous and unpartisan democrats, believing that
                            the enlightened conscience of the people should be the ruling factor of governments;
                            necessarily, they are among the most patriotic of the people, having faith that the
                            government of this country was founded under Divine influence, by human instruments, for the
                            preservation of the liberties of man. They give their testimony not to oppress the
                            conscience, but in love for the benefit of their fellow men, and are thankful if their
                            influence can lead any to amend their lives in any degree. (Rev. xxii., 2, "The leaves of
                            the tree were for the healing of the nations;") they think there are very few who possess no
                            redeeming qualities, and none can be entirely lost as long as they possess one good trait.
                            (Matt, xviii., 14.) They are the foster parents of modern spiritualism. The nation cannot
                            afford to lose the pure spiritual ministrations of the Shakers, unless it would be willing
                            to sink into gross materialism and mere intellectualism; because the time will come when the
                            people will regard the Shakers with affection and veneration. We would respectfully ask the
                            professed believers in the authority of the Christian scriptures, whether the immediate
                            followers of Christ did not form a community (Acts ii., 44-47 ; iv., 32-35;) whether
                            Christ's own words do not invite all who would be his followers to forsake their selfish
                            possessions and family relations, and seek with him to form a new relationship, and share
                            with him their communal property. (Matt, x., 16, 22; x., 34, 39 ; xii., 49, 50.) Christ
                            himself said, all could not receive the full cross (Matt, xix., 11, 12,) but he taught them
                            as they could bear it. (Mark iv., 33.) He was wise as well as peaceable and pure; if he
                            could lead any souls one step higher he rejoiced in that, and prayed that they might be able
                            to go on to greater degrees of self-denial and goodness. He chose a few, who were most
                            ripened up, to whom he could administer deeper spiritual teaching, and of whom he required a
                            severer cross than he did of others (Matt, xiii., 10-16.) His purpose was to induce this
                            little company to forsake all carnal pleasures, selfish possessions, (Matt, xix., 24; xi.,
                            25, 26,) and family ties (xix., 27, 28,) to form this new relation, founded on purity,
                            unselfishness and peace. (Matt, xxvi., 52.) But none understood him (Matt, xv., 16,) until
                            the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost partly enlightened them. We would ask
                            whether to govern the lives of professing Christians there are not three principles laid
                            down by Christ, namely, purity, peace and unselfishness, to be cemented by the power of pure
                            love; and whether if this be admitted that would not be an admission of the Shaker
                            principles. We would ask whether the principle of community and celibacy preserved by the
                            church of Rome, now become formal, and the influence for peace that she has exercised in
                            past ages, in the dark period of mediaeval times, were not derived from the traditions
                            handed down from the immediate followers of Christ; and whether the<pb n="198" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>
                            writings of Count Tolstoi are not remarkable confirmation of the Shaker testimony. We would
                            ask this suggestive question of the honest Unbeliever, Atheist, Infidel or Heathen, whether
                            the Shaker does not freely accord to him a privilege to live as his convictions lead him, in
                            the words of the poet: Is not an honest doubt worth full as much to the elevation of mankind
                            as blind devotion to religious creeds? Of the professed believer we would ask : Does not the
                            voice of the spirit (Rev. xxii., 11, 12, 17; xx., 13) as well as the enlightened conscience
                            of humanity, proclaim that all, who do no moral wrong, should have a privilege to live as
                            their own conscience and understanding lead them ? In my references to the Bible I mainly
                            quote from Matthew. All the other Gospels contain passages equally confirmatory of the
                            propositions stated. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life. Would
                            you have a spiritual feast, examine all the passages I have quoted.

                            none perhaps more conducive to individual and society interest, more important or worthy,
                            yet often overlooked or lightly considered than the duty of the present hour. And while in
                            an abstract mood, selfpreservation or wilful indifference, the opportunity passes by and is
                            gone for- � ever. Who can tell the value of a wasted hour, or desires to be answerable for
                            failures caused by neglect or omission ? Creatures of constant need ever consuming there is
                            scarcely a feature pertaining to active existence, but what we are directly or indirectly
                            influenced or benefited thereby; and each one should exercise his God-given forces in
                            providing and sustaining, numerous and diversified as we are, multifarious in form and
                            magnitude, follow in constant routine the duties of each succeeding hour. Labor is Life.
                            Temporal claims are manifold, and contain within themselves virtues, active, provident and
                            preservative. However arduous or trifling they may seem, they form a part and are
                            indispensable to the fulfillment and completion of the sum total of our existence. It is
                            seldom that great opportunities occur to test our loyalty, or confirm our stewardship. Our
                            special work may be the ennobling of toil, the heroism of sacrifice or obscurity of sorrow.
                            Most probably in the twofold demand of physical and spiritual development, we shall
                            experience the fatigue of one, triumph of the other, and hallowed calm found only in the
                            vale of Gethsemane. To wait upon the Lord, we each have obedience entire to render. An

                            When the Spanish conquerors entered Mexico they found, we are told, the children playing in
                            the dust of the streets with marbles of gold, the abundance of which greatly diminished its
                            value. Often, it seems to me that our gospel treasures are treated likewise by those who
                            have been called recently or even a long time ago, but have not yet entered into the very
                            spirit and faith. Having fled from social evils of all and every description they are
                            satisfied to have found a city of refuge, where hunger, thirst and destitution are never
                            known; to have found a resting place, where to lay down their weary heads and tired bodies
                            in sweet rest and ease. They are the children, playing, tossing, trifling with their golden
                            privileges in the streets of our holy city. Forgetting the pit of corruption, the abode of
                            the natural man, we should appreciate the more a pure and clean home. Escaped from the
                            fathomless depths of injustice and iniquity we ought to be thankful for a government where
                            all are weighed in the same scale, to be justly dealt with in the accuracy of the scales and
                            not with the inconstancy of a weather-vane. Having escaped being engaged in pugilistic
                            contests for the daily crumb, we ought to praise daily the peace and all temporal blessings,
                            resulting from a united labor of hearts given to God, and hands busy in consecrated
                            diligence and industry. O that we never may lose sight and appreciation of the gain, beauty
                            and treasures of Zion, which we exchanged for the dross and vanity of the world! Considering
                            that even the best of men, in their unredeemed state, are prone to fall, to be unjust,
                            overbearing and tyrannical, every one in our ranks ought to stand by and zealously work for
                            a cause which strengthens and protects the weak and encourages the strong; ought to defend a
                            gospel which respects neither persons nor beliefs, which suffers no government by purse or
                            person; where all have an even chance and fair play and none are oppressed or defrauded.
                            Where we may join a host of pure, true, honorable and upright souls; and where standards of
                            purity and love are waving. O fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, what a glorious
                            achievement is ours ! Our hearts may well sing praises and thanks that our lot has fallen in
                            such pleasant places. May that spirit forever increase in our souls which hungers and
                            thirsts for righteousness and integrity and which fears no sacrifice! May we feel that faith
                            which knows no fear, which calls no mortal master; which prays in humility to God for

                            Sisters shall dwell together in purity, peace and unity. A prophet said of Zion : "Violence
                            shall no more be heard in the land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou
                            shalt call thy walls Salvation and thy gates Praise." Isa. lx., 18. Again, the prophet saw
                            the coming day of peace and plenty, thus : "For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will
                            bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron ; I will also make thine officers
                            peace and thine exactors righteousness." Isa. lx., 17. How simply and truly these prophecies
                            are actualized among Believers each one can bear witness according as they have individually

                                The "Notes about Home" are becoming more and more interesting. There seems to be a rich
                                vein of spirituality running through them ; and why not ? If we give our hearts to God
                                and consecrate the labor of our hands to Him, our secular life must became
                                spiritualized. It was a wise saying of Mother Ann, "Hearts to God and hands at work."
                                Thousands of sermons might be written from that text and still its substance not
                                exhausted. It is a clear exposition of the unity of the text, Love to the Lord and love
                                to the neighbor. I was grieved when I heard of the death of Sister Mary Ann Hill, but
                                there was joy in my grief for I felt assured that she had gone to the joy of her Lord. I
                                have always had a filial affection for her ever since our first acquaintance; the
                                motherly love she manifested to all drew me toward her. I often think of her, she may
                                not now be far away. I dare not promise myself the happiness of visiting you soon for
                                all my "Ideals that shine like a star on life's universe," are pretty sure to be
                                "wrecked on the shore of the real." But I live in hope and trust that Divine Providence
                                will guide me aright and give me strength to do his will. To battle with the cold, hard,
                                profane world is a trying thing. I often wish I was out of it. It may be a wicked
                                thought but it will come up. The notes from Sabbathday Lake have the right tone ; why
                                can't A. S. C. make them a little longer? With love to all good Shakers, I remain your

                            discordant notes in the human soul, the tendency is to a pessimistic conception of life's
                            unfoldment. The externals of our existence absorbing so much of our time, and the vital
                            forces being drawn upon merely to sustain physical existence,<pb n="202" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> neither
                            time is given nor inclination to enter into the soul of things and dwell in the inner temple
                            where a conscious communion with the divine spirit places the recipient beyond the influence
                            of material conditions, where the apostle Paul can affirm "that the things that are seen are
                            transitory, bat the things that are not seen are eternal." When Jesus told his disciples
                            that he had meat to eat that they knew not of, he alluded to those vitalizing spiritual
                            forces that the truly esoteric mind is in constant rapport with, enabling it to look beyond
                            the shadows of material life into the realm of the spiritual, from which is constantly
                            flowing in pure and living streams those lifesustaining forces that will even give
                            sustenance to the physical organization, and enable it to endure privations that under
                            conditions not in harmony with those life-centers would culminate in death. A witness to the
                            truth of said affirmation is the case of Ann Lee when confined for fourteen days in a cell
                            with the intention of starving her. She could not have been kept alive with the small amount
                            of milk and wine she received once a day, if she had not been in rapport with the fountain
                            of life from which emanations are being sent, and received into all forms of life in the
                            material and spiritual world. As discordant tones are not so far reaching, leaving only the
                            harmony to be made manifest to the ear, so distance in spirit from the apparent commotion
                            that is producing the discord in human life, leaves only the impress of peace on the soul.
                            The geological structure of our planet indicates at some remote time, time so vast as to be
                            beyond human comprehension, a period of intense and fiery commotion. Elements apparently
                            contending with other elements for the mastery. But as wTe see, that was not the ultimatum.
                            Out of the apparent confusion and discord of these has come the higher developed conditions
                            and more harmonious surroundings of the present. And so with the spirit's unfoldment, if
                            true to its inherent life forces, it must look beyond the shadows of the present turmoil of
                            human society into the bright vista that is constantly unfolding and revealing higher
                            conceptions of life. To the soul that has truly entered the inner temple of its existence,
                            the crash of empires and the wivck of worlds disturb not its peace nor break the harmony
                            existing between it and the infinite life. Praise or blame, adversity or prosperity in the
                            external world, it passes by as the idle wind, heeded not because conscious of the
                            indwelling truth, and looking beyond the shadows, sees the substance, and in that securely
                            rests. Then as the elements that are producing the present discordant notes in human life
                            are only temporary ebullitions of the surface, while down deep in the internal seas a holy
                            calm prevails, the wisest course is to wait calmly, possessing in patience our souls,
                            knowing that we cannot be deceived in accepting the shadow for the substance. The lions that
                            intercepted the path of Pilgrim and terrified him, quailed<pb n="203" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> when boldly
                            met, and proved harmless phantoms when advanced upon with a brave heart. As darkness is but
                            the absence of light, so these negations cannot terrify the soul that serenely dwells in ihe
                            consciousness of the divine presence. Not whatever is, is right, only in the sense that
                            these perturbations arising from false views of life and the obligations that are due from
                            one individual to another, can be used as stepping stones to higher conditions, and the
                            wrath of man can be made to redound to the glory of God. And thus assured that the divine
                            all-sustaining power that forgetteth not a sparrow that falleth to the ground, will not
                            forsake the soul who on it trustingly relies, calmly, hopefully and joyfully the pathway of
                            life can be pursued, knowing that the ever present light will lead us out of the darkness
                            and shadows into the brightness of the coming day. Groveland, N.

                                One of the ''essentials'' to take with us on our Christian pilgrimage...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">One of the "essentials" to take with us on our Christian pilgrimage, is a Comforting
                                Assurance that our life is in harmony with the Christ life. We may have a great many
                                other things, abundant treasures that have been accumulated in "this world, but if this
                                special one is omitted, it may call forth a great deal of anxiety and cancel a large
                                amount of anticipated happiness. A very great multitude "out of every nation" are on
                                this same spiritual journey, having their own religious assurances, and transporting
                                more or less of the treasures that belong exclusively to their order. Many of these
                                parties are gifted in asserting rights and claiming privileges, as though the Holy City
                                was in their special keeping, and they were expecting a speedy entrance. Plow fortunate
                                it is for all this great company of religionists that their theologians have arranged
                                for them a halting place or trial station, which they have designated as the spirit land
                                or as purgatory, where they can rest and open their life books, square their accounts
                                and have judgment rendered. A thousand classes or a thousand religious orders are on
                                this line of march, preaching a thousand forms of theology and bearing aloft a thousand
                                crosses of varied shapes, sizes and colors. All are looking forward for their style of
                                happiness, for their kingdom of heaven, and yet not one of this vast assemblage has the
                                exclusive right of way into the Holy City. It is no wonder that some one has said that
                                "the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and violent men take it by force." A better
                                passage, however, comes to mind as an invitation to all these Christian crossbearers.
                                "Come. He that is athirst, come, and whosoever will, let him take the water of life
                                freely." With this comforting assueance our pilgrimage becomes more and more beautiful,
                                as we are privileged to drink of those waters welling up unTERMS<pb n="205" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>
                                to everlasting life. Over this interesting passage from the good book, no wayfaring man
                                need hesitate in his simplicity, to share the hope of such a promised reward. Egyptian,
                                Christian philosophers however, have ever been able to determine with far greater
                                accuracy the very essentials that are requisite for a right to the better Land, and have
                                formulated creeds of mystical theology and established a monopoly on the highway of the
                                crosses. But wTe have no use for creeds as they are man-made barriers in the path of
                                religious experience, while the systems of theology are of about as much value as is the
                                chaff that is threshed from the wheat. Credent churches are dominating churches, and
                                where prayers are ineffectual, the sword, the rack or the stake are brought forward to
                                assist in proselyting. The majority of the churches teach,�"Whoever will be saved,
                                before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic faith. Which faith except
                                every one do keep whole and undcfiled, without doubt, he shall perish everlastingly."
                                Into this faith a thousand doubts have already found an entrance, but if the above is
                                correct all these thousands of doubters must perish everlastingly. Having no use for the
                                creed, and having chosen a very different form of faith, what assurance have we that we
                                are made better by what we do have. Peter, in a letter to his brethren asks them to "be
                                ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is
                                in you." 1 Peter iii., 15. Our mind is quite like that of the apostle, on this subject.
                                We would not wish to move along blindly, nor to perish everlastingly. Better have an
                                assurance that the cross we bear, the life we live and the faith which has been
                                delivered to us is just what it should be. Religion is now better known by the
                                manifestations of the mind, than by any forms or ceremonies that can be devised ; and
                                "to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world," is of far more
                                consequence. This is the incoming of the kingdom of God as it is to dwell among men. It
                                exalts the cross of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, by whom, as said Paul, "the world is
                                crucified unto me and I unto the world." Gal. vi., 14. If the thousand or more forms of
                                religious life which are being developed in the world amidst the ceaseless disputations
                                about which the advocates know but little or nothing, could only be laid aside, they
                                might be far better representatives of the mission of Jesus, and in that way so
                                establish themselves as to be ready for his second advent which has been promised Jo
                                come among men, without sin unto salvation. This, above all things else would increase
                                our Comforting Assurance as we pass along on our pilgrimage to the city of our God.</p></div3><pb n="206" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="For thought" TEIform="index"/> FOR THOUGHT.</head><p TEIform="p"> It has been suggested by some of our beloved Elders, that the writers of "Home Notes" who
                            have so faithfully represented the temporal interests of our Zion home, should occasionally
                            add a little more of the spiritual, by giving an account of our religious meetings or of
                            social gatherings. * In this, however, we have no need to forget, "first that which is
                            natural, and afterward that which is spiritual." While we are on the earth we must keep an
                            active interest in the affairs that help to make a prosperous and happy home. God, himself,
                            planted a garden and then provided a man to take charge of it, and this was about all that
                            man could do in that age of the world. At the advent of Jesus it was a higher call. "Seek
                            first the kingdom of God," said he and then all these temporal blessings will be added to
                            your store. In all that we do, wre must cultivate the spiritual and as the apostle says,
                            whether we eat or drink or whatsoever we do, do all to the glory of God.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="At the time that David Crouch, jr. accepted the faith..." TEIform="index"/>

                            meetings at a house about one half mile distant. One evening while Sarah was meditating upon
                            this new and strange religion, and anxious to know if there was any good in it, she mentally
                            asked for a sign, and at the same time thought it almost impossible to be granted. "If,"
                            said she, "Patience Crouch and Mary Worcester, will be taken under the operations of the
                            spirit of God and turn down to my house, I will believe." As singular as the case may be,
                            the meeting commenced and soon after Patience and Mary were turning, as the spirit willed.
                            Continuing in this same exercise, they passed from the dwelling into the highway and over
                            the road for a distance of one and one half miles to the house of David Crouch which they
                            entered, and passing several times around Sarah, they left the place without speaking a word
                            and returned to the meeting. Sarah accepted the evidence and with that the testimony of
                            truth, and continued a loving and faithful Believer through time.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Crouch, Patience" TEIform="persName"/> Patience Crouch.</byline></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/> NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mount Lebanon, N.

                                in each so much like our unwritten ones, that it is very easy to say "ditto" and let it
                                pass. We too had an abundance of strawberries, and had they yielded according to the
                                faithful care bestowed upon them, our twenty-three bushels would have been doubled; but
                                either the dry weather or their close proximity to the salted asparagus bed, seemed to
                                blight them. Cherries are so well graded in our locality, that in a fruitful year like
                                the present, their season is from the middle of June<pb n="207" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> until the
                                first of August; and "big boys, little boys, and middling sized boys" are faithful to
                                gather them. The small boy and the cherry tree are agreeable companions in more ways
                                than one. He can sway from the topmost branches to gather the luscious fruit without
                                injury to himself or the tree. But no one speaks of the currants. Following closely as
                                they do, in the umbra of the strawberry, their reputation, though not their worth, seems
                                rather eclipsed. Our currant garden this year was a beauty. So neatly cultivated and
                                such strings of pearls and rubies, from every branchlet in striking contrast to the
                                verdant foliage. Apples, pears, x)lums and even our few peach trees are doing their
                                best. This is the year "we shall lose a thousand bushels of peaches for the want of
                                trees." Our apples are so carefully housed during the winter that there is seldom an
                                apple vacancy the year round. The Roxbnry Russet of '90 docs not desert us until the
                                early pippin is suitable to take its place in the apple pie. The three hundred windows
                                of our brick dwelling- are being repainted by faithful home labor, which will save in
                                many ways, we hope. The windows will be rescued from wear of time, and the money
                                sometime paid to hired labor, will be doubled, since "a penny saved is two pence clear."
                                Thus we are anxiously looking forward for means to repair the drainage of our Dwelling
                                before another winter, and thus save the tax sometimes imposed by the Board of Health,
                                as well as doctor bills. Since the irresponsible monetary monocracy adopted by Believers
                                has devastated so much of the consecrated wealt i of our Communities, it comes very hard
                                on those who, though on the same plan, are wise and skillful enough to be successful. We
                                too have enjoyed the pleasant visits to our home. Br. Watson Andrews, the dear Sisters

                                1891. Deab Editob:�We have had the satisfaction of having had visitors here from four of
                                our sister Societies who were welcome, thrice welcome to our home and hearts. It does us
                                good to see the Brethren and Sisters from various branches of our communal interest,
                                having a like faith, and actuated by motives springing from a good heart and true. Elder
                                Andrew D. Barrett of Harvard is one of the number, a former inmate of this home, which
                                was made dear to him through consecration. He is an earnest, warm-hearted, whole-souled
                                man. We love him for his work's sake and glad to have him come among us for rest and
                                recuperation. He has well earned it by devotion of body and soul to the well-being of
                                the household of faith. We have finished marketing cherries and have commenced on the
                                pears, which promises to be a good crop. Hay crop secured some two weeks or more since,
                                expect to finish harvesting^ oats this week. Dear Elder Henry, if you should journey so
                                far west as this place, we would be glad to give you hospitable welcome. The latch
                                string hangs out and you have only to grasp it to have the door swing wide open. T. E.
                                North. K'amily. Aug. 10, 1891. * Anotiiek month has rolled round and harvest time is
                                hastening to a close. We put the hay-loader in operation and it did work splendidly,
                                rolling up a load of hay in six or twelve minutes. It takes two good men on the wagon
                                and a careful hand to drive the team. The reaper and binder, after about live days'
                                experimenting and adjusting, was made to work very satisfactorily. Our rye was very
                                heavy and crinkled badly; so that it was impossible for the machine to separate each
                                bundle and a man had to follow behind and pull them apart; but in the straight grain,
                                wheat and oats, it was just music set to harmony, to witness the operation; on quite a
                                side hill and over some very rough places it kept in time,<pb n="208" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> though
                                occasionally a rest was introduced which only gave the more volume to the music. Have
                                cut some twenty-three acres of rye, several acres of wheat and twentyfive acres of oats;
                                have nearly twenty acres more to cut of oats and seventy-five of grass; hope to be done
                                by the first of Sept. On the 29th. of July, the trustee of School District No. 12, (by
                                mistake) called the annual school meeting. It was attended by a selected company who
                                went through the legal forms, electing officers, etc. and not till near the close did we
                                discover that our meeting was premature. We adjourned to the last Tuesday in August.
                                Although the meeting was a legal mistake, it did good, and it is hoped, awakened an
                                interest in school matters that will be felt when we meet again. The subject of
                                education is one that all who take an interest in the rising generation, should study
                                and exercise their minds upon; it is of great importance. The whole every-day life in
                                our Community is industrial education, and it is firstrate; but industrial education,
                                practiced mechanically, is drudgery in its lowest sense, even when exercised in that
                                which is genial; while that which would usually be termed menial, if mind and brain are
                                brought to bear upon it, becomes interesting and elevating. No labor, however
                                disagreeable, if its end is use, is in any way dishonorable. But when the necessity of
                                the labor is scientifically understood, the disagreeable is largely diminished. Our
                                district, or home schools, should be so conducted that they will instill into the minds
                                of the pupils the light of understanding, and made so interesting that the scholars will
                                drink in by absorption. What a child understands it will remember, what is learned
                                mechanically is soon foi'gotten. Last Sabbath, on account of the weather, our Society
                                meeting was omitted. Elder Andrew Barrett from Harvard is making us a visit; he is all
                                alone, which in olden times was thought not to be good; however that may be, I think it
                                is better now, when Brethren visit, to have some Sisters along. We learned through Elder
                                Andrew that some time ago, while Elder John Whiteley, with a company of Sisters were on
                                their way from Shirley to Harvard, one of the horses fell; as he fell the harness broke,
                                which let the wagon on the horse. The horse got up instantly while the wagon was upon
                                him, and turned it over with all its occupants. A single horse was following and was so
                                close to the team ahead that when the horse fell, stopping the wagon, the single horse
                                ran into the wagon, breaking both thills. Fortunately no one was seriously hurt; they
                                fixed up as best they could and returned home. We are called to learn by everything that
                                passes before us; and two important lessons are here given. First, that when we take
                                company riding the harness should be strong enough to sustain the horse, even though he
                                fall: Second, that one team in following another, should keep at a respectful distance.
                                On the 21st. of July we had a very pleasant visit with Br. Watson Andrews of North
                                Union, Ohio. He was a very interesting visitor; but that interest would have increased
                                many fold, if he had brought some Sisters along. I hope the Brethren will not do so any
                                more. If business is the special object, there is some excuse; but when visiting is the
                                business, there is no visible excuse. The August Manifesto came laden with treasures
                                from the good editor's heart. In our "Home Notes" what a lot of thought we gave to what
                                we had to eat. Not however, for the gratification of appetite but for the honor and
                                glory of God. Blessed be the Manifesto and all who contribute thereto. D.

Beloved Elder Henby:�When the girls of the Bible Class read the last
                                question they were unanimous in the opinion that they knew the answer perfectly well; so
                                sanguine were they in the belief that<pb n="209" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> there was no necessity to
                                "Search the Scriptures" that they delayed the work too long, so that we have but a few
                                to send you this time. It is true they did know the day on which Jesus was crucified,
                                also when he arose from the grave, but they found it hard to find the Scripture
                                reference to it. Think they have learned that it is well to be certain that our
                                knowledge is well founded. It is a bright, beautiful morning, all nature is rejoicing in
                                loveliness and seems to wish so much to prove a true tribute of praise to the Creator
                                that my heart bounds in unison and prompts me to add my mite to the universal
                                praise-offering of nature. As I have not sent any Bible Class papers for some little
                                time I enclose a few which please examine and do with as you think best. Please accept
                                love from Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters in Hancock for yourself, and as far as
                                you think it best to extend. E. H.

Everything passing smoothly with us gives reason for thankfulness. Our
                                efforts on the farm have prospered. Eye has been garnered and threshed, proving a good
                                yield. Oats are cut and ready to get in. Potatoes are large and fair, yielding fairly
                                well. Blackberries are plentiful and large. Canning them for winter has taken much time
                                and labor, without which nothing can be accomplished. We have more than we can use and
                                are selling some. The weather is warm and dry. The present month thus far is more like
                                summer than was July; the nights and mornings of that month were very cool. Repairing
                                has been going on about engine and boiler house and other buildings. An excellent spring
                                has been cleaned out and bricked around, so as to put in usable condition. Seeding down
                                to grass and putting in rye are in progress. It is hoped all the land that will be in
                                cultivation next year will be plowed this fall. A pleasant ride through Forrest Park was
                                very much enjoyed by all the members of the South Family one cool day the past month. M.

                                blest through their harvest time, by the troublesome blessing as the farmer styles it
                                just at this time, of rain. Could this blessing have been equally dispensed over Harvard
                                and elsewhere, I think we could have reported a more perfect crop of the staff of life
                                for the animal kingdom. However, haying is closed and our tally counts up one hundred
                                tons of the best hay that has been put into the barn for the last twelve years. Monday
                                the 8th of June we cut our early piece of clover and then with a short intermission to
                                the 22nd. when we started again and from that time to the present we have had but one
                                shower of rain to wet our hay. Early peas, beans and potatoes came along in uncommon
                                good season. Corn is looking excellent, for which I think all the farmers will feel
                                thankful. ]S"o doubt it will make the speculators feel a little sore, but this year we
                                hold it is the farmers' year, and am glad to see them come up and fill the important
                                place assigned to them. Health of Society good. Our dear Eldress Eliza whom we had given
                                up to the care of the angels and we thought they would claim her as one of theirs, is
                                slowly improving though quite weak in body. Our Manifesto grows better each time and we
                                long for the next number. This is the way it should be, and many blessings rest upon the
                                wearied hands who toil to make it so. What greater blessing can we realize than to know
                                we are striving to help others. This is the love of God. This formed the key-note to our
                                meeting this morning, to look for the bright spots in the lives of our Brethren and<pb n="210" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> Sisters, to spread sunshine and cheer in the path of everv one. A
                                few weeks since there was a book sent to Harvard, entitled "The Greatest thing in the
                                World." Now what do you think that great thing was? It was the true spirit of love, and
                                I felt that I could endorse the sentiment and say, thus it is. The love principle when
                                understood with perfect wisdom and knowledge will be the true Savior to mankind. Love is
                                magnetic and draws to itself the condition loved. It is the prime factor in a spiritual
                                growth. We read, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son," who said,
                                "I am the light of the world." Godliness then is a love of humankind, a love that is
                                like that of a father for his child to help him from all suffering conditions. Have this
                                love clothed with knowledge and wisdom and what a powerful factor it becomes. The mighty
                                Alexander with all the forces of Greece could not stand before it. Love then, surely,
                                becomes the greatest thing in the world. A. D.

                                month we have been greatly blessed in many of the precious, temporal gifts. Climatic
                                influences have been such that general, good health has prevailed most of the time,
                                which has enabled us to relish our food, so amply provided,�to engage in the manual
                                duties of our consecrated home, and to take an interested and active part in all the
                                religious exercises that are arranged for our spiritual prosperity. The life of man is
                                so extended, interesting itself as it does in demands for the support of the body and
                                then for the greater demands of the cultivation of the mind, that there is no time to be
                                lost through idleness. Up to date several hands are still engaged in the hay-field.
                                Those who worked by the day have been dismissed after securing some 250 tons of most
                                excellent clover and Timothy hay. The meadow or flat grass that grows in wet lands is
                                not of much value and may be-cut and taken to the barn the same day. The gathering of
                                small fruits as raspberries, blueberries and blackberries, occupies ever."<pb n="211" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> considerable time by small companies, and has been engaged in as pleasure
                                as well as profit. Not less than twelve or fourteen persons from this Society left home
                                this morning for the high bush blueberry field, a distance of some four miles. Showers
                                are falling most beautifully, and we can well imagine the forlorn condition of those
                                among the bushes, and their more than rural appearance on their real, rural, rainy ride
                                toward home in an open carraige. The rain falls equally as unmindful on the silks and
                                satins of the large companies that are passing over the premises of the Community, as
                                the visitors of to-day. Many of these are wonder seekers who have come from a distance
                                of twelve or fifteen miles to see the Shakers, and are wondering what they shall see,
                                and then go away wondering at what they did not see. Many of our little migratory, tree
                                top singers have already gone to their more southern home, and there is a perceptible
                                difference in the music in the air. The Baltimore Orioles left us some ten days since,
                                and it is a great loss to lose their sweet song. All the Eave swallows, and last week
                                there were hundreds of them, are to be seen no more for several months. Although this
                                class of birds are without song, yet their presence is one of pleasure, and their
                                service in the destruction of insects, invaluable. The song of the Bobolink has also
                                ceased, although the birds will stay with us for two or three more weeks. The male bird
                                seems obliged to change his gay suit of feathers for one of dull gray, and at the time
                                of leaving, the whole flock, old and young, are all of this sombre hue. The first
                                offering of green corn was made on the 3rd. of August, which was a very acceptable
                                foretaste of the good things that are to come. Beautiful specimens of tomatoes are being
                                gathered, and from present prospects we shall have a bountiful supply. The eating of
                                tomatoes seems to be an acquired taste, with most persons. Some two decades since, and a
                                few hills of this plant, produced all that our family would care to use, but at the
                                present time an hundred bushels could be utilized with profit, and even then we should
                                want more. With all these temporal blessings we have great cause for thankfulness. Our
                                spiritual blessings are also of great value, and to harmonize with the teachings of the
                                New Testament we must "seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness." Our prayers
                                in the morning and at evening should be beautifully anticipated offerings to God. These
                                will help wonderfully to lighten the burdens of the day, and aid us in carrying forward
                                our gospel work in the interest of humanity. *</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Groveland, New York" TEIform="index"/> Groveland, N.

                                renew our note making as the rapid transit of August, the august month of the year is
                                fast receding. We are reminded that a few more sunsets will forever cancel summer from
                                the "year of our Lord" eighteen hundred ninety-one. Farmers commenced thrashing wheat
                                last Friday morning. The music of their steam thrasher may be heard from early morn till
                                evening late, and the dusty, wearied appearance of the workmen as they retire from their
                                day's labor brings proof that some must be the "bread winners" in this land where two
                                extremes, "Capital and Labor" meet. We wonder as we listen to the ceaseless tramp,
                                tramp, tramp, of the mighty throng as they hurry and scurry, each grasping for the
                                largest loaf, how and when and where will end this constant contest for the "staff of
                                life."' Yet we know that "He who hears the ravens' cr.ll, Will not forget his children
                                But will give a rich supply Of his boundless blessing." A heavy rain and thunder storm
                                spent its fury here about midnight of the ninth inst. and every one says that every
                                    body<pb n="212" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> thinks that something somewhere got struck, but as no one
                                can locate the striking point, we are certain the storm returned free from a strike. The
                                harvesting of hay was accomplished in good time and we learn, of the best quality. A few
                                bushels of peaches grown on Groveland soil have found their way here again for a wonder:
                                these with harvest apples secured through the work of an enterprising Sister, furnish
                                healthful food for brain and muscle. Long live the apple and next live the peach. Long
                                live all fruits that live within our reach. G. D.

                                people. If I could only record some recognition of the genuine cross our Savior bore
                                against the selfishness of the human heart, some outpouring of the spirit, such even as
                                our predecessors were privileged to witness, although the day and time demands a more

                                by" the earnest worker who wearies not in well-doing. The August Editorial was
                                excellent; it was read in our morning service from advance copy and was highly
                                appreciated by many. Our summer term of school closed July 30th. with honors, so far as
                                commendations of 'The Board' were concerned at least. The one representative present
                                pronounced the proceedings to be a good illustration of what unity would do, seeming to
                                recognize the fact that proper discipline between school hours, also the support of
                                community members had a deal to do toward insuring success. Some shingling has been
                                accomplished this season, wish we might say painting as well. The hay harvest is now in
                                progress. We cannot tell about the delicious beans and corn that are "marching along"
                                nor do we expect the procession to be a very lengthy one when it appears, judging from
                                former experiences. Our fine vegetable garden which people admire so much, and really is
                                a picture in itself, is devoted to the producing of seeds mostly, and vegetables for
                                other consumers; and although we know if holy, we shall be thankful for daily blessings,
                                greatly in advance of the majority of humanity, just as worthy, yet (we) believe that
                                when all things work together for good to those who love the Lord, we shall have less

                                same hour on Saturday evening. Some of the Evangelists state that the crucifixion
                                occured on the third hour while others say the sixth hour. Some writers state that every
                                thing was done that human policy and prudence could invent, to prevent the resurrection
                                of Jesus. In this instance after the tomb was sealed, they stationed a guard of soldiers
                                to protect it from intruders. The women not finding the body in the tomb were greatly
                                perplexed; but they remembered the words that he prophesied of himself, before the
                                crucifixion, and left the sepulchre and informed the other disciples. J. E.'s answer is
                                as follows:�Jesus was crucified on Friday, the day before the Jewish Sabbath. At
                                midnight on Saturday, the stone which closed the entrance to the sepulchre was rolled
                                away and an angel sat thereon. Just before the break of day, the followers of Jesus went
                                to the tomb, carrying spices, but were told by the angel, "He is not here, but is
                                risen." M. M. C.'s answer. Texts, Matt, xxviii., 1, and St. Luke xxiii., 52, 54. Matthew
                                and the other evangelists write that Jesus was crucified on Friday and rose from the
                                tomb on Sunday, the Christian''s Sabbath. L. D. H.'s answer:�Jesus crucified on Friday
                                the day before the Jewish Sabbath. St. Luke xxiii., 54. He rose from the tomb on the
                                morning of the first day of the week, which is on Sunday; as we read that the angels
                                said unto the women who visited the tomb;�"Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was
                                crucified; he is risen, he is not here."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Inquiry. no. 2" TEIform="index"/> INQUIRY.

                            Shaker church. A creed is an instrument of force, an ecclesiastical barrier over which one
                            may not pass without censure, as may be witnessed by the long and acrimonious controversy
                            that is entered into on some of the ecclesiastical trials. Human creeds and confessions
                                of<pb n="214" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> faith have been handed down from generation to generation, and
                            these largely constitute popular Christianity. Three creeds have been written and are more
                            or less effective at the present time; as the Apostles' Creed, "which is supposed to be as
                            old as the third century, but there is no reason to believe that it was composed or used by
                            the apostles." "The next olde'st is the Nicene Creed. It was completed in 381. Next in time
                            comes the Athanasian Creed," in which the doctrine of the Trinity is the leading feature.
                            Theophilus, bishop of Antioch has the credit of being the first to make use of the word
                            Trinity to express the distinction of this mysterious Godhead. We think that the testimony
                            of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and a present revelation of God's love to man. "Know ye
                            not that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates ?" 2 Cor. xiii., 5. No number of
                            creeds can bring this gift of inspiration to the soul. It can be obtained, only, by those
                            who live as Jesus lived. We have no need to fetter the mind with a mass of verbiage over
                            religious mysteries which no one can interpret, so long as light and truth are freely
                            extended to every one that accepts the gospel of Jesus and departs from all iniquity.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Immortality" TEIform="index"/> IMMORTALITY.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> [The following is claimed to be the oldest poem in existence, with the exception

                                Nestor of New York journalism, George Jones, and an appreciative sketch. A criticism on
                                natural grounds of certain statements by Henry George follows. A very interesting
                                analysis of the mouth's physiognomy, and well illustrated, will give the reader sound
                                reasons for certain types of expression. The second Prize Essay is a taking sketch by
                                the well-known author of "For Girls." Following this are ten or more Phrenological
                                "Hits" that make spicy reading. The interest taken in the new science of mind by Dr.
                                John Bell, Professor Samuel G. Howe, Prof. Morton, the ethnologist, and Nicholas Biddle

                                effects of hygienic treatment as applied to Toothache, Ague and Fever, etc. What

                                are made in the third paper on Systematic Moral Education that should open the eyes of

                            The typical pupil of the private boarding-school is the philistine child. He has plenty of

                            but he makes great pretences, and is supremely satisfied with his littleness. The typical
                            pupil of the public school is the boy who is not rich and is not very cultivated. His code
                            of honor or of manners is not burdened by conventionalities: he values your son for his
                            manliness and pluck, not at all for the shape of his collator the size of his cravat. He is
                            uncouth: but when on'-e real refinement is brought to him, he admits its charm and is
                            anxious to win some of its richness. Is it not better for your own son, if you be a rich
                            man, that he avoid this lifeless, conventional boy of fashion; and find a playmate in the
                            bright, hearty, it may be rough boy from the middle class or from the home of poverty?�From

"The Standard Dictionary of the English Language," is the title of a new work
about to be issued from the firm of Funk
& Wagnalls of New York. Already the
prospectus is before the people, and has
received a very liberal endorsement from
many of the most prominent Professors
and teachers of education in America.
Our long acquaintance and direct preference for Webster's Dictionaries, makes us
slow in thinking that anything can be better or even have a place by its side. The
International is a beautiful work and whoever holds it has secured a treasure of
which his future language should be a living witness.
Of the multiplication of good books,
however, we can never see too many, and
the publishers of the Standard Dictionary
are now making a heroic effort, and giving
time and money to perfect their work in
all that an English speaking people could
wish at this time. The arrangement of
the work has several new features which
are claimed to be equal if not superior to
that of any other Dictionary.
