Probably nineteen fiirmers in twenty must
buy seed-corn for next spring's planting, on
account of the failure of tbe '83 crop to Hpen. We must look sharp to tbe seeds we
buy, that they are better than our own, as
many unreliable parties will offer inferior
stocks, to take advantage of the demand.
We suggest that every corn-grower should
send to Hiram Sibley & Co., tbe reliable
seedsmen at Rochester, N. Y., and Chioasro,
Til., for their Catalogue and seed-corn circular. This bouse makes a specialty of seedcorn and we believe that they will do what
they say they will.

"�Henry
                            George. Divine attributes inhere in man. Their unfoldment, is in the line of his destiny.
                            The relationships of created things, whether in their construction ; in the stupendous
                            movements of solar systems ; in the chemical forces which build up planets ; or in the
                            domains of living organisms, in their diversity of functions, and their adaptations to ends,
                            all bear a relation to mentality, and to the development of thought in man. Of life as we
                            are cognizant of it, mental development can go but a little way. Mind barely begins to awake
                            ere the bodily powers decline ; yet, dimly conscious of vast fields to be explored,
                            relations to be formed, and sympathies to be extended when death suddenly closes the scene.
                            Hence as far as animal life is involved, there is an abrupt termination to unfinished
                            destinies. And unless there is an after life, there is a break�a failure. A vista opened to
                            grand acquisitions, and closed by an Irapassable gulf. If mind and character developed on
                            earth extend no farther than life's short span ; then there is a want of purpose in our
                            creation and existence, inconsistent with the linked harmonies of the universe. And also
                            inconsistent with man's divine capabilities, and with the fact of his ability, mentally to
                            expand indefinitely. The sphere of man's thought Avidens as he thinks, and his poAver to
                            actualize his conceptions, is limited by earthly conditions.<pb n="74" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> The
                            indications are, that man's career on earth is but a beginning to his future history. In
                            this our rudimental state, we ever associate our animal life, its short duration and other
                            limitations, with a living and ever expanding power within us. This unseen Force, is the
                            true, the real human personality, invisible as is the Personality of God. And like Him, can
                            manipulate inorganic elements into form, beauty, and use�cause them to accomplish his
                            designs, and do his pleasure. " Let us make man in our own image " is not an idle myth ; it
                            is an ever-present reality. The creations of man's invisible personality, as in the steam
                            engine, manifests a thousand fold more strength, works with greater precision than can the
                            animal who is said to be the person who made it. Of this personality Jesus Christ spoke wheu
                            he said, " If I ascend up on high, I will draw all men unto me. " Those who accept his word
                            lovingly, and ascend with him divinely, have eternal life abiding in them.
                            Eternal�continuous life, affords opportunities to correct moral deviations, personal and
                            social difficulties ; and links together all the harmonies of creation. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            from all unrighteousness." The confession of sin is one of the crosses which all must
                            necessarily pass through, before entering upon the Christplane of life. Confession of one's
                            wrongs from a worldly stand-point is one of the most humiliating ordeals in which man can be
                            placed. Many would consider it the most ignominious punishment which could be inflicted upon
                            them. Mankind naturally are deceitful, they seem desirous to cover their sins. They want the
                            world to believe that their virtues are in excess of their evil propensities. How often do
                            their trained facial expressions, their rhetorical culture and flowery words debar those
                            with whom they come in contact, of seeing their true inward nature. If our eyes could
                            penetrate the hearts of some, whom the world look upon as examples, worthy of emulation,
                            what an adverse picture would be presented to us. Bitter hatreds and thoughts coiled like
                            serpents would be seen nestling within their breasts. We should see souls sapped of their
                            vitality by the gnawing tooth of sensuality and lust. We would see their spirituality
                            wrecked beneath the crumbling walls of vanity, selfishness and revenge. " Man looketh on the
                            outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart." <pb n="75" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Many no doubt
                            look upon confession as degrading iu the extreme, but why is it ? It is because they strive
                            against it. It is because worldly pride predominates in their nature. Also the lacerations
                            of expiation always renders confession doubly painful, but honest confession will bring joy
                            to the soul, yea, by gaining victory over this secretive propensity we can then begin to
                            rise in the pure atmosphere of divine love. We can then realize that a victory gained within
                            ourselves is of all victories the most glorious. "A man that ruleth his spirit is greater
                            than he that taketh a city." It is far better to control and subdue ourselves than to be
                            monarchs of earthlv kingdoms. The first step which indicates spiritual growth is child-like
                            simplicity. "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no
                            wise enter therein." Whoever is willing to give up self, willing to confess and forsake
                            their sins are not far from the kingdom of heaven. One step higher will make them children
                            of the resurrection, yea, enter the order God has established on earth, follow in the
                            footsteps of the two Anointed Ones, and all such, God will bless, -and count them children
                            of the celestial kingdom. Mankind generally prefer the lower plane, "For wide is the gate
                            and bread is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that go in thereat."
                            Mankind in their unregenerated state can truthfully say, "We lie down in our shame and our
                            confusion covereth us, for we have sinned against the Lord our God ; we and our fathers from
                            our youth, even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God. " ''
                            Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants, the prophets which spoke in thy name, to our
                            fathers and all the people of the land." All who confess their sins in the presence of God's
                            chosen witnesses are elevated to a summit of purity which the world can never reach. "Who
                            shall ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in hi3 holy place ? He that hath
                            clean hands and a pure heart Avho hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn
                            deceitfully, he shall receive the blessing from the Lord." When the defiled garments of sin
                            are thrown aside and we become clad in the white robes of purity, then true happiness can be
                            realized, also we can feel that we are more than compensated for all our worldly sacrifices.
                            The sincerity of any one who enters Christ's fold can to a great extent be tested Avhen they
                            confess their sins before God's witnesses. An honest child who desires to enter the Kingdom
                            will confess everyjknown sin, with the spirit of meekness and humility, by so doing their
                            sins are forgiven, confession is the door, through which all must enter, who desire to be
                            heirs of the Kingdom. " He that eutereth not by the door into the sheep-fold but climbeth up
                            some other Avay, the same is a thief and a robber. " Some no doubt enter into the fold by
                            climbing over the wall of deception, but inevitably they fall, crushed beneath the weight of
                            their own consciences which ultimately will result in a spiritual death, as was demonstrated
                            concerning Ananias and Sapphira. The door of confession is the only entrance through which
                            we can enter the fold in safety. " I am the door : by me<pb n="76" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> if any pan
                            enter in he shall be saved, and shall ;go in and out and find pasture. " May allwliQ are
                            prepared to live the higher life, enter the fold and become heirs of the Kingdom. Those who
                            accept this inheritance can understand the reality of being cleansed from all
                            uniigh,teousness, also rays of divine light will illumine their pathway as they enter the
                            mansions of glory which a, heavenly Father and Mother hath prepared for them on the other
                            side. "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord and the people whom he hath chosen for
                            his own inheritance. " "The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever."

                            behind us Footprints on the sands of time. " " Of all the causes which conspire to blend
                            Man's erring judgment and misguide the mind, What the weak head with strongest bias rules,
                            Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools." It lias been truly said : " Nothing is ever
                            settled in thij world until it is well settled. " We find among the accepted maxims of
                            mankind, and these should be considered well settled: " Tis education forms the common mind;
                            Just as the twig is bent the tree's inclined. " The human soul, like marble in the rough,
                            may possess inherent beauties, virtues, embryo perfections, incipient worth, and regal
                            powers, which without the aid of education, can never be made lo appear in their symmetrical
                            grandeur and radiant dignity. The statue, monument, or figure is in the stone, the statuary
                            only finds it. The sculptor's skillful hand works off the superfluous covering, polishes the
                            surface of the sculpture, and brings to view the varied colors, with every ornamental vein
                            and cloud of beauty that lay hid within it. So education unfolds and brings out in strength,
                            vigor, and symmetry, all the faculties and powers of the immortal mind, imparting to them
                            the refined refulgent radiance which is the peculiar characteristic of the truly great and
                            good, who : "As some tall cliff, that lifts its stately form [storm; Swells from the vale,
                            and midway leaves the [spread, Tho' round its breast the rolling clouds are Eternal sunshine
                            settles on its head. " Perfection is the ultimatum of education and is the result of
                            continued repe-<pb n="77" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> tition, forming by practice iixed habits of action,
                            establishing in the understanding and instating on the throne of reason the spirit of that,
                            , " Divine philosophy, by whose pure light We first distinguish, then pursue the right;
                            frees, Whose power the breast from every error Weeds out all its vices by degrees. "
                            Incentive is the motive power of action. Until Incentive exerts her magnetic influence and
                            awakens interest and arouses desire, action is inert. Without action there is no effect.
                            Effect is the consequence of adequate cause. The cause of voluntary action, is thought. The
                            obtaining of thoughts and the ability wisely to use them is education. The tendency of
                            education is to modify or change existing conditions of human society. Every new idea that
                            comes to light, claims a place in the domain of thought. As, new ideas are multiplied,
                            correspondingly new phases take place in the life, character, and institutions of mankind. .
                            This constant influx of intelligent life, produces new growth and expansion of the mind,
                            impelling it to seek broader fields for the exercise of the unfolding powers springing from
                            this new life infusion. We find, in the rapid transition of thought in these days, that no
                            two generations are alike. They each have marked peculiarities of ideas and methods. This
                            undoubtedly has been the order of progression from the beginning of creation but with a less
                            marked change. The effects of education, is, to refine, elevate, enlighten, and fraternize
                            mankind {rendering them more liberal, Iuk inane, affectionate, pacific, just, and
                            consistent. Its tendencyis to break dbwn and renaoyQ tjje. narrow sectal barriers formed by
                            creeds and dogmas which have made aliens and enemies of those who, otherwise would, like
                            kindred drops have mingled into a fraternal communion. Education is ennobling, carrying the
                            race God-ward, away from low vulgar, immoral, debasing conditions and practices, and
                            elevating it above the animal plane of tyranny, usurpation, bigotry, superstition,
                            persecution, human butchery, duelliug codes of honor, and all the degrading impulses of
                            ignorance. Education is a wealth-increasing power. It develops and fosters new and lucrative
                            industries ; it patronizes inventive skill and practical ability in science and art, and
                            brings into use, in the various departments of human industry, the vast resources of
                            material treasure deposited in the earth. Education is labor-saving enabling its possessors
                            to perform more and superior labor in a given time than as though they were ignorant. It
                            brings to our aid useful labor-saving machinery by the means of which the necessities and
                            luxuries of life are rendered more abundant and cheaper. This readers our homes and our
                            social' relations more pleasant. Education is a better and surer defense and protection to a
                            nation than armies and navies. This was evinced in the late civil war. The North had the
                            former aud the South the latter at the commencement of the conflict. .Education breaks the
                            chainsof tyranny and oppression, leaving no: place for aught but peerless Freedom, who with
                            exulting triumph shouts : \ , : . " Go, tame the wild torrent, Or stem with a straw,

                            the Freedmen of the South. They have learned to prize their liberties and are making good
                            progress in their intellectual development ; are becoming better citizens ; and that section
                            of the Union has been increasing in wealth and prosperity since the period of the
                            reconstruction of these states. The Freedmen ai'e becoming year by year more
                            self-supporting, as the following statement in the 27. Y. School Journal shows. "The Rev.
                            Dr. Orr, State School Commissioner of Georgia, in a recent speech before the North Georgia
                            Conference, stated that the colored people of Georgia pay into the treasury of the State all
                            that is appropriated to their education except about $20,000. "This is really wonderful for
                            a people who have had only about fifteen years opportunity to do for themselves. It shows in
                            the battle with ignorance and darkness, the colored people only need a chance. They put a
                            value on education that outruns the whites. " Education is the true magnetic pole of man's
                            redemption ; for only through culture and refinement are we fitted to enter the dominion and
                            share in the exalted joys of a pure and holy God. This is an age of progress, and all who
                            would be numbered in the ranks of the onward march of advanced and advancing ideas in the
                            world's Godward progression should put shoulder to the wheel and roll forward the car of
                            man's civilization, salvation, and redemption. " In the world's broad field of battle, In
                            the bivouac of life, Be not like dumb driven cattle ! Be a hero in the strife ! Trust no
                            future howe'er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,�act in the living present!

                            Time back to the days of childhood and early youth, recalls many pleasant and grateful
                            memories of you and yours. I seem to see them pass in review before me as I write, my young
                            companions, my dear Sabbath School teachers, yet, above all, my beloved Pastor, whose tender

                            never-tobe-forgotten Sabbath, were baptized in the name of Christ, and partook of the
                            symbols of his life and sufferings. Think not, because I am not with you, nor yet likely to

                            from sin in the present tense, and be made a fit temple in which the Christ Spirit might
                            dwell forever. " There is a Divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them as we will. " Even
                            so, have I abundant reason to give thanks to that God who has, indeed, led me by a way I
                            knew not, into the "city of peace," even the pure, virgin life of Christ, which, faithfully
                            lived, day by day, in meekness and simplicity, is daily renewing my soul with immortal life
                            from the fountain of Love divine; with that baptism of the " Holy Spirit and fire, " which
                            will effectually consume all the dross of the soul, and raise it into the very heavenly
                            nature and life of Christ. You did, indeed, baptize me with water, and give the symbols of
                            the "blood and body " of that absent Savior, who said, " do this until I ccme," but to the
                            soul who has been harvested from the earthly, generative order, to whom the Savior has
                            already come, in very truth, whose life is " hid with Christ in God, " �who has been given
                            to eat of the "hidden manna, " with the promise of " Eternal Life, " there can be no farther
                            need of the "types and shadows " of earth and time, save the remembrance of them as
                            stepping-stones to the substance. Send, if you please, the letter, if it is in accordance
                            with your rules, but, it is, to me, a mere matter of form, as the Shaker church demands no
                            other recommendation from its members, save the wedding garment of purity and righteousness
                            which is prepared for all souls who are willing to make the sacrifice which the Lord
                            requires. Once more, accept my love and thanks for all your efforts in my behalf, which have
                            been attended with such blest results. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bates, Louisa" TEIform="persName"/> Louisa Bates.</byline></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="O union, thou spring of salvation" TEIform="index"/>O union, thou spring of salvation

                            from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes. " These facts should be enough to
                            satisfy every inquiring, and discerning mind that the " grand departments" introduced to out
                            notice have nothing at all to do with the " basis of the temple of pure and undefiled
                            religion." But I would not disparage a literary, philological or other intellectual
                            education, but again deny that they contain even the germ of pure religion. Pope said, " A
                            little learning is a dangerous thing, " and so is much learning to the self conceited and
                            aspiring mind, but no amount, be it little or much, is dangerous to the meek, modest and
                            unobtrusive mind. But as nothing merely intellectual can benefit the spirit, the scientific
                            study of music, poetry, analogy, psychometry, etc., must be ruled out. If they had been
                            absolutely necessary to<pb n="80" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>spirit culture Christ would not have neglected
                            them, innocent and harmless though they be ; but devotion, revelation, contemplation and
                            prajer Avere his constant companions and the very essence of* his God-serving life. While it
                            is admitted that extreme and constant study in any direction may be injurious, I would say
                            the spiritual was the least dangerous ; and I would by no means discourage spiritual study
                            on account of its dangerous tendency. I doubt much if any person ever became a maniac by
                            this study who maintained the Christ-like and child-like spirit. It 0$ only those who are
                            puffed up with selfconceit snd aspire to be something more than mortal that are in danger of
                            becoming maniacs ; but many have had their reason dethroned by undue excitement caused by
                            the pictures given of a world of hell-fire with devils for firemen, and such like, by
                            fanatical pulpiteers and others. All such things should be avoided and discountenanced. It
                            is to be hoped that none will be afraid to let the mind run on spiritual things. We may do
                            the best we can in this direction and still find it difficult to prevent worldly things from
                            entering in at times and occupying a seat where they should not. Hence, says Christ, "Watch
                            ye therefore and pray always. "�[Luke xxi., 3(L] The more we study spiritual things and put
                            them in practice the more happy, angelic and useful we will be. The maniac will not touch us
                            while possessing the obedient, child-like spirit of Christ, who said: " Whosoever shall cot
                            receive the Kingdom of God as a lit6le child he shall not enter, therein." ("Mark x., 15.]
                            In order to succeed we are required to, give to God the " whole mind, might and strength, "
                            without reserve, every moment of our existence. All such, God will direct, protect and
                            prosper. Such one or ones can be relied on and followed with more safety than all the
                            wise-acres of the earth blended together. "But to this man will I look, even to him that is
                            poor, of a contrite spirit and trembleth at My word." [Isaiah Ixvi., 2.] So God has always
                            looked and blest, and ever will. Therefore would I say to all who enter His kingdom on earth
                            cease to look after or covet the intellectual and mechanical greatness of the world, which
                            is the Apocalyptic Beast whose tail of pictured pleasures have " drawn down the stars of
                            heaven," and, alas ! is yet but too successful. The only safe and sure way for all is. to
                            look to God in the order of His appointing. Any who reject the gift of God, there, because
                            of a lack of scientific knowledge will find some day the great mistake they have made, and
                            learn the fact that "to be carnally-minded is death, but to be spiritually-minded is life
                            and peace. " Finally, let me add a last parting word, and tell, without the charge of
                            egotism, vanity or dogmatism, what we, the followers of Christ, know, that others may be
                            benefited by the same. We know that God has set up His kingdom on earth. We know that we and
                            all who live the Christ-life are in it. We know (don't think us vain,) with the Apostle
                            John, that " we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. "� [1 John, v., 19.] We
                            know this because we have consecrated soul and body to His service and are not moved by any
                            selfish purpose. The unselfish is of God ; the selfish is of man. We know the world is
                            diseased�" full of woundsT<pb n="81" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> �and bruises and putrefying sores from its
                            crown to the soles of its feet. " We know there is a place where all can be healed and
                            purified, aiid this is within God's kingdom, and we say, " Ho ! every one that thirsteth,
                            come," but come not for a material but a spiritu-il union and joining with the body of
                            Christ. Those who have a material joining only are in danger of falling away every day that
                            this condition continues. There is no real safety for any until they become quickened into
                            spiritual life. One more word in deep humility and I am done : To have God's blessing all
                            must respect and give heed to his Order, for God, though of long forbearance, will not be
                            trifled with. No branch, division or family can prosper and have God's blessing whose
                            leaders possess not the childlike spirit of perfect dependence upon it, and keep a close
                            union and connection with it. The taking our own judgment independently thereof, or
                            concealing from it in auy way, presages decadence and makes prosperity impossible. " By
                            humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life. " [Prov. xxii., 4.] This
                            being true makes the contrary poverty, dishonor and death.

                            entitled, Pioneers of the Western Reserve. Some explanatory remarks are added by J. S.
                            Presoott, a member of the Society of North Union.] Though sneeringly called Shakers by the
                            outside world, it is evident they have become a great moral power, as well as numerous. From
                            their original number seven they have increased in this country to seven thousand, *
                            established eighteen prosperous communities, * This far exceeds the number of Shakers in the
                            United States. and accumulated a property worth from twelve to fifteen millions of dollars.
                            In achieving all this they have kept the faith. Though childless, they have children, most
                            of whom are waifs received from the outside world into the bosom of their communities, where
                            they are kindly treated, and brought up in the nurture and admonition ot Ann Lee,| and
                            trained to habits of industry and a life of moral purity, and are thus saved from a career
                            of vice and moral degradation. It cannot be a bad religion that is devoted to a work so
                            benevolent and humane in its character. But if all mankind were to become Shakers, and
                            should prove true to their faith, it would not require a prophet to predict the speedy and
                            final extinction of the human family. It is said there are more than one thousand different
                            religions in the world, and a priesthood so numerous that they cannot be counted. All claim
                            to be right, yet all condemn each other as wrong. When docters differ, whether medical or
                            divine, who shall decide?�And yet in every age new creeds are generated, and new revelations
                            follow revelations. " t The reason why the doctrines of Ann Lee have " survived her, and
                            never die," is because she revealed the eternal Mother in the Deity. To many, it is still
                            unknown although self-existent. Its power and influence is beginning to bo felt and manifest
                            in the world. Ann Lee's mission took place about one hundred years ago. It was the
                            commencement of a new era in the world's history- -the, changes wrought and the revolutions
                            which have taken place since that time, let the world itself bear witness. Two orders of
                            people are now established on the earth, and are required to be governed by two distinct
                            laws. The first is the rudimental, the law of propagation, i. e. to have no sexual
                            intercourse only for offspring. The second is to keep the higher law, i. e. the law of
                            Christ. Ann Lee could not have fulfilled her mission without advocating virgin celibacy for
                            the higher development of our race. The time had fully come for these two orders to be
                            established. And we need not expect that the calamities will cease, until these two laws are
                            obeyed, if it takes a thousand years. Earth is not heaven, and heaven is not earth. Heaven
                            is a state, or condition of the mind, the effects of " righteousness and peace, and joy in
                            the Holy Spirit." The End.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="God's promises will never fail" TEIform="index"/>God's promises will never fail

                            charity which never faileth, binding up the broken-hearted, strengthening the weak and
                            comforting ' the afflicted. In you is found that power which healeth the sick of sin,
                            casteth out the spirits of evil and givetb sight to those who are blinded to their own best
                            interests. By giving up all, you have received all. For every sacrifice that you have made
                            of selfish pleasures, an hundred fold of spiritual blessings has filled your cup to
                            overflowing, and the pathway in which you walk is leading you nearer and nearer to the
                            fountain of all good, nearer and nearer to God. A few short years here, in which to teach
                            your disciples and followers to do as you have done, to live as you have lived, and then the
                            real home in the Heavens of Glory is opened unto you. " They are slipping away,�these sweet,
                            swift years, Like a leaf on the current cast : With never a break in their rapid flow, We

                            into the beautiful future, into the home of the redeemed, a home that you have made your own
                            by a travel of soul away, far away from sordid passions. Redeemed from all that is not of
                            God. Like the lake in midsummer when the air is still, so is the redeemed spirit. Like unto
                            the tree clothed with the blossoms of Spring, and like unto the tree laden with the ripe
                            fruits of Autumn, so is the redeemed spirit. Like unto the grandeur of the eastern clouds
                            when the sun is rising, so is the redeemed spirit. In the school of Christ you have been
                            disciplined ; by the fire in Zion you have been tried, until like the gold of Ophir you are
                            purified; and now, saith the Spirit, " Ye shall walk with me in white, for ye are worthy. "
                            From this high estate, let your blessing descend like the dew of Hermon into the hearts of
                            your faithful children. Let your mantles rest upon those who follow in your footsteps, and
                            you shall be more than satisfied when the books are opened, and your eyes behold the record
                            of those whom you have led along in the highway of Holiness. And I will sing,� "Let my name
                            be recorded In the book the Angels keep, Where each act is rewarded, And the seed I have
                            sown I shall reap. So when the Angel reaper cometh And the harvest time shall be, I shall
                            find in my Father's house There's a mansion reserved lor me."

                            Testament, becomes more and more interesting, as new light is obtained to aid us in a better
                            understanding of the work. One writer says that the books of the New Testament were gathered
                            from more than 500 MSS. more than a dozen ancient versions and from quotations in the
                            writings of more than a hundred Christian fathers. In the introduction to the revised New
                            Testament by J. H. Hall, L.L.D., we obtain *he following information. It is supposed that
                            Matthew wrote his book of the gospel in Hebrew, as did Paul his epistle to the Hebrews. The
                            other books of the New Testament were written in Greek. These early books were written on
                            papyrus,�ancient paper. It was not very durable and for this reason, the originals of the
                            New Testament books have all perished. The transcripts of the originals have also perished.
                            In the 4th. century, vellum parchment was made from the skins of animals, which was a more
                            durable material. The most ancient MS. known is from the middle of the 4th, centiyy, and
                            those which are before the 10th. century are exceedingly few. Some 60,000 copies of the Npw
                            Testament were in circulation at the close of the 2nd. century and the 1,600 MSS. of the New
                            Testament or parts of it now in existence are copies of those in use at that time. One of
                            the forms of writing at that date was in large capital letters, standing distinct from each
                            other. These form the oldest MSS. of the New Testament, and are thought to be the most
                            correct. The MSS. have no punctuation marks and the liability to error is very common. There
                            are a large number of MSS. in this form dating from the 4th. to the 10th. centuries. These
                            are more or less complete. One closes at the ninth chapter of Hebrews; another contains
                            fragments of all the books of the New Testament, except second Thessalonians and second
                            John. Another contains only the gospels and the book of Acts. The most important one
                            contains all the books<pb n="84" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>of the New Testament and is supposed to have been
                            written in the 4th. century. Another class of these old books was writ" ten more like our
                            ordinary hand writing1 These are supposed to have been written about the 10th century, and
                            some attempt.was made at punctuation. The majority of these books are of but little value. A
                            great many translations of the Bible have been made since the days of the apostles. The one
                            now in use by the Protestants is called the King James Version. It was or. dered by King
                            James the First of England in 1603 and was published in lb'll. It was to be a version of the
                            Bishop's Bible and as little altered as the original would permit. �The. Douay O. T. version
                            was made in 1609 and is used by the Roman Catholic Church. Prom Clark's Commentary, Vol. I.
                            The different nations of the earth which have received the old and new Testaments, have not
                            only had them carefully translated into their respective languages, but have also agreed in
                            the propriety of illustrating them by comments. Ex. xii , 19. " Seven days shall there be no
                            leaven found in your houses." To meet the letter of this precept in the fullest manner
                            possible, the Jews, on the eve of this festival, institute the most rigorous search through
                            every part of their houses not only removing all leavened bread, but sweeping every part
                            clean, that no crumb of bread shall be left that had any leaven in it. So strict were they
                            in the observance of the letter of this law, that if even a mouse was seen to run across the
                            floor with a crurnb of bread in its mouth, they considered the whole house as polluted, and
                            began their puriflca" tion afresh. Leaven was an emblem of sin' because it proceeded from
                            corruption. Ex- xii., 30. " And there was a great cry in Egypt. " No people in the universe
                            were more remarkable for their mournings than the Egyptians especially in matters of
                            religion, they whipped, beat, tore themselves, and howled in all the excess of grief. When a
                            relative died, the people left the house, ran into the streets and howled in the most lam.

                            would be obliged to consult different commentators on the situation of the terrestrial
                            Paradise. Some place it in the third heaven, others in the fourth, some within the orbit of
                            the moon, others in the moon itself, sotre in the middle regions of the air, or beyond the
                            earth's attraction, some on the earth, others under the earth, and others within the earth.
                            Some have fixed it at the north pole, others at the south pole, etc., etc. Joshua, vi., 4.
                            "Seven trumpets of rams' horns. " The instruments used on this occasion were evidently of
                            the same kind with those used on the Jubilee and were probably made of horn or silver, and
                            the text should be translated; and seven priests shall bear before the ark the seven Jubilee
                            trumpets. 2 Samuel, xxiiu, 20. "Two lion-like men of Moab. " Some think that two real lions
                            are meant; some that they were two savage gigantic men; others that two fortresses are
                            meant. 1 Kings, xii., 2. " I will chastise you with scorpions." The scorpion was a military
                            engineer among the Romans for shooting arrows,which being poisoned,.were likened .to the
                            scorpion's sting. Job, iv., 10. " The roaring oi the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
                            and the teeth of the young lions are broken. " By the roaring lion, fierce lion, old lion,
                            stout lion and lion's whelps, tyrannous rulers of all kinds are intended. The design of
                            Eliphaz in using these figures is to show that even those who are possessed of the greatest
                            authority and power, the kings, rulers and princes of the earth, when they become wicked and
                            oppressive to their subjects, are cast down, broken to pieces and destroyed by the Lord.

                            closed her eyes to the things of time and the trials of this earthly sphere. She acted well
                            her part while in the body, and was true and faithful unto the end ; and we read that such
                            shall be saved. She passed thnragh the trials and sufferings of life, keeping in view the
                            bright side of her faith and conviction, and indeed, it may be said of her, that her long
                            life and character is without spot or blemish. She has been a faithful burden-bearer a great
                            portion of her life, having experienced the ups and downs of society life, and through all,
                            led her course quietly and in a peaceable manner. Her kindness was not limited and partial,
                            but extended to all without reserve. The poor and needy were remembered especially. She
                            proved herself a true disciple of our blessed Parents in Heaven. We have reason to believe
                            she had overcome the world in the same sense that Jesus declared that he had overcome the
                            world. And his promise to such was,�" To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in
                            my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down witli my Father in his throne. " She
                            came among Believers n the morning of her days, in company with her sistei s, four in
                            number. They were young and in good circumstances as to means for worldly enjoyments, all of
                            which were cheerfully sacrificed for the one great and holy object�the redemption of their
                            souls. She was the eldest of a family of five sisters, and has outlived nearly all of them,
                            being over four score and ten years. We read, " Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord. "
                            And also, " To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give
                            him a white stone, and in the stone a New Name written, which no man knoweth saving him that
                            receiveth it. " Dear Friends�I have not left you, My spirit still is near, To comfort and to
                            bless you,� AH who the truth revere. Let no one feel discouraged, The way is free for all,
                            And truth alone must save you, Obey your gospel call. Cheer up, ye sorrowing faces� I'm
                            happy and secure, My love to you increases And will forevermore; For Christ thro' Mother
                            blesses The true and honest heart, And such of heaven's glory Will surely have a part. My
                            thanks and love, I give you� You are most dear to me, I claim you all, dear children, My joy
                            yfith you shall be To endless ages growing, Increasing evermore, When you with me shall sing
                            sweet songt With saints who've gone before. Adieu! adieu, dear kindred. Take faith and be ye
                            strong : Faint not, nor be ye weary� But help each other on; For peace and quiet dealing
                            With condescension sweet, Will make your earth-life pleasant, Your happiness replete.

                                    would bring burdens and losses on other people. There may be rare cases where a man
                                    really cannot help entanglements, or where, from inexperience, or lack of judgment,
                                    lie has brought his affairs into such a state that the interest of others depends
                                    upon his life ; but lie should make all possible haste to extricate himself from

                                    that his death should cause no one to be wronged. And as to dying, although all men

                            Shaker to an English vegetarian. The Gazette thinks it may be interesting to some readers
                            and amusing to the rest, and for the same double purpose it is reproduced below : I am
                            deeply interested in the spread of vegetarian ideas in England, believing as I do, that
                            England will never cease to learn and practice the horrible art of war until she hears the
                            Divine command, " Thou shalt not kill, " and religiously obeys it. Of course, a new land
                            system would logically follow, for the war system originated the present land system.
                            Meat-eaters, sword in hand, took possession of the land by force. Possession is nine points
                            in law, and they made the law to secure to themselves title to the remaining tenth part. I
                            am religiously converted and conscientiously convicted that riotous eating of food from the
                            butcher is a direct cause of war, land monopoly, intemperance, and their concomitant evils.
                            You speak of forming a colony of vegetarians in England. Do it by all means. My opinion is
                            that such a colony would soon become a Shaker family, holding their land in common, laboring
                            in common, all being teetotalers and non-resistants. Also they would refrain from increasing
                            the population until, to all who do exist, life was a blessing. All truths have a family
                            relation ; they go together. A Southern planter who owned many slaves, prohibited his
                            daughter from introducing the use of brown bread into his family, saying, " I have observed
                            that vegetarians all become abolitionists, and brown bread is the first step to
                            vegetarianism. " Why not found Shaker societies, on the basis of vegetarianism, as above
                            suggested, to check population and emigration ? Religious celibacy is Nature's balance wheel
                            to the population faculty in humanity. Try it.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Science and spirit" TEIform="index"/> SCIENCE AND SPIRIT.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Field, Pletus" TEIform="persName"/> PLETUS FIELD. </byline><p TEIform="p"> Science scans all that is seen below From fragrant flowers to stars that glow; From the

                                stray from the path of rectitude. Guard closely the avenues of the heart where
                                temptation and sin may enter, and place a double watch at the weakest point of this
                                celestial fortress. Now look about you and make yourself wise by observation, and
                                experience. Where you discover goodness strive to imitate it. Fear God and keep his
                                commandments. Waste not time in idle; useless pursuits, or conversation. Ever heed the

                            For tragic Fate usurped its reign, And he in death is still! In death we say,�but that sad

                            might evade ? We hoped to claim thee, brother dear, For many years to come; And why should

                            cannot well say less : A brother who has nobly stood, With aim to love and bless. ****** And
                            as our dearest ones depart For brighter, angel spheres, One universal throb of heart With

                            and vital action. We are living in a very eventful age, a period of human history wherein
                            the powers of mind and the soul of humanity are reaching out, in every direction, in both
                            the material and spiritual world, to discover causes of phenomena manifest to the senses ;
                            and energetically tracing those discovered causes, to their normal and legitimate
                            consequences. Investigation is peering into science, Philosophy is instituting new
                            inventions and guiding the ringers of art; Literary researches are inquiring after the past
                            history of our "ace, to find its origin in God's great universal plan, and, if possible, to
                            mark out a path for the luture. Geology is postulating the origin, and date of the advent of
                            the creation of man. But, with all these things, the hungering and restless soul of humanity
                            is not satisfied. Lost, in contemplating the infinity of the universe, and unable to account
                            for the freedom of the human will, millions are wrestling with the question, " If a man die,
                            shall he live again ? " Other millions chafingly inquiring " Is life worth living ? " There
                            are still left a multitude of soul-quickened intelligences, whose spirit visions reach
                            beyond the tomb, and whose semi-fledged angel wings are beating a more ethereal air than of
                            the earthly heavens ; and whose spirit eyes, visioned by beams of radiance from the sun of
                            God's truth, are beholding celestial abodes for the soul of man, for which their inspired
                            spirits are yearning with a fervency unknown, undreamed of by those whose being is all
                            absorbed with earthly sciences, and filled to sleeplessness with philosophies and
                            sophistries that fulminatingly betray each other. These soul-stirred beings are reaching
                            heavenward, after a pure religion ; having unsatisfactorily tried those systems which
                            dwai*f, stultify and virtually enslave, instead of liberate the soul, or postulate its
                            salvation as a bequest upon a vagrant vicariously bestowed, they are reaching out,
                            inquisitively, seeking a religion that is in harmony with a God character who is a merciful
                            Heavenly Father, and a charitable, forgiving, and Nursing Mother to the penitent soul. A
                            religion bearing in its vessels the waters of repentance from the wells of salvation, to
                            clean up the sin-sooted soul, and a healing balm of righteousness to restore the bruised
                            soul to healthy soundness and beauty ; a religion whose converts to its theology may not
                            only sing of Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens, but, if obedient to its behests and
                            revelations, bask in the sunshine of the bliss of God. To us, dear Gospel Friends, this
                            Precious Gospel Pearl is given; yet, not alone for us, but for all, who, baptized with the
                            truth-seeking spirit, are peering into the archives of revelation, to find food for their
                            hungering souls. To us have been given these blessings to disseminate ! Is not the inquiry
                            momentous, How, with our limited measure of strength we may most efficiently accomplish our
                            work ? Considering the limited able capacity among us to officiate as heralds in the mortal
                            form, to us it feels important that we store our " Manifesto " that every number of it shall
                            be a 88tup: <pb n="89" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> living epistle of the gospel of a full and free salvation
                            and redemption, and every number be so dispensed, as to be a missionary of the same, both at
                            home and abroad. Truly the harvest of humanity who need to be gathered into the garners of
                            God is very great, but the laborers are very few, and many of them worn with | toil and very
                            feeble, and their waves of usefulness fast ebbing from the shore of earth's boundaries, to
                            return no more in time ! Every condition of Zion is pulsating with demands for more
                            laborers, active souls, baptized with power to preach the kingdom of God, both by precept
                            and example ; to tell the world that the dual Christ, in his glory, has come, to sit as a
                            refiner's fire, and as fuller's soap ;,�a healer who hath a balm for the wounded, and a
                            provider of both mil!: for babes in Christ, and meat for the hungering, who, when baptized
                            Avitli the Christ spirit, are able to become men and women of God. Let every soul in Zion
                            earnestly pray to God that He may hear the Heavens, and that the Heavens may hear the earth,
                            ; and the earth may hear the corn and the oil and the fruit of the vine. The light of this
                            Gospel Day is sufficient to show to every soul, a path of perfect purity ; and the baptismal
                            inspiration of its testimony is powerful enough to enable every soul, who receives and keeps
                            it, to live without sin. Therefore, let the sinner in Zion be confounded, and repent, and
                            turn to God. Let those who would live in ease, " crying the lurden of the Lord, " and
                            unwilling to toil for; lost souls, and the upbuilding of the kingdom of God, arouse from
                            their lethargy and slumbers, and work for God, lest the spirit of the Lord of the Vineyard
                            dismiss them from His service, turn them out of the vineyard, and, to occupy their places,
                            call in those who will labor for the salvation of souls. Let those who would cry, " It is
                            yet three months, and then comethharvest," hear the Lord of the Vineyard crying, " Lo, the
                            fields are white, ready for the harvest; thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the harvest of
                            the earth is ripe!" Let the Covenant-breaker renew his pledge, and those whose faith hath
                            waned, and their lamps of gospel light grown dim, arise and trim their lamps, for the
                            heralds of the Lord of Hosts are crying, S' Lo the Bridegroom cometh with his heavenly
                            Bride, Go ye forth to meet them."</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B." TEIform="persName"/>Giles B.

                            that will begin an agitation upon this subject and pursue it to a successful issue will
                            become as immortal as John Brown, whose soul is marching on toward the emancipation of
                            wages, slavery, hirelings, which is much deeper seated and far more universal than chattel
                            slavery ever was on this planet. Vested rights may not be touched. What then can be done ?
                            Where there is a will there is a way. Let land limitation be prospective. From Jan. 1, 1884
                            no citizen of these United States, male or female, shall buy and become possessed of more
                            than 100 acres of land. So fast as present landlords die their estates shall pass to
                            landless heirs, 160 acres each, the overplus shall go into the market and be sold within one
                            year, each heir receiving equal share of the proceeds. The operation of such a law would be
                            like the dew of Mt, Hermon, the people would be continually refreshed thereby. Death would
                            be a joyous messenger in the land. Let the funeral of a land monopolist become a festive
                            occasion. But if death claimed a land monopolist who had voluntarily sold or given away the
                            legal overplus of his estate, let the mourners honor him or her by erecting some cheap but
                            enduring memorial, such as planting a particular kind of tree in a section of the burial
                            ground set apart by each town as a memorial ground wherein none other should have the honor
                            to be interred. How long would land monopolists run the risk of having the bells rung, the
                            cannon fired and bonfires lighted at their exit from the scenes of their unpatriotic earthly
                            labors ? I think there is far more latent good in the hearts of evil-doers than
                            philanthropists give them credit for. Witness the fact that some of the most efficient
                            abolitionists were from the ranks of slave-holders and that the civil war itself* was
                            largely sustained by the self-sacrificing capitalists to whose misdirected financial
                            abilities it owed its origin. "The foundations of the earth are out of course. " The system
                            of government may be largely improved. It can come only gradually. The blessings flowing
                            from aland limitation law require an abler pen and more vivid imagination than mine to
                            properly depict. In every town in each county of New York state would begin a new life.
                            Young men and women now looking westward for a homestead in which to build up a family would
                            begin to lay by a little capital, to wait and watch the annual land market to secure the
                            coveted prize. Farms would multiply, dwelling houses with their accessories be built,
                            schools be better supplied with children and far better supported than at present; and
                            public schools would soon become industrial schools, where economy, industry and health
                            would be among the subjects of education. Roads, lecture halls and meeting houses would be
                            within easy reach of the people of a densely populated town, and the products of each
                            district would be largely consumed by the producers in that neighborhood. When so much good
                            and no possible evil would flow from the land limitation law why may we not have it without
                            unnecessary delay, to the end that there be neither rich nor poor left in the land ? Mt.

                            signature entitled "Land Limitation." I would like to reach clear over (500 miles and shake
                            hands with you, but in so doing I should reach over and past hundreds of other thinkers, who
                            like you and me have caught the gleam of the coming dawn of the day of truth. I suppose the
                            word Elder signifies that you are a follower and standard-bearer of the Nazarene. In my weak
                            way I try to be the same. I believe that his word, his truth, will yet rule the world. And I
                            am sure that " Land Limitation" is precisely in the line of his doctrine. The Church is not
                            up to the teachings of its great Head, nor will it be, I suppose, forever, for our progress
                            towards the Infinite must needs be eternal. But I am persuaded the time is not far distant
                            when all monopoly, and especially land monopoly will be reckoned, by our religious teachers,
                            in the same list with robbery and extortion. This would be " political preaching, " it is
                            true, but we all remember how the abolitionist preachers were reminded that "Christ's
                            kingdom is not of this world. " And we remember too how they preached on, being assured that
                            although not of the world, that kingdom must dominate the world. Those who feel the pressure
                            of the tyrant's heel, can best describe his power. I know there are thousands, who like
                            myself could tell bitter stories of seemingly unending strife against hard circumstances.
                            Yet, to the cry of the monopolist, our condition is good enough. They tell me I can succeed
                            if I work. I admit it. lean. I think I will. I can work. I am not afraid of self-denial. I
                            can manage my farm. I say I will succeed. To the monopolist, this is enough. Having sold his
                            own soul, and dwarfed and shrivelled every noble power of his being to gain wealth, he is
                            not ashamed to ask me to do the same. So I toil on. I give the years, the best of my life,
                            to get me a home�to gain the right to plow the land and make bread. Why, God gave me the
                            right to plow. And while I am thus toiling for a foot-hold on the earth, and as the
                            monopolist views it, it may be succeeding, what am I doing for my own soul? Joseph Cook
                            lectures in the near village, on subjects I long to study, but cannot hear him. I have not
                            the time nor the few cents to spare. There are Libraries within reach of me, but I must not
                            read. Even cheap books are too dear for me while I am paying for the right to work. And if I
                            succeed in heaping up a few dollars at such a cost, and then lifting my son out of the class
                            of the oppressed into the class of the oppressors, then the monopolist thinks I ought to be
                            satisfied. Why, sir, the mortgage-ridden farmers of this country are dead intellectually and
                            morally, and do not know it. They think if they pay for their farms at the expense of half a
                            life-time of toil, and throw their souls in, they are doing well. God prosper you, sir. With

TEIform="persName"/>REV. GEORGE W. TIMLOW, D. D.</byline><p TEIform="p"> [Contributed by Eld. G. B. A.] PRAYER BY REV. GEORGE W. TIMLOW, D. D. There are two classes
                            of people, one saying, " What profit shall we have, if we pray untoltim?" and the other
                            declaring, "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. " At a time when
                            this question is much discussed, let us see what the rational and Scriptural idea of it is;
                            for manifestly there are wrong impressions in regard to it. It is not the doctrine of the
                            Bible nor the dictate of reason that asking, alone and of itself, is prayer. It has no real
                            existence separate from a rightful aim, aspiration, character. One may seek for spiritual
                            knowledge, and be none the wiser; for spiritual strength, and be no stronger; for faith,
                            sure and steadfast, and receive nothing. He may ask and receive not, because he asks amiss.
                            If he does not group together and observe the conditions, and all of them announced, as the
                            law in the case, failure meets him at every step. The Apostle John gives his understanding
                            of the question, "And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments,
                            and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. " Prayer has a place, is a factor, a
                            means, in the great spiritual lives that have moved the<pb n="92" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> world; but how
                            absurd to say, Let us try it by itself: that is, let us use petition only. The mainspring of
                            a watch has a very important place, but only in its relation to and connection with all the
                            other parts of the mechanism. Affirming its necessary place and use in the watch, we are not
                            prepared to say, Let us take the mainspring out by itself and test its power and accuracy as
                            a chronometer. It is an error to suppose that any one can tell just what prayer is in its
                            nature. In science, no one can tell just what any element or any substance is. He knows
                            something, but not all about it. lie knows something of its conditions, phenomena, of its
                            forces, something of its correlation to other things : of its absolute nature, he knows
                            nothing. When Prof. Tyndall lectures on light, he comes to a point when lie says : " That is
                            all I know about it. No one can tell its cause, unravel all of its nature and mystery. "
                            That concession does not destroy the fact or the force of light. But it is said that prayer
                            implies a possible change on the part of God, and that "puts the question outside of the
                            laws of harmony." Suppose it true (we do not so affirm it) that prayer does imply a change
                            on the part of God, is that in contradiction to their own scientific doctrine of forces?
                            These same scientific men tell us that, when we pull a boat to the shore, the boat-hook at
                            the same time pulls the earth toward us; that a grain of sand dropped affects the universe;
                            that planets attract the sun, and the sun the planets,� that action and reaction are
                            everywherem the whole domain of physics, and that the harmony of the universe, so far from
                            being disturbed, is dependent upon these very conditions. . .. � . If their own laws of
                            force are correct, then it follows that a mind operating in the line of God's own
                            nature�having in itself qualities like those of God, as atoms have of the earth� will have
                            an influence upon the mind of God: it will from its own laws of farce, have an influence
                            upon the mind of God, and yet no more disturb the constancy of God's nature and plans and
                            purposes than the influence of planets upon the sun, and of star upon star, disturb by the
                            changes they produce the harmony of the universe, but are, as the astronomers say, the
                            conditions that result in that harmony. Why may not the writers of the Bible apply the same
                            law to the spiritual world that science does in the whole empire of nature? Take the law of
                            the magnets, of which Prof. Tyndall speaks. When in a certain state, the poles attract, tend
                            to each other, when not in that state, they repel each other. Take the divine mind and the
                            human. May there not be conditions in which they tend the one to the other, and God dwells
                            in the soul in consciousness, love, and power? In other and opposite conditions, may not the
                            will, aim, desires of the person be repellent to the will of God. and all this too within
                            the sphere of consciousness? Does life witness these facts, as science does its phenomena
                            and laws? Is the testimony of the multitudes, that no man can number, without place and
                            force, who say, "We speak of that we do know, and we testify of that we have seen? " What
                            analogy of science controverts the doctrine, " Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to
                            you? " As to how far a mind, seeking and keeping the laws or divine commandments in the
                            case, may influence the material world, we do not know. Shall we say, Not at all? Then, we
                            are reminded that mind has sought and kept the laws of one element in nature, that it is the
                            will, desire, prayer of mind that drives its trains night and day through the land; that is,
                            the force of mind over matter. It tunnels the mountains, makes a dry road over the rivers,
                            grades the uneven belling States, and opens a highway of commerce from sea to sea. Is there
                            lack of harmony here between seeking, striving, and prevailing human minds and the purposes
                            of God? Another element, and mind was long seeking and asking, then finding its laws. They
                            are found and kept; and mind joins itself to iron nerves that web the land, dip under the
                            oceans, feel as by sensation what is going on at the same time in,.two hemispheres. It
                            controls the movements of armies, directs navigation, affects the thoughts and plans of

                            what we read. All these things�the power through steam, electricity and certainty in weather
                            prophecy�would have been declared impossibilities or miracles a century ago. But men sought,
                            observed obediently the laws in the case ; and we have no evidence of violence done to the
                            divine government, or that it is in any way thrown out of joint. These and all questions as
                            to how for mind may affect the world of matter are purely questions of evidence. The place
                            of prayer as a factor and force in history is to be determined by the records of the past.
                            Are the records that contain the testimony true or false? We cannot dispose of these by

                            phase of impossibility. Scientific men told Prof. Morse that making beats over the land at
                            the speed of hundreds of miles per second was an impossibility. But proof of the feet became
                            stronger than the a priori negation. Learned men once said in the British Parliament that no
                            one could ride in cars, as was pretended, twenty miles per hour, without losing his breath.
                            There is now considerable evidence that the learned men were mistaken. Prayer, like any
                            other great question, may present apparent contradictions or paradoxes. So does Science. Our
                            senses tell us that the moon moves toward the west. Science demonstrates that it moves
                            toward the east. The sun seems to move around the earth, yet evidence comes and corrects the
                            mistake made by the senses. In the relations existing between man finite and God Infinite,
                            do we expect to find nothing mysterious, no seeming paradoxes, depths which reason has not
                            sounded, and which are not contrary to, because they are yet heyond the exploration of
                            reason? The question of prayer returns to one of fact, evidence purely, and cannot be
                            determined by assuming what the science of prayer ought or ought not to be. Prayer, or what
                            is commonly called prayer, is natural in the human soul,�natural not for one people, one
                            age, but all. Tne same evidence that shows us that sight and hearing are natural to the
                            human race, although multitudes are blind or deaf, shows to us that prayer must rest upon
                            some universal law, gencrically if not individually present, as sight, hearing, etc., are
                            generically, if not individually, found among all people in all times and places.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Books" TEIform="index"/> Books and Papers</head><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hall's journal of health" TEIform="index"/>Hall's Journal of Health

An old physician, retiredi from practice, having
had placed in his hands by an East India missionary
the formula of a simple vegetable remedy for the
speedy and permanent cure of Consumption, Bronchitis, Catarrh, Asthma and all throat and Lung Affections, also a positive and radical cure for Nervous Debility and all Nervous Complaints, after having tested its wonderful curative powers in thousand* of cases, has felt it his duty to make it known
to his suffering fellows. Actuated by this motive
and a desire to relieve human suffering. I will send
free of charge, to all who desire it. this recipe, in
German, French or English, with full directions for
preparing and using. Sent by mail by addressing

Power's Block, Rochester; N.   Y.
A happy surprise it was to Mr. A. R.
Norton, of Bristol, Conn., when Athlophoros
put him on his feet, and sent him cheerfully
about his business. Let him tell his own story:
"About three weeks ago I was taken
with a severe crick in the back.   For four days
I was unable to turn in bed without help, and
when lifted up could not stand on my feet. I was
induced to try Athlophokos, after all the usual
remedies failed.   In 20 minutes after taking- the
first dose I could bear my weight upon my feet.
In two days I was able to get about and attend
to business.   In two other cases which have
come to my knowledg-e its use has been attended
with the same results."
A poor man in Philadelphia had to borrow a dollar to bur a bottle of Athi ophoros.
On account of his poverty his name shall r main
a secret. He had suffered terribly from liheumatism.   He gratefully writes:
" I took my first dose Tuesday afternoon,
and on Wednesday, after but seven doses, lh.d
not a sharp or severe ache left. Then I reduced
the dose one-half and tooli the remainder of the
bottle. I wa3 able to be steady at work till Saturday, when I took a severe cold and was unable to use my left hand. I purchased another
bottle and by bed-time I found re.ief. The
medicine is all you claim for it."
Investigate Athlophokos all you please!
Find all the fault you choose with it! and
yet the fact remains, that it is doing what
no other medicine ever could do for Rheumatism and Neuralgia.
If you cannot get Athlophoros of your druggist, we will send it express paid, on receipt of
regular price�one dollar per bottle. We prefer
that you buy it from your druggist, but if he
hasn-t it, do not be persuaded to try something
else, but order at once from us as directed.
