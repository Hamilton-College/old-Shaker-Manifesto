                            0. Blinn. The imprisonment of the Believers in Albany. The preaching of the gospel excited
                            an alarm among the children of this world who viewed with unpleasant apprehension this new
                            religion, embraced as it was with such enthusiastic zeal by so many persons. As the
                            testimony of the gospel was a testimony of peace, it gave occasion to the enemies of the
                            cross of Christ to take advantage of the Believers as the country was in a war with Great
                            Britain. They represented the Believers as enemies to the country and this charge was made
                            the pretext for many abuses which they were obliged to suffer. The first open act of
                            persecution that took place after the testimony was preached in America was in July 1780. As
                            many people from New Lebanon, Hancock and other places resorted to Niskeyuna to hear the
                            word of God, those Believers who were able, took with them provisions for their support.
                            Evil minded men in the vicinity of New Lebanon accused the Believers of acting against the
                            civil government, which soon led to a cruel persecution. David Darrow of New Lebanon while
                            driving a flock of sheep to Niskeyuna, was seized by three men. The sheep were stolen and
                            David was taken before<pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Matthew Adgate, a justice of the peace under the
                            royal government. The charge of treason was brought against him, but as Adgate had no
                            authority to try such cases, David was sent under guard to Albany and delivered to the "
                            Committee of safety," to be tried by them. John Hocknell and Joseph Meacham were sent, by
                            the Believers, to Albany to witness the course of the trial, but on their arrival they were
                            held for examination before the Committee. These accusers knew it was contrary to the faith
                            of the Believers to bear arms and become soldiers, and on this account flattered themselves
                            with the hope of confirming the charge of treason. As the minds of the Committee had already
                            been impressed with this fact, they were ready to exert their authority, according to their
                            discretion. After an examination the Brethren were ordered to promise obedience to the laws,
                            without being informed what those laws should be. The result was as might have been
                            expected. The prisoners, whose faith and conscience bound them to obey every just and
                            righteous law, without any external obligation, could not promise obedience to laws which
                            were yet unknown, and which in all probability would be unjust and oppressive. Consequently
                            the Committee sent them to prison. But the imprisonment of only three persons, DavidDarrow,
                            Joseph Meacham and John Hocknell, was not considered as being sufficient to stop the
                            progress of the testimony of the word of God. They next seized Hezekiah Hammond and Joel
                            Pratt, two influential preachers of the gospel of Christ, and committed them to prison. An
                            officer was sent to the home of the Believers and Mother Ann, Elder William Lee and Elder
                            James Whittaker were arrested and taken to Albany. After passing a short examination before
                            the Committee and being charged as enemies to the country, they were committed to prison.
                            This was a day of sadness for the little Community, and their sorrows were in tears and
                            prayers for the protection and safe return of these, their best gospel friends. Mary
                            Partington was permitted to accompany Mother Ann, as her companion, and to assist her as
                            best she could under these unpleasant conditions. Calvin Harlow also went to Albany to
                            render what assistance he was able, to the Brethren. The company were imprisoned in the old
                            City Hall, but after a few days were removed,to a prison in the "Old Fort, " where the
                            tories and prisoners of war were confined. All the leading characters of the gospel work
                            were now under arrest by the instigation of evil minded men, who had thought to suppress the
                            testimony by persecution. The Believers were still zealous in their religious service and in
                            supporting the testimony of truth at all hazards. No outward opposition could lessen the
                            zeal of a people who had been awakened by the resurrection power of Christ, and who by their
                            obedience to the truth had been made partakers of the power of salvation from all sin. The
                            next person to be arrested was Samuel Johnson of New Lebanon. It was during the hour of
                            worship, on 'the Sabbath, and while Samuel was engaged in prayer. Several persons hurriedly
                            entered the church and rudely dragged the praying brother from the meeting.<pb n="219" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> After a mock trial before the Justice, Adgate, he was taken to Albany and
                            delivered to the Committee for further trial. Samuel had formerly been a minister in a
                            Presbyterian church, and the crime for which he was charged, was in saying.�"People cannot
                            follow Christ and live in wars and fightings. " The Commissioners represented to him the
                            danger of preaching such doctrines among the people. Samuel replied,� " I speak what Grod
                            gives me to speak. I have spoken no more. " The Commissioners remarked,. "The elect lady
                            will be sent to the British army at New York," and intimated that the Society of Believers
                            would be broken up. " She is the elect lady, indeed and in truth, " replied Samuel, " but
                            whether she lives or dies, I know that the work is of Grod, and that this testimony's the
                            testimony of truth. " Samuel then informed the Commissioners that he received his light on
                            the subject of war from the New Testament, and not from the Believers. He was fully
                            convinced in his own mind that those who follow Christ cannot live in wars and fightings.
                            "Before receiving this conviction " said he, '' I was very zealous in the cause of the
                            country, but knowing the truth of Christ's word I could proceed no further. " The
                            Commissioners then informed Samuel that they would not suffer such doctrines to be preached
                            among the people. Samuel replied, " I shall speak what God gives me to speak: for I feel it
                            my duty to obey God rather than man. " This remark offended them very much, and they were on
                            the point of condemning him to be executed as a traitor when Dr. Stringer, one of the
                            Committee declared Samuel to be insane, ami he was ordered to be imprisoned in the jail of
                            the old City Hall. After the excitement was over, many candid and thoughtful men expressed
                            their displeasure at the injustice of the proceedings. The public imprisonment of innocent
                            people, for no other cause, in reality, than their religious faith, had a powerful effect
                            upon the minds of honest and impartial people, and of course, drew many inquiring people to
                            search into the truth of the accusations. This caused a more extensive circulation of the
                            religious principles, than would otherwise have been, if the enemies of the cross had not
                            resorted to persecution. A great many people visited the prisoners, and after having heard
                            their testimony of the work of God, were led to accept the truth, and to seek a privilege to
                            make an honest confession of their sins to God, before his anointed witnesses. In this way
                            the truth prevailed against all opposition, and many were added to the faith. The word of
                            God which could not be bound was preached to large assemblies through the grates of the
                            prison, and the hearts of the hearers were touched to accept the testimony of truth. Many
                            precious gifts of God, many divine lessons of instruction, and many heavenly visions were
                            received by those confined within the prison. Communication was allowed with the friends of
                            the prisoners, and the privilege was granted to the Believers of administering to the
                            necessities of their imprisoned gospel relation, so that in the midst of affliction, they
                            were blessed of God in the spirit of peace.<pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> The persecutors of Mother
                            Ann, considering her the grand actress in these movements, directed their malice more
                            particularly against her, and were anxious to banish her to the British army then stationed
                            in New York. The Committee however, decided to send her to Poughkeepsie. She was taken from
                            the prison in Albany, in the month of August, and conveyed on board a sloop, and sent down
                            the river to Poughkeepsie and imprisoned in the jail of that town. On this trip, Mary
                            Partington was allowed to accompany Mother Ann. During this term of imprisonment, Mother Ann
                            was treated generally, with much kindness. As Mary was not considered a prisoner she had
                            full liberty to procure anything that was needed for their comfort. Mother Ann endured this
                            injustice with marked patience and Christian resignation. Much of the time was spent in
                            great suffering of soul and in prayer to God for the protection and prosperity of her
                            spiritual children. Elizar Goodrich, Samuel Fitch and others visited the Sisters in prison,
                            but through fear that the presence of strangers might excite alarm among the inhabitants of
                            the town, they were advised not to tarry long as it might bring on additional persecution.
                            Elizar was the messenger of kind and encouraging words from Mother Ann to the Elders who
                            were still in the prison at Albany. When Elizar delivered his message, the Elders were so
                            overjoyed that they exclaimed, "How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings
                            of good things, and publish peace." In thankfulness for this message they all kneeled in
                            prayer with their faces to his feet. After an imprisonment of several weeks, Mother Ann was
                            removed to the house of James Boyd of Poughkeepsie, who had accepted faith in her testimony,
                            while she was in prison and who had with the assistance of Joseph Ellis, another young
                            Believer, become responsible for her appearance at court, so that she was permitted to leave
                            the jail.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Conscience" TEIform="index"/> CONSCIENCE. When, and how far, it is authority for human

                            sanctioned by punishment" as the consequence of infraction of its laws, " is the type, and
                            the starting point, even when the conscience takes an independent flight, and adopts rules
                            for itself, different from those that entered into its education." "Keep the eyes of the
                            soul open" so that the character of a true and pure conscience may be kept in view !
                            However, in order to know how far the conscience a person possesses is authority for conduct
                            of life it is necessary to know, first, what conscience is.� 1st. Conscience is a monitor,
                            which, when heeded, is a guide to the conduct of human life. 2nd. If enlightened, by the
                            lamp of divine truth, in the revealed light of God, it may be a safe and true guide. 3rd. If
                            unenlightened, or, having been enlightened, and faithfully instructed in the truth, it is
                            disobeyed, until its light is obliterated, it becomes an unsafe and false guide to life.
                            4th. But, conscience is also a pupil, a student, and may be rightly or wrong-<pb n="221" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>ly taught, or left in ignorance, without instruction. St. Paul speaks of
                            different characters of conscience thus, "a weak and weakened conscience, a good conscience,
                            a pure conscience, an evil conscience, a defiled conscience, and a seared conscience, " and
                            he admonishes his hearers to '' purge their consciences from dead works." And these
                            characteristics of conscience correspond to the general understanding of the enlightened
                            mind. It is thus manifest that conscience may, or may not, be a true guide to the conduct of
                            life, according as it may have been rightly or wrongly taught, or otherwise, may have been
                            left untaught, consequently ignorant of right and wrong. Human experience illustrates this ;
                            thus, some of the inhabitants of the West India Islands, and of New Zealand, and even the
                            Scots of Britain, once thought it right to kill and eat human beings ; and these were not of
                            the lowest class of barbarians neither, but, some of them, having considerable progress in
                            science and art. In "Angas's New Zealand Illustrated " there is a picture of the country
                            mansion of the accomplished chief Rangihaeta, one of the finest specimens" says the author,
                            "of elaborately ornamented dwellings yet extant; its name is Kai Tangata, which means, eat
                            man, and it has been so called in memorial of the feasts within its walls." * John Calvin
                            appeared to have had a conscience that caused him to feel it right, and not only right, but
                            duty, to burn Servetus. The Empress Theodora, possibly may have thought she was
                            conscientiously doing duty when she ordered her subjects, in one campaign into * Library of
                            useful knowledge. Armenia, to put to death over one hundred thousand Paulicians, in a most
                            barbarous manner, because they held different religious views from herself and her court,
                            and by them, were called Heretics! The conscience of Pope Innocent, and the soldiers of his
                            Papal armies, may have been so educated as to believe they were in G-od's service, when they
                            put to death over two hundred thousand of the Waldenses and Albigenses, a people whose
                            doctrine, as reported by themselves, was, "to renounce the world, to bridle the lusts of the
                            flesh, to maintain ourselves by the labor of our own hands, to do violence to no man, to
                            love the brethren" and sisters. In view of these persecutions, the Church historian,
                            Robinson, says, "Dominion over conscience, is anti-christ, anywhere," and "Conscience,
                            everywhere, is a throne of G-od." Of an enlightened and godly taught conscience this is
                            true, but of consciences that are barbarous, unenlightened, or, having been enlightened,
                            have ,been disobeyed until they have become seared as with a hot iron, as St. Paul says,
                            they become the throne of Satan. Possibly Martin Luther may have claimed to be
                            conscientious, as a protestant to the Catholic faith, in his persecutions of the
                            ana-baptists, and his presumptuous damnation of all who differed from him in faith, though
                            he, and his followers exercised the same cruel spirit, that had been manifest by the
                            Catholic church of Rome. "But, how inconsistent it must appear, to every feeling heart and
                            Christian mind, to hear the title of '' glorious reformation," applied to that abominable
                            work which was wrought by Martin Luther,<pb n="222" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> and his followers, when, by
                            gibbet, fire, and sword, they could and did exterminate their fellow beings from the earth,
                            as they would mad dogs ! Could such conscientious works be the fruit of a conscience, which,
                            as Robinson says '' is everywhere the throne of God?" Forbid it, kind heaven ; forbid it all
                            ye honest and enlightened sons and daughters of men ! It is farther possible that John
                            Calvin may have claimed to have been conscientious in instituting his doctrine of absolute
                            decrees, and punishing, by imprisonment and death those who opposed his authority ; but it
                            was the same Satanic spirit that inspired Luther, and the dominant powers of the Catholic
                            Church ; and consciences that could originate and execute such horrid cruelties could not be
                            considered by any good, enlightened person as a "throne of God in the soul." Alas, much more
                            appropriately would such consciences be known as the throne of Satan ! Multitudinous
                            examples might be given to illustrate characteristic consciences, that, instead of being
                            monitors and guides to righteousness, goodness, mercy and truth, have been leaders to
                            wickedness, cruelty, and desolation to the human race. On the other hand some Brahmins have
                            a conscience that does not allow its possessors to destroy the smallest insect, and they
                            will punish themselves for having knowingly killed a flea. The poet (Cowper) says :� " I
                            would not enter on my list of friends, Though graced withjpolished manners and fine sense
                            The man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm." It is not uncommon for persons who have
                            consciences very ignorant of the principles of righteousness, or such as have been seared
                            and malformed, by sinning against light and truth to such a degree as to be unable to see
                            what is right, to claim they are doing right, because they are not condemned by their
                            consciences. It is thus clearly manifest, that, although conscience is a mentor and monitor,
                            it is also, necessarily a pupil, and needs instruction in the school-of Christ at the feet
                            of wisdom, presented by souls who have learned, by obedience to Christ's gospel, the paths
                            of righteousness and peace. The conscience of some persons would be as unfit to trust for
                            safe human progress, as a balky horse ; as unsafe a lamp for a guide in the dark labyrinth
                            of human experiences as a jack o' lantern in a rice swamp. To be a sure and safe guide,
                            conscience must be educated in the school of Christ, and have learned obedience to revealed
                            truth ; and only such a conscience is "the throne of God" in the soul of man. Mt. Lebanon,
                            N. Y. </p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Gently and easy to be entreated, without partiality and without hypocrisy no. 2" TEIform="index"/> " Gentle and Easy to be Entreated, without Partiality and without Hypocrisy."

                            or concern for him, and that he tad nothing of value but a strong determination to make a

                            effect. You and I have seen such, who, in the midst of great temptation, stood truthful,
                            honest; without a teacher, became learned, and gathered substance without capital. One who,
                                standing<pb n="223" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> upright, became beloved ; without friends in childhood,
                            could count his friends by thousands in manhood; and from an errand boy, had arisen to some
                            of the most useful stations in society, and a strong pillar to support all the radical
                            reforms of the age. I have studied such biographies with thrilling interest. Here let me say
                            that this character is the best phototype of a Shaker, that ever existed. Such a character
                            arises to be a man without the shadow of partial surroundings, and so does the Shaker. A
                            true body of Believers, in our faith, are self-made men and women. To God they give all the
                            glory for their uprising in a spiritual resurrection. When called into this order and
                            awakened to an understanding of sin, by the Holy Spirit, they see that they must rise out of
                            the lost state that they are in by bearing the cross of Christ, and that none can do the
                            work for them. Nothing of their old character will answer now, they must have one entirely
                            new, and they cannot get it till they toil and suffer for it, and earn it. Like the pilgrim
                            at the gold diggings without capital, if they secure the precious dust, they dig it, wash
                            it, cleanse it, for none are partial enough to do it for them. At the door into this church,
                            there is no partiality ; the poor candidate who will show his lost condition, will pass in
                            before the rich who will not do so. The reckless or the thoughtless, who have been rude,
                            will pass before the moralist who needs no physician. I have seen the ignorant pass through
                            this door while the learned was barred, out. He whose name never stood on any church record
                            has been accepted, while the great professor had to stand back. It matters not whether a
                            candidate is a religionist, moralist or a rude man of the world, as Christ makes all things
                            new, they must obtain a new set of thoughts, words and actions. They can obtain them by
                            constant effort, watchfulness and prayer; no other price will purchase them. Since the
                            Christian religion was plasted on earth, no joint interest was ever carried out so perfectly
                            as it has been among the Shabers, upon religious equality. Our own experience teaches us
                            just hoWtall partiality was struck down in the pentecostal church. Our co�cnant relation was
                            formed in the very spirit of the compact. It gives to all the social comforts of life, in
                            health and sickness. The proceeds of all labor, income and consecration, goes into the hands
                            of one set of Trustees, "Who buy and sell as though they possessed not," to be appropriated
                            for the good of ajl. Dwelling rooms and work rooms are furnished alike, convenient for all
                            the inmates, and all trades impartially, from Elders to all grades of members. The same
                            church order and law meets us all, and must rule us all. The same seasons for labor, as each
                            has ability, goes to sustain the whole, without favoritism in any quarter. Now, when the
                            apostle says in the text, without partiality, if all this does not bring us within his exact
                            meaning, I see no way for Christians to get there, and it is easy to discover that all who
                            come up to this state of things must be in reality without "hypocrisy." Here, then, is the
                            conclusion of the whole matter. No oue can carry out the principles of Christianity, except
                            ne is strictly candid and free from all duplicity and hypocrisy. It has been a maxim with us
                            for years that if the gospel does not make a professor free from all .<pb n="224" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>guile and double dealing that it does but little for him. In the political world many
                            screen themselves from sight in the under-current of policy and the unreal, but such
                            hypocrisy will not do for a Christian. We have started on the Christian course we have
                            endeavored to describe, and have found it to be a pure way. Honestly have we continued it
                            through life thus far, and find it to be the path of peace, quietness and comfort, and
                            honestly will we. pursue it to the end of our course, that we may justly expect to find our
                            names written in the " Lamb's Book of Life. " "We must all come up to the moment when we
                            step from time into eternity. We, then, above all things else, desire to pass into the
                            unknown world with the certainty that it has been our highest ambition to successfully carry
                            out in practice ; '' Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
                            things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, and! whatsoever
                            things are of good report."�This will give the departing spirit of a child of God, when he
                            looks upon the last setting sun, full confidence to expect a " city which hath foundations,

                            perusal of your interesting letter ; interesting, because of your position in the important
                            moves of the day, and personal experience in relation to persons and things connected with
                            attempts to form a community having goods in common. You have had an opportunity to see the
                            workings of human nature under peculiar circumstances, and though painful in the detail and
                            in the aggregate, such experience will yet prove of much value. The non success of the
                            Hopedale Community in common with others that have arisen and gone down,' must have<pb n="225" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> its weight in establishing ground for suspicion, that man and woman
                            on the Adamic or procreative plane, occupy a position antagonistic to communities having
                            goods in common. Taking it for granted that they do, leads us to an analysis of human
                            society. Firstly, what are the primary atoms of human society? Secondly, what are the forces
                            of these atoms? Thirdly, what are the products or results of these forces. Proceeding in
                            this manner, we may arrive at some definite conclusion whether those on that plane are
                            capable of forming themselves into such communities or not; for specific forces, have
                            specific results. Man and woman are the primary atoms of society, and their most potent
                            inherent force, is an affinity for each other, which induces them to unite and " become one
                            flesh. " This force may be called the animal force ; for all animals in common with man and
                            woman are its subjects. The product of the union of these atoms, is the Adamic community or
                            family, composed of father, mother, and their children. When their clrldren, the off-shoots,
                            are matured, they fly off to fulfill their destiny as their parents have dene. Here we see a
                            force to form a community, and to disintegrate the same. And within every such community
                            there is a force, repelling any coalescence, with every other such community. Hence family
                            distinctiveness. And those families who are considered the most cultivated, exhibit the
                            lines of distinctiveness the most vividly. The history of the Courts of Probate, indorse the
                            fact of the existence and intensity of said forces, Having arrived at a knowledge of the
                            forces which create the Adamic community, and limit its extent, we become possessed of a
                            base of operations, to weigh and measure what they are able to do, and what they are not
                            able to effect. The forces of the physical world are to some extent controlled, applied, and
                            modified by man ; but he cannot change them essentially; whatever form they may assume under
                            his hand, they continue to bear a strict relation to their primary forces. So man and woman
                            on the Adamic plane, can be educated and developed under favorable conditions, till a very
                            great change (in the common acceptation of the term) has been effected. But on examination,
                            they remain essentially the same, and bear a true and strict relation to the forces of their
                            being, on the plane they occupy. And any attempt of the subjects of said plane, to raise
                            themselves out of and beyond the power of the forces thereof, by the aid of said forces,
                            must prove a nullity. Hence the formation of communities embracing a number of families
                            recognizing the forces alluded to, whether on philosophic or devotional premises, have all
                            died out, or merely linger along. And it is worthy of note, that the philosophic have
                            flashed and flared, and gone out in the greater darkness ; and so long as the primal forces
                            already indicated, remain intact, the same results will attend any attempt to work
                            antagonistically to them. Taking it for granted that we have disposed of the Adamic or
                            procreative plane, and deem its subjects incapable of forming communities in your and my
                            acceptance of the term; what is to<pb n="226" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>be done with them ? Under the action
                            of their own forces they are dissatisfied, uneasy, and in trouble, and often confused. And
                            all attempts heretofore to help them out of the sphere of their troubles, by the forces
                            which formed their sphere, has only made the confusion somewhat confounded. On looking over
                            the history of the past, occasionally we find a mind that has discovered a force, that
                            existed in the arrangement of created things, unknown till that mind revealed it. Newton
                            discovered the force that binds the universe, gives law to the velocities and limits the
                            spheres of the planets. Watt applied the force of steam ; Galvino, the galvanic force. And
                            so of others who have been focal points of physical knowledge. Having seen that there are
                            forces in the material world, once hid, but now revealed and applied to us; may there not be
                            some force in the human world uot yet discovered. In the material world the forces are
                            material. In the human world the forces are material, mental, and spiritual; these are the
                            magazines of human force. In the human world, the animal or material force predominates, the
                            mental is its servant, and what little there is of the spiritual incorporated, hardly
                            amounts to an acknowledgement of its existence. Hence the kingdoms of the human world, " are
                            the kingdoms of the Beast" because they operate physically, or after the manner of the
                            beast. Seeing that there is not a kingdom (recognized as such) an earthly, where the
                            spiritual force predominates, and has taken the mental and subdued the animal ; and brought
                            forth an order of society, with law, order, and government; and a civilization corresponding
                            thereto. Perhaps, we may find a single individual, who may have focalized in himself such a
                            kingdom. On looking over the past, we find one individual who states that his kingdom is not
                            of this world, and as a proof that it is not, he farther states, "that his subjects will not
                            fight" and "that the world receiveth him not." Here are encouraging indications. But what
                            are the forces by which this Nazarene purposes to create and vitalize his kingdom. He says
                            "those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven ; the same is my mother, sister and
                            brother. " Here is a new relationship. His Father is in heaven�in a heavenly sphere; and
                            those who do the will of his Father� whose every word and act, are in harmony with the
                            Father, are also of that sphere�the sphere of love. And he who is the least in that sphere,
                            is greater, than the greatest born of woman. Here we see that love to God is the vitalizing
                            element or force, and love to those brought forth by that force, creates a community or the
                            Christ family. And wherever such a commuuity exists, it may be called Christian socialism.
                            It will not be of the world, for its government will not stand in physical power, nor
                            operate after the manner ol the kingdom of the beast. The germ of the Adamic community, is
                            extremely limited in its unfoldings. The germ, love to God, in its unfolding, can embrace
                            all the people, of all worlds ; and the voice of that unfolding, is ever, "whomsoever will
                            let him come" and inherit all things, temporal, mental and spiritual. Under the influence of
                            this power�love to God ; there is no need to manufacture a community having goods in common
                            ; it springs up of itself, and<pb n="227" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> is the result of the internal forces of
                            the new relationship. Again the Nazarene says " Come learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of
                            heart, and you will find rest to your souls." But if you will learn of me, you must bear
                            your cross daily ; against what ? against your own life�your natural loves and desires. And
                            "he who seeks to save it, will lose it." "And he who loves father and mother more than me is
                            not worthy of me. " Or in other words, he who does not hate the affinities, the loves and
                            desires that bring forth the father and the mother, the wife, and the child ; cannot love
                            the affinities that bring forth the universal sister, and brotherhood of Christ. Again he
                            says, " ye cannot serve two masters ;" neither will it do, to patch up the old with a piece
                            of the new, "it maketh the rent worse." Here we see focalized in Christ,� First. A force to
                            create an universal sister and brotherhood. Second. A force to destroy the organizing forces
                            of the Adamic relationship. And wherever two or three are gathered together in the power of
                            these forces, there will be the law, and the government, and an ultimate civilization ;�that
                            eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered the heart of the Adamic man or
                            woman to conceive of it. Such is an outline of some of my views in relation to Communities.
                            I hope they will be acceptable to you. At all events accept them as a token of my esteem.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Fraser, Daniel" TEIform="persName"/>Daniel Fraser, To Adia Ballou, Hopedale, Mass.</byline></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="He is indeed a conqueror..."

                            and candor. You present very strong reasons why families of the procreative plane cannot
                            without great difficulty, if at all, establish communities of goods ; and why a people on
                            the plane of the Shaker families cau do so successfully. I will endeavor to present in
                            response the real difficulties which need to be removed from my mind in order to my
                            concurrence with you. First. I have believed that it was the destiny of man as a race to be
                            gradually inducted into a holy, harmonic, and happy order of society here on earth. Second.
                            I have believed that it was according to Divine order, natural and right for mankind as a
                            race, while here on earth, to procreate their species. Third. That whatever is strictly
                            natural for the time being cannot be a sin per se, .and should not be forbidden, but only
                            regulated into true order. With these fundamental ideas, I have sought to discover and
                            commence an order of human society, which would not only be holy, harmonic and happy in
                            select communities, but become ultimately universal for the entire race. I can see that
                            celibacy was best for Jesus, Paul, and many saints in the ages of the past to enable them to
                            fulfill their respective missions for the regeneration of the race. Also, that the like
                            exceptionally will continue for ages to come. I can see that with such characters, under
                            such circumstances, celibacy is not only a privilege, but an imperative duty. I can also see
                            that this may be true in respect to select communities of celibates.<pb n="228" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>And I can farther clearly see that in such cases, such celibates can establish communities
                            with far less difficulty than can married families of the same essential moral goodness. I
                            do not need to be convinced of these truths. Now will you tell me whether your order and
                            system of society is designed or expected to become universal for the race here on earth ;
                            or if it is only select and exceptional in its nature? If select and exceptional to the
                            course and destiny of the race, I assent at once to the fitness of its platform and means to
                            its end. But if designed and expected to become universal then your present societies are
                            first fruits, specimens and models for the entire race, and if so, then your success must
                            result in the extinction of the race here in flesh and blood on the earth. And farther, if
                            so, it must be a sin per se for even the best of human beings to procreate offspring. In
                            that view, how can you vindicate God for having created mankind.here on earth with all the
                            capabilities, instincts, and inherent longings which result in offspring? Or how can you
                            demonstrate that loves and faculties strictly natural cannot be exercised without sin per
                            se? These are the precise points on which if in error, I need to be enlightened and
                            corrected. I state them as explicitly and directly as I can, that you may instruct me. I am
                            sure I desire very strongly to embrace " the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
                            truth." Bear with me esteemed friend, and write again soon.

                            Perfect in all its bearings towards that plane to which it was specially confined. St. Paul
                            referring to the mission of Moses, speaks of his faithfulness as that of a servant in his

                            a schoolmaster which should bring us to Christ. Jesus, speaking of his own mission, said,
                            �'! came not to destroy the law but to fulfill;" and add thereunto, his life declared. While
                            the Mosaic law enjoined strict justice, the law of Christ presented the new commandment,
                            "That ye love one another ; " and more than this, " Love your enemies ; bless them that
                            curse you and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you
                            aud persecute you.'" The law of Moses gave no intimation of soul life,; while all of the
                            teachings of Jesus Christ, pointed more or less directly to the life beyond ; as he himself
                            declared, " My kingdom is not of this world. " How plainly marked the duty of all who would
                            become his followers, in the injunction, " Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his

L, Eads. ]I sat down in an arm chair, wearied with my work.
                                    My toil had been severe and protracted. Many were seeking the salvation of their
                                    souls, and many had found what they sought. The church wore an aspect of thrift: and
                                    prosperity, and joy, and hope, and courage, were the prevailing sentiments on every
                                    hand. As for myself, I was joyous in my work ; my brethren were united; my sermons
                                    and exhortations were evidently telling on my hearers; my church was crowded with
                                    listeners. The whole community was more or less moved with the prevailing
                                    excitement, and as the work went on I had been led into exhausting labors for its
                                    promotion. Fired with my work, I soon lost myself in a sort of half forgetful state,
                                    though I seemed fully aware of my place and my surroundings. Suddenly a stranger
                                    entered the room without any preliminary "tap" or " come in." I saw in his face
                                    benignity and weight of character. But though he was passably well attired, he
                                    carried about his person measures, chemical agents, and implements, which gave him a
                                    very strange appearance. The stranger came toward me and extending his hand, said, "
                                    How is your zeal? " I supposed when he began the question, the query was to be for
                                    my health, but was pleased to hear his final word ; for I was quite well pleased
                                    with my zeal�-and doubted not the stranger would smile when he should know its
                                    proportions. Instantly I conceived of it as a physical quantity ; and putting my
                                    hand into my bosom brought it forth and presented it to him for inspection. He took
                                    it, and placing it in his scales, weighed it carefully. I heard him say, " One
                                    hundred pounds. " I could scarcely suppress an audible note of satisfaction. But I
                                    caught his earnest look as he noted down the weight, and I saw at once that he had
                                    drawn no final conclusion; but was intent upon pushing his investigations. He broke

                                    of layers, or strata, which at the touch of the hammer fell apart, and were
                                    severally tested and weighed; the stranger making minute notes as the process went
                                    on. When he had finished, lie presented the note to me, and gave me a look mingled
                                    with sorrow and compassion, as without a word except " May God save you, " he left
                                    the room. I opened the note and read as follows : Analysis of the zeal of Junius, a

                                    the peculiar manner of the stranger, and especially at his parting look and words;
                                    but when I looked at the figures, my heart sank as lead within me. I made a mental
                                    effort to dispute the correctness of the record, but I was suddenly startled into a
                                    more honest mood, by an audible sigh�almost a groan from the stranger, (who had
                                    paused in the hall,) and by a sudden darkness falling upon me by which the record
                                    became at onco obscured and nearly illegible. I suddenly cried out, "Lord save me, "
                                    and knelt down at my chair, with the paper in my hands and my eyes fixed upon it. At
                                    once it became a mirror, and I saw my heart reflected in?it. The record was true : I
                                    saw it, I felt it, I confessed it, I deplored it, and I besought God to save me from
                                    myself with many tears ; and at length with a loud an irrepressible cry of anguish I
                                    awoke. I had prayed in years gone by to be saved from hell, but my cry now to be
                                    saved from myself was immeasurably more fervent and distressful. Nor did I rest or
                                    pause till the refining fire came down and went through my heart, searching,
                                    probing, melting, burning, filling all the chambers with light and hallowing up my
                                    whole heart to God. That light and that love are in my heart to-day; and when the
                                    trials and tears of my pilgrimage shall he at an end, I expect to kneel in heaven at
                                    the feet of the divine Alchemist and bless him for the revelation of that day that
                                    showed me where I stood and turned my feet into a better path. That day was the
                                    crisis of my history ; and if there shall prove to have been in later years some
                                    depth and earnestness in my convictions,, and some searching and saving pungency in
                                    my words, I doubt not eternity will show their connection with the visit of this
                                    searcher of hearts, at whose coining I was weighed in the balance and found wanting.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected"</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Acrostic" TEIform="index"/> ACROSTIC.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anderson, Martha J."

If true, all should
                            adopt it. In that case the world would be depopulated in a given time. Answer�Shakers are
                            especially called of God to their manner of life. Faith to live it is the gift of God. Jesus
                            said: "No man cometh to me except the Father draw him," prepare him. Consequently, the will
                            of God is the motive power. If so, is there any danger of the race becoming extinct, unless
                            it be the will of God that the earth become depopulated, for a season, in the future as it
                            has been in the past? Geologically, the earth was once without form and void, in a gaseous
                            state, as are other globes to-day. And in the theological future, this earth will be burned
                            up. The last trump will sound and the Lord Christ will descend from Heaven, with a shout
                            that will awaken all the countless billions who have lived and died upon this earth. There
                            will be a general resurrection. The saints will be caught up into the air,�the spirit
                            world,�and so will they ever be with the Lord. The human race will be extinct.
                            Astronomically, as the earth was thrown from the Sun in a gaseous condition by centripetal
                            force, so is it cooling, condensing and being drawn back to the fountain by centripetal
                            force or gravitation, to be again melted by its fervent heat and to have its elements used
                            up in the formation of other worlds, to run through the same cycles of existence that we
                            have been and are passing through. Thus it may be seen that the common and apparently
                            formidable objection to Shakerism that it will " run the race out " has neither a scientific
                            nor ecclesiastical basis to rest upon in the encyclopedia or the Bible.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F. W." TEIform="persName"/>F. W. Evans. Mt.

                                is generally accepted ; but from our present standpoint, it would seem that it had been
                                our misfortune to live upon the earth in the prophetic "last days." There have been
                                Edenic days when men could hear the voice of God, and days when He would direct all
                                their duties both official and domestic. Days when lie could send his word to man
                                through the mouth of a prophet, and days, even, when the Son of God came among men and
                                wrought the most wonderful work that was ever placed on record. But alas, the brightness
                                of those days have all passed away, and only the story of them is left, over which we
                                may find a ray of faint and sweet consolation. If we are to believe the voice of
                                Christendom, God no longer walks and talks with men.�He no longer has the need of a
                                class of prophets as it is unnecessary to make known any farther his mind and will to
                                the race of man. In the "last days" perilous times will come. The perilous times have
                                already reached us and we are told that wickedness walks abroad at noonday, and
                                infidelity is largely among the people. Men are choosing darkness rather than light,
                                because their deeds are evil. They are willing to crucify the son of God afresh and put
                                him to open shame. The Bible is set aside to become a common book, the Sabbath is
                                desecrated, and the rel'gious observances passed by very carelessly. " Men shall be
                                lovers of themselves, covetous, proud, and blasphemers." And even these times have
                                really crossed the threshold and entered our dwellings, and have made captives in our
                                cities and villages. To a great many persons this seems to be the present state of the
                                world, and with but little chance for improvement. If any thing is done for the
                                salvation of the world, be it much or little, a spirit power independent of mau must do
                                it. But our calling has been as laborers in the vineyard of God, to work faithfully and
                                diligently in seeking and saving that which was lost. Our duty is first to cleanse our
                                hands and purify our hearts from all unrighteousness and then, look up ! The angels of
                                God are above us, and ready to minister to us the heavenly gifts. "Preach the word," and
                                believe what we preach. Ask and we shall receive, but be sure and ask aright, lest our
                                prayers be consumed on our own selfishness. Have we not read the story of patient Job,
                                and shall we have less confidence in the spirit of God than an Arab priest who lived
                                some three thouTERMS.<pb n="233" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> sand years ago ? Through all his
                                afflictions, through all his trials, through all his losses he maintained an unflinching
                                consistent reliance in the belief that an over-ruling Providence could help and sustain
                                him, and in this he was not disappointed. If we can believe that a spirit ministration,
                                has in an early or in a more recent age been of any benefit to mankind in aiding them to
                                bear the cross, or to win souls from the paths of unrighteousness, shall we whine in our
                                unbelief or indifference and make the work of God of less value in this enlightened age?
                                Men are no less anxious for a moral education, no less interested in the blessings of a
                                spiritual and divine ministration than they have been at a former date. No less willing
                                to make sacrifices for the good of humanity by taking upon themselves the work of the
                                good Samaritan. If any thing has arisen in the pathway that leads to God, to prevent a
                                success in righteousness and peace, that will equal or transcend that which has been in
                                the past, it must be in the workmen who may be consulting their own pleasure and
                                self-interest, rather than the more vital interest of harvesting souls from the world. A
                                neglected vineyard may become overrun with noxious weeds, and a neglected residence soon
                                gives unmistakable evidence of dilapidation. If they are to be maintained as worthy of a
                                close and extended inspection, they will require the aid of much hard work from willing
                                and honest hearts, and if a higher aid is invoked as being more conducive to success, it
                                will be remembered that, "God helps those who help themselves. " "Would it not be well
                                for us to sing with the friends who have gone on before us.� "Thou church of God, awake,
                                awake, For light beams from on high; From earth and dust thy garments shake, Thy glory's
                                drawing nigh. " It may require a powerful awakening and a powerful shaking to banish

                                the heading of an article in the Mirror Supplement. The letter from this little Mann is
                                remarkable more for its multiplicity of words without the establishing of any fact, than
                                for anything else. There are a great many writers who are so selfishly bigoted that they
                                assume the liberty to denounce all who may differ from their narrow conception of
                                righteousness. That he is gifted in calling people bad names, is not in the least
                                strange. Some entertain the idea that coarse language is stronger than correct English
                                and use it from choice. " A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth
                                forth that which is good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth
                                forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. " The
                                little Mann seems to be quite a judge, and while he is "all right" and can teach others,
                                he pronounces their writings, "the work of Satan, and without common sense. " Of course
                                he knows that if it does not agree with his sense it is not common sense. Yea, that is a
                                nice discrimination and remarkable judgment for a little Mann.

W. Evans.] Mr. James M. Durkee of Pittsfield Mass., and the late
                            Isaac Auger of Shaker Village, Hancock, Mass., had a very interesting conversation on the
                            subject of the Spirit Life, of which Mr. Durkee tells in the following letter to Elder
                            Evans. Pittsfieli), Mass., May 14, 1886. Elder F. W. Evans, op, Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N.
                            Y.�My Dear Si�:�Several weeks ago I promised to give you some points of a most remarkable
                            conversation which I held with the late Isaac Auger of Hancock, Shaker Village, West
                            Pittsfield, Mass. I had known and done work (job printing) for Mr. Auger, for the last
                            twenty-four years, and I never knew him to spend twenty minutes in conversation upon any
                            subject before. He seemed unlike himself upon this occasion He entered my office about 9.30,
                            A. M. and remained some two hours. The subject of Spirit Life had been strongly impressed
                            upon my mind by the Sunday school exercises,, in which I had been engaged the previous
                            Sabbath day. After being seated, I remarked, " Mr. Auger, what is your opinion regarding
                            Spirit Life, also, that of the Shakers generally? " He answered, "Spirit Life is, as I
                            understand it, the invisible existence. The visible life is a figure of the invisible, for
                            'The invisible things of Him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
                            understood by the things that are made, even his invisible power and Godhead revealing a
                            dual deity� a Heavenly Father and a Heavenly Mother.'" "Spirit Life is all about us, it is
                            everywhere, as is God, in whom we live and move and have our being. Those who were once in
                            visible conditions, as we now are, are with us, influencing us to a greater or less degree.
                            And, through proper mediums, they can communicate. Not so much at present, as when God's
                            plans are more completely fulfilled. The world's people, and even Church people, fail in a
                            great degree to comprehend the spirit teaching of Jesus. He said, ' My words they are Spirit
                            and they are life. ' And Paul said, " The things that are seen are temporal, but the things
                            that are not seen are eternal. Day by day, year by year, the Spirit Life or condition is to
                            be more and more manifest. As the morning sun dispels the shadows of night, so the glory of
                            God�of the Spirit Life-1�is to remove the darkness of earth life. God is Spirit, and all
                            things must be made like himself, spiritual, or there could be no eternal existence. "
                            Again, I asked, Mr. Auger, What will become of those who reject Christ while in the earth
                            condition?" He answered, "They will be burned up, as we are taught by Malachi, ' For behold
                            the day coraeth that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly
                            shall be as stubble and that day that cometh shall burn them up, saiththe Lord of Hosts.'
                            The greater part of the Bible is in figurative, parabolical and symbolical language, and the
                            above quotation is figurative of the eternal power of God that operates to the destruction
                            of evil. It will be burned up and sin will cease from the universal dominion of God. ' And
                            the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth, as the waters cover the bottom of the sea.'
                            Ezekiel: 'Son of man the House of Israel is to me become dross ; all they are brass and tin
                            andiron and lead in the midst of the furnace.' As I would say, they go into a furnace of
                            fire, receiving the full recompense of all sin, until they acknowledge their sins and become
                            loving and obedient to God. Understand me now as using the word hell in the same manner that
                            Malachi uses the word furnace. A suffering process will continue until purification is
                            effected. A melting, fiery operation until the dross of evil lusts of flesh and mind are
                            purged away, for he will thoroughly purge his floor, separating chaff and wheat, the good
                            and evil. ' This will I believe, be the ordeal through which every spirit will pass. God is
                            love. And all things in Heaven and earth, in this visible world and in the invisible world,
                            must be purified and sanctified by the love of God our Heavenly Father and Mother. " Elder
                            Evans, there are many other points he touched upon, and altogether it was one of the most
                            wonderful sermons to which I ever listened. When he came into my office that morning for a
                            small job of printing, lit-<pb n="235" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> tie did I expect from him such a singular
                            and unique discourse as he delivered, and which I can but partially recall and imperfectly
                            record, and that it would be the last time I should ever see and hold converse with hini in
                            this life, for he soon afterwards passed into the Spirit Life which he had been so fluently
                            and feelingly discussing, and which left such an indelible impression upon my mind and
                            feelings. I give to you these thoughts because I have ever since been impressed so to do,
                            for the benefit of his many friends in West Pittsfield, Mount Lebanon and in Pittsfield
                            proper, where he was for so many years well and favorably known. Elder Evans, I have now
                            fulfilled my promise to you, in recording as nearly as I possibly can in his own language,
                            my last interview with Mr. Isaac Auger. As I said from the first,.it was printed upon my
                            mind as with indelible ink never to be erased. Very Respectfully, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Durkee, James M." TEIform="persName"/>James M.

'Twas the home of my childhood My own country home, I love it the better Wherever
                            I roam. Our Summer ending so happily always gave us a fresh start in our regular home duties
                            wherein we were soon engaged. After the berries were gone came the gathering of apples and
                            other fruits, and I particularly enjoyed these exhilarating occupations. The air had now
                            began to have a touch of frost in it, the wind blew more keenly and seemed to call for more
                            activity and exertion on our part. The orchards being at some distance from the dwellings we
                            usually went to these in wagons returning home in the evening just weary enough to sleep
                            without dreaming. I never shall forget the delicious fragrance of those apples or their
                            peculiar flavor; there are none like them now a days. It was my delight to get perched upon
                            the highest ladder I could find and thus peep through the branches of the tall trees feeling
                            "Monarch of all I surveyed." How carefully I plucked the best specimens and put them into
                            the basket for Winter use meanwhile tossing the worthless ones down and if perchance these
                            were stopped in their fall by some unwary head, who for the moment like Sir Isaac Newton,
                            was wont to enquire why an apple falls, found a ready answer when thus reminded of my lofty
                            perch, as it was not done to inflict pain upon my humbler sister, so with a laugh on both
                            sides it was made right without further philosophizing. Were there ever such lunches as we
                            partook of seated on the sunny side of some convenient wall where with appetites sharpened
                            by the robust exercise and the sweeping winds what did we care for other tonics. In the
                            lengthening evenings we would meet to cut the apples for sauce or for drying, and such was
                            the glowing warmth and genial cheer enjoyed that we shall not soon realize its like again.
                            One of the sisters would sometimes read to us from some entertaining hook, to which we
                            children always listened with the utmost pleasure. The cider made from the poorer apples in
                            those days was boiled down for future use. I remember once of being permitted to sit up late
                            to assist in boiling the cider and never shall I forget the huge open fire we had on the
                            hearth or how it made fantastic shadows of my companions in duty as they attended the
                            boiling caldrons for to my sleepy eyes, they assumed proportions at once gigantic and
                            uncanny. Sometimes we would go for grapes both wild and domestic which grew near in
                            abundance and return home laden with the- spoils. One year we children picked up the
                            potatoes after they were dry and left on the ground; all this did not seem like a task but
                            was one of continuous change of healthful employment never to be forgotten as long as memory
                            lasts. Then as the frost began to harden the ground we would prepare to make all snug for
                            Winter which we knew would come soon and last long but it was without sorrows to us � for we
                            were sure of warmth and food nor did we take much heed for the morrow, and then as the last
                            of our out-of-door occupations we would meet to husk the garnered corn, for the clean dry
                            husks make an excellent bed<pb n="236" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/>beyond competition, while the disrobed corn
                            gave promise of unlimited supplies of corn bread and Johnnie cake not to mention the
                            succulent hasty pudding dear to every New Englander. Now it began to be cold nights and
                            mornings,�and we did not linger over cur outgoings for we could not but feel with a pang of
                            regret that the leaves were withering; at the North wind's breath, and we must prepare for
                            Winter, well knowing that our intercourse with laughing brooks and singing birds would soon
                            be only a thing of remembrance. The grand old mountains which surround the Village seemed to
                            come nearer as though to encircle us in a closer embrace, and then followed the days when we
                            heard the howling winds at night making ready for the coming of the ice king in good
                            earnest, and all too soon would "Rough Winter rudely rend the robes of Autumn," and we would
                            gladly ask.� Yet one more smile departing distant sun, One mellow smile through the soft
                            vapory air E'er o'er the frozen earth the loud winds run, Or snows are sifted o'er the
                            meadows bare One smile on the brown hills and naked trees And the dark rocks where summer
                            wreaths are cast And the blue gentian flower that in the breeze Nod lonely of her beauteous
                            race the last.�Bryant.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Carll, Anna P." TEIform="persName"/> Anna P. Carll. Providence, R.

                            Never lose your temper. I do not say, never be angry. Anger is sometimes indispensable,
                            especially where there has been anything mean, dishonest, or cruel. But anger is very
                            different from loss of temper. Never sneer at them; and be careful even how you rally them.
                            Never try to work on their feelings. Feelings are far too delicate things to be used for
                            tools. It is like taking the mainspring out of your watch, and notching it for a saw. It may
                            be a wonderful saw, but how fares your watch? Especially avoid doing so in connection with
                            religion, for so you will assuredly deaden them to all that is finest. Let your feelings,
                            not your efforts on theirs, affect them with a sympathy the more powerful that it is not
                            forced upon them; and in order to do this, avoid hiding your feelings too much. A man's
                            family has a right to share in his good feelings. Never show that you doubt, except that you
                            are able to convict. To doubt an honest child is to do what you can to make a liar of him.
                            Never be too hard on mere quarreling, which, like a storm in nature, often helps to clear
                            the moral atmosphere. Stop it by a judgment between the parties. But be severe as to the
                            hind of quarreling, and the temper shown in it. Especially give no quarter to any unfairness
                            arising from greed or spite. Use your strongest language with regard to that.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Donald, Mac" TEIform="persName"/>Mac Donald.</byline></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Correspondence" TEIform="index"/> KIND WORDS.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I enclose subscription..."

                                little village of Jezreel, a very pleasantly situated place fifty-two miles north of the
                                city of Jerusalem. There lived in Jezreel a certain poor but honest man named Naboth,
                                who gained a livelihood, mainly from the products of a fruitful vineyard which he had
                                received from his father. A short distance north of the vineyard was the palace of Ahab,
                                King of Samaria. Many times had the king looked from his window on the beautiful
                                vineyard and mentally coveted his neighbor's land, as he said it would be very
                                convenient for a garden of herbs, being so near to the house. The king asked Naboth to
                                sell him the land, agreeing to give him a better vineyard, instead, or, if he preferred,
                                would pay the worth in money. But Naboth said to the king, '' The Lord forbid that I
                                give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee." Ahab returned home much displeased, and
                                it is said "would eat no bread. " I learn that this childish practice is still common in
                                some parts of the East, and a person who has been greatly disappointed will go without
                                food for several days. By this time, Ahab had gained the sympathy of his friends, who
                                were anxious that his desires should be satisfied. Jezebel said to him, "I will give
                                thee the vineyard of Naboth. " So wicked Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed
                                them with the king's seal, to the elders and nobles, saying, "Proclaim a fast, and set
                                Naboth on high among the people and bear witness against him saying, ' Thou didst
                                blasiiheme God and the king,' and carry him out and stone him till he die. " The elders
                                and nobles did as they were commanded and after Naboth's death they wrote to Jezebel
                                saying, "Naboth is dead. " This report soon reached King Ahab and he gladly took
                                possession of the vineyard so mnlawfully gained. But the wicked seldom prosper in their
                                evil ways, and so it proved with the king. The Lord sent Elijah to Ahab while he was
                                viewing the land, and the prophet said to him, "In the place where Naboth was stoned
                                shalt thou also die." When the king felt that the hand of the Lord was upon him, he
                                repented, sitting in sackcloth, and gladly would he have returned the vineyard to its
                                rightful owner. Then the Lord said to Elijah, " Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself
                                before me; because he humbleth himself I will not bring this evil in his day, but in his
                                son's days will I bring the evil upon his house. " Not long after this, a war commenced
                                between the Syrians and the Israelites, and during the battle, one of the soldiers drew
                                a bow and shot King Ahab, so that in the evening of that day he died. The king was taken
                                back to Samaria and buried among his own people.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilson, M. A." TEIform="persName"/>M. A.

                                advice in times of sickness. In short, although at the point of death, these unfortunate
                                Peculiar People simply anoint the sufferers, tenaciously believing that if it is God's

                                depart to enjoy His eternal presence. Hence, repeatedly, a practical world has indicted
                                many members on account of manslaughter. The Shakers, who have several deeply
                                interesting communities in America, are far too sensible a people to pursue any such
                                eccentric tenet as this. Indeed, they have a medicine manufactory, they are highly
                                conversant with the very best herbal remedies, and in the cute people of the State find
                                a ready market for their medicinal manufactures. In many ways the American Shakers are a
                                most intellectual and instructive community, solving many enigmas which to many of our

                            left, which he sees and strives to follow, knowing that others have been there before and he
                            is not the only person who has traveled that road. Perhaps he is forsaken and solitary in a
                            barren desert and has lost his way. The scorching sun beats down upon his head, and in vain
                            he looks for some shady tree where he may be rescued from its rays. The hot sands burn his
                            feet. He finds no fountain of pure sparkling water where he can quench his thirst. After all
                            these afflictions no wonder that he is about to despair. Poor traveler � there seems to be
                            nothing but death before him, when suddenly what does he see? Footprints! indicating that
                            some one has been there before. He is led by those visible signs and is soon conducted to an
                            oasis, where he finds shady trees, and a cooling spring of water. Certainly he must know
                            that those blessings were sent from God. After obtaining rest and nourishment he is able to
                            pursue his journey, strengthened to meet dangers and difficulties ; in thankfulness that he
                            found those footprints which guided him where his languishing spirit was revived. Just so
                            with our spiritual journey. Ofttimes we would feel discouraged were it not for the
                            footprints of noble souls which we find all along our way, infusing new hope and strength
                            into our spirits, to fight bravely the battle of life. Those footprints were left as a guide
                            to keep our feet from wandering from the right path. When we are about to faint and become
                            weary with the conflict, those footprints, if carefully followed will surely lead to the
                            fountain that giveth to the thirsty, cooling drinks. Like unto those footpriuts that caused
                            the traveler in the desert to rejoice, we, with renewed vigor, keep on our course in those
                            spiritual footprints until we arrive at a never failing spring. Jesus, the Christ, left an
                            example for the children of men. All who live that perfect life of purity which he lived,
                            will never be left in the trackless desert to perish, nor alone upon the mountain of
                            temptation, nor in the "Valley of the shadow of Death." He has promised to be with those who
                            walk in his footsteps, and the promise remains sure. If we trust in Him He will sustain us.
                            So we will take heart knowing that his footprints are still "On the sands of time. " We,
                            also, must leave ours. Let us be careful that they lead in the right direction.�

                                Company. 16mo, cloth. Price 00 cents. This attractive little handbook begins at the
                                boginning, and tells the young student of the microscope exactly how to proceed in his
                                investigations, what to do, and how to do it, and the reasons therefore. There is no
                                study so fascinating, or so instructive withal, as that of natural history with the aid
                                of the microscope. It opens a new world to the pupil, and reveals to him wonders and
                                beauties which are unseen and unknown to the natural eye. Mary Treat has long been known
                                as an interesting writer on natural history, and the valuable series published two or
                                three years ago in Harper''s Monthly were from her hand, Naturally she has had great
                                experience with the microscope, and so, too, has Mr. Wells, who gives suggestions as to
                                outfits, preparation objects, and methods of experiment. Mr. Sargent tells how home-made
                                microscopes may be prepared and used. The book is well illustrated. Among the issues in
                                the educational line of the Interstate Publishing Company is a volume prepared by
                                Professor H. W. Tyler, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called
                                Entertainment in Chemistry, designed for young students. Professor Tyler has aimed to
                                make clear to the minds of pupils exactly what chemistry is, and the best methods of
                                studying it. In the performance of this task he has described a series of experiments
                                which can be performed without the aid of costly apparatus, at home or in the
                                schoolroom, but which demonstrate the main principles of the science just as accurately
                                as those involving greater skill and knowledge. The book is written in a clear and lucid
                                style, without the use Of more technical terms then are absolutely required. 16mo.
                                cloth. Price 60 cents. </p></div3></div2><div2 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Ten commandments for bathers" TEIform="index"/>Ten commandments for bathers
