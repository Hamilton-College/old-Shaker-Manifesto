TEIform="persName"/>OLIVER C. HAMPTON. </byline><p TEIform="p"> He that confesseth and forsaketh his sins shall find mercy, but he that covereth them shall
                            not prosper. "�Solomon. �'' If we are faithful to confess our sins, He is faithful to
                            forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John, �., 9. Hardly
                            anything seems to create greater uneasiness and dismay in man, than the idea of confessing
                            his sins in the hearing of his fellow man. But perhaps no one ever honestly tried the
                            experiment, without finding a wonderful releasement from the burden of his sins, and a
                            feeling of at-one-ment with God, to which before, he was an entire stranger. When this
                            burden of sin is rolled oft' and his mind is tranquil, he is in an excellent condition to
                            begin life anew and to commence the work Of repentance, by leaving off, and traveling away
                            from sin, and wrong of every kind. At this important crisis in his life, he can form many
                            serious and good resolutions to correct all sinful habits, into which he has ignorantly or
                            willfully fallen, and lay out more virtuous paths for his feet to walk, in which to find
                            greater peace and consolation, and live in reconciliation with both God and man. Let me
                            assure any one who has never tried it, that whether he fully understands the fact or not, he
                            will find himself forgiven and fully absolved from all guilt and selfcondemnation, after
                            sincerely confessing all his sins to some one appointed to hear him, and a calm sheltering
                            feeling of security and acceptance with God, which will be more abiding and yield him more
                            inward comfort than any previous, religious exercise of his life. Many have tried it and all
                            have testi-<pb n="50" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> Red to this, who have been truly honest and sincere. The
                            deep stains of memory are erased from the tablet of conscience and the spirit left in a
                            free, released condition, to enjoy the beatitudes of a. holy life and the blessedness of
                            well doing. This confession of all known sin, has always been considered the stepping stone
                            into the Temple of Holiness and eternal progress, to higher and high,er blessedness and
                            perfection here and hereafter. Believers have always judged of the prosperity of souls
                            setting out in the gospel by this criterion of confession. If done in uprightness and
                            sincerity the 'safe travel and peaceful journey of the , penitent, is pretty safely
                            calculated upon ; if otherwise, there is almost if not quite a certainty of failure. The
                            only hope remaining, consists in the contingency that the. superficial novitiate may come
                            ."up to a. time, in the progress of 3iis or ."Iior experience, when after-convictions may
                            lead to the necessary confession� and the soul may at last find a true joining to the
                            Church, and an abiding home 'in the fold of Christ. All ecclesiastic nistory, upto the days
                            of the Protestant � Reformation, abounds in facts going to show, that auricular confession
                            was among the sacred obligations of all, or at least a. large majority of past popular
                            systems of Religion ;�as witness the � Brahmins, Budhists, Hierophants of �Egypt�-the
                            Essenes-, Jews and Catholics. �Even: the Ptiseyites, though a Protestant sect,' have adopted
                            the practice and ac; knowledged to having found great peace 'and comfort as well as
                            spiritual edification and benefit' therefrom. .Therefore, dear friends, Brethren anc Sisters
                            in and out of Zion, let us all be ;encouraged from the testimony and ex)erience of these
                            bright clouds of witnesses, and still more from the direct inspirations and revelations from
                            Heaven :hrough the medium of our Holy Savior and our blessed Mother Ann, to solemny and
                            sincerely confess all our sins in the sacred Order of God, thereby securing the spiritual
                            boon and blessing of our Heavenly Father and Mother ;� planting our souls on the Rock of
                            Eternal Ages against which iC the gates of Hell can never prevail. " It is so sweet to lie
                            down at night, and know ourselves to be in a state of perfect peace with God and all men,
                            that if we are called away before the morning dawn, we are pei'fectly ready to depart and be
                            at rest with the angels and kt spirits of just men and women made perfect through sufferings
                            ; " the very same ordeal we ourselves have passed through that all our sins have gone before
                            hand into the judgment, and have been sent into the land uninhabited, no more to be
                            remembered against us forever. Let us try this, first of all experiments, in the upward
                            journey into higher and holier conditions, viz ; confessing and forsaking all known sin, and
                            see if we cannot exclaim with the rapt seraph whom John the Divine saw and heard on Patmos,
                            " Now has come salvation and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ, for the
                            accuser of the Brethren, He who ceased not to accuse them day and night is cast down." What
                            is it that " accuseth day and night. " unless it is a conscience wearied and loaded with sin
                            and from which there is no rest or peace. In this good gift of confessing and forsaking sin,
                            is a certain and sure asylum from all these painful scenes of self condemnation and despair,
                            and let all who will, come and be released and forever blest.

                            combined, can give internal religious light. It was St. Ghrysostom who said we should study
                            philosophy in order to be able to contemn it, but I do not agree with him, as all truth
                            should be received and revered wherever found. The study of philosophy, logic, etc., enables
                            us to meet those who stand on that ground, but a lifetime is insufficient for any one to
                            master the occult sciences, though his years should outnumber those of Methuselah. The
                            simple one, the physical, so easily handled, still has doubts hanging over it after the
                            labors of physiologists for thousands of years�so dark and obscure it still is, that none of
                            them have been able to tell us with anything like a certainty what is the office or function
                            cf the milt, or spleen, in the human body, and if so simple a thing as this is beyond our
                            reach would not the man be a maniac who would undertake to master thiem all in 100 years?
                            The same may be said of nearly all the divisions and subdivisions presented to us. Better it
                            would be never to have learned our a,b, abs, than to endanger the intellect in such a
                            strife. Yet I would not be understood to undervalue a literary education. All that is said
                            on this subject may be well enough for the denizens of the underworld, as well as the
                            religion based upon the sciences, as it is all theologica-moral, or a simple belief, without
                            the corresponding works demanded by Christ, who said : "If any will come after me, let him
                            deny himself and seek first the kingdom ;" not seek first a collegiate education, but seek
                            first the kingdom, and all necessary things (education included) will be given you. It is
                            unphilosophical to say that the sciences are illustrative of the objective and subjective
                            worlds ; in fact it is a contradiction, because the objective and subjective are not
                            tactual�one is spiritual, the other material; and just as erroneous is it to use the words
                            spiritual and intuitional as synonyms�spiritual pertains to the soul, touching not matter ;
                            intuitional is human instinct; differing from the animal in that it may reach the intangible
                            as well as the tangible, while the animal reaches the tangible only. The intellect being a
                            faculty, and not a system, is for objective and not subjective purposes ; it takes
                            cognizance of morality, but not of spirituality or religion only in an external sense, not
                            in essentia. Morality is not religion. The external law may compel a man to be moral, but it
                            cannot compel him to be religious. Environment and neighborly conditions may induce one to
                            live morally who does not believe in a future life, but such one must be pronounced a moral
                            man in the absence of every religious feeling.<pb n="52" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>Every word in a discourse
                            should have a distinct signification and application to prevent misunderstanding. Then what
                            are spirit and intellect ? To speak philosophically and truly, the spirit is an entity, the
                            ego, the inner and real person, the subjective me, in which the intellect is not seated. The
                            intellect is not an entity, but a faculty seated in the brain of the objective " me, " which
                            is only a little bark for the spirit to guide on the ocean of life. The intellect perceives
                            by brain power, while the spirit perceives by the unfolding power of God in the soul. The
                            province of the intellect is to judge, to know, to invent� look into and see to the fitting
                            and fitness of material things. The province of the spirit is to scan the motive of the
                            fitting, but not to judge of the material fitness. Thus we see their functions are as
                            different and distinct as things can be, and the one cannot be made to do the work of the
                            other. And every one who does not go behind nor beyond the intellect is to all intents and
                            purposes a materialist and knows nothing about pure, spiritual religion ; for practical
                            religion is obedience to the inward monitor. When this speaks, saying : Think or think not
                            on this or that, speak or speak not, do or do not, then pause, give heed�listen not to
                            passion, but obey, for it is the voice of the infinite God in the soul who cometh quickly,
                            whose reward is with Him to give to every man according as his works shall be. (Rev. xxii.,
                            12.) But I am still asked ; If the intellect does not aid the spirit, why do you preach ? Or
                            why are books written ? The intellect must perceive the truth or falsehood of what is spoken
                            or written. Answer�All that ever may or ever can be spoken or written to be effective must
                            meet in harmonious rapport with the inner spiritual unfolding, or it will pass asso much
                            idle wind. H�\v many millions hear and see incontrovertible truths who honestly see no
                            necessity of their application to themselves. So the light without and the light within must
                            harmonize or all preaching is vain. Thus I think the functions of the two are madeplain. If
                            we look within, the spirit speaks ; if we look without, the intellect responds ; and it is
                            :n this way the world strove to get religion and failed, until the illiterate Jesus, from
                            teachings within, " brought life and immortality to light" and introduced to the scientific
                            world and world at large the only true, pure and abiding religion the world ever saw or ever
                            will see : and it is worthy of remark that he selected no followers from the scientific
                            circles, nor courted nor recommended science in any shape, for the simple reason that the
                            sciences do not contain one iota of spiritual and pure religion. The same has now been
                            re-introduced to the world by an illiterate woman, Ann Lee, and I doubt not but all Zion
                            would be far better off to-day having in possession their spirit with the absence of all
                            literary education than, to be master of all the sciences, with their spirits and example
                            ignored.

                            be prepared for age, are gone, I see; Xow age with much infirmity appears,� A few turns more
                            will finish out my years. My eyesight, memory and hearing fails, And weakness o'er my

                            have been privileged to become personalty acquainted. Others we have learned to love by
                            their kindly jottings in our paper. We are reminded of one contribution entitled "Soul
                            Travel" in February No. 1882, that deeply impressed our mind, and led us to ask, What are we
                            doing that shall help to build and sustain the God-like, heavenly home that was predicted
                            and so earnestly prayed for in those beautiful sentiments? We need to awaken to the
                            necessities of the day and pledge our lives anew to sustain the principle of gospel truth

                            Prescott, a member of the Society of North Union.] The civil authorities interfered and
                            committed her to prison. While thus imprisoned, she alleged that she saw in the night-time a
                            vision of Christ standing before her, and that he became one with her in form and in spirit.
                            When released from prison she announced herself as the "Bride of the Lamb." This provoked a
                            popular storm of jeers and ridicule, with attempts at personal violence. Her fears induced
                            her, with seven of her disciples, to emigrate to America.* They pitched their tent in the
                            wilderness near Albany, N. Y. This occurred about the year 1775. Here her name and fame went
                            abroad; and in the course of a few years hundreds of American converts adopted her faith,
                            and a society was established at New Lebanon, ST. y. She was suspected by politicians of
                            being a British spy, and in 1780 was imprisoned for some time at Poaghkeepsie, but was soon
                            released. She announced that she should not die, f *Tt was fcot persecutions alone but by a
                            special revelation she had, that induced her and all who chose to accompany her, to emigrate
                            to America, where further tidings awaited them. Ann Lee was horn a medium. She had heavenly
                            visions; saw and talked with angels from her childhood, and probably, would never have
                            entered the married state, if she had not lost her mother while young, and beiug
                            over-persuaded by her natural kindred, to do so, contrary to her early convictions, and
                            remonstrances against it, but she had human nature, Iike all other women. She was heard to
                            say there, was enough to people the earth without those who had conscientious scruples
                            against it. J " For. in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." Genesis,
                            ii., 17. "InAdam all die," the same death which he died, who do the same works, and this
                            same death reigned from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ, and from Christ down to the
                            present Any, and does still reign; See Epnesians, ii., 1. This was the death that Ann Lee
                            alluded to when she said, she. " should not die." It was her soul, and not her body, and she
                            never did die, nor any of her true followers, the death of Adam, after they were resurrected
                            in Christ. "Neither can they die any more." See Luke xx., 36. and, as was trie death in
                            Adam, so, also is the resurrection in Christ, spiritual i. e. the soul, and not the bodvr,
                            hence, there can be no other resurrection than that which is spiritual. Because " in Christ
                            shall all be made alive," and that life is eternal. She never taught any other doctrine than
                            the death of the human bod)", without its ever being- resurrected or translated. but would
                            at the close of her mission be suddenly translated to heaven, like Enoch and Elijah. Her
                            followers believed this. Yet she did die at Watervliet, near Albany, Sept. 8, 1784. Still
                            her adherents earnestly insist that this was not real death, but a miraculous
                            transfiguration and ascension. It is certain, however, that her doctrines have survived her
                            and seem destined never to die. It cannot be doubted that Ann Lee was a remarkable
                            personage, a religious enthusiast as earnest as irrepressible. She taught doctrines which
                            her followers have somewhat modified since her death. They now hold, that in going into
                            union, they die to the world, and enter upon a millennial life; and that' death, when it
                            does come, is but a change of form, or transfiguration, and a re-union with purified saints
                            in heaven: and that earth is heaven. They say that those who have passed out of sight are

                            second advent of Christ in the form of a woman, and that the God-head consists of the
                            Mother-hood as well as the Father-hood of God. In other words, God is dual, both male and
                            female.

                            be performed ; which if neglected will remain forever undone. Regret and repentance, however
                            deeply felt, cannot atone for past neglect. The faithfulness of to-day, simply meets the
                            demand of the present. Amid the multiplicity of earthly cares, the hurry and bustle of daily
                            life, we often lose sight of the injunction, " One by one life's duties wait thee Let thy
                            whole strength go to each." Unmindful of some essential duties, in point of Christian
                            discipline, we give to those of a non-spiritual character more time and attention than is
                            rightfully their due. The seasons devoted to prayer should claim our undivided attention,
                            our whole strength, so to speak, should be given in the petition for divine guidance, which
                            we present at the throne of the Eternal; but how often do temporal calls and selfish
                            interests engage the mind, even when the attitude of prayer is assumed. It is well to bear
                            in mind, in the minor duties of life, that whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing
                            well. Concentration of thought to the subject, or duty at hand, when guided by a religious
                            principle, brings the most satisfactory results ; writing '' Holiness unto the Lord," upon
                            each act of our lives ; making perfect, "even as our Father in heaven is perfect."

                            unlocks and delivers to our keeping the hidden riches of rational growth and development;
                            brings us into harmony with the world about us, giving us to see the necessity of adapting
                            ourselves thereto to secure those nice adjustments so essential to our welfare, without
                            which the most brilliant genius, the most profound learning, prove only a flame to burn or a

                            foregoing and still leave much unsaid. However as our observation is confined to th^
                            common-places of every-day life, a few disjointed thoughts on the subject from a
                            fellowworker might not be out of place. We are all so alike and yet so differ-<pb n="58" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>ent, still the pursuit of happiness, present or future, is the aim of all
                            although the means to attain that end differ ever so widely; some have the will and
                            knowledge to adapt the proper means to the end that others have not, and do noti is evident.
                            Life is a many-sided problem with many phases ; of the dark side we know but little and that
                            only by hear-say ; from even the relation of which the sensitive nature must shrink with
                            horror, where vice stripped of every covering stands revealed in all its frightful ugliness,
                            like " The pestilence that walketh in darkness and slayeth at noonday, " drawing in its
                            train, crime, want and woe. Much has been done to remedy these evils but the great work of
                            removing the caine remains. How the feelings of all lovers of our common kind must go out
                            toward the innocent helpless youth and childhood born and growing up in these surroundings ;
                            nothing short of a miracle can save even one from destruction. Who shall judge these justly
                            ? Where is found the wise perception, the skillful hand, that shall lay hold of the twisted,
                            gnarled and knotted tree of Nature, in all its branches producing a healthy, graceful growth
                            ? Chir faith in the right leads us to believe all good possible in time. Who has not at
                            times prayed as one of old " Come, Lord, come quickly 1" In all and through all let us not
                            be unmindful that, "To whom much is given much will be required. " The more we are led to
                            observe the peculiarities of individual character, the more we are convinced of the al
                            powerful influence, early surroundings have and always will have, in moulding the mind and
                            shaping its course, drawn n as it were with the first breath of life becoming stronger than
                            any process of reasoning, and by a still more subtle Dower even beyond this world. A certain
                            eminent physician once said, the reason why most people die of disease was because the
                            doctor was not called in time, adding that the right time was about a hundred years before
                            the mtient was born. This is more truth than jest; we may go still further by saying the
                            same rule applies as well to the mental and moral disposition, the lurtful tendencies of
                            each to be considered as a form of disease to be studied with a view of discovering the
                            cause and if possible, applying the rational cure. To this end let the gospel of Common
                            Sense have " free course to run and be glorified, " teaching that Purity, Love and Peace are
                            the only enduring riches here and hereafter, to gain which we have only to cast out
                            Selfishness and its kindred evils, the old man with his deeds. We are of necessity and by
                            nature compelled to associate in our various callings and conditions of life ; seeing it is
                            so, it becomes us to turn it to the best account for comparison, discipline and development.
                            Sometimes we may think if we but had a little world of our own, secure from the intrusion of
                            our fellows or only those of our own choosing, we might lead lives above reproach; perhaps
                            so, but such a scheme is, and must ever remain impracticable. It is not possible however
                            free we may live from fault, to wholly escape censure and adverse criticism, even from our
                            best friends, much more from the majority who are at least indifferent to our interests as
                            perhaps a few who are hostile ; in all cases if we can rely on the conscious rectitude of
                            our intentions we<pb n="59" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>shall triumph over all such trifles and be thankful
                            for the experience thus gained through trial. However much we might wish to, we cannot
                            shield even our nearest and dearest from all the trials and temptations of life ; it may be
                            in the wisdom of an over-ruling Providence to have it so. It is for each one after reaching
                            years of understanding to take up the burden of life where others have laid it down, and
                            learn wisdom through suffering; happy are they who hearken to good counsel and profit
                            thereby ; still more so such as have a conscience quickened by spiritual discernment to
                            judge rightly, united with a firm self-reliance in the right. These are they of whom it is
                            written�" The kingdom of Heaven by violence is taken. " If we labor for a spirit of
                            contentment, count over the many blessings we have daily, we shall thereby develop the
                            highest type of Common Sense receiving new ajid higher views of life, and each day have
                            cause to be thankful " that our lines have been cast in pleasant places. Watervliet,

NO. 2.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H. C." TEIform="persName"/> BY H. C. BLINN.</byline><p TEIform="p"> In the revision of the New Testament, several changes have been made that are well worthy of
                            a careful perusal. All would wish to use the best word and especially one that may be
                            clearly defined according to our present understanding. Wherever the term Holy Ghost occurs,
                            it should be changed to Holy Spirit; as Matt, iii., 11. " He shall baptize you with the Holy
                            Ghost, (Holy Spirit) and with fire. " A decided improvement is also made in other places and
                            the reader or speaker can now have a choice of words. For devil, read demon. " damnation, "
                            condemnation, judgment, justice. " tempting, trying. " hell, hades. " miracles, signs "
                            Master, Teacher. It is really curious to noie the large number of variations and alterations
                            that have been made, both by the addition and the erasure of words and sentences. Nearly
                            every chapter, throughout the whole New Testament, has been more or less changed. It had
                            become pretty thoroughly riveted in the minds of all Protestant denominations that the book
                            was written by direct inspiration from God, and hence not one word could be changed or
                            erased without committing a very great trespass against the Holy Spirit. Some have even
                            maintained that every word from the first of Genesis to the last of Revelation was the work
                            of full inspiration of God, and in proof of this referred to 2 Tim. iii., 16. "All scripture
                            is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
                            for instruction in righteousness. " This the revisers have thought best to change and it now
                            reads, "Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
                            correction, for instruction which is in righteousness. " No one would suppose that the
                            Christian revisers took much burden on account of these traditions, when we see the thorough
                            pruning which they have given to some of the passages, as Matt, iv., 24. "And his fame went
                            throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers
                            diseases and torments, and those that were possessed with devils, and those which were
                            lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. " This verse now reads, "And the
                            report of him went forth into all Syria; and they brought unto him all that were sick,
                            holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons and epileptic and palsied;
                            and he healed them." As might be expected the text is very much improved, and yet all that
                            is essential to a correct understanding is retained. In the sixth chapter, ninth verse they
                            have changed,<pb n="60" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> "children of God" to "sons of God. " We prefer the old
                            form as that included both son? and daughters, while the revised text has the masculine,
                            dominating sense which so thoroughly fills the old Testament. In Matt, v., 22, two essential
                            changes are made. " Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger
                            of the judgment. " Those who wrote the Testament for King James in 1611, took the liberty to
                            add a few words as a paliation to their own consciences. They probably wanted the scriptures
                            to sanction their anger and hatred toward their brethren, and so added to the text,�"
                            without a cause, " which would make their inquisitions and persecutions, justifiable. Those
                            who �ay,�"Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire, " but we must now think that he will
                            be in danger of the Gehenna of fire, or of being cast into the valley of Hinnom, a place
                            near the city of Jerusalem where " all refuse of the city was cast, and where the
                            combustible portions of that refuse were consumed by fire." Kitto says that "we are so
                            little acquainted with the state in which we shall be hereafter, and with the nature of our
                            future body, that no strictly, literal representation of punishment could be made
                            intelligible to us." Matt, v., 44. "But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that
                            curse you, do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
                            persecute you. " More than one half of this verse, as good as it was, did not belong to the
                            sayings of Jesus, and on this account is not in the revision. It now reads : " But I say
                            unto you, Love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you. " The Lord's prayer,
                            Matt, vi., has several changes, and now is in this form :�"Our Father which art in heaven,
                            Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven so on earth. Give us
                            this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we have also forgiven our debtors.
                            And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. " To lead us or bring us
                            into temptation seems very much alike, and as though God did really intend to lead or bring
                            us into places of temptation. There are other forms of translation which, for us, read
                            better than the above. " Abandon us not, or give us not up unto temptation. "�Shaker. "
                            Abandon us not to trial, but preserve us from evil."�Emphatic Diaglott. Paul in 1 Cor. x.,
                            13, says "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man ; but God is
                            faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the
                            temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.' To lead one into
                            temptation and then provide a way for them to escape would seem rather tantalizing. In the
                            epistle of James i., 14, the matter is fully and clearly seated, so that no one need be in
                            doubt in regard to the source of temptations. The closing words of the prayer; "For thine is
                            the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever, Amen." are now thrown out as spurious.
                            Dean Alford says they are not found in any of the most ancient Mss., and were not noticed by
                            the Greek or Latin fathers. Shall we ask, Who inserted them?

                            into daily association with some half dozen others of different ages and
                            temperaments,�leaving out for a time the intermediate intercourse with nearly an hundred
                            other associates, of ages ranging from seventy years, down even to the little children, all
                            claiming a Christian relationship. With these we profess to have given our life-interests.
                            Our covenant demands full consecration of time, talent, strength, aims, loves and hopes to
                            the building up of the Christ-kingdom on earth, a church free<pb n="61" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> from all
                            self-emulation. Now, to love every one as we love otirself, we apply the cross of Christ to
                            our inherent likes and dislikes ; instead of rejecting those personally unpleasant, and
                            differing from our idea of loveliness, we take them into our heart's sympathy, and work,
                            eat, talk, sing, pray, and share with them whatever good we have, all the while becoming
                            less and less conscious of selfexistence. We have ever with us our pattern, or lesson, the
                            command to " Love thy neighbor as thyself, " which conveys the idea, that, if true to our
                            standard, we shall sacrifice for others as we would to attain the best for self. We need
                            only ask the question, How should we feel under similar conditions,�to see this poLt of duty
                            ? We all wish to be forgiven of our errors, though we may tempt the spirit of charity, even
                            beyond " seventy times seven ; " yet we ask the favor, and urge that this charity should be
                            unfailing with the saints. If this be right, then why not become saints ourselves ? There is
                            no surer way to develop this character than to exercise the grace which we so frequently
                            request. When we think others not quite so good as we would like to have them, if they
                            exhibit' some offensive quality of character from which we imagine ourselves quite far
                            removed, let us call to memory the truth that " all sin is related, " and so long as we are
                            not without sin, we are neighbors. Let us '' Love our neighbor as ourself, " and '' Confess
                            our faults one to another." The latter injunction frequently practiced will create love and
                            chaiity, and has, in our experience, been a good agent to cast out the spirit of
                            self-righteousness, and enabled us better to love our neighbor as ourself. Canterbury, N.

" These were the words spoken by our great
                            Exampler, and how needful it is to grow and cultivate this beautiful virtue. That we may
                            more faithfully practice it, in our daily life, is our most earnest desire; that thereby we
                            may be enabled to bear all things for Christ's sake and the gospel's. In order to do this,
                            we must ever remember, there is a never-failing Fount from which the needy soul may draw
                            with the full assurance of aid. ''He that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out. "
                            Again, " Ask and ye shall receive. " All of these sayings were spoken to the disciples of
                            Jesus, while He was yet with them; but no less for the guidance and comfort of the needy in
                            the present day. Then shall we not strive to "Let patience have her perfect work. " Very
                            much of the Christian character, we find embodied in this one gospel grace. We have often
                            queried whether one is entitled to the name of Christian when allowing the spirit of
                            impatience to govern, or find a resting place in the heart. Beautiful indeed are those
                            lives, wherein the gospel grace of gospel patience is fully exemplified. Canterbury, N.

TEIform="persName"/> NANCY G. DANFORTH.</byline><p TEIform="p"> When man first transgressed the laws of God, then came hatred and strife, and as men
                            increased and multiplied on the earth, so also multiplied the elements of discord and
                            enmity. Through these elements in man even God was judged to be cruel and vindictive, full
                            of wrath and indignation. Hence, during the early dispensation, we find God represented as
                            being angry with the people when they sinned, and often times many lives were destroyed.
                            Thus we read on, through all the pages<pb n="62" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/>of the Old Testament and find no
                            way of escape from the displeasures of a jealous God ; even the last sentence ending " with
                            a curse. " It is true, obedience to the law was always commanded under penalty of the wrath
                            of God, but, as the power of obedience was lost in the first transgression, there must of
                            necessity be some way found of restoring it. It seems that this never could be realized
                            while man believed in a God having like passions with himself, subject to anger and hatred,
                            for it is true no people can rise higher than their idea of God. When, in the fullness of
                            time, Christ was revealed, and the angels sang the glad song," Glory to God in the highest;
                            on earth peace and good will to man," then commenced a revolution in the minds of men,
                            concerning the nature and attributes of God. Jesus himself declares that, '-God is love,"
                            not hate, and thej who live in the spirit of godliness, live in love and sweet communion of
                            soul. Our daily strife should be, would we be restored, or " redeemed from the powers of the
                            fall," to live in that perfect love of God which will not permit us to look upon Him as an
                            enemy filled with wrath at our short-comings. When we walk in humility, live holy, blameless
                            lives, then we obey the injunction, "Fear God and keep his commandments," because we fear to
                            grieve the beautiful spirit of love and tenderness which watches over us for our good. It is
                            not a servile fear, which would bid us perform some unjust or unreasonable act of penance.
                            Love requires no sacrifice but of our own selfish natures, when we are inclined to grasp
                            some pleasure or good at the expense of the feelings of our companions, then we should
                            control self and yield the coveted prize in favor of others. By constant self-denial we
                            finally obtain the victory over all lower, baser desires and rejoice in the reward of
                            perfect love, not only to a few souls of our own kindred, but it is boundless as the
                            universe and manifests itself in doing good to all mankind. Canterbury, N.

                                    Dawson of Montreal, (the retiring president,) in reference to evolution said, " In
                                    geology nothing perishes. Heat may change clays into slates, and lime stones into
                                    marbles. And that the sudden incoming of life in varied forms baffled Biologists.
                                    And that the theories of evolution do not account for it. Suppose we start evolution
                                    with a number of organisms ready made; I ask, how can these have varied so as to
                                    give new species and genera? It is a singular illusion, that development should
                                    arise from spontaneous selection. One consideration stands in the way of the
                                    theories of Evolution. It is the remarkable fixity of leading types. Trace certain
                                    forms of life along their own line through stupendous vicissitudes and across
                                    geologic periods, and we find them substantially unchanged. The origin of whales,
                                    affords an example of the difficulties arising from referring existing forms to
                                    imaginary ancestors. A strong evolutionist candidly says, " I have questioned these
                                    gigantic sovereigns of the Tertiary oceans, and they leave us without a reply." The
                                    Dr. adds, " the periods of rapid introduction of new forms of life, were not periods
                                    of struggle for existence, but of expansion ; while the periods of struggle, were
                                    marked by extinction." Another difficulty, is the inability of evolutionists to fill
                                    the gaps in the chain of being. Many lines of being, present a continuous<pb n="63" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>chain. On the other hand, the abrupt and simultaneous appearance of
                                    new types in many specific and generic forms over wide eras, obliges Evolutions to
                                    assumptions that Agassiz states, as being a mire of confusion. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="With might and main" TEIform="index"/> WITH MIGHT AND MAIN.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> Strike, when you strike, with might and main.

                            are able to buy and wear a good decent suit of clothes, be free from debt, and have money
                            enough in your pocket to bear your expenses to New Orleans ; and are free from all cutaneous
                            corruptions. Then, if you feel ready to come to some one of our Communities, cleanly and
                            handsomely clad, and willing and determined to bear your cross against a fleshly, corrupt,
                            demoralizing life, against diunkenness, laziness, and every kind of evil, you may come and
                            we will give you a trial privilege. But, do not, for one moment, think we are going to send
                            you money to come here, and dress you decently, and support you when you get here, by your
                            pretentions to desire to better your life, which, however, is a good desire, and we bless
                            it; but prove to us this fact, by going to work, earning money, and clothing yourself
                            decently. When a decent winter suit for a man can be got for $12.00, or $15.00, and a man
                            working faithfully, if able to work, can earn from $12.00 to $25.00 per month, in common
                            kinds of labor, there is no reasonable excuse for a man to go in rags; and, while there are
                            rivers of water, and abundance of combs and brushes, there is no need of his going dirty, or
                            slovenly! Do not think to come to any of our Institutions under the supposition that we are
                            so needy of members that we covet filth, and idleness ; far from it. Nay, clothe, and fit
                            yourself for decent society, before you attempt to call on the Shakers, for a home ! We do
                            not despise poverty, when it is an unavoidable condition and for such unfortunates the Alms
                            house is the proper home ; and we pay our share for its support. Ours, is essentially a
                            religious Institution; and its charities are administered to those toiling in the field of
                            God's reform for human society; beginning, by confessing and forsaking all sin; and then
                            being sober, industrious, and self-denying. We love all mankind! Accept a share, and wake
                            up; go to work, and do good. Your true Friend,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B." TEIform="persName"/>Giles B.

                                    childhood, by which I was taught to be careful not to wound the feelings of the
                                    unfortunate. A number of us school children were playing by the roadside, one
                                    Saturday afternoon, when the stage-coach drove up to the neighboring tavern<pb n="65" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>, and the passengers alighted. As usual, we gathered around to
                                    observe them. Among the number was an elderly gentleman with a cane, who got out
                                    with much difficulty, and, when on the ground, he walked with the most curious
                                    contortions. His feet turned one way, his knees another, and his whole body looked
                                    as though the different members were independent of each other, and every one was
                                    making motions to suit itself. " "I unthinkingly shouted, 'Look at old Rattle-Bones
                                    !' while the poor man turned his head, with an expression of pain which I can never
                                    forget. Just then to my surprise and extreme horror, my father came around the
                                    corner, and immediately stepping up to the stranger, shook his hand warmly, and
                                    assisted him to walk to our house, which was but a short distance. "I could enjoy no
                                    more play that afternoon, and when teatime came I would gladly have hidden myself;
                                    but I knew it would be in vain, and so trembling went into the sitting room. To my
                                    great relief, the stranger did not recognize me, but remarked pleasantly to my
                                    father, as he introduced me : " Such a fine boy is surely worth the saving ! " " How
                                    the words cut me to the quick ! My father had often told me the story of a friend
                                    who plunged into the river to save me, as I was drowning, when an infant, and who in
                                    consequence of a cold then taken, had been made a cripple by inflammatory
                                    rheumatism; and this was the man I had made a butt of ridicule and a laughing stock
                                    for my companions !" " I tell you boys and girls, I would give many dollars to have
                                    the memory of that event taken away. If ever you are tempted as I was, remember
                                    that, while no good comes of sport whereby the feelings of others are wounded, you
                                    may be laying up for yourselves painful recollections that will not leave you for a

                                the Church family of Shakers. I attended school the past Winter and was in the first
                                class in everything. My studies are Arithmetic, Reading, Physiology, Geography, Grammar
                                and Drawing, I like them all very much. Bertie and I am in Fractions and shall soon be
                                in Percentage, we expect to go through decimal fractions. I have had good lessons so far
                                and shall try and continue them good. Last Summer the boys each had a small piece of
                                ground to plant and take care of. I planted on my piece, some corn, melons, beets,
                                turnips and radishes ; but the melons did not do very well so I destroyed them and
                                planted some buckwheat in their place; but I planted it too late so it did not come to
                                anything; my corn was very good, I planted about a pint and got about four bushels. The
                                kinds of work I like to do best are carpentering, tinkering, and pipe-fitting. I feel
                                very grateful to you for the good care you take of my clothes and also for your teaching
                                me to write well. I am glad to have some one to take such good care of me, for I have
                                not had it for a good while before I came here. I will try and take good care of my
                                clothes and not give you unnecessary trouble. I am progressing nicely in my music and
                                can read in any key, and I will here say that I am very thankful to my teachers for
                                persevering with me as I hope to repay them some day by making a good man.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Newman, Fred R." TEIform="persName"/> Fred R.

Whatever else may demand the attention of the professor of Christianity on his
                            pilgrimage through life, the spirit of Christ,�that spirit which made Jesus pre-eminently
                            the Son of God, should become our teacher and protector. It has lovingly promised to lead us
                            into all truth, life, light and knowledge and by a growth in these divine blessings,
                            ultimately, to make us free sons and daughters in the kingdom of our God. " Let names and
                            sects and parties, Accost mine ear no more ; " for there can be no intrinsic worth in a
                            name, Avhether applied to religion or philosophy, and there can be no warrantable objection
                            to a faith in God, although in partial obscurity from the wise and prudent of this world.
                            Let os accept, with willing hearts, the spirit and courage of the apostle, and glory in our
                            freedom,, and then with him we may well exclaim,�" What if some do not believe, shall
                            unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid!" And we as unqualifiedly repeat
                            with all the earnestness that our light and experience have given us, God forbid ! That some
                            religious bodies are satisfied to abide in the rudimental work of Christianity is not
                            strange. Accepting one degree of light, they become satisfied and fail to prosecute the
                            journey �which was to make them free in Chri-t. External forms and ceremonies may have
                            captivated the mind and effectually ruled the religious life. The doctrine of water baptism,
                            of laying on of hands, of the physical resurrection and of the literal day of judgment, have
                            like the tithes ot mint, anise and cumin, been the subjects which have claimed the most
                            attention. A rigid exactness has been demanded in these while weightier matters pertaining
                            to* truth and righteousness have been allowed to waste away by utter neglect. The
                            pentecostal spirit has been lost and the church forming an alliance with a secular order,
                            has been represented as walking with the world. " Just walk with me but a little space, "
                            Said the world with a kindly air; " The road I walk is a pleasant road, And the sun shines
                            always there; Your path is thorny and rough and rude,. And mine is broad and plain ; My road
                            is paved with flowers and dew. And yours with tears and pain ; The sky above me is always
                            blue, Xo want or toil I know; The sky above you is always dark; Your lot is a lot of woe ;
                            My path you see is a broad fair one, And my gate is high and wide; There is room enough for
                            you and me, To travel side by side. " Our lur;e as a religious body must rest upon the
                            faithfulness which is manifested in the order, to abide as living members of a living church
                            upon the foundation which Christ has laid for our salvation. His testimony has been
                            denominated the testimony of the resurrection heavens, as it calls us from dead works into
                            life and light, and out front the tombs and sepulchres Of selfishness and uncleanness into
                            the glory and beauty of the Kingdom of God. Are we right? Can we testify with corresponding
                            boldness and simplicity with the good apostle,�" We know we are of God ! " It is indeed,
                            better to look up and have courage to do right than to be double-minded and unstable. To be
                            of God we must be pure, be<pb n="67" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/>peacemakers, and this state can be reached
                            only through an honest confession of all sin. To encourage us in this work of the cross it
                            has been written, "If we confess our sins he [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our
                            sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Nothing short of the acceptance of the
                            divine Spirit and an unclouded honesty can work this effectual change. If we are now able to
                            establish a claim as being among those who have heard the voice of the Son of God, then we
                            certainly have a part in his spirit and in the work of the first resurrection, upon whom the
                            second death can have no power. Christ has given us this assurance, "I am the resurrection,
                            and the life. " If we accept this we have no need to wait for some special day, afar off, at
                            the end of time for the reanimation of our earthly bodies, as the life of Christ will dwell
                            in us while on the earth and give us a place in the resurrection from the dead. Having
                            received this heavenly home and the unbounded mercy of God, we might well be called
                            unprofitable servants if we should fail to present them in all their beauty and glory to
                            those less privileged than ourselves.</p><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Among the many good things in this world is..." TEIform="index"/>

                                a good source. The Teacher recognized this fact and left for us this beautiful lesson,
                                'k Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. " Children that are carefully

                                not remember, you have heard how she cured you of colic with warm herb teas, and hot
                                draughts to your feet; she cured croup by dipping strips of flannel in hot water, then
                                wringing them out and enveloping your neck with them ; how she cured a cold and cough by
                                wetting several thicknesses of flannel in hot water and laying on your chest. But the
                                world has forgotten its experiences, and Hot Water poses as a brand-new remedy ; not
                                only for ailments for which it is especially adapted, but is recommended by some who
                                ought to know better for diseases where it might do positive harm. Do not imagine that
                                because water is abundant, is found everywhere, even in stones and metals, that it has
                                no potency as a curative agent. It stands at the head of the list of remedies, and
                                enters into all compounds, it constitutes five-sixths of the material from which the
                                bodies of men and animals are made. A knowledge of these facts will, en-<pb n="68" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> able us to see more clearly how water, and particularly hot water, acts
                                as a remedial agent. Take, for example, the case of a person who has taken cold in the
                                lungs. The circulation of the blood in the small bloodvessels in that portion of the
                                lungs affected becomes sluggish; in some cases it is quite suspended; the general
                                circulation is impeded through failure of an important organ to do the work required of
                                it, and the whole system suffers ; the man is ill. Now, if we know why the disease
                                exists, by what unnatural condition it is kept up, the remedy suggests itself; as, if a
                                water pipe were frozen up, any child knows that the remedy is heat. And here is just
                                where water as warm as it can be comfortably borne will effect a cure in ordinary cases.
                                Let the patient go to bed. Put bottles of hot ivater to his feet, and cloths wet in hot
                                water on his chest. Let him drink hot water as freely as he can with comfort ; it
                                matters little whether it is clear hot water, or herb tea, it is nevertheless hot water.
                                With this treatment we are employing hot water at its full value. Its internal use tends
                                to thaw out the blood-vessels, and its outward application quickens the circulation in
                                the blood-vessels near the surface ; thus drawing on the deep-seated blood-vessels for
                                supplies to keep up the activity, and thus the congestion is relieved and* the patient
                                is cured. In dyspepsia, hot water, taken internally, under proper restrictions, is no
                                doubt very useful, since dyspepsia depends on a congested and deranged condition of the
                                digestive organs. But in consumption and other diseases attended by general debility it
                                can only be deti'imental. When a person is feeble from disease not marked with acute
                                inflammation, the hot water treatment necessarily increases the debility. Here a tonic
                                treatment is applicable�a treatment; that will increase and enrich the blood and supply
                                the fuel required to keep the machinery of life in motion. The Hot Water Treatment is
                                useful in removing obstructions from the machinery, but only in systems where there is a
                                surplus of vital power. To recapitulate ; the drinking of hot water at proper intervals
                                and in proper quantities is useful in dyspepsia, constipation, torpid liver, congestion
                                of the stomach, chronic diarrhoea, and in various affections of the kidneys and bladder;
                                provided that there is not at the same time serious diseases of the lungs, with
                                debility. The water should be as hot as tea is usually made that is,�from 110 to 150
                                dgs., and should be sipped, not taken rapidly. The quantity should be from half a pint
                                to a pint. It should be taken one to two hours after meals, and nothing should be eaten
                                until at least one hour afterward. The evening draught should be just before going to
                                bed. The hot water treatment should continue until a cure is effected; the time required
                                will vary from one to six months. If a person desires to reduce this treatment to a
                                system, and thus be able to judge for himself of the required temperature of the water,
                                itsquantity, and how often it should be taken, he should provide himself with a
                                thermometer and a urinometer. The thermometer will enable him to get the proper
                                temperature of the hot water, and the urinometer will show the specific gravity of the
                                urine that is voided on rising in the morning; this being the proper time to make the
                                test. The specific gravity of the urine of a healthy infant is 1015 to 1020. The near
                                approach to these figures indicates that the treatment is properly regulated. The urine
                                should be near the color of champagne, free from rank odor and sediment on cooling. In
                                order to derive the full benefit of this, or indeed of any treatment, the diet and the
                                general habits of the patient should be regulated to conform with the treatment. All
                                excesses in eating and drinking should be avoided. The effect of the above treatment,
                                properly carried out, is to improve the general health by removing obstructions to the
                                natural action of the digestive organs, upon which the condition of the other Internal
                                organs mainly depends. </p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="A community having goods in common is is an outflow of the divine element in man." TEIform="index"/>

                            prior to their embarkation for the New World, is note-worthy for a humility, as well as a
                            candor and liberality, which modem Religionists might copy with advantage : "Brethren! we
                            are now quickly to part from one another, and whether I may live to see your faces any more
                            on earth, the God of Heaven only knows; but whether the Lord has appointed that or not, I
                            charge yoa before God and his blessed Angels, that you follow me no further than you have
                            seen me follow the Lord Jesus Christ. "If God reveal anything unto you by any other
                            instrument of his, be as ready to receive it as you were any truth by my ministry ; for I am
                            persuaded, I am very confident the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his word.
                            For my part I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the Reformed Churches, who are
                            come to a period in religion, and will go, atpresent, no further than the instruments of
                            their reformation. The Lutherans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther saw. Whatever part
                            of his will our good God hath revealed unto Calvin, they will rather die than embrace it.
                            And the Calvinists, you see, stick fast where they were left by that great man of God, who
                            yet saw not all things." "This is a misery much to be lamented; for though they were burning
                            and shining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not into the whole counsel of God;
                            but were they now living, would be as willing to embrace further light as that which they at
                            first received. I beseech you to remember, it is an article of your Church covenant, that
                            you be ready to receive whatever truth shall be made known to you from the written word of
                            God. Remember that, and every other article of your sacred covenant. But I must herewithal
                            exhort you to take heed what ye receive as truth. Examine it, consider it, and compare it
                            with other Scriptures of trutli before ye receive it; for it is not possible that the
                            Christian world should come so lately out of anti-christian darkness, and that perfection of
                            knowledge should break forth at once."</p></div2><pb n="70" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="fiction" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Woods, Joseph" TEIform="persName"/> [Contributed by Joseph Woods.] </byline><head TEIform="head"><index level1="John and the Minister" TEIform="index"/> JOHN AND THE MINISTER</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> How to Improve the Time. John having hired out to work for the Minister, was
                                    directed by him, one morning, to take old Buck and Berry and the harrow, and harrow
                                    a certain piece of plowed land, so that it might be suitable for planting. John look
                                    the cattle and harrow and went to work. The weather being warm and the old harrow
                                    hanging back, in about one hour the oxen began to show unmistakable signs of
                                    approaching resolution, and soon came to a halt, having their mouths open, their
                                    tongues protruding, and making sounds which John wisely interpreted to be their
                                    funeral song. Being of a merciful turn of mind and somewhat serious, he caught the
                                    inspiration of the hour, and quietly seated himself as an attentive listener,�if so
                                    be he might learn the tune. The good Minister, ever watchful, made the discovery
                                    very soon that John was idle. He thought it would not be profitable at such wages,
                                    fifty cents per day to so 3pend his time. Accordingly, he leisurely walked to where
                                    John was seated, his attention in the meantime being toward some surrounding
                                    objects. John could not really design what it was ; but was soon enlightened by the
                                    Minister. John, said he, would it not he a good plan for you to have a scythe, and
                                    hubble a few bushes while the oxen are resting? John, knowing the Minister was hired
                                    for $800. per year, to preach and make himself otherwise useful to the people, and
