There are persons using
Dobbins' Electric Soap, who
commenced its use in 1869
Would this be the case, if it
were not the purest, best, and
most economical soap made ?
For 23 years it has been imitated by unscrupulous soap
makers. Why? Because it
is best of all, and has an immense sale. Poor articles
are not imitated. Is it probable that what a million women say, after a life time of
daily trial, is a mistake ? They
say that they know by actual
test that Dobbins' Electric
Soap is the most economical
soap made. They have had
23 years to try it. You try
it one week.

LUUft    twenty or thirty of th-m all

^*�* '       are   all   inferior,   adulterated
soaps, not worthy a trade mark  of their

                            of New Hampshire, called at the Society in Enfield and was introduced to the family, by
                            Father Job Bishop. President Monroe also made a visit to South Union on the 17th of June,
                            1819 and was accompanied by General Andrew Jackson and family. The new meeting-house was
                            finished and the first service held on Sabbath, November 28, 1819. Several Brethren from
                            Union Village and from Pleasant Hill were present, who had assisted in the work of the
                            building. In 1828, the people of South Union, were strongly reminded of the story of the
                            flood, as they had a term of forty days, in which it rained a large part of the time. Since
                            the organization of the Society, all the cooking of the food had been done in the
                            fire-place. To some persons, this seemed to be the best arrangement for the business, that
                            possibly could be devised. But the cooking stove had been introduced into a great many
                            families, having all the modern conveniences, and one of these was brought home for the use
                            of the Sisters. From this date, the fire-place had less and less advocates, and finally was
                            abandoned altogether. Not less than twelve valuable horses have been poisoned with
                            strychnia. Several of our neighbors have also suffered in the same way and yet no clue can
                            be obtained of the perpetrator. Although most of the rogues that we have mentioned, have
                            been white, yet the colored men were not all strictly honest. Some one entered a building in
                            the North family in 1832 and broke open the chest of one of the novitiate members and stole

                            a negro and he was confined for several days, through hope of obtaining a confession. He was
                            then given his freedom, but told to return the money by Sunday. Sunday came, but no negro
                            nor any money. They took him up again and he concluded to confess. He escorted the Brethren
                            to a small cave near Bowling Green, a distance of fourteen miles, and there unearthed
                            $204.00 saying 1hat was all he had. So they took the money and let the negro go. After this,
                            his master, who was a Shaker, sent his slave to the Iron Works in Tennessee, from which
                            place there was little chance of escape. Some of the blacks who were at work at the North
                            family, resolved themselves into a court and impaneled a jury of black men, to try a negro
                            by the name of Tom for stealing a jackknife. The case went to a hearing and the jury found
                            him guilty and ordered that he should have ten lashes, well laid on, and after that he
                            should be treated to a supper, and his waiters should be three black gentlemen. Tom received
                            the lashes, and then had his wounds washed. When supper was ready, the gentlemen were
                            appointed to carry out their part of the seatence. They waited on Tom handsomely, and the
                            Court and Jury were satisfied that all things were done in good, African style. The knife
                            was restored, the law satisfied and Tom was again admitted to fellowship. The Believers at
                            South Union were quite interested in the manufacture of silk handkerchiefs. They had ample
                            accommodations for the raising of silk worms, and in 1832, in the month of June, the Sisters
                            picked the first crop of cocoons for the season, and had one hundred and thirty-seven
                            pounds. One pound would be eight hundred and five cocoons, making in all, 110,285 cocoons.
                            Some remarks were found among the writings of J. R. Eads, referring to slave labor in 1835.
                            The renunciation of the practice of hiring slave labor, generates new feelings. This, with
                            the changes that have been made in our family arrangements, is calculated to awaken us from
                            our quietness. In 1844, a negro, who seemed to be under a religious excitement, came into
                            Elkton Co., and spoke in the street for two hours. Among other things, he said, ."I have
                            been sent to proclaim, that the time of the end is near. I am not come in the name of
                            Stephen, but in the name of the mighty God of Israel. You may not believe me, but you will
                            yet be convinced. This government is a government of strife, confusion and gloom, but that
                            which shall succeed, will be a government of universal emancipation." In twenty years from
                            this date, the above prophecy became true, when a universal proclamation was sent throughout
                            the United States by President Lincoln. In July 1850, there was a discussion on the subject
                            of lightning-rods and it resulted in putting the rods on the Trustees' Office, the
                            meeting-house and on the family dwelling. None had ever been used up to this time, and
                            whether these proved beneficial or otherwise, we have no record to inform us.<pb n="55" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 55 The cost was fifteen crntsa foot for the rod and one dollar
                            each for the points. In June 1855, a disaffected class attempted to raise a company and by
                            mob violence, drive the Shakers from South Union and then seize the property for their own
                            use. An old resident of the County, a doctor by profession, had been riding about the
                            country for some three weeks, striving to enlist the populace in the scheme, and agreeing
                            with them to meet on the first of June, at the cross-roads, on the way to Russellville. The
                            causes for this raid, or intended raid, are vnrious, but the principal cause is said to be
                            the interference of one of Ihe Brethren to procure the freedom of some persons of color,
                            illegally held in bondage by some of the party. Some friendly neighbors had the kindness to
                            inform us of these unlawful proceedings. A meeting was appointed and the .friends of the
                            Believers were notified to be present. Two lawyers volunteered their services on the side of
                            the Shakers, and an able lawyer from Elkton was engaged to plead the case. The complainants
                            then urged that the meeting be held at the residence of Dr. Ehea. The meeting was called to
                            order by John Burnham, a merchant of Bowling Green. Our attorney then proposed to address
                            the crowd. No, no, no, resounded through the air. They did not wish to waste time. It was
                            then agreed to leave it to the crowd whether or not he should speak. A vote was taken and a
                            large majority decided that he should speak. The lawyer then addressed the crowd, as
                            law-abiding citizens, appealing to their sense of right and arguing a legal course as the
                            proper one to pursue. If the Shakers had violated any law, let them be prosecuted;�but if
                            they had not, those who disturbed the Shakers would be liable to indictment and prosecution.
                            After several others had spoken, some for the Shakers and some for the complainants, lawyer
                            Briston demanded a separation in order to discover who was in favor of legal proceedings and
                            who was not. Accordingly, the separation was made, showing a large majority on the side of
                            law and justice. The meeting then adjourned to some subsequent day, but to this date (1872)
                            it has not convened.</p><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p">[The Believers at South Union, were obliged to exercise great care in regard to the
                                language they used in reference to the subject of slavery. As Christians, following the
                                example of Jesus the Christ, they could not hold slaves as property, nor encourage
                                others to do so. Situated in a slave state, it required a constant guard over the whole
                                life, that they might live peacefully with the slavemasters, who were very jealous over
                                their peculiar institution of human slavery. As the abolitionists became more annoying
                                to the owners of the slaves, the slaveholders became more suspicious of the Shakers, and

                            wisdom and love. I find that in finite man, these two qualities can, may and do act as it
                            were separately. A mother may love her offspring to death and destruction and not show any
                            wisdom in th &gt; whole process. A man may love gold merely for itself, till he starve to death
                            before he will spend it to live. He is entirely wanting in wisdon. These are extreme cases,
                            but they prove that love may be exercised while wisdom is not in activity. Again, man may be
                            intensely exercised in cold, cast-steel calculations in mathematics, vivisection or even
                            theology. Witness Calvin's grizzly horrors of doctrine, and in all his speculations not one
                            atom of love is to be discovered. The absent quality in each case is merely lying dormant in
                            the human soul and is not yet developed into normal activity. These fairly represent
                            humanity on its lower, rudimental plane of existence. All the way between these extremes of
                            inequality, there are grades and degrees of distribution of wisdom and love, even to
                            comparative equality and perfection. Jesus Christ supposed man to be capable of absolute
                            perfection, that is, infinite perfection, else why did he say, "Be ye therefore perfect,

                            these, a third active attribute, a perfect union thereof ensues. Here is a trinity of
                            aspects or conditions not possible to be experienced on the lower plane of humanity with its
                            abnormal, unequal and imperfect conditions. This Trinity in Unity is what constitutes the
                            difference between the rudimental plane of existence and the grand and glorious Christ
                            plane. It is the difference between selfishness and self-abnegation, love and hatred,
                            revenge and holy forgiveness, mercy and cruelty, war and peace, purity and impurity. This is
                            the glorious height to which we are called and the green pastures of everlasting consolation
                            in which we may walk. "Let us lay aside every weight," envying and strife, intoxicants, even
                            as medicine, flesh-meat, etc., etc. "and the sin which doth so easily beset us," the 'flesh
                            with its affections and lusts,' and "let us run with patience the race that is set before
                            us." "We'll follow those who've gone before And have the prize possessed, Who've all their
                            trying scenes passed o'er And entered into rest. For Prophets, Kings and Holy men Did long
                            to reach this light, Yet lingered out their days in pain And died without the sight." Let us
                            do all we can for humanity in our day and generation in all prudence and wisdom not
                            forgetting the inspired word of the great Seer of the Babylonian captives "The wise shall
                            shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the
                            stars forever and ever."

                            some trees in preference to others. A German professor who has investigated the matter for
                            several years has recently published the interesting result of his labors in Ueber Land und
                            Meer (Over Land and Sea.) He started from the natural assumption that the trees which
                            furnished the best conductor ought to be the ones most frequently struck. He therefore
                            subjected the different kinds of wood to chemical, electrical and microscopic investigation,
                            which soon established the fact that electricity had no decided preference for either hard
                            or soft woods. Knowing that water is one of the best conductors, he ascertained the amount
                            of moisture contained in growing timber, finding 51 per cent in poplar, 39 in oak, 26 in
                            willow, &amp;c, but the electric test proved that the willow with only half the quantity
                            of moisture was no more exempt than the poplar. Further analysis determined the<pb n="58" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 58 THE MANIFESTO. amount of oil contained in beeches, walnut trees and
                            evergreens: while pursuing this line of research he observed the electric spark to jump over
                            the green beechwood to reach a piece of dry, dead wood beyond. Following this clew he
                            established the fact that lightning has but little affinity for oilcontaining forest trees,
                            and this conclusion is fully verified by statistics. In the principality of Detmold,
                            forestry has beeu reduced to a practical science. Its very extensive titnbar lands have been
                            under the constant care of numerous officials, and an exact record of everything relating to
                            them has been kept. About 70 per cent of these woods consist of beeches, 11 per cent of oaks
                            and the remainder of different kinds. Statistics kept since 1874 prove the great exemption
                            beeches enjoy from the visitation of lightning. Of course the number of such contacts will
                            vary according to the frequency of thunder-storms in the season ; thus in 1879, fifteen oaks
                            were struck to one beech, while in 1885 the former were struck eighty-four times to one of
                            the latter. The Professor decided that the walnut tree is the least liable to be touched by
                            the electric fluid because of the large amount of oil it contains. The aboriginal Indians
                            knew that oaks were the worst trees to be under in a thunder-shower, and beech or walnut
                            trees the best. But they were ignorant of the cause of the fact, nor could they have ever
                            discovered it as long as they remained what they were. Aside from and in connection with
                            true religion and morality it is art and science, literature and mechanical inventions, that
                            are the glory of our time ; but they all are the product of long continued labor, research,
                            experiment, and deep and orderly thinking. No knowledge worth having has ever come
                            intuitional. Newton saw an apple fall to the ground ; millions had seen the same thing
                            happen before and were none the wiser; but with his whole mind bent upon discovering the
                            cause which keeps the movements of the worlds in order, this simple fact started a train of
                            thought which was finally formulated in the law of gravitation. It was not a sudden
                            knowledge come to him from without, but the slow and laborious secretion of years. We have
                            heard of a man who claims he obtained the knowledge of the Hebrew language by illumination
                            or inspiration. We don't believe it. Knowledge doesn't come in that way. The facts are all
                            against it. The "gift of tongues" in the primitive church was the temporary exercise of
                            mental and spiritual faculties, the power passing away with the occasion which produced it.

                            race, and making due allowance for the allegorical habit of the early peoples in accounting
                            for phenomena, there appears to be little difficulty in reconciling the two. The Biblical
                            account declares that God made all things; the world, plants, animals and man. Evolution
                            claims the same thing, only ascribing all to natural forces�as though natural forces were
                            not God's will and desire. No tolerably enlightened Christian of to-day, entertains the idea
                            that God constructed the physical universe as a mechanic constructs a watch or a factory; or
                            that anything beyond the will and desire�inspiration of the laws of nature�of an Almighty
                            and All-wise being is required to cause all things to be. Let us say then, once for all: man
                            was made, produced, caused to be, in common with other animals; and hence necessarily
                            endowed with the instincts, appetites, passions and desires<pb n="60" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 60 THE
                            MANIFESTO. indispensable to animal life. Up to this point Christianity and Evolution agree.
                            Here however there is a divergence ; but, seemingly only in the manner of expression.
                            Christianity claiming the direct, and Evolution the indirect application, inspiration or
                            in-breathing of Divine force or power in producing or evolving humanity. � The Christian
                            ascribes man's double nature (of the possession of which we are all but too well aware) to a
                            union of the animal and Divine having taken place by direct in-breathing, inspiration or
                            obsession; while Evolution ascribes the difference between a "gorilla and a gentleman," to
                            the indirect action of Divine power through natural laws. This difference is further shown
                            to be one of mere words, when the facts of the history and present condition of the race is
                            considered, since these answer the logical demands of both theories alike. "Uniformity of
                            results, proves uniformity of cause." Given the human pair in the state of innocent
                            inexperience described in the Mosaic account of creation, and the excesses, dissipations and
                            consequent disorder of human society becomes what the theories of Christianity not only but
                            the laws of cause and effect require. And given the most human-like of the lower animals,
                            and admitting the epochal change in the workings of "natural selection," evolving human
                            reason, imagination and invention, as Evolution claims; and is not the successes, excesses,
                            grandeur and demoralization of the world of to-day, the logical outcome? Hence it would seem
                            a matter of indifference which theory we accept, since the results are shown to be the same,
                            to wit, the peopling the world by natural generation. But in peopling, generation has
                            pauperized the world. Morally the whole world, pecuniarily the larger share; this, although
                            in the nature of things unavoidable, is not well. However, it seems the world was to be
                            peopled, if peopled at all, in accordance with the laws of nature through the
                            instrumentality of man and woman, and to result in a civilization susceptable to
                            Christianity; hence the private family with its exclusive loves and interests become
                            unavoidable. And govern a world with exclusiveness of loves and interests, the competitive
                            system, and strife andcontention, bloated wealth, squalid poverty, crime, war and
                            blood-shed, become unavoidable. It follows, whether we accept the Mosaic or Darwinian
                            cosmogany, the natural or artificial theory of the world; we are alike confronted by the
                            same inextricable dilemma, to wit, the necessity for peopling our planet, necessitates the
                            depravity of its people. This being admitted�and there seems no way of escaping the
                            conclusion�there can be, at bottom, no essential difference between the requirements of
                            Christianity and Evolution, or indeed any other theory that proposes to rescue the world
                            from its evils; since generation, with its partial loves and divers lusts must cease, as a
                            prerequisite, with all who are to be �rescued. In a word, the world must come to an end with

                            the passing to the permanent; from the natural to the spiritual; from the animal human to
                            the Divine human being; from the necessary self-care of the one to the equally necessary and
                            spontaneous social care of the other, where self is merged in social, and partial, in
                            universal love; must accept the new regimen, the second great epochal change�and this
                            Evolution seems to have overlooked�where a second in-breathing or more properly, obsession
                            takes place, changing the man's motives of action from generating a natural race, to
                            re-generating the natural to a spiritual, or spirit race. This time the obsessing force is
                            said to be visible, descending and abiding upon the man Jesus; thus constituting him the
                            head of the New, as Adam is the head of the Old creation, or phase of man's existence. The

                            generation to his followers ; resulting in a world of natural human life. The second being
                            also endowed and adequately empowered to set the example and transmit the elements of
                            regeneration to his followers ; resulting in a world of spiritual human life. The terms
                            natural and spiritual are here employed, not as separate matters, but as compliments of each
                            other, as the stalk and grain ; the stalk to perish when its usefulness is subserved, the
                            grain to be transmuted to a higher phase of life.

                            seventy-four years in our lovely Zion home. Faithful to the last in all things, temporal and
                            spiritual, while health and strength remained. He was truly a pattern of godliness in all
                            his dealings with his Brethren and Sisters. Pure and chaste in his deportment, simple and
                            child-like in his manners. He was indeed, a tower of strength to the � young thus evidencing
                            what Mother's gospel can do for all souls who willingly yield obedience to its elevating,
                            soul-saving principles. He often remarked that he thought we had too much of the spirit of
                            the world among us, as a people, to have a fruitful travel in this soul-purifying work. That
                            we needed to retrace our steps to the foundation principles of our faith, before we could
                            expect to have that measure of justification and spiritual prosperity as a body, for which
                            our spirits were so earnestly praying. The religion of our dear father was eminently
                            practical; not a dead, lifeless formalism, but one whose noble aspirations reached to all
                            humanity, for their future happiness. Honest and upright in his dealings as an Elder as well
                            as a Trustee, he ever manifested that inflexible regard for loving-kindness to all, that it
                            deeply enshrined his memory in the affectionate regard of every consecrated Believer. Though
                            we shall greatly miss him in our little home circle where his pure influence ever rested
                            like a sacred benediction, we rejoice that his noble spirit passed quietly from the scenes

                            thousands. For this multitude there is but little work, and for the work that may be done,
                            the laborer gets only a small compensation. To say that it was always so, does not better
                            the condition and to say that the starvation of the poor brings about the "survival of the
                            better class," is quite questionable. The humanity of man should, so far as it is able,
                            ameliorate all these unfortunate conditions and work in the interest of good-will toward
                            men. There is something about this state of affairs that bears a strong resemblance to the
                            lives of the laboring classes in Egypt many thousands of years in the past. Crime is thought
                            by some to be on the increase, and certainly deeds of foulness that cover the catalogue of
                            wicked ways are of daily occurrence. The why and the wherefore is the great wonder of the
                            age. No one seems able to solve the problem or to define the cause, even though the would be
                            worldly-wise are anxiously waiting to be heard. The religionists would have it a political
                            visitation but are not fully decided which party organization is the most culpable. Bad
                            thoughts are generated and bad words are hurled from one to another with little
                            discrimination and with less care for strict justice. The religious wTorld suffers as does
                            the political and the lines of morality have fallen very low, as animal natures'are more
                            keenly aroused. A few incline to see in the dim distance the hand of God, as of old, writing
                            on the wall, and this they say will solve the great mystery. It will tell the whole story,
                            but it will, in all probability, have reference to the shortcomings of our neighbors who are
                            always at fault, and have no special reference to ourselves, as we are generally right. The
                            revolving seasons have brought us quite to the place or condition of that wonderful
                            personage who asked of God,�"Give me neither poverty nor riches, lest I be full and deny
                            thee, or lest I be poor and steal and take the name of God in vain." So there seems to be
                            danger in being either ver,y rich or very poor. A great deal has been said, even by
                            Believers about the wage slaves, as though the rich were grinding the faces of the poor and
                            forcing them to suffer unwarrantable distress. This to a large extent may be quite true, and
                            yet there may be poor, hard masters as well as rich ones. The poor are not slow to take
                            advantage of the poor if occasion offers, so that the selfishness of the human mind is quite
                            fully represented through every class.<pb n="65" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 65 The only sure
                            remedy, in all probability, that will ever be found for the rich and the poor will be in the
                            words of Jesus, "Do unto others as ye would that men should do unto you." This comes
                            directly to the point at issue. The strongest inclination is generally, to do by others as
                            best we can in our own interest. Those who are rich and selfish will force all below them,
                            if possible, to be their slaves, while the ignorant poor will often squander all they may
                            obtain, honestly or dishonestly in a very questionable manner. And yet it is surprising how
                            very dependent the rich and poor are upon the efforts of each other, and then how rapidly
                            the two classes sometimes are found changing places, with each other. The wealthy of one
                            generation may find themselves among the poor in the next, and the poor may by industry and
                            perseverance rise to affluence and wealth.</p></div2><div2 type="editorial" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="For the poor shall never cease..." TEIform="index"/>

                            themselves in this world the strife began to see which should possess the most property.
                            Soon one became rich and the other became poor, and it might have been said even at that
                            date, "The poor shall never cease out of the land," and certainly the prospect at the
                            present time is not very flattering. After Cain had secured the property of his brother
                            Abel, he no doubt, made the journey to the land of Nod in grand style and found there the
                            rich and poor, the same as wre should find them to-day in every city and village. That
                            expression, concerning the poor, in its fullness will last so long as the race of man
                            exists. Moses and Jesus were typical men and were specially sympathetic toward the poor.
                            Both of them took occasion to say many comforting things to the poor and to those burdened
                            with the sorrows of this life. Neither did Jesus hesitate to speak as kindly to those who
                            had an abundance of this world's goods. He attended the wedding of a wealthy personage in
                            Cana, and added liberally to their interest in the pleasures of the occasion. He accepted an
                            invitation to dine with the rich Zaccheus and subsequently through kindness to heal the son
                            of the wealthy Centurion. His mission, however, was essentially spiritual and whether among
                            the rich or the poor his testimony was for God and his kingdom. For the unclean poor he
                            manifested no more sympathy than for the unclean wealthy. His interest was with the poor in
                            spirit. "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness." Whether rich or
                                poor<pb n="66" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 66 THE MANIFESTO. he was anxious for them to "seek first the
                            kingdom of God and its righteousness." Eating and drinking was a secondary matter as we
                            learn from his own words, "Take no thought, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink." He
                            would eat that he might live. "Whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
                            glory of God." Make this a matter of conscience instead of forcing conscience to eat and
                            drink as urged by an undisciplined and unchristian appetite. How much we have yet to learn
                            in this simple, daily duty and how much it has to do with our whole course of life. We are
                            learning new lessons, lessons in eating and drinking as well as lessons in grammar and
                            geography. We are learning that the soul and body of man are very closely conjoined and what
                            influences the one, will more or less influence the other. We are learning that a system of
                            righteousness must develop in the soul as we walk among men. It must create in us a new
                            heart and awaken an inspiration that will give life to the whole household of faith. Then
                            the rich and the poor will bear toward each other a friendly relation and the peaceable
                            fruits of righteousness will govern the minds of all.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Now" TEIform="index"/>NOW.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">If you have a kind word, say it; Throbbing hearts soon sink to rest; If you owe a

                                of peace and love, always welcome and comforting. We are pleased to read in many reform
                                papers, of the noble men and women who are ministering to the relief of suffering and
                                want, and of others who are working to remove the causes. We wei'e moved to collect, as

                                to New York for distribution to the needy, through the organization of the Salvation

                                center is judiciously distributed. Eldress Anna felt the impression of the spirit of
                                generosity and kindliness moving in the hearts of all at this time, and was sure if the
                                K. R. Companies were appealed to they would carry the goods to the city free. Some of us

                                were drilled to salute the National flag which hung in the room, and required to sing,

                                soul was moved when he reached home to pen the following verses, If I could clothe each
                                jeweled thought That comes to me from Nature's bowers In classic language, such as
                                taught Away from western woods and flowers, If I could sing the sweet refrains That in
                                my soul in silence cluster, From many a heart I'd strike the chains, And give the star
                                of hope new lustre. If I could scatter all the gems That light my soul, in darkest
                                places, Could pluck the hope-buds from their stems, A nd wreathe them o'er despondent
                                faces, If I had but trie power to stay The blighting hand of pain and sorrow, The human
                                flowers that wilt to-day Would raise their heads and bloom to-morrow. If from the Master
                                hand above To me the longed-for power was given To change all bitterness to love, Of
                                every earthly hell make heaven, The lowering clouds would quickly flee Before the light
                                which followed after, And every wave of Life's broad sea Would gleam with love and song
                                and laughter. This power is in the hands of the people if they only knew it and were
                                wise enough to use it. In all this gloom and apparent despair ours is a gospel of hope,
                                and we are thankful notwithstanding all the misery and wrong, that we are living in this
                                age of activity in moral reforms, and to witness the gathering of the forces that will
                                yet overthrow the foundations of the old earth and establish the new. We have followed
                                the good example of other of our friends and put water within the reach of our cows as
                                they stand in their stalls; this is a great accomodation and we think will be
                                profitable. Three years ago we erected a slide for ice from our pond to the icehouse. We
                                were not able to check the descent of the ice so that we could make use of it until this
                                year, when the inventive genius of our Brother Charles Greaves, devised a plan for
                                lowering that has worked fairly well this season, and with a little perfecting, will
                                make the slide a great saving of . labor in getting the ice. We are having a spell of

The February Manifesto, with its mine of true riches, seemed to us almost
                                incomparably excellent. Every sentence it contained was read with deep satisfaction, and
                                re-read with increased interest. Were particularly pleased to hear from the Sainted
                                Father in Israel, Elder John Whiteley, whose benedictions like the refreshing dews of
                                heaven are distilled upon all, and whose invocations will not fail to reach the
                                Omnipotent Father, who gives heed to the prayers of the righteous. Home Notes are always

                                of the day was greatly enhanced by their presence, and the spiritual power, love and
                                strength they were able to administer, gave evidence that they walked with God. At
                                present date there is good sleighing in Pittsfield city, but in the hill towns of this
                                section, the highways are more or less blocked with snow. There has been nearly two
                                hundred tons of ice harvested in the Society, preparatory to the coming warm season,
                                which will soon be with us. It is presumed that a new cold-storage and ice house in
                                connection, will be erected here in the Church family, in the course of the season, with
                                nriny, if not all the modern improvements. The sound of the whistle was again heard at
                                our Ore mine near Christmas day after a silence of nearly seven months duration. Owing
                                to the condition of our country, and the stagnation in business, they are now mining

                                service to hear the wise counsel from one of the Elders, urging the importance of
                                laboring for a spirit of charity and forgiveness. To enter the New Year with the
                                resolution to leave old things and press onward and upward into an ever increasing
                                spiritual growth. We enjoy the ministration of, and our communion with our beloved
                                Ministry, also the gospel relationship of Brothers and Sisters is more fully understood
                                and deeply appreciated than of yore. May we walk with an humble and pure heart that the
                                divine Spirit may abide with us. Winter, while we have had some stormy days, has not
                                been as cold, nor has as much snow fallen as during the previous winter. At present it
                                is very unevenly distributed. Large drifts in some places and in others the earth may be
                                seen. We conclude there is much good sense in the remark of our colored friend that he
                                "ought to be thankful for any kind of weather." We are striving to keep our lamps
                                trimmed and burning that our light may shine that all men may see it. By a spirit of

                                absence of general illness during the winter months has hardly been realized in this
                                vicinity since the advent of "La Grippe." Death, the angel Reaper has indeed visited us,
                                but with one exception, (that of our precious Sister, Helen Taber,) his selections were
                                persons advanced in age, and perchance ripe for his sickle as well as ready for the
                                transition to the "Better Land." While holding them in loving remembrance we are under
                                still greater obligations to perform our duty to the living. With us, the problem of how
                                to make the best use of time is an important one. We often find ourselves subject to the
                                fluctuations of the present social and political elements, hence realize to some extent
                                the straitened circumstances of the world's workers. Yet honest industry brings its
                                reward, and agreeably to the counsel of Mother Ann with "hands to work and heart to God"
                                we hope to earn our daily bread. Our active farmers have already started the early
                                potatoes within doors. Work is also being carried forward at the saw-mill, it having
                                heretofore been delayed on account of scarcity of water. The continuous snows of the
                                season have proved a great blessing in water supplies. For all the uncounted benelits we
                                receive we daily thank our Heavenly Father, and in his blessing will continue to work
                                and pray.

                                them at the rate of ten machines a day. We hope to have them all completed by the time
                                the maples are ready for the sugar harvest. Small orders for sweaters come in now and
                                then; also an occasional order of custom shirts. While not all we could wish, still,
                                "small favors are thankfully received." Our Second family Brethren and Sisters have now
                                all become members of the Church and North families, and the buildings are vacant for
                                the first time in a century. We have moved over one hundred and twenty-five loads of
                                household articles and there are many more to follow. Elder William Wilson has gone to
                                New York to endeavor to effect a sale of their large farm. We are all enjoying average

                                excellent discourse of the character language of the Believer. It was stated that its
                                worth in soul growth could not be fully known until the effects appeared. Who can
                                question the efficacy of refined language as being other than an impetus to kouI
                                goodness, and should we not use the best to illustrate the glory of life? Minds like
                                temperaments vary, science, doctrine and philosophy have their students and admirers,
                                and lovely nature gives a hearty amen to all. We should not simply be theological pens
                                containing only religious ideas, but like nature's ex-<pb n="72" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> 72 THE

                                organic part of our being. Nature re-echoes her notes of approval that as a variety of
                                flowers adds cheerfulness to life, so variety of gifts adds usefulness. We can not
                                disconnect one essential moral, social or temporal block from our structure, but we can
                                add thereunto. Therefore, as good language is the filter of refinement, so is broad
                                mindedness the open door to greater works of righteousness. We are pleased to record a
                                visit from Elder Isaac Anstatt. His presence was an inspiration of cheerfulness and his
                                encouraging counsels to the young were impressive, being created by a union of love and
                                sympathy, qualities which give tone and vivacity to life. In enumerating life's
                                blessings, we deem it worthy of note, that we are so situated that throughout the entire
                                year we can meet for soul devotion with the Church family. Long would pen linger upon
                                the theme of "Home, sweet home," as thoughts of the wretchedness abroad, which is being
                                lessened by noble men and women, come to us, but space is too precious for mental story
                                or written comparison. We are enjoying good health, have a large yard of wood nicely
                                stored for another cold season, and a good crop of ice sixteen inches thick, for the
                                summer. As the command of God's Church is to "study the creation of souls" and win them
                                to Christ, may we be ".doers of the word and not hearers only." George H.

                                having some snow, about four inches fell a few days ago. Our winter has been very open
                                admitting of a great deal of work that will help along when spring comes. We are putting
                                up about one hundred and twenty-five rods of picket fence. We also had eleven hundred
                                locust posts cut this fall. Eldress Hester Frost and Sister Harriet Snyder have made a
                                short visit to Union Village, O. We had the company of Br. Lawrence Oscar for a few days
                                from the same Society. We are preparing to put out 1,000 raspberry plants, 500
                                blackberry and some currants this spring. Health of Society very good for which we feel

                            of mine by any means for really to tell you the truth, any one of the so-called 'trades'
                            would have suited me much better; but through some means, or other, which I do not care to
                            mention, I was brought up upon a farm of about four hundred acres, where I have spent a
                            goodly number of my days as a farmer, and have learned many useful things. I propose to give
                            you a sketch of the year's work on a farm situated on a side hill, and remarkable for the
                            quantity not quality of stones thereon. In the spring, sowing and planting must be done;
                            There are oats, wheat, corn, pctatoes, peas, beans, cabbages, beets and several other
                            things, all of which ought to be planted on the same day, and if it is not enough to make
                            any one's head whirl, to think where to start, then I will give up. After sowing and
                            planting comes that delightful job of weeding, getting down on your knees and scratching the
                            dirt over with a bent knife. Then the cultivating must be done, and what delightful work it
                            is. Occasionally one gets a rap in the ribs, by the handles of the cultivator. I have had a
                            little experience of this sort myself. Once when cultivating potatoes, the cultivator struck
                            against a fine specimen of concreted, earthy mineral matter, which geologists are so much
                                interested<pb n="73" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 73 in; it is not I"that would go hunting
                            for them, I have seen enough of them already. It threw the cultivator out of the ground, the
                            handles striking me with great force, laid me in a very humiliating position. I at once
                            resolved not to be baffled by so small an offense, and arose, feeling myself master of the
                            situation, and felt around in my mouth to see if there was any room for false teeth. I soon
                            discovered that two of my teeth were loosened, and my lips growing so large that I could
                            hardly speak. This is but a small affair and the work must go on, there is no time to lose
                            on a farm, especially in the spring, nor for that matter in any season. One scarcely gets
                            ready for it, before haying and harvesting time is right at hand,and then we hear nothing
                            but the song of the mowers and reapers; and O what a busy time this is! At this season we
                            often have the pleasure of working till eight and nine o'clock at night, getting in hay and
                            grain. By this time we feel like bidding a hasty farewell to the day, to go in search of
                            dream-land, which we are pretty sure of finding. No wonder so many boys and men get tired of
                            farming. I should think it was enough to discourage a cast-iron man. When expecting a good
                            crop of oats, say about forty-five bushels to the acre or thirty bushels of wheat to the
                            acre, he finds it about two-thirds Canada thistles, all to be reaped and bound by hand. This
                            however is not the case with us at the present time, as we have a good reaper and binder,
                            but many farmers have not the means to get one, while there are others who have the money to
                            do with, but are too stingy. They would rather stick to the old-fashioned way, than to spend
                            their money for new-fangled things. Their backs try hard to have them understand that they
                            will not endure this kind of usage very long, but the warning is not heeded. Their hands are
                            full of thistles and they: must feel the pricks. But then this gives them something to do on
                            Sunday. Picking thistles out of the hands is not breaking the Sabbath, you know. Then the
                            ensilage must be taken care of, and the thrashing done. This is the worst of all, but it is
                            a short job lasting only about a week, and then we forget all about it. Our next delightful
                            business is to draw manure and plough about fifty acres of land. When November winds are
                            blowing, we begin to think there must be some chopping done, and I tell you what, it makes
                            me scratch my head, when I think of chopping about eighty cords of wood on a bleak mountain,
                            where there are no roads fit for a team to travel on, and all this wood to be brought home.
                            It is a long, hard task, I might as well say. Just think how any one of you would like to
                            start off in the morning for the woods, with dinner pail and ax, the mercury about 10 deg.
                            below zero and a good, brisk north wind blowing, and every step of the way up a steep hill,
                            and a glare of ice; Let me ask you, would you call this a real pleasure trip? By the time
                            one is ready to eat his dinner his appetite is about as keen as the north wind. If one could
                            only dress like an Esquimau, I think it would be a good thing for this kind of business in
                            this climate. Drawing home the logs is not so very disagreeable, providing you have a lively
                            team of horses, that can keep step to the music of a goodly number of sleigh-bells, as they
                            jingle in the frosty air. If there were no horses, farming would be intolerable; but with an
                            active team and a cheerful heart, this kind of work goes on much better. If freed from
                            hirelings, we may find real enjoyment in working for our Brethren and Sisters, even on a
                            stony farm; risking frosts early and late, too much rain, or not enough, heavy winds,
                            hailstorms, etc., etc. Canaan, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="They are never alone..." TEIform="index"/>They are never alone...

                            years instead of getting all the enjoyment possible out of the present. It is well to
                            remember that the time will never come, in this world, when we shall have every thing we
                            want, just where and when we want it. The only way to be happy is to enjoy all we have to
                            the utmost as we go along. It is right to lay up for old age in youth; right to prepare for
                            a rainy day, but it is not right to blend all our energies to this end, and put off until
                            the future the happiness we might enjoy every day. It is far too common to see people
                            working and saving, denying themselves all recreation and many comforts to lay up money to
                            buy more land, to build a larger and finer house, or to save for their children, thinking
                            that when they have accomplished this they will be happy and begin to take comfort. The
                            hoped for point may never be attained; or, if it is, sickness or death may have come first,
                            and the dear ones whom we expected to be happy with may be gone forever. How much better to
                            use some of the good things of life as we go along, to make our humble homes as cheery and
                            bright as possible now, instead of waiting for a better house! Don't starve to-day, either
                            body, mind, or soul, thinking that you will riot to-morrow. Don't hoard and scrimp through
                            all the best years of your life, that you may be generous in your wills. Life is uncertain,
                            and it is better to make your children happy while they are under the home roof, to call to
                            that home every agency which will make their lives sweeter and better, than to deny them
                            these that you may leave them a larger bank account when you are gone."</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Child's prayer" TEIform="index"/>A CHILD'S PRAYER.</head><p TEIform="p">Dear Father, help me this to feel and know In all I say and do.� As I love well thine other

                            our highest good. The New Year calls aloud for workers, not idlers, not observers, but
                            workers in God's vineyard; workers together with him who said, "Be of good cheer I have
                            overcome." Those who would bring sheaves into the Master's garner must gather them without
                            delay. The brief working hours are few and numbered. Keapers, let us bend to our toil, and
                            win the crown. Strength for to-day is what we need, to speak a kind word and perform a good

                                    failures to meet business obligations rose to speak. The subject was, "What shall I
                                    do to be saved?" He commenced slowly to quote the words, "What shall I do to be
                                    saved?" He paused, looked around, and said again, "What shall I do to be saved?"
                                    Again, with more solemn tone he repeated the question of questions, when a voice
                                    from the assembly, in clear and distinct tones, replied, "Go and pay John Williams
                                    for that yoke of oxen." The incident stirs up solemn thought. A great many people
                                    before they can be saved, or guide others to the Savior, will have to "go and pay
                                    John Williams" the money they honestly owe him. Shrewd tricksters in the marts of
                                    the world are not shrewd enough to be dishonest at heart and retain the favor of
                                    God, who "loves purity in the inward parts." Neither can a hope of the world to come
                                    be like a slieet anchor in the soul of any one who robs God by being dishonest to
                                    his fellow-man. Thousands read no other Bible than the lives of those who profess to
                                    be following Christ's precepts in their daily lives. The greatest need of the church
                                    is true, pure, upright living�"living epistles, known and read of all men." The
                                    "square" man is the best shape. The tree is known by its fruit. "Go thcu and pay

                            </head><p TEIform="p">The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for February contains extra pages and
                                exceptionally varied and interesting matter. Dr. H. S. Drayton in the illustrated
                                opening article learnedly discusses the "Brain of Woman Relatively," and throws a clear
                                lifiht upon that much mooted question. Dr. Edgar C. Beall's phrenograph of William Dean
                                Howells, the famous novelist, from a personal examination, is an artistic pen picture
                                and also closely analytical. Prof. Nelson Sizer continues his series, "How to Study
                                Strangers," and contributes also a phrenological description of the well-known humorist,
                                Marshall P. Wilder, from an examination. This will prove interesting as an echo from the
                                consultation room of the veteran character reader. Horace Mann, one of the most eminent
                                educators of America, is the subject of a sketch by Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells, in
                                which the phrenological views and wonderful labors of the great philanthropist are
                                appreciatively set forth. Child culture and hygiene receive attention as usual. The
                                editorial columns contain an important testimonial from Dr. Lyman Abbott in favor of
                                phrenology. Character sketches of Dr. Parkhurst, Supt. Byrnes, District Attorney
                                Fellows, andDelancy Nicoll of New York, also Master Workman Sovereign, besides the field
                                notes, etc., are new and attractive features. Price, 15cts; $1.50 a year. Address Fowler

                                acknowledge to me her safe arrival at her home after visiting me, writes Mrs. Lyman
                                Abbott in the February Ladies' Home Journal. The "bread and butter letter," as it is
                                sometimes called, because it is supposed to be an expression of thanks for what bread
                                and butter stands for, should be written within twenty-four hours after arrival at one's
                                destination, to the hostess whose hospitality one has been enjoying. It is not quite
                                enough for a young man who has been visiting his college mate to write to him alone;
                                courtesy calls him to send at least a brief note to his friend's mother, or the lady
                                taking her place. You think it is not an easy thing to do, and it is not altogether if
                                you try to make your note unique and different from others, but the simplest way is the
                                best way, and if you have had a pleasant time say so. An agreeable incident of your
                                journey, or a few lines about the circumstances into which you have gone, will make a
                                letter which your hostess will enjoy, and she will set you down in her selected list of
                                well-bred young people. Besides that, you will have the consciousness that you have been
                                thoughtful of another's feelings, and have not been guilty of the appearance of
                                ingratitude.</p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="New England Magazine" TEIform="index"/>The New England Magazine
