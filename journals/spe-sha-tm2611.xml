The American Literary Exchange. This
enterprise, recently started in New York, will
interest a vast number of readers. It undertakes to place, at the nominal cost of one cent
to three cents a day, better reading facilities
within reach of every home, anywhere in the
United States, than have heretofore been given by more than a few very large libraries in
the principal citiesin fact, to supply any
proper book published. It does this by means
of a system of exchanges, through Book Clubs
and local Lending Libraries to be located in
every city and village. Obviously one book
at a time is all any one can read ; so if lie can
only exchange that, when read, for another
which be wants, and so on indefinitely, the
whole world of literature is open to any one.
And why not, if a medium of exchange between readers is offered, since the cost of
wear, and the cost of transportation, in large
quantity, are both trifling matters? Those
who want further information, and those who
would like to promote such a work by organ
izing clubs or acting as local agents, can bave
particulars free by addressing The American
Literary Exchange, John B. Alden Manager,
10 and 12 Vandewater St., New York. Books
are loaned, sold or exchanged. A large catalogue will be sent for two cents postage.
Ignace Padebewski has written a new minuet for the piano, which he has dedicated to
his American admirers and given the signifi
cant name of Menuet Modern." He regards
the new composition as his bent, and believes
that it will meet with greater popular favor
than his "Menuet a L'Antique," written in
1883, of which over seven million copies were
sold in a single year. It is the first minuet written by Paderewski since "L'Antique," and was
composed by the famous pianist expressly
for The Ladies'' Home Journal, and will appear
in the October issue.
Humanity, for October is an interesting
number. Humanity and the Jew, is a lesson for the people now on earth, and will have
many careful readers. Carlyle and Modern
Democracy; An Unpublished Poem; Window Pictures and Humanity are all good,
but Honest Jo in Politicswill no doubt be the
experience of a large class of men who are
marching to the polls. Published at Kansas
City, Mo.   Price 50 cents a year.
The Outlook for September, is an illustrated number of this beautiful magazine. The
Spectator on the Great Lakes, is beautifully
descriptive of that part of the country, and
the illustrations make it much more interesting.
A very nicely printed portrait of John H.
Vincent. The founder of the Chautauqua
Movement, stand at the head of an article
written by Win. R. Harper D. D.   This valuable article is liberally illustrated and introduces us to the home of Bishop Vincent and
into his study and parlor, without even the
necessity of a guide.
The artist has also given to us the Recitation
Hall, tlie landing Pier, the Hall in the Grove,
and the Tent College at Chautauqua.
The Rural Church of England, by J. Cleveland Cady takes us on a very pleasant journey
and interests us not only with his written
word hut presents a line picturo of the church
of which he writes.
A visit to Mr. Barrie's mother is from the
pen of Ellen P. Cunningham, five illustrations
accompany the article.
The Children in the Public Library; by John
C. Dana will interest many readers in its care
of the children and in its illustrations.
Basket Ball at Smith College; by Elizabeth
F. Read, is an illustrated article in which
those who arc young will take special interest.
Hydrabad ; by Win. F. Dix, takts us on a
trip to southern India and his illustrations introduce us to those whose costume would
look very singular to the people of the United
States.
A large number of other articles of equal interest may be found in the Outlook, treating a
great variety of subjects. Published by the
Outlook Co. 13 Astor Place, New York.
The Crowning Sin of the Age; by Brevard
D. Sinclair. The Perversion of Marriage, is the
subject under consideration and the author of
this little work has evidently  entered upon
the'work of "fearlessly preaching the truth,"
however others might differ from him in the
illustration.The   writer   says   "It   is  not   a
pleasant task to tear aside the masks which
men  wear, and expose the rotten leprx>sy of
sin in all of its pestiferous hideousness."   It
seems like a redeeming feature in this grasping age of the world, to have a man made able
by his thought of humanity to speak words of
warning to the ignorant and no less to the
willful   transgressor   of  God's laws to man.
The  author of the  work before us, does not
hesitate to enter the church with his prophetic testimony  while   manifesting the  same
degree of zeal as he would in the home of the
Infidel or non-professor, and  says   to   every
one    that   God     "will   visit    the    iniquities
of the fathers upon the children down to the
third and fourth generations."   The Crowning
sin of the Age" should be read by every one
who has an  interest in  God's laws to man or
an interest in the peace and prosperity of the
family of man.

The Phrenological Journal and Science
of Health for Oct., presents a beautiful likeness of Prof. L.N. Fowler, who was laid to rest
on the fifth of September.
Then follows the fourth article on Phrenology and Psychology, by John W. Shall.

                            to be thankful above all creatures, and are accountable to God for these blessings we enjoy.
                            If we are unthankful for our daily and abundant blessings, we are not followers of Christ.
                            The spiritual and temporal blessings which we enjoy are the gifts of Heaven to us, we can
                            not call one of them our own and we are not certain of them from day to day." "Those things
                            which the earth brings forth are of the earth, and will yet return to its own. We can not
                            make one plant grow though we sow with great care; it is God who giveth the increase." "It
                            is our duty to humble ourselves in the sight of God, that our judgment may be taken away.
                            Let the soul seek God's mercy in humiliation before it is too late, and while we may be
                            heard ; if we are not humble and cry to God in our need, we may yet cry and not be heard. If
                            we trust to our great privilege and experience, we trust in something which will fail us.
                            Remember a haughty spirit goeth before a fall." "I hope we shall not be unthankful in the
                            midst of plenty, with a fullness of spiritual and temporal blessings on every hand." 'Many
                            precious promises are given to the faithful. Some, being darkened, think that the gospel is
                            not sufficient to save them. The gospel is not at fault, it is sufficient to save every soul
                            that will obey it. If we obtain the precious bless ngs that are promised to the willing and
                            obedient, we must NOVEMBER, <pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 170 THE MANIFESTO. gain them. We make our
                            heaven. All who are true will realize the blessing of God. God forbid that we glory, save in
                            the cross of Christ." "We must be what we profess to be, and profess to be what we really
                            are. Do not glory in a profession for it will not save you. We shall appear just what we are
                            when we enter eternity." Mother Lucy seemed to feel great anxiety for the children. She
                            would often speak of the great responsibility their guardians were under to care for their
                            daily welfare, their protection; the example before them, the language used to them; all
                            this should be the burden of those who care for them She would speak particularly to the
                            children and youth, saying, "You are young; your youth is the best and easiest time for you
                            to learn to serve God. I wish you could realize this. I pray for you often for I feel the
                            burden of your salvation, and desire you to live a life of uprightness. Those who are called
                            by the good Spirit in their youth should often return thanks to God that they are thus
                            noticed of their heavenly Father. If you do not want to do wrong, then you will do right,
                            for the master we love, we serve." "The gospel requires no more than is just, and you must
                            part with all that is contrary to its requirements. 1 do believe that every one who can
                            sense it will be thankful that they have found the blessing of God that will separate them
                            from all evil and make them acceptable before God. Love begets love. I have that love for
                            poor, lost souls that I would suffer in their stead, if this were possible. If we love the
                            gospel we shall obey it, and if we truly love God we shall serve Him." "Of all people we are
                            the most noticed of God. Shall the children of this world be before us, and appoint a day of
                            thanksgiving, and we not be able to keep it in thanksgiving? Nay, let us_keep it to God's
                            acceptance. We can do this in truth." June 11, 1820. Mother exhorted us to be spiritually
                            minded. "All who have an understanding should labor for their own spiritual food, and pray
                            for the gifts of God in their own souls. The young need to be helped, and I am able and
                            willing to bear a great deal with and for them. Yea, I am willing that they should have a
                            part of my bread, if they will be good." "I love the blessed spirit of the gifts of God.
                            They are our support day by day, and without them we should suffer hunger and have no
                            treasure in heaven."

                            tender age when the mind as readily receives good, as under other conditions it would
                            receive evil. <pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 171 Second, because what Believers taught
                            me of the practical duties of life, accorded so perfectly with what I had received from my
                            mother, that when I came to reflect upon it, I saw that mother had formed the soil in me
                            that was ready prepared to receive our gospel teaching. Third, because I could feel a
                            comfortable conscience in obeying the teaching imparted, and was troubled and harassed if I
                            did not. Fourth, because when I came to years of understanding, and the allurements of the
                            world and its freedoms appealed to me in their strongest attractions for the youthful
                            imagination, I regarded the prizes of a life that was to be eternal, too great, and the
                            chance of securing them too hazardous for me to decide what to exchange it for without
                            knowledge. For what will it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own life,
                            or soul which alone enjoys the world. Or why give the freest and freshest part of one's life
                            for a song,or for transcient joys that dance for a while like bubbles on the water, and then
                            vanish into nothingness, leaving the soul a barren, deserted waste. Would such a life be
                            free from those pleasures which leave the sting of death behind, to be withdrawn only by
                            repentance in anguish, bitter reflection and sorrow. I turned to the Source of Being, to the
                            Fountain of all Intelligence and Wisdom and asked for knowledge. I paid the price fixed, in
                            self-denials, in prayer and watching, in obedience to light as fast as received, and
                            knowledge was given me, that the best and richest purchase for which life could be given,
                            was to be gained by obedience to the gospel of Christ in Mother, as taught and delivered to
                            us by the faithful sucessors of Jesus and of Mother Ann. It was given me to know that this
                            purchase joins its possessor in spiritual communism and relationship to the mighty host of
                            prophets and martyrs, who have given their lives for the truth in all ages, whose toils for
                            the emancipation of the human mind from error, and whose sufferings for the uplifting of the
                            race from animalism and savagery, even to the laying down of their lives, have prepared the
                            way for the blessings we now enjoy. They sowed the seed, from which we reap the harvest of
                            civil and religious liberty, and other blessings. To become a living temple of purity, into
                            which the holy spirit of the eternal heavens might descend and flow forth for spiritual
                            health and cure. Jno. vii., 38, 39. I was willing to sacrifice every earthly tie and
                            selfpleasing allurement of the world, and with all the ardor I possessed, enter the
                            crucibles of the Refiner and stay there till purification was accomplished. Forty-five years
                            I have labored to practice this knowledge and add thereto, and I have not been deceived in
                            one iota thereof. I have a satisfactory possession in exchange for the life given,
                            increasing like a sum at compound interest, or like a growing crop of fruit. The fruits of
                            obedience, have been love, joy, peace, quietness, a justified conscience, assurance of
                            victory, and of life everlasting. <pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 172 THE MANIFESTO. Some will ask,
                            could not the same be accomplished in some other way or without sacrificing so much. Is not
                            some one of the other hundred ways claiming to lead to the highest goal equally safe? The
                            answer is. Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be
                            that find it. I am the way, says the anointed Jesus, and the anointed is but one. Whosoever
                            there be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he can not be my disciple. He that
                            seeketh to save his life shall lose it. He that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it
                            unto life eternal. Whosoever will or wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take
                            up his cross daily and follow me. There is but one way and one price for all. If we pay but
                            part of the price, we get but part of the purchase, or may lose the whole, and have to do
                            the work over again. If we pay the whole price, by giving all, we receive an overflowing
                            fulness of the higher, perfect and permanent inheritance, in exchange for the lower,
                            imperfect, harassing, corruptible and transient. To God be all the glory. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            order to obtain a reward. Nothing is enjoyed that is not gained by exertion. If one sits
                            with folded hands and receives treasures gained by the labor of others their value is
                            depreciated. So it is in regard to promises; to fully enjoy their benefit, we must first
                            faithfully perform our part of the contract. Even then, the reward is many times greater
                            than the conflict. There seems to be a promise for every individual and each occasion. If
                            they were given the first place in the heart and well engraved upon the mind in times of
                            trial and temptation they would shine through the darkness and many dangers would be
                            averted. It is only when they are hidden from our view by doubts and fears that we become
                            discouraged and forget they are there. Once cast aside this darkness, and diligently search
                            for these gems and we become filled with <pb n="174" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 174 THE MANIFESTO. light; our
                            hearts thrill with love at the unspeakable mercy and tender care manifested by God for his
                            children. They are like a chain ; take the Book and search for all the links that we, in our
                            carelessness, have allowed to slip. Link on link we join them, all the while feeling
                            ourselves drawn nearer and nearer to their Great and AllWise Author till we can almost feel
                            the pressure of his hand. O let us never loosen our hold on this priceless chain. Wind it
                            around us until we are firmly held by it, let not a.link be broken that would bind us to the
                            love of God. Do we feel sorely tempted, we find, "He will not suffer you to be tempted more
                            than ye are able to bear." Again, uThe Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly from
                            temptation." Do we feel that we are sometimes le t alone, let us look through the
                            darkness,there is a gleam of light. As we touch the electric current of this one, numberless
                            other lights begin to shine, and we see, "I will never leave thee comfortless, "I will never
                            leave thee nor forsake thee." "Lo, I am with thee even unto the end of the world." Do we
                            feel sometimes, in the unseen battles of the heart, that our foes are too many for our
                            strength? Brighter than the costliest gems shine the precious promises, "He that overcometh
                            shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son." "Be of good cheer, I
                            have overcome the world," and our weakness becomes strength, until we feel, like the
                            prophet, "I will trust and not be afraid." Do we feel sadness because of hopes blighted, or
                            disappointments that have come"Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord." "Rejoice
                            in the Lord alway." For the tired and care-worn we find "Come unto me, and I will give you
                            rest." "My presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest." Thus we might delve in
                            this mine of treasures much longer, obtaining rich blessing thereby. Let us commence the
                            chapter of ench day's history, by a glance at a promise, thus brightening the whole day, and
                            proving an illumination in the book of life.

                            THE MANIFESTO. 173 sions. Wnat a few generations ago would have been considered by the
                            masses as impossibilities, the present know as accomplished facts. We many times make
                            assertions that certain ideas are the operation of chimerical minds and can not be produced
                            as actualities of life. And while we have slumbered, some energetic spirit has received a
                            spark of the immortal fire, has penetrated iuto that interior chamber from which comes the
                            inspiration that giveth strength to grapple with the forces of life that before appeared
                            unconquerable; and has entered as an intrepid explorer that field which formerly was marked
                            the unknowable. And by the power of that ministration has removed the barriers that hindered
                            the admission of light, and prepared the way for still greater conquests. Whether it is
                            within the realm of the forces that appear to us to dominate and control our earthly
                            existence, or within the boundaries of our spiritual life the call is for more light. The
                            determination that is manifested to grapple with those subtle forces that apparently are
                            trying to elude the searchlight turned upon them by the advance guard of scientific research
                            is causing us to realize that the dividing line between what we term the material world and
                            the spiritual is more imaginary than real. We say that certain bodies are opaque or
                            impenetrable to light, and others are transparent. In the discovery of their existence, and
                            the development and application to beneficial uses in life of the X rays showing that those
                            subtler forces have penetrated and opened to the sight what before remained hidden. To those
                            individual lives whose spiritual development is yet dormant, the intrusion into what to them
                            appears a mysterious and forbidden realm is fraught with dangers that should be avoided. But
                            to those who have received the divine commission to grapple with those hidden forces, and to
                            illuminate the pathway upward which human life is moving, do not realize the sensation of
                            fear. Some of the so-called scientific minds in their unwillingness to recognize the fact
                            that the dominant object in investigating and developing the interior forces of life should
                            not be confined to the childish play of dealing with effects but to study and understand the
                            underlying causes, have so enshrouded their mental horizon with the mists of dogmatic
                            bigotry causing them to think that the boundaries of their vision is the outer circle of the
                            infinite universe. When the project was first being seriously considered of ocean steam
                            navigation, one of the so-called scientific men of England came forward with the statement
                            based upon what he thought actual knowledge of its power, "that what else could be done with
                            steam its use in ocean navigation was an impossibility." The doubt and uncertainty that
                            formerly existed in the ability of the human soul to understand and use those forces that
                            are so enshrouded in mystery, has given way to the feeling of wonder that they were not
                            understood before. The rapidity with which those thought forces have penetrated hu- <pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 176 THE MANIFESTO. man life, causing the development of those
                            wonderful inventions that during the past century have given such mighty power to control
                            the material elements and cause them to become the servants of man instead of his master,
                            has c ased to excite wonder. The question now is, should not the way also be made clear so
                            that the moral and spiritual life could receive its full portion of that light which has so
                            wonderfull}? illuminated the material side? Nothing short of a full presentation of the
                            truth will satisfy the piogivssive soul after it has received a portion of the divine light.
                            The quickening of the moral tone of society on many questions that formerly it was at least
                            indifferent, and insisting that light shall be turned upon the causes that have been
                            productive of the false conditions of life under which it has been living, and demanding
                            their removal, is evidence to prove the fact that darkness is only a negation, that it can
                            not supply that vital force of life which only is able to cause a growth to higher
                            conditions. Above the storms and convulsions which at times assail our globe and cause such
                            great destruction to the material interests of life, are the mighty constellations that for
                            ages have shone with undiminished splendor and sent their light earthward. So, superior and
                            above the upheavals that at times are shaking the religious and political world, is that
                            Divine power which is the source of all light and life, and is using those conditions as a
                            means to clear the avenues through which may come that light which will enable the prophetic
                            prediction to be verified. "I will shake all nations, and the desire of all the nations
                            shall come ; and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord." Shakers, N.

                            more like a grand reunion or a genuine love-feast; a love that will abide forever. This is
                            not a sad funeral although we have lost a true friend, a good brother and a kind father. We
                            shall continue to love and revere his name. All were gentle and kind to Father William and
                            we know it is well with him. We may, sometimes, have cloudy days and if it were not so we
                            would not be well tried like silver, and tempered like fine steel. The dews of heaven come
                            for a purpose, and the heart-aches and trials that surround us, if patiently borne, will
                            subdue and soften our lives, "For the lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the Lord
                            alone shall be exalted." The strong must bear the infirmities of the weak and this was the
                            life work of Brother William. As a well ripened sheaf he has been garnered at an appropriate
                            season of the year for this event. He was a praying man, and <pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 177 was never too old to bend the knee. For a long time he has been ready, but
                            not anxious for the change. Although we may love this perishable earth of which we are in
                            part composed, do we love it better than that anticipated part of immortality? If we did not
                            cling to this earth life and all that there is in it, not many of us would greet old age. If
                            we love life and live wisely we will, no doubt, grow old in years. If we go the way of the
                            ungodly, our days will not be long in the land that has been given to us. Our Brother's
                            mission has been fulfilled and many have been benefited by it. Many have visited him in his
                            advanced age and realized of a truth that from his youth up, all these years have been years
                            of fidelity,a loyalty to the cause of his own choosing. "They are passing away those aged
                            and beloved parents who have long stood on the heights of Ziou, messengers of peace and

                                past, and as the whole of it will soon follow the retinue of its venerable predecessors,
                                it becomes us, as pupils of Wisdom, to take some note of Time's important events that
                                have transpired through these nine divisions of the present year. Believers have had
                                dispensations of adversity and prosperity, which like Joseph's coat, has been of many
                                colors. Our Pleasant Hill Community have been sorely bitten by that viperborrowing money
                                and giving notes; and the courts have saddled upon the innocent sufferers a heavy load
                                of indebtedness. When will business managers cease to violate our Covenant, by giving
                                notes, which they should know is a sin against Community. Mt. Lebanon, as well as
                                Pleasant Hill, has had its share of trouble. When will all the directors of our
                                Societies truly feel the weighty responsibility of their offices and act as though they
                                knew that the rods of avenging justice were constantly held over their heads, to be used
                                executively in case of violation of trust. Palpable misconduct is soon spread throughout
                                the land, so I will refrain from making individual specifications. With all the
                                vicissitudes of the year that have been unpleasant, we have been abundantly blessed,
                                both temporally and spiritually. The earth has yielded abundantly of substantial fruits
                                so that our tables have been abundantly, if not lavishly supplied. Our pear crop has
                                been very scant. Peaches, plums and cherries have been a failure, but our cultivated
                                strawberries, raspberries and blackberries have been ample. Wild huckleberries have been
                                superabundant. The Church family have gathered twenty-one bushels. The other families
                                have gathered about twenty-five bushels. We have gathered over 200 bu. of cranberries,
                                and when the entire crop is in, there will be fully 300 bu. Thus far we have put down
                                213 gallons of stewed tomatoes for family use, and by the close of to-day we shall have
                                over 400 gallons put up in tin cans for sale to supply an order, when completed, of 600

                                barrels of fall apples have been shipped to England. Some men bought and paid for them
                                so we run no risk. There is an inventor in Brooklyn, L. I.James Greshamwho is building a

                                by gospel relations from New Hampshire, Enfield, Conn., and Colonie, N. Y., all of which
                                has made tbe bonds of our spiritual union stronger with the several Communities. Our

                                that which could not have been explained to him. It was the inner spiritual life which
                                touched a chord in his soul that vibrated through his being. Said he would go from us as
                                a missionary, and perhaps would come again knocking at our door asking permanent
                                admission. He has since published an article concerning his visit. Thus we have had many
                                occasions to let our light shine. May we ever be prepared to give the bread of life to
                                the hungry, water to the thirsty and clothe the spirit with that "love that knoweth no

                                the reapers are keeping time to the music. Already one thousand bushels of apples have
                                been gathered and many trees are still heavily laden. The past month our doors have been
                                opened to many transient visitors, among the number are some of much interest. The Dane

                                Christ. His discourse was edifying. He brought to bear upon the minds of the
                                congregation that within each heart were two elements, striving for mastery. If through
                                self-will Cesar ascends the throne of the soul then Christ is crucified, but if by
                                integrity and fortitude Cesar is dethroned then Christ reigns and the "Christian's
                                Triumph" is begun. Sept. 13th two members of the Sorosis, New York; Augusta Raymond
                                Kidder and Sophia Curtis, sought opportunity to attend our Sunday service. They seemed

A glance at the calendar tells us that it is again time for our monthly call

                                and the soul is continually expanding or contracting, the outward forms may be similar
                                to those of years ago. So it is in our quiet home. Day succeeds night, bringing its
                                duties to be performed. The seasons come and go in their prescribed order, each
                                fulfilling its particular mission, and the harvest follows the sowing. But as "Nature
                                abhors a vacuum," and, "The secret of life is action," so we daily endeavor to improve
                                our surroundings, and ourselves, that we may say with the minister of old, "I am nearer
                                the kingdom now than when I first believed." We have recently been blessed by the

                                for the elevation of the needy, it bespeaks volumes of praise to the doers of the work
                                ai well as the hearers of the word of salvation. It is pleasant to realize that the old
                                fence of exclusiveness that once hedged in the various churches is crumbling away, and
                                the living vines of truth are drawing mankind out of the furrows of dogmatic narrowness
                                into the broad fields of Christian duty. During the pleasant month of September we
                                enjoyed a feast of love and soul communion with Sisters Sarah Barker and Elmira

                                our journey and that we are rapidly approaching the closing of the year. The harvesters
                                are industriously engaged in securing all that may be held for use during the long
                                northern winter, and indeed, a rigid economy must be exercised in this respect in order
                                that the proffered supply might equal the daily demand. In many things the earth in thiB

                                opportunities given for the advancement of the truths of the higher life. Those who have
                                recei ved a portion of this light, should let their light so shine that others may see
                                it and be led to glorify God. When we look around us and see the many who have laid up
                                treasures where decay can not affect them and are nearing the time when they will lay
                                all earthly burdens down; we ask "who will hold the virgin standard as high as those
                                saints who have gone on before?" That it will be sustained we know, and though creeds,
                                empires and systems may pass away., yet the efforts that have been and are being made,
                                to spiritualize human life, have not been sown on the desert air but by accumulation
                                will become irresistible in their uplifting power. It may be largely owing to
                                temperament but we can not coincide with Bryant that "autumn is a melancholy season."
                                After the toils of spring and summer to produce the fruits and vegetables, comes the
                                best of all, autumn. Now we can enjoy the fruits of our labors: and life, manifested in
                                the insect and vegetable departments of nature's kingdom, seem to say, "now let us
                                rest." In the tempernte latitudes of the earth old winter with his rough and ready ways
                                givt s us variety and causes us to appreciate the returns of spring. Through this

                                Saratoga County, the apr ple crop is enormous. Many trees are so loaded that in spite of
                                props they are prostrate on the ground with tilth1 burden of fruit. We had a call from
                                our Br. George H. Baxter of Enfield, N. H. We have observed that the visits of our
                                gospel friends the past season have been like angel visits short, but sweet, but we will
                                be thankful for small favors. The door will always stand ajar and the welcome signal

"A hot bath, a stroll in the
                                fresh air, shampooing the head in weak soda-water, of a timely nap in a cool, quiet room
                                will sometimes stop a nervous headache," writes Dr. B. F. Herrick in August Ladies' Home
                                Journal. "When overfatigued from shopping or sight seeing, a sponge dipped in very hot
                                water and pressed repeatedly over the back of the neck between the ears will be found
                                exceedingly refreshing, especially if the face and temples are afterward subjected to
                                the same treatment. Neuralgia is caused not only by cold air but by acidity of the
                                stomach, starved nerves, imperfect teeth, or by indolence combined with a too generous
                                diet. Heat is the best and quickest cure for this distressing pain. A hot flat-iron,
                                passed rapidly and deftly over several folds of flannel laid on the affected spot, will
                                often give relief in less than ten minutes, without the aid of medicine. Hot
                                fermentations are of equal value; though when the skin is very tender it is more
                                advisable to use dry heat, nothing being better for the purpose than bags of heated
                                salt, flour or sand, which retain warmth for a long time. Cold water, applied by the
                                finger tips to the nerves in front of the ear, has been known to dispel neuralgic pains
                                like magic. When caused by acidity a dose of j charcoal or soda will usually act as a
                                corrective. Sick headache is accompanied by bilious symptoms, and attacks usually come
                                on when the person is overtired or below par physically. This is a disease of the first
                                half of life, and often stops of its own accord after middle age. A careful diet is
                                impernthe in every case, sweetmeats and pastry being especially pernicious. "Eating
                                heartily when very tired, late dinners, eating irregularly, insufficient mastication or
                                too much animal food, especially in the spring or during the hot weather, are frequent
                                causes of indigestion, causing headaches by reflex action."</p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Remedy for dandruff" TEIform="index"/>A Remedy for Dandruff.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">Having suffered much inconvenience from dandruff, and having resorted to many

                                        very sensibly thinner, was finally induced, from my knowledge of the frequent
                                        efficacy of sulphur in certain cutaneous affections, to try a preparation of an
                                        ounce of the flowers of sulphur in a quart of water, as follows, with the
                                        happiest results. The sulphur was repeatedly agitated in the water during
                                        intervals of a few hours, and the clear liquid then poured off, with which the

                                        dissappeared, and the hair became soft and glossy. After discontinuing the
                                        treatment for eighteen months there is no return of the disease. The remedy is

                                    offered him an article for the Evening Post. My young friend, I observe that you
                                    have used several French expressions in your article. I think, if you will study the
                                    English language, that you will rind it capable of expressing all the ideas you may
                                    have. I have always found it so, and in all that I have written I do not recall an
                                    instance where I was tempted to use a foreign word, but that, on searching, I found
                                    a better one in my own language. Be simple, unaffected; be honest in your speaking
                                    and writing. Never use a long word when a short one will do. Call a spade a spade,
                                    not a well-known, oblong instrument of manual industry; let a home be a home, not a
                                    residence; a place a place, not a locality, and so of the rest. Where a short word
                                    will do, you lose by using a long one. You lose in clearness; you lose in honest
                                    expression of your meaning, and in the estimation of all men who are competent to
                                    judge, you will lose in reputation for ability. The only true way to shine even in
                                    this false world, is to be modest, unassuming. Falsehood may be a very thick crust,
                                    but in the course of time will find a place to break through. Elegance of language
                                    may not be in the power of all of us, but simplicity and straight-forwardness are.
                                    Write much as you would speak; speak as you think. If with your inferior, speak no
                                    coarser than usual; if with your superior speak no finer. Be what you say, and
                                    within the rules of prudence. No one ever was a gainer by singularity of words or in
                                    pronunciation. The truly wise man will so speak that no one will observe how he
                                    speaks. A man may show great knowledge of chemistry by carrying about bladders of
                                    strange gases to breathe, but he will enjoy better health, and find more time for
                                    business, who lives on common air. Sidney Smith once remarked: After you have
                                    written an article, take your pen and strike out half of the words, and you will be
                                    surprised to see how much stronger it is.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>�Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="There is no failure..."

A Book of Shaker Poetry, called "Mount
Lebanon Cedar Boughs" issued by the Sisters
of the North Family at Mount Lebanon, New

Frederick W. Evans was so long a ruling spirit. Among these Shaker women there is considerable literary talent, one of the Sisters being Miss Cecelia DeVere, the sister of Miss
Mary Ainge DeVere, so well known to magazine readers by her nom de plume of "Madeline Bridges." Miss DeVere, like her sister,
has written some exceedingly clever verse,
and her work is well represented in the volume. All the poems in the book are reflective
of the simple life of the Shaker community,
