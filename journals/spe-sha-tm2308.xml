A   THOUSAND TUNES.
That's a large number, but the Symphonion plays it. The Symph< mion is an unlimiU d
music box instead of a cylinder playing from
one to six airs. The Symphonion uses steel
plates as shown herewith.
These plates revolve and their teeth strike
the teeth of the steel combs, thus producing
the tones. Plates are changed in a moment.
They may be bought by the hundreds and each
plate represents a different tune. One may
fhus have sacred music, old favorites and latst songs of the day, as he chooses.
The Symphonion is simple in construction
and does not get out of order, as the old fashion music boxes always do. They are rich and
melodious in tone and not the least expensive.
We are headquarters for the trade and are
prepared to quote lower prices than ever betoie with all the latest improvements.

                            No. 2</head><p TEIform="p">When I arrived at Watervliet, where they lived, I was received with great kindness. The
                            leader of this people was Ann Lee, whom they called Mother ; and truly she seemed like a
                            mother. Her countenance, and the countenances of those who stood as witnesses with her,
                            shone with brightness and glory, as evidently as the shining of the sun upon clear water.
                            This confirmed me that the glory of God was upon them. The first words I recollect hearing
                            from Mother Ann were, "James, take this man and let him open his mind." This was just what I
                            desired; and by this I perceived that she knew the state of my mind. I opened my mind and
                            confessed my sins, freely and honestly, before Elder James, as a witness of God. I had
                            frequently confessed my sins to God in secret, as many others do ; and in conformity to the
                            practice of public preachers in antichrist's kingdom, I had frequently, in public, confessed
                            myself and the congregation to be great sinners. But in all this I brought nothing to light,
                            nor did I find any abiding releasement of soul. The burden of my sins returned upon me, and
                            condemnation still continued. I was therefore convinced that I did not confess to God's
                            acceptance: for I read, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
                            sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John i., 10. This promise I had never
                            before found verified. But now, by bringing my deeds to the light, I found the promise of
                            God fulfilled: for I felt entirely released from the burden of sin. All condemnation and
                            despair were entirely taken away, and my soul was filled with heavenly peace and comfort,
                            accompanied with a godly sorrow and repentance for sin. 1 tarried about a week, and
                            witnessed many beautiful displays of divine power and goodness, and heard many precious
                            instructions and exhortations. Here my soul received the precious "unction of the Holy One,"
                            which is the baptism of the Spirit, and by which I knew the spiritual things of God, which
                            can not be understood nor discerned by the natural man. This produced in me many heavenly
                            gifts, and many operations of Divine Power. Here I obtained the full anAUGUST,<pb n="178" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 178 THE MANIFESTO. swer of my former prayers; for I had now lived to see the
                            second coming of Christ, and the commencement of his kingdom on earth. In this I was
                            confirmed beyond a doubt. I left them with great reluctance; and nothing but my duty to my
                            family, enjoined by Mother Ann's counsel, could have reconciled my feelings to retire from a
                            place and a people so evidently filled with the Spirit of Christ, and so blessed with the
                            Divine presence. I returned to my family, and felt myself blessed in my obedience to Mother
                            Ann's testimony, and daily enjoyed the presence of God, and felt the powerful influences of
                            his Spirit. And I have reason to bless God that my wife and children all embraced the same
                            testimony of the gospel, and, with the exception of one daughter, who died firm in the
                            faith, they are all now living in the Society, and continue in faithful obedience to the
                            gospel. In September following, after Mother and the Elders, and a number of the leading
                            Brethren were imprisoned in Albany, I was attending a meeting on the Sabbath, at Dr. Isaac
                            Harlow's, with my family and a consider able number of the Brethren and Sisters ; and while
                            we were on our knees, in prayer to God, a mob rushed into the house, headed by the very one
                            who had stirred up the persecution against Mother and the Elders, and caused their
                            imprisonment. They seized and dragged me out of the house, and carried me off to the house
                            of their champion. The next morning they made a pretence of trying me before one Adgate, who
                            had been a justice of the peace under the royal government. Here I was accused of speaking
                            against the war; and it was also alleged that Mother and the Elders were British emissaries
                            in disguise, who were exciting their hearers against the war. After this mock trial, (for I
                            can call it nothing else,) I was hurried off to Albany, to be tried before the commissioners
                            who composed the Board of War. Here I was again charged with maintaining the principles of
                            Ann Lee against the lawfulness of war. Such principles, they contended, were detrimental to
                            the cause of the country, which was then engaged in the arduous struggle for liberty,
                            against a powerful enemy, and forbid my preaching such doctrine. I replied, "I shall speak
                            what God gives me to speak; for I feel it my duty to obey God rather than man. I did not
                            receive the testimony against war from Ann Lee ; but was taught by the revelation of God,
                            before I ever saw Ana Lee, that the followers of Christ could have nothing to do with wars
                            and fightings." This declaration was so offensive to the commissioners, that they gave
                            orders for my imprisonment, declaring at the same time, that the Elect Lady was going to be
                            banished to the British army in New York. I replied "The Elect Lady she is, indeed and in
                            truth ; but whether she sinks or swims, I know the work is of God." They would not suffer me
                            to be imprisoned with Mother and the Elders; I was therefore confined in the jail of the old
                            City Hall. After ten days imprisonment, I was set at liberty through the intercession<pb n="179" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 179 of my brother, who produced many certificates from
                            respectable characters, of my former zeal in the cause of my country. From all the
                            proceedings of these inveterate persecutors, it appeared evident that the clamorous charges
                            of British emissaries and traitors to the country, which were raised against the leaders of
                            the Society, were merely a pretext, under which they intended to effect the destruction of
                            the Society, by securing the leaders and suppressing their testimony. But in this they were
                            disappointed; for many who received intelligence of these things, flocked to hear the
                            testimony of a people who were persecuted and imprisoned for the cause of righteousness and
                            peace. So that in the event, the very means they had taken to prevent the spreading of the
                            gospel, produced a far more extensive increase. Thus the overruling providence of God
                            "caused the wratn of man to praise him." Being now in the eighty-fourth year of my age, and
                            on the verge of eternity, I feel it my duty to leave behind me a testimony of my experience,
                            for the benefit of all who are seeking, as I once was, to find religion in the dark pages of
                            ecclesiastical theology, written in the dark kingdom of antichrist, by the blind guides of a
                            bigoted priesthood. And as I feel a sense of my solemn responsibility to a just and holy
                            God, I can have no possible wish nor motive to deceive my fellow-creatures, in any manner
                            whatever. I can therefore assure every candid inquirer after truth, that I could never find
                            the work of salvation, nor the life and power of religion, which is the essence of the
                            gospel, by all my labors and researches, until I found the present testimony of the gospel,
                            which was brought to light by Mother Ann Lee. And concerning her testimony, I can truly say,
                            it is "the power of God unto salvation :" for such it has proved itself by its effects. It
                            has purified my soul from sin, and saved me from the corrupt propensities of an evil nature.
                            It has afforded me justification and peace for nearly forty-seven years. Through this gospel
                            I have received many precious gifts, and many divine manifestations. When I first embraced
                            this testimony, I was baptized with the spirit of humiliation, which brought me under many
                            mortifying and humiliating signs and operations, tending to mortify and crucify the pride of
                            my nature, and show me the folly and vanity of relying on my literary and scientific
                            acquirements to teach the way of salvation, or preach the gospel of Christ. These
                            humiliating operations of the Spirit completely humbled the pride of my education, and
                            prostrated in the dust my exalted station among men. I then felt, by actual experience, the
                            force and power of the prophet's words: "The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
                            haughtiness of men shall be made low ; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day."
                            Isa. ii., 17. And this every exalted soul must yet feel and experience, before he can be
                            prepared to enter the kingdom of heaven. By these humiliating scenes, the loftiness of my
                            spirit was abased, and 1 was effectually brought down into a humble frame of mind ; so that
                            I could truly feel the meek and<pb n="180" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 180 THE MANIFESTO. lowly Spirit of
                            Christ, and profit by the simplicity of the gospel, which, according to the testimony of
                            Jesus Christ, is received by babes, rather than by the learned Rabbins and great ones of the
                            earth. After this, my soul was blessed with many joyful and heavenly gifts of God ; such as
                            gifts of revelation and prophecy, which have actually come to pass ; discerning of spirits ;
                            so that I could many times discern the secret state of souls : also divers kinds of tongues
                            and signs; and many glorious and heavenly visions, by which the spiritual world was brought,
                            as it were, into open view to my spiritual sight. Concerning the existence of such gifts, in
                            this day, I well know that a spirit of scepticism prevails almost universally, both among
                            professors and profane, and especially among the learned priesthood. They are taught to
                            believe that there can be no such gifts in this day, nor any divine or supernatural
                            inspiration; because they all ceased with the primitive Church. It is true that when the
                            primitive Church lost the life and spirit of Christ, and fell back into the spirit of the
                            world, these gifts actually died away. But a restoration was promised, which was to take
                            place when the true Church should rise in the spirit and life of Christ: for these gifts are
                            the life of the soul, and a seal to the testimony of the true gospel. I was formerly taught,
                            agreeable to the prevailing opinion, that those gifts had ceased, and were no more to be
                            expected. Accordingly I strove to believe it, until I was convinced to the contrary by
                            actual experience. I have myself experienced many such gifts; I have been an eye and ear
                            witness of many such in Mother and the Elders ; and many such have I known to take place in
                            the Church, from time to time, down to this day. Can I then disbelieve the sight of my own
                            eyes, the hearing of my own ears, the feelings of my own senses, or the inspirations of
                            Divine light in my own soul? I can not. The evidenco of these things is as clear to me as
                            that of my own existence. It is an immutable truth, established by the eternal principles of
                            heaven, that without the inspiration and gifts of the Holy Spirit, no soul can ever find
                            salvation. These gifts, being the very essence of divine life, are as important to the
                            spiritual life of the soul, as the inspiration of the natural air is to the natural life of
                            the body. Why then will mankind still cleave to an erroneous and blind tradition, which can
                            not be maintained by scripture nor reason? 0, ye professors of the divine religion of Jesus
                            Christ! when will ye cease to believe in the soul-darkening doctrines of men, and the
                            blinding creeds of human invention? Is not God "the same yesterday, to-day and forever?" Is
                            his "hand shortened that it can not save," or his Spirit straitened that it can not work ?
                            Is it not iniquity "that has separated between you and your God ? " Have not your sins shut
                            you from the light of his countenance, and hid from your eyes the divine operations of his
                            Spirit? I know, by living experience, that this was once my case, and why not yours now? I
                            feel it my duty, before I leave this<pb n="181" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 181 earthly
                            tabernacle, to bear a testimony concerning the characters, moral and religious, of Mother
                            Ann and the Elders who administered the gospel with her ; knowing, as I do, the many false
                            and infamous reports circulated in the world against them, and more especially against
                            Mother Ann, who was the principal object of the dragon's rage. For it is clearly evident
                            that he is now gone forth in his wrath, uto make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep
                            the commandments of God, aid maintain the testimony of Jesus." I have been with her in many
                            places, and had much opportunity to hear her testimony and observe her conduct, both in
                            public and private ; and I can bear witness to the purity of her life and the sincerity of
                            her religion. She was truly a pattern of godliness to all Christians, and especially to
                            those of her own sex: for she was indeed the most exemplary person, both in word and deed,
                            that my eyes ever beheld. Her words were generally few; but they were directed in the most
                            perfect wisdom; and none were able to gainsay or resist the power of her spirit. Yet she was
                            free and familiar in conversation, when occasion required it; nor did she feel herself above
                            conversing freely with the least and the lowest, whether aged or young. She showed a
                            remarkably kind and tender feeling towards children, and would often give them some good
                            advice ; and the attachment of such little ones to her was wonderful. There were many small
                            children who, by a few words from her, received impressions of godliness which governed them
                            through life. And there are numbers now living, whose first impressions of faith and love to
                            the way of God, were inspired into their souls, by the notice of Mother Ann to them, in
                            their infancy. She was truly a Mother in Christ. Her whole soul seemed entirely devoted to
                            the will of God; and her discerning spirit was able to see and feel the state of souls in
                            every situation, and to administer to their necessities under all circumstances. Indeed, the
                            discerning light of God in her was such, that it seemed as if no secret thought of the heart
                            could be hid from her. Often did she expose the secret sins of hypocrites and deceivers, to
                            their shame and confusion : and in all she said, I never knew her to be in the least
                            mistaken. She always manifested a feeling of kindness and compassion to the poor, the widow
                            and the fatherless, and often deprived herself of temporal comforts, in order to administer
                            to their wants. She taught us to be faithful and just in all things, both spiritual and
                            temporalï¿½to be industrious, prudent and saving, and to manage our temporal affairs with
                            economy, that the blessing of God might attend our labors. In so doing, she said we should
                            be blessed with a plentiful store of the comforts of this life, and be able to supply the
                            wants of the poor and needy. And by walking in uprightness and keeping the way of God in
                            purity, she assured us that we should always be blessed with the gospel and the gifts of the
                            Holy Spirit, not only for ourselves, but to administer to other needy souls, who should
                            desire to forsake the course of this world, and<pb n="182" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 182 THE MANIFESTO. find
                            a part with us in the way of God. In the early part of my life, I often contemplated upon
                            the character of a child of God, as exhibited in the New Testament, and earnestly sought for
                            it; but could never find it, until I found it in Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, William Lee
                            and James Whittaker ; there indeed I found it perfectly exemplified to my full satisfaction.
                            Come then, ye who desire to learn the way of peace and righteousness, and be partakers of
                            that life and salvation which, I can testify, is treasured up in this Church, which was
                            founded by the ministration of Mother Ann Lee. I know by the revelation of God, and by my
                            own experience, that the second coming of Christ has commenced ; that the latter day of
                            glory has dawned upon earth, and the kingdom of Christ is begun, which will never have an
                            end. And i feel confident that all souls will yet bow ' before it, and acknowledge it,
                            either in judgment or mercy. Beware then, ye children of men, that ye speak not evil of
                            those things which ye understand not, "lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the
                            prophets ; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for I work a work in your day, a
                            work which ye will in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you." Acts xiii., 40,
                            41. Expecting this to be my last public duty, I solemnly bear witness, in the fear of God,
                            to the truth of these things; and I pray God that, in his mercy, it may be the means of
                            awakening and rightly directing some poor lost souls, who are, as I once was, seeking in the
                            wilderness, where there is no water, and in the desert, wh re there is none to save, and
                            where there is no way of salv:.tioa to be found. So testifies your aged friend. New Lebanon,

                            sky, And one by one in the stellar dome Gleamed the starry-gems on high. There was the sun
                            fast sinking In his bed of living name; And just above the sunset One star of glory came.
                            And then, near the darkened zenith; A brighter one appears; Lo! all the star-lamps lighted,
                            Hung out like chandeliers. And I've gazed in the morning twilight, When the moon was sailing
                            by, Eight near fair Lunar's crescent, Two diamonds gem the sky. So near that they flashed
                            their beamings Right in her mellow ray, I wondered, (if by telephone) They talked on their
                            circling way. Oh, with what thrilling ecstacy I've gazed on the star-lit dome, Till each
                            radiant, silvery twinkler, Seemed a beautiful angel's home; And I've thought of the little
                            children, And the funny things they've said;ï¿½ That the angels lighted the star-lamps While
                            they were going to bed. One thought that they were gimlet holes That the glory we might see;
                            If heaven's wrong side so bright appeared What must the right side be. Maud:ï¿½ Why Amelia!

                            a little knowledge Of those starry worlds afar, For have seen one follow the sunset, It is
                            Venus, the evening star. The brightest one is Jupiter, Four million miles from here; Four
                            moons attend through all his course That monarch of the spheres. And those at present near
                            the moon, Are, Saturn with golden rings, And Mars who was called the God of war In the time

                            Down through ages men have watched The starry multitude. To constellations they gave names,
                            Like the Big and Little Bear; Draco, Pegasus, Auriga, And Cassiopeia's chair. Perseus,
                            Virgo, Hercules, The beautiful Northern Crown; Just now above the eastern hills, Sweet

                            And I can cipher, too, This wonderful science Astronomy, Is even too much for you. Now you
                            star-gazing poets, I can not understand, How you can fill your noddles, With every thing so
                            grand. Tillie:ï¿½ I've had a bright idea That struck me in the head, They like such fairy
                            visions, We, practical things, instead. Away back in the distance, I can not tell you when.
                            Some wise men followed a wondrous star Serene:ï¿½ 'Twas the Star of Bethlehem. Tillie:ï¿½ I can

                            Bethlehem, The promised child who grew to teach God's law to suffering men. Yet while he in
                            a manger lay Wise men came fr;/m afar, Directed by the glowing light Of the bright and
                            guiding star. They thought he was their future king, As prophets had foretold; They laid
                            rich presents at his feet Of frankincense and gold. When he grew up to be a man His mission
                            he received, He spread abroad the heavenly light, And many souls believed He healed the
                            sick, the blind and lame, And blest the children dear, And comforted all lonely hearts With
                            blessed words of cheer. And thus they loved and reverenced him, But some his power denied;
                            The wicked Jews detested him, His body crucified. And down the years men worshiped him This
                            good and Christ-like man; But loving self, they've quite forgot His beautiful Christian
                            plan. Tillie:ï¿½ Why don't men worship present good, Instead of the good afar? I'm sure I
                            could follow a starry ray, And find where bright treasures are. Maud:ï¿½ My dear little girl,
                            I think we've found The beautiful Morning Star; For in our home doth love abound, With

                            cold, I am protected from the storm Like a lamb within the fold. And when the blossoms deck
                            the trees, And the birds are full of cheer, And the fruit hangs ripening in the sun, Why! it

                            in an invidious and arrogant spirit, I take a lesson from the grey-headed dandelion
                            (Leontodon Taraxacum,) or the humble pumpkin flower. The first of these is such a skillfully
                            wrought machine that it can distribute its seeds by aerial navigation all over the
                            countryï¿½and then consider also the inimitable ingenuity and beauty of each little parachute
                            under which the little seed sails to its destined future home. And there is the golden
                            flower of the pumpkin (Cucurbita Pepo,) within which are the most beautiful and gorgeous
                            galleries and walks for the promenade of insects, with a symmetry, beauty, and glory, of
                            which Solomon in all his glory, was not to be compared. When I look on all this, and
                            consider my own poor and limited intelli gence, all my vainglory and concei are snuffed out
                            in a moment; and in stead of inclining invidiously to criti cise others who may not know
                            quiti so much as myself or may not be quite so good a Pharisee as I may be, I am constrained
                            to cry out "Fool! take back this unholy criticism or fault you are about to lay at the door
                            of your brother fool, and allow both of you to grow together in peace till the Harvest." And
                            thus my vain pride receives a wound from which there is no recovery. But herein the vale of
                            humility and Christian charity is reaclu d, and this yields a peace and consolation which no
                            amount of pride and vainglory can ever confer.

                            according to prophecy, and in the line of the female. 1. There is a universe of natural life
                            originating with Divine Power in obedience to natural law ; and there is a universe of
                            spiritual life originating with Divine Power in obedience to spiritual law. 2. The human
                            Ego, the "living soul," is this Divine Power, Deity, manifest in humanity, and subject to
                            natural law. 3. This Deity, then, is original humanity, in infinity, and subject to
                            spiritual law. 4. Such as original humanity was, then, the Deity is, in an infinitely
                            superior degree. 5. Humanity is not composed of one, but two beings, distinct in nature and
                            attributes: viz. male and female.<pb n="185" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 185 6. The Deity,
                            then, is not composed of one, but two beings, distinct in nature and attributes, viz. male
                            and female. 7. One being, distinct in nature and attributes from another, can not administer
                            the nature and attributes of the other. 8. Two beings of distinct natures and attributes in
                            united effort, can minister the nature and attributes of both, in accord with the law
                            governing the case. 9. Hence there is required the united effort of male and female in order
                            to produce their "image and likeness." 10. Jesus, the Christ declared his followers must be
                            born again. That no man could enter the kingdom of heaven without passing through this new
                            birth. 11. Jesus, the man, was the subject of the first, the natural birth. 12. Jesus, the
                            Christ, was the subject of the second, the spiritual birth. CONCLUSION. As the natural man
                            and woman are subjects of the naturalï¿½oldï¿½birth, through the united instrumentality of
                            natural man and woman in conformity to the natural laws of generation; so the spiritual man
                            and woman must be the subjects of the spiritual new birth, through the united
                            instrumentality of spiritual man and woman, in conformity to the spiritual laws of
                            regeneration. Hence, as we believe Jesus of Nazareth to be the anointed Savior in the male
                            line, because his advent was foretold by ancient prophets and typified ' by numerous
                            symbolic representations ; and because he was recognized by a Grod-fearing man, John the
                            Baptist; but principally because of the fruits he brought forth the world-wide results of
                            his mission, as also by the fierce opposition and cruel persecution he suffered at the hands
                            of the popular religionists of the times ; so we believe Ann Lee, of Manchester, England, to
                            bs the anointed Savior in the female line ; not only because a second advent was predicted
                            and the only logical reason for such an event, so far as we can see, was the quickening into
                            spiritual life the female nature, in humanity, as the male had been in the first advent; but
                            for all the above reasons as well: viz. by prophecy, by typical representation ; by being
                            recognized by the godly inspired of the times, who were waiting and watching for his second
                            coming, and by the like opposition and persecutions by the popular professors of religion of
                            the most advanced civilization of the time; but principally because of the divine light and
                            power manifest in her life and testimony and the most beneficent results of her mission. The
                            symbolic representations alluded to above, relating to the first and second advents of the
                            divine spirit in the work of human redemption, point to two correspondent powers, united to
                            accomplish the same purpose, being the united influence of male and female in the work of
                            redemption. ~ Such are the Cherubims, (see Ex. xxxvii., 7.) whose wings covered the
                            mercy-seat above the ark ; the two tables of the covenant; the two silver trumpets ; the two
                            olive trees ; the two olive branches; the two golden pipes through which the two olive

                            typical work. The two cherubims placed over the ark that contained the two tables of the
                            covenant, were very remarkable types of the two Anointed Ones, the male and the female, who
                            are united in the work of redemption, and the covenant of peace is between them both. Over
                            the ark was placed the mercy-seat of pure gold, and the two cherubims of gold were placed on
                            the ends of the mercy-seat, and their wings were extended on high, so that they covered the
                            mercy-seat with their wings ; and their faces looked toward each other and toward the
                            mercy-seat. These figures are so plain and obvious, that it seems as though they could not
                            be misunderstood, so strikingly representative are they of the true order of the work of God
                            through the united agency of the male and female in Christ. Between the two cherubims was
                            the mercy-seat from whence the law of God was delivered, which not only pointed out two
                            gospel dispensations, but also showed, in a figure, that the merciful display of God's
                            grace, in the last dispensation, would proceed from between the Two. All who have received
                            this last manifestation of divine light and power, through the Two, have found it a saving
                            faith, affording them complete victory over the animal nature, and fully satisfying their
                            every need. Union Village, Ohio.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Justice is the only permanent foundation..." TEIform="index"/>Justice is the only permanent foundation...

                            gradual development ; or, in other language, as the thoughts and abilites of the child are
                            inadequate to that of the man's, through lack of experience and maturity, so the unfoldment
                            of spiritual discernment is limited only as we disassociate ourselves from physical
                            phenomena and materialism. Being the children of a heavenly Father and Mother, we
                            necessarily partake of and are permeated with the divine life or spirit which is immortal.
                            But, immediately arises the query :ï¿½ Whence the evils so prevalent among humanity? The seed
                            contains the germ of all that is possible for the plant to produce, vitality, leaves, color,
                            etc. ; but if sown in sterile soil, or surrounded by uncongenial conditions, the result is a
                            frail, imperfect plant; so, the human soul placed under similar conditions becomes
                            spiritually, mentally, and physically deficient; thus man's deterioration from the
                            at-onement with the Father. In this state of separation there consequently ensues tumult and
                            contention ; thus each soul hath its battle-field and its adversaries ; the passions and
                            propensities conflict with the lofty and divine nature. Through the efficacy of Truth and
                            spiritual enlightenment, necessary to embrace this grand injunction "Know Thyself," we are
                            prepared to enlist heroically in the warfare against our individual sins, and also against
                            cooperative and com-<pb n="187" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 187 petitive evils, whose roots
                            centre in the bestial passions. Never for a moment can the armor be laid aside, lest in an
                            unexpected time the enemy gain vantage ground and demand surrender to its inglorious power.
                            The warrior returning from the battle-field crowned with success, feels not the thrill of
                            joy permeating his being, equal to the spiritual warrior whose triumph is over self. If this
                            victory was unattainable, never would have been uttered,ï¿½"Be ye therefore perfect, even as
                            your Father in heaven is perfect." This passage proves the possibility of regaining our
                            inheritance with the Omnipotent Creator. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                his legitimate sphere of action. To be good, whether in our own home or amang strangers,
                                is a very essential feature in one's life. The conscience that is to be exercised for
                                the home relations, should not be laid aside under any circumstances. Personal pleasure
                                should always be a secondary consideration, and honest principle be the governing rule.
                                To profess to be good and then to walk in the worldly ways of crookedness, is ndt quite
                                right. Such a course is confusing to the mind and makes for all a sphere of inharmony.
                                As there are so many degrees of goodness, especially when it is connected with religion,
                                that sometimes the lines are so faint that one can scarcely perceive them, or they may
                                be so shaded by the elements of the world that they would hardly be known. Religious
                                goodness should be an unmistakable force in the reforming of one's life. It should say
                                in words easy to be understood,ï¿½ "Go and sin no more." It should have the same
                                ministration for the erring as did the apostle. "Let him that stole, steal no more." And
                                then to make the whole matter as simple as is the gospel of Christ, we have only to
                                listen to the words of the prophet,ï¿½"Cease to do evil, and learn to do well." To involve
                                any thing that belongs to the testimony of Jesus, the Christ, in a mysterious maze, is
                                to detract so much from its spirituality and add to it that which is man-made. Religious
                                goodness, or that which is goodness by profession may sound better than it really is.
                                Cain and Abel each had religious goodness, and they brought offerings to place on the
                                altar before the Lord. These gifts were of value as they had built places of sacrifice
                                and carried to them the best that their store-house afforded, and yet the sequel of
                                their story informs us that there must have<pb n="189" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 189
                                been a deficiency in the essential quality of goodness. To make long prayers that may be
                                heard of men is no evidence of goodness, neither is a protestation of a life to God,
                                unless it comes from a contrite spirit. It is practical righteousness that makes the
                                life of man a power to do good. "Show me," said the apostle, "thy faith without works,
                                and I will show thee my faith by my works." These works constitute the life. It is the
                                governing element that forbids the doing of wrong. It is the armor that protects the
                                soul against the fiery darts of Satan. This element returns to the Christian mind the
                                new language which belongs to the people of God, and so clothes them with the Holy
                                Spirit that they are enabled to say what they mean and to mean what they say. It aids
                                them in living a new life, and leads the soul onward and upward toward the blissful
                                future. It was Henry Ward Beech er who talked of the thermal line of duty, where it was
                                warm toward God at home and in meeting, and then became cool in proportion as it went
                                from home. Some one on asking him to step aside from the rules of propriety, he
                                remarked,ï¿½"If I am going to take any liberties, I am going to take them at home." That
                                rule would not be out of place with us who are members of a religious Community, and any
                                thing less careful than that is not consistent with our profession.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Metaphysical preacher" TEIform="index"/>A METAPHYSICAL PREACHER.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">The Eev.

                                    desire to preach on a certain Sunday in the village of H- - - - -, where he had
                                    formerly served as pastor. His application was favorably considered by the pastor,
                                    who in order to make up his mind wisely, consulted Jonathan Sykes. The latter was a
                                    steward and class leader, a man advanced in years, whose educational advantages had
                                    been limited, but whose common sense was without limit. He was a man of great
                                    influence in the community, always at the head of every good work. "Brother Sykes,"
                                    said the pastor, "the Kev. John Jones wishes to occupy our pulpit next Sunday. What
                                    shall I say to him?" Laughing heartily, Brother Sykes answered: "The Rev. John Jones
                                    always reminds me of a great big fish in a little pool of water. No sooner does he
                                    get in than he gives two or three flops and flounders, and gets it so muddy that you
                                    can't see in, and he can't see out." We would commend the above to some preachers

                                It is customary in some Oriental cities for the night-watchmen to hourly announce the
                                time, adding "All is well," when it is so, for the comfort of the inhabitants who are
                                trusting their safety to these vigilant guards. This is very much like our little Home

                                though not hourly. It is pleasant to hear of homes being renewed, brightened up and put

                                to learn of drought and frosts as so troubling our Western Societies. Columbia County,
                                N. Y. is one of the best places to live in after all. The weather is always doing
                                better for us than we expect. We can stand a drought without much injury (only to

                                no frosts afterward of any amount, although we expected them for "Hicks said so." Under

                                acquaintance of our people. We are pleased and encouraged to meet so many thoughtful and
                                intelligent inquirers who are giving their earnest efforts to the solution of the dark
                                problems of human life. We are thankful that Zion is yet able to minister strength and
                                encouragement to such souls, and that the hallowed influence in and about our
                                consecrated homes is felt and the source of it acknowledged and revered. Much has been

                                would say that she is still the same loving mother as when she stood at the head of

                                her aid in the little home duties as far as her strength will permit, and more than we
                                feel that she ought. She lives to show us the beauty of that character which has made a

                                the wall of our large stone silo on two sides. The unevenness caused considerable loss,
                                and we think with straight walls there will be no necessity for weighting the ensilage
                                when the silo is filled. We have under way considerable improvement in our barnyards
                                with the object of having them in as dry and tidy a condition as possible. Our gardeners
                                have noticed there are fewer insect pests in the gardens and orchards this year than for
                                many previous years. We hope this is general and presages a time of relief from these

                                the Valley. Through the kindness of a beloved gospel Sister we were favored with the
                                loan of a work entitled, "The Way, the Truth, and the Life." by J. H. Dewey, M. D. It is

                                and profitable visit to the Society at Canterbury, and was entertained both spiritually
                                and temporally as Canterbury can do it. He did not have the privilege of meeting the

"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." Serving

                                in the vineyard of God. The consciousness of divine approval, the assurance of being a

                                Already I am admonished that the time is here for the few items of interest which have

                                with speed. Twelve large loads were put in on the 8th inst. and the number will increase
                                as the better portions of the mowing fields are reached. The hay loader is a great
                                addition in the field to save time and labor. The garden is looking unexceptionably
                                well. A number of bushels of peas found ready market about the 4th. Quite a number of
                                crates of fine large strawberries also paid well for raising, and a plenty was reserved
                                for home use, the yield being large. Cherries are abundant and of this fruit the
                                preserving jars are well filled. Currants are in good demand at 15 cts. a basket. The
                                sweet corn is about four feet high and promises a good yield. Tomatoes and cucumbers in
                                full bloom, next the fruit. Beets and turnips are now ready for cooking. Potatoes are
                                looking fine, but late. With all these blessings, health prevails. These demonstrations
                                are proof of God's care for his grateful subjects; and love being an evident quality of

Beloved Elder Henry:ï¿½I have been looking over various numbers of the
                                Manifesto to-day. What a fount of heavenly virtues beams forth from the pens of our
                                inspired ancient worthies! There I find our gifted Elders, F. W. Evans, H. L. Eads, G.
                                B. Avery, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, and scores of others beautifully illustrating
                                the sublime teachings and example of those self-sacrificing, devoted souls, who received
                                and kept the gospel in its purity in days gone by. I always hail with joy the
                                    Manifesto<pb n="194" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> 194 THE MANIFESTO. so fraught with precious truths.
                                O, for a score of Brs. like Isaac Anstatt and truthful sayings so bravely proclaimed. We
                                are a little band away out here in a region called the "dark and bloody ground;" toiling
                                and struggling with foes within and without; intermingling with the world, dependent on
                                them for aid in our daily toil. ''Oh! what will .the harvest be?" Communities have
                                sinned and strayed (in many things) from the true fundamental principles of the faith,
                                therefore, few in numbers and works. Though like the Xinevites we sometimes cry
                                out,ï¿½''Where are the hundreds and thousands that were to flock to Zion for the food of
                                eternal life?" From early childhood we have watched and waited, and still the vision
                                tarries. And, where rests the responsibility? A certain inquirer, visiting us once,
                                said, "If the testimony you put forth was strictly lived to, people would fall before
                                you like grass before the scythe." What a responsibility is resting upon the subjects of
                                this faith! All praise and honor to your faithful heart and toiling hands, in keeping
                                afloat the highly prized Manifesto. May your days be long and blissful. I was so
                                impressed with the article of Br. Isaac Anstatt, that I felt like making a faint effort
                                to add to your columns a few lines. We are having very warm and stormy weather. Our

Beloved Elder Henry :ï¿½Your kind favor of the 6th and the Manifesto, also a
                                copy of Friend Kobinson's book, received. It has much information, in an attractive
                                form, and people will be looking after it more and more as the necessities of the case
                                will require. In consideration of the great changes that are going on, it does not
                                require prophetic eyes to see, must go on, in the minds of the people, as they feel the
                                increasing pressure resulting from panic and the accumulation of riches on one hand and
                                consequent impoverishment on the other. Politicians may shout themselves hoarse, to
                                little avail. The Heaven-born plan of Christian Communism is the panacea for poverty,
                                destitution and the inequality so deplorable in our day. Would that the masses could see
                                these things in their true light, and be willing to pay the price required to enjoy the
                                blessings of a peaceful, pure relation. Nothing can well be imagined more wicked and
                                deplorable than the spirit of anarchy that is becoming so prevalent in Europe
                                especially, and gathering strength in our own country. How true the figureï¿½ "Men shall
                                hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water." Will repeated
                                failure prove the fact to them that "All things shall work together for good to them
                                that love God and keep in the way of his counsel?" How sad it is to think that, "The
                                ways of our Zion do mourn, that none come up to her feasts"ï¿½while so many are needy, but
                                hungering and thirsting after worldly pleasure, rather than the self-denying way of
                                Jesus and his faithful followers; would also the world could know that they can not
                                follow where lie never went on the generative plane. But I would not weary you or your

                            doings of Ann Lee, I have road the little book over and over. I am delighted with the
                            Christian experiences noted therein, and now by the kindness of a friend I have had the
                            Manifesto of March and April. 1 am also much taken by some of the plain Christian talks
                            therein printed. I was held to consider the quotation, Gal. v., 24, And they that are
                            Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections (margin says passions) and lusts. This
                            has been the experience of such as have been Christ's since that epistle of Paul to the
                            Cralatians, A. D. 58, so that this is no new doctrine, as some claim. 1 have heard much talk
                            about a (or the) resurrection life, while those claiming to live the life, lived in
                            pleasure. In plainer words they rushed from a single, pure life, into marriage, and from all
                            outward appearances became slaves to the flesh. I always doubted their sincerity. Now i read
                            in the Gospel according to Luke chap. 20, beginning with the 33rd verse,ï¿½ "ï¿½The children of
                            this world marry and are given in marriage ; but they which shall be accounted worthy to
                            obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in
                            marriage. ****** They are equal unto the angels and are the children of God, being the
                            children of the resurrection." Here we have something on which we may rest our faith and
                            hope. Jesus Christ gave us the precept and example nearly nineteen hundred years ago, and
                            all along He has had true followers who delighted to walk even as He walked. Why? Because
                            they loved Him, and while the Shakers may be the first and only Society holding this Christ
                            life up to the world, I have known some cases where married people, in the prime of life,
                            have lived together, where the true light shone on them, b?ing married, and have been as
                            free from the flesh life as are the angels in heaven, fulfilling the injunction at the hand
                            of the beloved Paul: "Let them that have wives be as though they had none ;" but if there is
                            not union and agreement with husband and wife to Jesus Christ's example, then the next best
                            will follow". A Society like yours would ba a place of refuge indeed. Did not Jesus Christ
                            himself say "All men can not receive this saying ;" and then again He said, "Many are
                            called, but few are chosen." What was this calling, but the marriage supper? And why not
                            chosen? Because the old garments were not exchanged for the white raiment. I believe in this
                            real li e, walking with Jesus, and to Him be all the praise. 1 am walking in the way, and
                            find it so sweet and satisfactory, so free from the world of trouble. I have my trials and
                            temptations, but there is peace in believing. The spirit says, "This is the way, walk ye in
                            it," and the "spirit and the word agree." God bless all the dear ones who see the way, and
                            give them confidence to walk in the way that He has cast up in this wilderness of sin, is

                                    The most charming companion I ever met was a plain little woman whose life for
                                    years had been entirely given up to the care of an invalid, demented father, an old
                                    man who demanded her constant presence in his darkened room during his waking hours,
                                    in the few spare moments she had while going through the usual round of household
                                    duties. Poor, living in the backwoods, where she never saw any society, she gained a
                                    depth of mind and a power of expression far superior to any of her old schoolmates
                                    who had shown greater promise, and had possessed every advantage. Indeed, she was
                                    neither "smart" nor particularly studious at school, but excessively fond of fun,
                                    excitement, and company. One day I asked her the secret of the change. She laughed:
                                    "I have been enjoying constant pleasant company for the last few years." I started
                                    mystified. She drew from her pocket a little quotation book, and pointed to two
                                    quotations, "My own thoughts are my companions," and, "They are never alone that are
                                    accompanied with noble thoughts." There were several other quotations written on the
                                    margin, and the page was well thumbed. She said earnestly: "Lookingback over my
                                    girl-hood, I know that there is a fatal defect in the training of our girls; our
                                    words, our actions, receive attention; we are given advice and instruction in every
                                    point but in our thinking. I did not have even a conception of entertaining myself
                                    by my own thoughts; I wanted all the time to be amused by something or somebody
                                    outside of myself. Then came that plunge into poverty, sadness, and loneliness ; at
                                    first I believed I should become insane, then God must have directed me to this
                                    little book, too worthless to be sold when our libi'ary went. One other quotation
                                    chained my mind. "Our thoughts are heard in heaven," and I began recalling ray
                                    thoughts. How disgusted I was with them! Round and round, in a weary rut of repining
                                    they had traveled, or ever if not repining, how stupid, how unelevating they had
                                    been! From that hour I determined my thoughts should be inspiring companions; when
                                    sewing up a seam, they should not be, 'So long and tiresome, wonder how long before
                                    I get done,' and so on and so on, over and over again. Why! I would take a little
                                    trip while sewing that seam. When washing the dishes, I discuss with myself
                                    different national questions; when sweeping the room, I review the last book I read,
                                    or perhaps a book read years ago; every duty not requiring concentration is
                                    enlivened in this way. Not more than an hour can I ever read a day. Our books
                                    scarcely number a dozen, but since I began to think, one verse of the Bible will
                                    open and unfold, until it blossoms into a wonderful revelation, and I hope bears
                                    fruit. Before, I did not take time to wait for the unfolding and the fruit-bearing."
                                    "But I can't control my thoughts," I objected. "They will dwell on any trouble or
                                    worry I have." "Paul tells us that in our warfare our weapons are 'mighty to cast
                                    down our imaginations,' 'bringing into captivity every thought;' that promise is a
                                    great help when I feel despairing over my wrong thoughts. To keep down the
                                    disagreeable ones, to shake myself free from the servitude of the daily fretting
                                    tasks, I drill myself into meditating on pleasant subjects, just as I would drill my
                                    tongue, if in company, to make pleasant speeches. Tell the girls you teach and write
                                    to, how true it is that 'The pleasantest things in the world are pleasant thoughts,
                                    and the great art in life is to have as many of them as possible' also that this art
                                    can not be learned when the feebleness of age has weakened the control of the mind."
                                    When she had left me, I remembered she was the only person who had not made insane
                                    remarks about the weather, nor said, "Wasn't that Johnstown calamity awful?" Do you

                                    her mind, not empty turning of the mental wheels? If the mill grinds not grist, it
                                    will grind itself; if the mind feeds not on thought, it preys upon itself, and is

                            work. The above passage was prophetic of a time when the law of the Lord should be "written
                            in the inward parts"ï¿½-when all the promises concerning God's chosen people, should be
                            fulfilled in the great Sabbath, the millennial period of which their jubilee year was
                            typical. A time of spiritual rest from all that was sinful, or in any way contrary to the
                            higher laws of being. Truth is a unit, and real science and religion are always closely
                            connected, as body and soul. The Jews were thoroughly schooled in relation to every
                            department of physical existence, by their great lawgiver, Moses. They received many special
                            instructions concerning agriculture and dietetics;ï¿½the manner in which they should manage
                            their land, cook their food, etc. Their obedience to those laws made of them a distinct
                            people, separate from all the surrounding nations. In that day they were a very crude
                            people, just having been emancipated from Egyptian servitude, and could not understand
                            spiritual things, therefore all their religious ceremonies were of an external nature; but
                            the prophet foresaw the time, when in the progress of the race, their righteousness in
                            physical things would be only as the foundation of a superior order of society, wherein
                            man's moral and spiritual nature should be controlled by those higher laws of divine truth
                            which should be taught by the Christ spirit, when' the whole life should be one of perpetual
                            consecration, so ï¿½ sanctified ï¿½ through obedience to truth in every department of life that
                            "holiness to the Lord" would be as much observed in the treatment of the animals, the
                            tilling of the earth or cooking of food, as in the sanctuary of worship. The prophetic
                            period has come to us, and has or will come to any other people, according to the light
                            given them and the mt-asure of ob^ dience they yield to that light in the observance of
                            physical and spiritual law. We believe we can serve and honor God just as acceptably in the
                            performance of the lowliest duties, of manual labor, as in those seasons set apart for
                            spiritual devotions. To live in the truth is to "write holiness to the Lord" on everything
                            with which we come in contact. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our affections are vines..." TEIform="index"/>Our affections are vines...

                            souls, to draw nearer the Fountain Source of truth and life, by establishing among
                            themselves, unity of purpose and harmony of thought and feeling. To this end are held the
                            Soul-communion and the Silent Unity meetings of which we have read. This class of people are
                            organized under various names in different places, but the central idea among them all is to
                            Think no III,ï¿½to look for, emphasize, and build up the good in each other, by thought, word
                            and deed; recognizing that the outer being is created by the inner; that all potency is in
                            thought; in fact that thoughts are things, and the only real things. That apart from
                            expressions in word or action, through silent thought we have power to bless or injure,
                            uplift or degrade our brother or sister. The acceptance of this truth is having a practical
                            bearing upon the lives of thousands at the present time, and is working as a dissolving
                            element to creeds and dogmas, sects and isms, and also as a unifying and focalizing power to
                            all that is good and true in the hearts of the people. In refusing to think evil, and ever
                            holding in view the God-thought and divine ideal, they believe they are brought nearer the
                            source of creative good which heals,ï¿½restores to wholeness, body and mind. It seems to me
                            there is a truth in this, worthy of our thoughtful acceptance. As a people we are blest
                            above all others in the possession of many of those spiritual truths toward which they are
                            progressing, and should we not strive earnestly to embody these in our characters, that we
                            also may be drawn together in a closer communion, and have our souls refreshed from those
                            crystal fountains that shall vitalize our beings with new and living thoughts? To this end
                            let us be firm in our resolve to think no ill of each other. In every human heart there
                            dwells a deathless being created in the image of the Divine;ï¿½a child of God,ï¿½a beautiful
                            angel. Let us call it forth and recognize it: let us speak of it to each other and greet it
                            in each other. Let us nourish it by our kindly thought, our sympathies and prayers, and in
                            our efforts to minister to this life in those about us, perchance the angel within our own
                            hearts will grow stronger. We all have one purpose, and one goal in view. We all must feel
                            struggle of soul in casting off the old life for birth in the new. Let us be lights to each
                            other through the darkened valley, that we may rejoice together on the mount of triumph. Let
                            us cultivate that kindly affection and tenderness of feeling that shall make us as careful
                            of another's reputation as we would wish them to be of our own, thus keep the golden rule ;
                            and in that love which is the fulfilling of the law, so faithfully guard our hearts that we
                            shall think no ill. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I can of mine own self do nothing." TEIform="index"/>I can of mine own self do nothing.

From Prof. Wm. D. Hornaday, Taxidermist, N. S. National Museum:

those in Audubon's great work, and am
free to say that they are more accurate in
outline as well as more faithfully colored
to nature."

the study of Ornithology."
