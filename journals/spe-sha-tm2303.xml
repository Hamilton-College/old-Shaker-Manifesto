G. Clark, an inspired man, and a bright
                            star preparing to take his plac? in a constellation of the New Heavens now in process of
                            formation. Our Manifesto has done a great deal of good, and we all bless it. I have a great
                            interest in its publication. Let its pages sparkle with living, practical faith, that
                            inspires hope and brings into operation the life essence of that love that knows all
                            humanity as related to the divine, and realizes that what is for the benefit of one soul or
                            part of humanity, if based on the eternal principle of right, will equally benefit every
                            other part. The principle of Justice is applicable to every department of human existence ;
                            and when brought into operation and practiced in accordance with the Golden Rule, we shall
                            have the Millennium. The life principle of Shakerism is in the every day practice of the
                            living faith of Mother's gospel. Which gos pel is imminently adapted to the life that is;
                            even more so than to the life to come. And should be applied in all our relations to each
                            other; especially as pertains to the things of this world. If the gospel of Christ and
                            Mother, is just something to look up and forward to, as only to be attained after the body
                            is laid aside, we certainly shall miss a great deal of good while passing to that stage of
                            our development. A thorough knowledge and understanding of our basic principles, and of
                            their practical application is very essential. A principle that cannot be put into operation
                            in all our relations to our fellow men, and especially as pertains to the trade and traffic
                            in the things of this world, would seem to me not worthy our attention. We talk a good deal
                            about principles, but a definite statement, of how, what, when, and where, is or should be
                            our practical standard. This would be very interesting reading. As they, (the principles,)
                            are unalterable and never change, should we not be able at all times and in every place to
                            discern them? When this is not the case is it not because of a beclouded understanding,
                            which comes from the non-practice of the same ? If the principles of our gospel were<pb n="58" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 58 THE MANIFESTO. definitely stated, and their application denned, in
                            every department of our order, in temporal, as well as spiritual things, we should have a
                            straight line, and the square of truth could always be applied, to bring us to that straight
                            line. We could then stand before the world, without any doubts, or caviling, a United body
                            of Believers, Shakers, our practice conforming to our preaching, and to our holy faith. Our
                            life practices, internal and external, would in a more emphatic manner be the
                            exemplification to the world of the living faith that is in us. This would show, in our
                            relation to each other as Brethren and Sisters, perfect equality. Practical equality would
                            bring the square of truth to apply to all our possessions, and to our opportunities. I love
                            the faith of the gospel, especially the spiritual part when applied to our every day
                            relation in our Communal home. Our life must rest upon a spiritual principle, and that
                            principle is as eternal as the law that governs the movement of the stars in their course.
                            Who will give us, through the pages of the Manifesto, a definite and plain statement of our
                            faith and principles, and the practical application of the same as applied by the square of
                            truth. Let the trumpet sound.

                            flowers of fruition in Gardens of Love Far, far from the wilds where the fierce passions
                            rove. 0 this is the world whence creations sublime, Are photographed forth on the mirror of
                            time; Whence lights and perfections and glories and all Upon the Arena of Destiny fall. To
                            this silent region of peace I aspire, And in meditation full often retire; And sooner or
                            later my home shall be there Remote from delusions of sorrow or care. When sickness, menaces
                            or sorrow or sin, 1 haste to commune with the silence within; For there I find God on his
                            glorious throne Declaring that "1 and my Father are one." And can it be possible sickness or
                            sin A victory over the spirit shall win? Nay�these fell delusions I quickly dismiss For time
                            and eternity, yon world and this. In soaring o'er regions of silence forsooth, I seem to
                            return to the days of my youth; And most Divine mysteries ope to my view 'Mid the deep
                            solitudes of the good and the true. In rapture of silence I wait for the word, And
                            peacefully walk in the Oracle heard; When I and the Father in spirit are one How pleasant to
                            iterate "Thy will be done." From out the deep silence the Oracle lifts, Like the sun-clouds
                            of eve with their splendor and rifts; From the gates of the west as the great sun retires,
                            And garnishes Heaven with many hued fires. And there's thunder in silence could we only
                            hear, To awe the dark sinner in his mad career. And there's music in silence the sad to
                            console, And melody soft that will passion control.<pb n="59" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 59
                            There's healing in silence from sickness and fear, And joy in the Inmost the lonely to
                            cheer; For sorrow and sin are not found in that � world, But happiness on its escutcheon
                            impearled. Forever adieu to the negative state, Which once I believed was the Fiat of fate;
                            My pilgrimage opens, the trumpet has blown, And I'll go on my journey afoot and alone. Then
                            farewell to sickness and sorrow farewell, To sin and all throes of a negative hell; Whose
                            shadows the spirit can never content With passions dull surfeits and vagaries blent. Union

                                purity you have walked from youthful days until the present time, and now, as said the
                                beloved Apostle so can you say, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth
                                in wickedness." Elder Giles B. A very once said, "Zion is the working hands of God in
                                the world." It then becomes the duty of Believers to "sow light till the world is
                                aglow." If we fail to do this, others may arise to take our birth-right, and it is now
                                evident that light is greatly needed to shine abroad over the earth. Whenever we come in
                                contact with those outside, we find that we are very imperfectly known unto them. The
                                questions which meet us at every turn, are like these; ' 'What is your religious
                                belief?" "What is the difference between you and the Quakers?" "Have you books that will
                                inform us of your history and manner of life ?" To be sure, we tell tnem, we have books,
                                large and small, and we have let them have a great many, written by those of long travel
                                and deep theological study and experience. Thousands will yet arise to call our good
                                father Elder F. W. Evans blessed for the labors from his brain and pen, and also others
                                who have toiled in the same field. But "Variety is the spice of life," which gives it
                                all its flavor and one outside of our homes has written an interesting series of
                                articles, in a very friendly spirit, giving the history of the Order from its
                                commencement, of the organization of the Societies, and the foundation principles by
                                which they are governed; also biographical sketches, and pleasing reminiscences,
                                together with illustrations of nearly all our villages and some of our leading members.
                                These articles have appeared, during the last two years, in the Manufacturer and
                                Builder, a magazine published in New York City. The work has been revised and very
                                kindly given to us, with the use of the plates for the illustrations, by the waiter of
                                the series, our good friend Charles Edson Robinson, who, it seems has made the lives of
                                God's people a study, and is, himself, not far from the kingdom. At a sacrifice of time
                                and labor, the work is now being printed and put into pamphlet form, by our beloved
                                Elder Henry C. Blinn, Editor of the Manifesto. His reward is with him, to give unto the
                                    people<pb n="60" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 60 THE MANIFESTO. according as their subscriptions to the
                                pamphlets have been. In our correspondence with our Brethren and Sisters of the
                                different Societies in regard to the work, the kind spirit in which we have been
                                answered has filled our hearts with thankfulness. We are particularly grateful for the
                                approval and help of the Elders of the North Family, Mt. Lebanon. It is our hope and
                                trust that in the future, new editions of, and additions to this work may be made, until
                                "the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea." Those of
                                our Societies who, from adverse circumstances, which they could not control, found it
                                impossible to render that aid to the enterprise, which they otherwise would gladly have
                                done, will want some of these books for distribution in a future day, when the tide of
                                adversity rolls back, and prosperity's waves roll on. "For the Angels are coming down
                                from heaven, To bless the people anew, They are coming with rich and beautiful gifts For

                                Heavenly Mother;" if you will pardon me, a stranger, for thus venturing to address you,
                                I will inquire what Scriptural authority you have if any, for asserting that God is a
                                dual nature, essentially, both Father and Mother. It is my opinion that our Protestant
                                faith is unique in asserting that there is a triune God, each person which is
                                distinctively masculine. Granted that the natural is but a shadow of the spiritual in
                                many particulars, the parallelism if carried out to its fullest extent would lead to
                                absurdities. The idea of a Mother in the Godhead, savors of gross materialism and of the
                                old theologies like those of Greece and Rome which you say had "the true elements that
                                constitute an enlightened race." Is not the expression "Born of the spirit," a
                                figurative way of speaking ? Jesus said to the carping Jews^ that there is neither
                                marrying nor giv ing in marriage in the resurrection. I do not think many political
                                economists will agree with you in thinking that the evils which threaten our nation have
                                been due to the lack of woman suffrage. You cannot in sincerity deny the superiority of
                                man's intellect any more than you can deny his physical superiority ;�it may be, and
                                likely is true, that "woman's intuition" is the natural compensation for her lack of
                                intellectual strength. The expressions, "Bridegroom and Bride" as applied to Christ and
                                the Church are surely figurative expressions, an anthropomorphic designation. Until you
                                can prove from Scriptural authority that there is both Father and Mother in the Godhead
                                it would be well not to speak of a "triune God as a theological monster." If a female
                                Deity is necessary, why not argue a female devil also, as necessary to the propagation
                                of evil spirits. I have stated some of my objections to the idea of a female principle
                                in the Godhead: will you kindly give me some of your reasons for supposing there is such
                                a principle ? I simply desire to know the truth as it<pb n="61" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO.

                                came to me. "Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker." I see by the tone of your
                                letter that you have been thinking and am glad of it, as that will lead to investigation
                                and to enlightenment. You ask what Scriptural authority I have for asserting the Dual
                                principle of the Godhead? I will quote Genesis i., 26, 27. "And God said, let us make
                                man in our image, after our likeness�So God created man in his own image, in the image
                                of God created he him; male and female created he them." Now mark the exact reading
                                where it says, "let us make man in our image, male and female created he them." What can
                                be clearer than that sentence to prove the dual principle of the Godhead? Also Romans,
                                i., 20. "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly
                                seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead."
                                You "grant that the natural is but a shadow of the spiritual in many particulars," why
                                not in all? What absurdities would it lead to when it is stated that the invisible are
                                clearly seen by the things that are made even the Godhead ? Now I would ask how could
                                God create man in his likeness, male and female, unless those attributes were in the
                                Godhead? To my mind there is where the absurdities are, in supposing that he could be
                                created male and female, (the word he and him are used in the generic sense meaning the
                                race as a whole) when the creative power did not possess those attributes. You state
                                that the idea of a "Mother in the Godhead, savors of gross materialism." Far from that.
                                So we understand, it appeals to the most spiritual part of our being. Thinking of our
                                earthly parentage and the loving, tender care of a Mother and to realize that it is the
                                earthly representation of our Heavenly Mother, awakens emotions that are the antipodes
                                of a Materialistic mind. You misquote me when you say that I said, Greece and Rome had
                                the true elements that constitute an enlightened race. What I did say as you will see by
                                referring to the article, that the nineteenth century had been weighed in the balance
                                and found wanting in the elements that constitute an enlightened race and like the
                                ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome are destined to dissolution if the
                                eternal principles of progress were not complied with. You ask "is not the expression
                                'born of the spirit' a figurative way of speaking?" I do not think it is. Jesus told his
                                disciples that they "lmist be born of the spirit or they could not enter the kingdom of
                                heaven," and then he told them that the "kingdom of heaven was within," in their own
                                spiritual being and not in some far remote place or locality. Nay, my dear friend it is
                                not figurative, but real.<pb n="62" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 62 THE MANIFESTO. Every one that is
                                earnestly striving to evolve higher and better conditions in his life is traveling
                                towards the spiritual birth, to that condition where they can in truth be "born of the
                                spirit." Whether this spiritual birth is attained here or in the spirit world, it is the
                                final goal to which all mankind are traveling and will ultimately attain. I do not
                                believe that souls will be forever lost but they will have to suffer in tribulation
                                until they are willing to renounce the follies and sins of their lives and travel away
                                from them, some will be longer and some a shorter period of time in doing the work. The
                                resurrection as we understand the term is not a physical one but spiritual, and truly,
                                as Jesus said, "they neither marry nor are given in marriage." I use the term for the
                                want of a better one as a large majority of people only think of it in a material or
                                carnal sense ; when the true meaning of the word implies a union and that union may be a
                                spiritual one entirely removed from any carnal desires or relations. In my allusion to
                                the Heavenly Bridegroom and Bride I used the name in a figurative sense to indicate the
                                growth in the minds of the people of the true understanding of the Godhead in relation
                                to the Mother spirit. I do not claim that all of the evils that exist in our modern
                                social and political life are caused by not granting the right of suffrage to woman, but
                                I do assert and without fear of successful contradiction that unless man is willing to
                                recognize woman as something more than a political chattel classed with idiots and
                                insane, willing to have her stand by his side in perfect equality in the brother and
                                sisterhood of humanity just so surely will the strong hand of the iconoclast smash our
                                boasted civilization. In the words of Whittier:� "All grim with toil and brown with tan,
                                I saw a strong one in his wrath, Smiting the godless shrines of man along his path. O
                                justice, when will thy eyes be opened and thou be ready to mete out to all of earth's
                                children a true and righteous recompense? And when will mankind cease to be half
                                orphaned and acknowledge that beautiful truth that to be spiritually developed they must
                                have a Mother as much as they needed the maternal bearing spirit to unfold their earthly
                                existence. You say that man's intellectual superiority cannot be denied. I believe that
                                to use a homely phrase they are "six and a half dozen." That there are individual men
                                who are the intellectual and moral superiors of some women there is no doubt, and so
                                there are women that possess these qualifications in a greater degree than some men, but
                                ou the whole they stand equal. My dear friend, I have tried to make my reasons clear and
                                hope I have succeeded. Remember that it is a dangerous experiment to get into the path
                                of a cyclone, so it is not safe to say or do anything to hinder the onward march of man
                                to a higher comprehension of the duties and requirements of life. Should be pleased to
                                hear from you again at any time, and may your efforts to attain the truth be successful.

                                letter of Dec. 15th. We have seventy or more boarders in our charge, ranging from three
                                months to eighty-four years. Some are passing away with consumption and some from old
                                age. We know whereof we speak when we say that humauity is a mixed problem. O Elder
                                John! If the masses could be prevailed upon to live sober and be industrious, taking the
                                example of your people, what untold blessings would be in store for them while posterity
                                could truthfully bless their memory. God help us all as we look up to the hills from
                                whence comethour strength. Sad, indeed, must be the reflections of a misspent life.
                                Thank God, Elder John, with all our short-comings, to think that you and I are not
                                cursed with these sad memories. I often think of the influence that a Christian life had
                                upon me following the years of my engagements with you. It was the fork in the road of
                                my existence or journey, and I took to the right. Your idea is that in the ratio we aid
                                weak humanity we help ourselves up the grade of life. We cannot emphasize the fact too
                                strongly, that we help our own cause in life when smoothing off wherever we can, the
                                rough places in the pathway of weak humanity. To one person who came to our home, I
                                said, "If you will try and be a man among men, I shall help you," and he promised with
                                tears. In three months he was able to attend church in the city, and his most intimate
                                friends did not know him. Although there may have been some cases of failure, in our
                                trying to assist our fellow men, yet I shall lose no opportunity or courage in trying
                                again and again. In friendship and interest,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Jefts, George H." TEIform="persName"/>George H.

                            attempted to throw doubts on its gospel history, but now for over one hundred years they
                            have never explained in what way Mother Ann and her disciples, circumstanced as they were,
                            succeeded or could have succeeded, in propagating as we know they did, such a religion as
                            ours, supposing it to be not from God but from man. If we look to human transactions we will
                            find portions of history even those which no one has any doubt of, full of such strange
                            events that difficulties might be pointed out and objections raised even when it rests on
                            such satisfactory evidence as to be believed in spite of these objections. For instance in

                            convince some persons that the history could not be true, were it not so well attested as to
                            be believed notwithstanding all the difficulties. Persons should not think themselves bound
                            to renounce our faith if every objection that may be raised can not be answered to their
                            satisfaction, because many things must be believed, against which there are strong
                            objections that have never been completely answered, but let us think of the comforting
                            words of Jesus. "If any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of
                            God." The whole tone of Shakerism differs so widely in every particular from all other
                            religions that much difficulty must be expected to make converts, as it is unlike all that
                            has been described or imagined in-as-much as it practices and teaches all mankind to be pure
                            and upright, kind and humble, gentle, patient and self-denying. When we show the world how
                            suitable our life is to the needs of mankind, how it supplies such guidance, hope and
                            consolation as human nature requires, then we may expect a readiness on the part of many to
                            follow, not their own will, but the will of God and to receive whatever shall appear to come
                            from Him however contrary to their owa expectations or wishes and when in sincerity we have
                            embraced the Gospel of the second appearing of Christ and labored for that spiritual travail
                            without which our lives here are but as "sounding brass or a tinkling symbol" then we will
                            perceive that it does suit the real wants of man, as it quickly enlightens his judgment

                            life that will secure him the truest peace and comfort because "He that is Christ's, hath
                            crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts." Sometimes God leads us by a path that at
                            the time we think rough and thorny, but we find out afterwards that it is one of the short
                            cuts to happiness hereafter and is it not better, if the will of God be so that we suffer
                            for well-doing, even if in dark moments we may think we can not trace his hand, still trust
                            Him for "all things work together for good to those that love the Lord." It is well to
                            remember that all the objections which have been brought forward against Shakerism are so
                            far evidence in its favor, and whatever scorn may seemingly be felt towards a religion whose
                            founder was a woman and whose follows were persons of obscure station, it might be well to
                            exercise a little calm thought on the similarity between the first Shaker, Jesus, our Elder
                            Brother and his followers, and yet in spite of all this, Shakerism prevails and that it has
                            made its way as it has against so many obstacles and objections, is one of the strongest
                            proofs of its divine origin. Pray for what passeth human skill The power God's will to do,

                            acquainted with the miracle, that when ten thousand persons followed him to the desert to
                            catch the living words of truth as they fell from his lips, how through the agency of his
                            spiritual powers he fed them all with five loaves and two fishes, and then bade his
                            disciples "gather up the fragments that nothing be lost." Although several centuries have
                            elapsed it still retains a vital import, and teaches our souls a spiritual lesson. To those
                            who are earnest and intent to do all the good they can, this world will not seem like a
                            desert place; but rather its sunshine and shadow, its joys and sorrows will all appear as
                            fragments of the Divine Mind, preparing our spirits for higher realms of thought and action.
                            Who has not watched the unfolding of a bud, how it gathers into its being the warmth of the
                            sunbeam, the moisture of the dewdrop, also the breeze and shadow are requisite to unfold it
                            to the perfection of beauty. There are many golden treasures of good scattered along our
                            pathway, that too frequently we pass by, unheeded ; the circumstances of daily life, its
                            crosses and trials ; the look of sympathy, or the kind word of a friend ; the good that we
                            can derive from spiritual intercourse with others, do we fully utilize and absorb into our
                            interior beings the boundless wealth of these things? Perhaps we have failed to attain some
                            cherished object, thus our hopes are blighted, or, in the hours of weakness we have been led
                            astray by some temptation, we become sorrowing and downcast and our hearts are thus unarmed

                            fragments" to fortify our souls against the encroachments of evil. We are continually
                            weaving the tissues of our lives, by our daily thoughts and actions; the good that we do,
                            the beam of gladness that we send into another's heart, and the soul aspirations that we
                            cultivate, these things will never be lost to us, but will yield a blessed fruition of joy
                            in time and eternity ; if, on the contrary, we yield to the promptings of our lower selfhood
                            and vanquish the power of conscience, these things will also bring their legitimate reward
                            and darken our spirits with the shadow of evil; the aggregate of life is made up of
                            fragments. Oh, let us color our lives with the beautiful tintings of soul aspirations and
                            right doing. A scientist would tell us, that nothing is lost;� "The drop of dew that
                            trembles on the leaf or flower, Is but exhaled to fall anew in summer's thunder shower." We
                            may draw an illustration from the fading leaf; it falls to the ground withered and lifeless,
                            yet still it conserves a purpose to decay and nourish the tree that gave it life. In all the
                            vast universe the same law of economy is in constant operation, and it would seem that God
                            had written on the earth, the sea and the sky,-"Gather up the fragments that nothing be
                            lost." There are many that we might mention who have attained great good in various ways, by
                            improving the precious moments of time and never allowing a day to pass without b ing able
                            to record some attainment, some good stored away for future use. Let us be diligent,
                            therefore, and keep our hearts open to receive, then we- shall have no vain regrets over
                            wasted moments or lost golden opportunities; but our accumulation of wisdom and knowledge
                            will be a constant incentive to still "gather up the fragments that nothing be lost." Mt.

                            She had spent a long life, in full consecration to the principles of the gospel, counting no
                            sacrifice too great that would enable her to gain full and final victory over all sin.
                            Possessing a kind and charitable disposition toward all, we loved and cherished her many
                            noble Christian traits of character. She was a fearless champion of the cause of gospel

                            which come home to every individual experience of more or less importance, and that which
                            does not appeal to our intelligence, our love of humanity, our wisdom, our Christianity, has
                            seemingly been sown on barren ground. Is not the beginning of a New Year to every soul, the
                            commencement of good resolutions, and firm resolves, that will bring peace and satisfaction,
                            if each one seeing the necessity of reform shall practice it daily, and advocate it at all
                            times. Into every human life there comes an hour when the brand of the interpreter of human
                            thought is thrown, kindling the fire of selfexamination and criticism, calling upon each
                            individual to pour out ttuoffering of his life upon the shrine of truth, justice, and mercy,
                            that will take hold of humanity with a spirit to shape its destiny. The New Year should be
                            the beginning of decision against wrong, a starting point for individual growth, and the
                            awakening of higher aspirations after the true principles of religion. Purity, and

                                maintaining a "Separation from the life of the world." In the world, but not of the
                                world was one among the many precious sayings of the Teacher. He knew the value of the
                                position. It was not that one should become a recluse and waste away his ability for
                                doing good among his fellow men, to bury his God given gift in the earth, and then live
                                in exclusive selfishness. Such a life would be anything but creditable to those who
                                professed to be honorable men and women. Our lives were not given to us to be of no more
                                value than to eat, drink and sleep, and then perish. Life with us is the work of
                                progression, the advancing from one degree of excellence to another in the interests of
                                mankind. The monks of Egypt who fled to the mountains and to the caves in their
                                separation from the active duties of the world, are no example for the men and women of
                                to-day. Idleness, indolence and sensuality became the inseparable companions of such an
                                unnatural course, and at the close of their career the world was made worse for their
                                system of ignorant self-denial. The manhood of man and the womanhood of woman should not
                                be ignored, nor foolishly left to waste away in an unprofitable manner. No system of
                                religion can ever be introduced for the happiness of mankind and retain within itsc If
                                the elements of success, if it fails to make man better, both temporally and
                                spiritually, and increases, purifies and establishes his whole beingr in the work of
                                doing gojd. To separate one's self from the world in accordance with the testimony of
                                Jesus, is to turn from the wickedness that is in the world, to turn from all
                                unrighteousness that has like noxious plants grown up in the hearts of men, and made

                                illustrates, most beautifully, for the Christian, the motto which is quite universally
                                used throughout the country as individuals struggle for a sure position in life. "In
                                union there is strength." A body of Christians who have covenanted together to
                                consecrate their lives and all they may possess, for the happiness and prosperity of
                                their fellow men, are more able, in their united efforts to accomplish this laudable
                                enterprise, than they could in the isolated condition in which the world live. Their
                                assistance to each other in all that pertains to the interests of this life, to their
                                economy, prudence and general management, can be advanced many fold beyond what it could
                                be in any other system of organization. This hundred fold blessing which Jesus
                                prophesied should be the legitimate fruit of a Christian Community has already been so
                                wonderfully realized, in its every phase, that a worldly-wise class, of eagle eyed
                                penetration has charged it upon the Order that such a life is more selfish than is that
                                of the world. It is an escape, say they, of the thousand and one burdens that must be
                                borne in a life devoted to domestic interest or to the labors of a devoted
                                philanthropist. Observed in the light of a man of this world, there is much reason for
                                the statement which savors strongly of the wisdom which the Apostle says "descendeth not
                                from above, but is earthly and sensual." James iii., 15. That those who have entered
                                into a Community may become selfish and even indolent, and then consume these best gifts
                                of God upon their lives of selfishness and lust need not for a moment be questioned.
                                This is the devouring element of "filthy dreamers" "who have run greedily after the
                                error of Balaam." Like weeds in a neglected garden which crowd out the beautiful plants,
                                so will an amalgamation with the sins of the world crowd out God's precious gift to man.
                                Faithfulness to duty would have saved the garden and faithfulness to duty would add
                                prosperity to the Community, while the same results that follow a neglected garden will
                                follow with equal force a Community, a family or a neglected soul.</p></div3><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p">Unfortunately, the "Home Notes" from Watervliet, N. Y. by Elder Isaac Anstatt, were

                                month, we could not anticipate the arrival of our neat little Monthly. Coming as it does
                                laden with items from the North, South, East and West, it is really a Carrier Dove, and
                                has at least scored one point, toward a concentration of our forces. We have just
                                received from the hands of the binders, the latest volumes of the "Manifesto" and now
                                having the set entire in our Church Library, we feel it to be a valuable acquisition
                                thereto. No more worthy volume is found in our entire list (which is no meager
                                collection) and why should it not be so. Turning its pages, we find the contributions of
                                so many of our worthies, now passed to spirit life; and still many more living
                                representatives, of the faith, who write of what they know, because experience has
                                taught them. When we read something particularly good, how it enhances its value to know
                                that the author's thoughts are the outgrowth of life principles, and if "Thoughts are
                                Things," are we not ennobled by the reading of a book, directed entire, to a life of
                                virtue, and an unselfish devotion to its cause. But these Notes are of the "Manifesto"
                                not of Home. The severe weather here as elsewhere in our latitude closes us in. But the
                                spiritual life like the roots beneath the ice, is vigorous, which is manifest, by the
                                spiritual communion we enjoy when the Church and Center Families, meet alternately in
                                our places of worship, through the winter. Though nominally two Families, still we are
                                of one interest, both spiritual and temporal, and our joys and sorrows are mutual.
                                February thus far has given us wide extremes of weather, and we hardly know from hour to
                                hour, whether we need umbrellas or furs. The Brethren are out one day chopping away the
                                ice to let the surplus flood of water down into the proper drain, and perhaps in
                                twenty-four hours are chopping again to find some water. Our water privileges are great,
                                and our water excellent, but this we are too unmindful of, until some little disturbance
                                in the channels, causes a halt in the usual abundant flow. It is then that we are
                                reminded of the maxim: "Pleasures and privileges, like birds of gay plumage, are better
                                seen when on the wing." Amelia J.

Fresh cabbage is an excellent food for hens in winter, it stimulates and
                                gives exercise that healthy layers must have. This is worthy of trial. Cabbage should be
                                kept in a cool place, handy to the poultry house, a supply of it should be stored in
                                November. The lime and soda phosphate contained in the cabbage is essentially valuable
                                to laying hens when out-door exercise is out of the question While chickens are young
                                and growing, the albuminoids and nitrogenous foods should be fed largely to promote the
                                growth of flesh, muscle, bone and feathers. Two weeks before marketing, cracked corn and
                                corn meal are best. We tried this plan last season with marked success. Daniel Orcutt.

                                but little change for the past six weeks. It has been a remarkably dry season, and to be
                                deprived of water almost entirely in such a cold time adds much to the burdens of the
                                day. We are drawing water in barrels for the Laundry and Dairy use, but with care we
                                have water for cooking purposes from the spring which is very low. The stock are all
                                driven to the meadow some distance from the barn, where by use of a pump they are
                                supplied. About a week since thei'e was a nice shower which lasted two hours and every
                                pailful was caught which it was possible to obtain. We have an excellent supply of ice,
                                1500 cakes. We are now making preparations for putting new heating aparatus into our
                                dwelling house, as the intense cold weather necessitates something more desirable than
                                our present mode and also to save expense and labor. We have a fine springin the meadow

                                a wind engine. Health of all good. At this date the icy traveling is severe on both man

We had quite a bleak cold winter for Southern Ohio, up to about the 2(&gt;th

                                rational plan of eating and drinking, a land flowing with, not the luxury of animal food
                                and foreign narcotic poisons, but the milk and honey of intellectual and spiritual
                                enjoyment? It is a solemn fact, that the expense of living on animal food over that of
                                food at first hand (fruits, cereals, vegetables) is in the surprising ratio of 40 tol!

                                family or Society would resolve to cease making grave-yards of their stomachs and
                                undertake the sublime etherializing experiment of Daniel and his three Colleagues in
                                Babylon. I should want to belong to that band of reformers if there should be but three
                                of them. I don't mean that such should merely cease eating flesh, fish or fowl, but I
                                mean that they should take all their diet at first hand and abjure the use of flesh,
                                fish, fowl, milk, cream, eggs, butter, tea, coffee, whiskey, wine and tobacco; allowing
                                however unfermented or sweet cider and the unfermented juice of any fruits or berries if
                                desired. We should not only save the direct expense of the old kinds of food but the
                                indirect expense of the wear and tear of the human machine in producing it, and the
                                still greater one of Doctors' bills and the waste of time and toil of both nurses and
                                sick patients. "Hands at work and hearts to God" is a most excellent precept and its
                                benefits cannot be too highly estimated. But my common sense teaches me that Mother
                                never meant by that, that any man, much less any woman should be employed in physical
                                drudgery from nine to sixteen hours a day and even at that never catch any nearer up
                                with his or her work after all. This state of .things however we have brought upon
                                ourselves. We are almost perfectly absorbed, engulfed, swamped so to speak, in temporal
                                subjects and interests, to the exclusion of intellectual and spiritual thoughts,
                                conversation and elevation of mind into the higher and holier regions of spiritual
                                existence. Any one attempting to converse freely on these higher themes, is supposed to
                                be "getting good too fast" or going crazy. Why not, as you proposed years ago, all meet
                                together somewhere and talk about these matters and see if some better status of
                                physical, mental and above all, spiritual progress cannot be developed? For my part I am
                                tired of wallowing around in a luxurious, almost voluptuous sink of expensive and
                                hurtful "riotous living," with its attendant sickness, blasting and spiritual death. Now
                                I guess I'll stop after that explosion of my true inwardness, and try to think about
                                something more cheering. Oliver C.

                                side-walks with a sheet of ice, giving possible delight to the little folks not

                                course the completed and unperfected soul to its final home; its ever changing seasons
                                giving to mankind, opportunities to sow and reap the products of good or ill, as
                                dictated by the cravings of the moral and mental faculties. Before many days a new
                                season will be ushered in by the immutable laws governing the universe; wise are they
                                who take father time in season, accept and utilize the valuable life lesson contained in
                                the couplet,� "Honor and fume from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all the
                                honor lies." An honorable life calls into action, every function of the mind which
                                harmonizes with God's great plan of soul evolution; in unflinching hostility to sin,
                                making war for the inexorable truths of God, as against licentiousness, avarice and
                                every other species of moral turpitude. Its subjects vaunteth not themselves unseemly,
                                but with humility do good and thus grow good; the noble hearted, sounding the glad news

                                Such is our high calling, gospel kindred everywhere; as Society conditions cry aloud for
                                constant congregated zeal in furthering' its welfare, let us not abate our energy in
                                doing the duties requisite to soul and mind improvement; thinking less of the
                                non-essentials of life, and giving more weight to the principles embodying our Church,
                                which add solidity and true culture to the character; those traits which gather, hold
                                and guide aright souls yearning for purity of life. We report the coldest winter here
                                for many years. Notwithstanding all this, we are remarkably free from colds and
                                epidemics of every nature, and are able to hold regularly our devotional, social and
                                reading services, which are sources of profit and pleasure. We extend best wishes to
                                all, and especial sympathy for those who have sustained the loss of valued friends. "If

I wonder if you have had as much cold weather in New Hampshire as we have in

                                thick, I thought that yours must be a milder climate than ours. Our Brethren commenced
                                cutting ice for ourselves and townsmen in December and before they had finished the

                                inches thick. It has been cold, colder and coldest, and not having had the protection of
                                the snow one of our aqueducts has suspended operations until sometime next June, the
                                frost having penetrated down to and below it. Old Boreas has driven the same into houses
                                and cellars making the building of fires necessary to save our vegetables. The bursting
                                of water pipes has tried the patience of our Brethren not a little, and still they have
                                maintained a Christian spirit. We thank God for our Brethren. Notwithstanding all this
                                cold weather there is still a complaint of too little snow to haul wood and lumber.
                                However, we all live and have had much less sickness than last winter with its mild
                                weather. How happy the thought that this cold world is not our abiding place or

The harvesting angel has made us two visits within the last three weeks. The
                                first time he took away our aged Sister Lucy Field. She had long been very feeble, and
                                was waiting to be called home, so we could but be reconciled when she was released from
                                her sufferings. His last call was on the 9th inst. when he took one of our most precious
                                lambs, even the choicest of the flock, our dear sister Mary Ella Douglas. We were not
                                wholly unprepared for the change, but when the final blow came, we found it was very
                                hard to bear the sorrow of parting. During the past week Br. Henry Green of Alfred has
                                been with us assisting in preparing material for some of our sale work. We were glad to
                                have our good brother with us, if only for a short time. His believer-like spirit has
                                left its influence with us to abide. Our school closes the present month. Eighteen

                                    vehemently at the other end thereof, and did look very grave and calflike, and the
                                    smoke of their torment as- j cended up forever and ever. And the cultivation thereof
                                    became a great and mighty business on the earth, and the merchant-men waxed rich by
                                    the commerce thereof. And it came to pass that the saints of the Most High defiled
                                    themselves therewith; even the poor who could not buy shoes, nor bread, nor books
                                    for their little ones, spent their money for it. And the Lord was greatly displeased
                                    therewith and said: "Wherefore this waste; why do these little ones lack bread and
                                    shoes and books? Turn now your fields into corn and wheat, and put this evil thing
                                    far from you and be separate, and defile not yourselves any more, and I will bless
                                    you and cause my face to shine on you." "But with one accord they all exclaimed, "We

                            Come away from the strife and sin of a worldly life and be at rest forever. It is a present
                            rest. How soothing is the sentiment, the true cross-bearer finds soul rest. Not only is the
                            self-denying way pleasant and safe, but there axe heavenly guides to cheer and direct our
                            footsteps. "Come unto me." What a heavenly call to the sin-sick soul that is groping in
                            darkness, seeking rest and finding none. In a sinful life there is continual unrest. The
                            immortal soul can be satisfied with nothing short of the forgiveness, protection and love of
                            God. "All ye that labor." The invitation is unqualified. For the erring, the
                            sin-burdened�all who will may partake of the waters of life freely. In the world there is
                            tribulation, no shield from trouble and sin, but in Christ there is peace and rest. How
                            blessed to be at rest in Him. Sheltered in his peaceful fold we are safe for time, safe for
                            eternity. The Manifesto grows in value from month to month. We wish its visits were weekly.
