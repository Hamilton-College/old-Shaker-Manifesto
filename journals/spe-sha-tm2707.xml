TEIform="persName"/> By Elder Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> IS there auy value in a name aside from the work which the name has wrought out? As a
                            religicus body we have given ourselves a name and we have thought that it represented an
                            order of religious life. Others have seen fit to give us another name which they thought
                            would designate us better than the one already in use. It seems that it is the good or ill
                            fortune of many religious denominations to be provided with a name, not of their own
                            forming; but its value to the Society depends very much upon the influence it produces in
                            their own home and also among the children of this world from whence it came. Some of these
                            names at first were given in derision, and upon which the Merry Andrews have played to
                            please their silly listeners, but subsequently these same names became the honorable and
                            honored sign of Society, which like the Sun of Righteousness arose with healing in his
                            wings. The Primitive Church was not permitted to enjoy the simple name "Disciples of Jesus,"
                            but were soon laughed at as "Nazarenes," or men who had taken a set of vows that kept them,
                            more or less out of society. The several forms of religious doctrine that have followed in
                            the order of time have shared the same experience. The Holy, Apostolic, Catholic Church, is
                            known as the Roman Catholic, and another Holy, Catholic Church is known as King Henry's
                            Church. The Methodists were known by the name of Ranters, and the Baptists as Dippers, while
                            the more quiet and humble Friends are universally known as Quakers. <pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Our
                            Church name, so significant of the religious life that we have accepted "United Society-of
                            Believers" has been largely laid aside and that which was brought forward by the enemies of
                            the cross of the Christ, is now our accepted name before the world. But why did the sons of
                            Belial call our gospel fathers and mothers by the peculiar name of Shakers? We may expect
                            that those good God-fearing pioneers who loved righteousness and hated iniquity were worthy
                            of the designation and demonstrated by their zealous forms of worship, and their quotations
                            from Scripture that they also hated the spirit of the world, that they might become the
                            friends of God. One of their familiar quotations was from the prophet Haggai, ii., 6.�"Thus
                            saith the Lord of Hosts. It is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth,
                            and the sea and the dry land. I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall
                            come, and I will fill this house with glory." From the use of these Scripture quotations
                            came the name of Shaker. It is a good Dictionary word but it has no honor of being
                            classical. Does this say that the rabble knows better how to name a religious body
                            appropriately than do these religionists how to name themselves? We might with all propriety
                            ask,�What is there in a name? The Revelator, under an inspirational influence breathes forth
                            this loving word,�"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will
                            give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he
                            that receiveth it." This was the beautiful promise from the spirit of God, and the new name
                            was of inestimable value. Written as it was by the finger of God in the white stone, it
                            became a most precious treasure. In this case the new name could not be tarnished by unclean
                            hands, nor injured by the voice of the unregenerate heart. But religious societies are no
                            better for the acceptance of one or more names which are used to designate them among
                            men,�even if used with deep religious significations as Christian, Apostolic or Evangelical;
                            nor are they the worse for being known by the opposite class of names as Heretic, Infidel or
                            Schismatic. The good and the bad occupy, unmolested, the same pages of history, and dwell
                            side by side in their silent homes. This strange record begins with the race of man. We have
                            the two brothers, Cain and Abel, then Esau and Jacob and among the long list of the right
                            and wrong we find Alexander, Peter, John and James with Judas, Nero and Attilla. Then
                            Augustus, Henry the VIII, Napoleon, Washington and Benedict Arnold. And yet there may be
                            great power for good in a name that has an honorable record attacht to it for deeds of mercy
                            and love and charity in the interest of the human family and men are made better as they
                            read or think of those who have given their lives to God for the good of mankind. Before one
                            name it is said,�"Every knee shall bow and every tongue <pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> confess," but
                            with our present understanding we should suppose that the very foundations of the earth
                            would tremble to bring this about. In this work the Shakers are at home as sons and
                            daughters of the living God. They can have but one testimony, and that will be�Truth. Those
                            who have any light from God, even in the least degree, should let that light shine. To
                            neglect this duty is to fall into darkness and ultimately into death. We can take a review
                            of the past and there read what God has designed to do in the earth. Isaiah tells us that
                            the Lord will shake terribly the earth and that men shall cast away their idols of gold and
                            of silver and hide themselves among the rocks through fear of the Lord. That mighty
                            visitation will be the day of the willing and unwilling Shakers, when that only which is on
                            a sure foundation will be able to stand. In this wonderful work that will extend throughout
                            the whole world, those who are interested in the elevation of manhood and womanhood, whether
                            it be in civil or religious liberty, will be denominated the friends of God, as they are the
                            friends of humanity. They will work with and for God and by their lives of unselfishness and
                            of honesty and of strict self-denial, they will help to shake the earth from all that
                            fetters either the body or mind. Should we prove unfaithful to our name and to our trust, we
                            know without a doubt, that the end is death. Nehemiah the prophet has written,�"God will
                            shake every man from his house and from his labor that does not keep his promise," to walk
                            uprightly. Time only is needed to verify the truthfulness of this word by the prophet, as we
                            are the witnesses of its fulfillment on every side. There is no escape even down to the
                            third and fourth generation if the law of God is violated. To be called of God is not an
                            idle story. It means active labor, and here it is,�"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
                            all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind and with all thy strength," and
                            when this is consummated then will come that beautiful promise of God,�"To him that
                            overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in
                            the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it." Every
                            religious denomination has a special work, which points more or less directly toward the
                            life of our divine Teacher, and in this righteousness, will have the reward of "well done."
                            Whatever this may be for humanity, we need not occupy their ground. Our lines are well
                            drawn. Our work is distinct from all others, and our name is significant of the work which
                            we have espoused and will be our witness before the world. If like the wise virgins we keep
                            our lamps trimmed and burning, we may hope to find a place in the ranks of the redeemed and
                            be able to enter into the Holy City, the habitation of our God. East Canterbury, N.

TEIform="persName"/> Alonzo G. Hollister.</byline><p TEIform="p"> MOTHER ANN told a certain Sister that she would find her nature like the coats of an onion.
                            When she had stript off one, she would find another under it, and so on till she came to the
                            core. What is the core of human life ? Is it not the heart with its varied affections and
                            interests ? "The heart is the governing part. 'Tis the heart the hand doth wait for."" The
                            outside coats of an onion, unfold from within. They are not put on as are our earthly
                            garments. The matter composing them, is drawn from the soil by fine rootlets, and from air
                            by the leaves, and the vital chemistry of the plant, forms within and thrusts outward the
                            matter which constitutes the exterior coats of the vegetable. Just so with the human being
                            spiritually. The garments worn by the spirit are not manufactured from foreign substances
                            and put on from outside as our earthly garments. The garment of the human spirit is its
                            character. The least spiritual of my readers know what character is. They know it is not
                            made as a mechanic makes a machine. It is not woven in an iron or wooden loom. It is not cut
                            out of some stuff by a pattern and sewed together as a tailor makes garments from cloth. Yet
                            in speaking figuratively we say without being misunderstood character is woven in the loom
                            of life. In the upright and virtuous it is formed by pattern, Jesus Christ being the purest
                            and best. But there are many patterns of particular virtues and graces. Hence we say he or
                            she is a pattern of meekness. Another is a pattern of industry, another of constancy and
                            faithfulness in duty, another of self-control all of which virtues and many others are
                            elements of the true Christian character. One may be a pattern of all these and many more.
                            Whoever give? serious, thought to this subject can see that character is not a sudden
                            creation nor is it subject to transfer but it grows from the heart of the wearer or from
                            within outward. The finer, vital and more sensitive part is within. The coarser, tougher,
                            less impressible part is without as protector and conserver of that which is within. The
                            heart has its rootlets of affection which are like magnets that draw from whatever the
                            thoughts feed upon, the material which is elaborated in the mind and thrust forth in
                            conduct, whereby it is made fast in the web of life. In this way we are continually weaving
                            our spiritual garments out of our affections, our thoughts and our conduct. Now it is plain
                            that if our hearts are pure, and our affections clean no defiled thing can enter nor adhere
                            to become part of our spiritual garment. If it pass in review or jostle us in the crowd it
                            will be put aside as with tongs and leave no shade nor stain upon the perfect transparency
                            of our minds. And if we subject ourselves to order, fulfilling all stipulations of our
                            covenant in the gospel there will be no break <pb n="101" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> nor flaw in the
                            character we weave. It will be that of wise and noble sons and daughters, of God. Our
                            thoughts when free from service required by temporal duties instead of turning to the world
                            for satisfaction, will be attracted to the higher and substantial things of our existence.
                            We shall delight in meditating on the things that belong to our peace that we may draw from
                            thence the jewels of Christian grace and virtue which will adorn our conduct and beautify
                            ou*r spirits. Such souls are co-workers with God and thereby add to the felicity and glory
                            of heaven, making a heaven wherever they dwell. But if the heart is impure, what then? Jesus
                            taught, From within, out of the heart, proceeds evil reasoning, i. e. false reasoning. The
                            natural heart of man is the field in which the Father sowed only good seed, but the enemy
                            while men slept, or were careless or thoughtless, neglecting their true interest, sowed his
                            tares. Jesus said to the Pharisees who were relying on ceremonial performances for
                            justification,�Ye appear unto men to fast, but God knows your hearts. Hypocrites make clean
                            the outside of the cup and platter but within are full of extortion and all manner of
                            excess. First make clean the inside of the cup or platter, the heart, which leavens all, and
                            the outside will be clean also. The Apostle tells us,�The law can not take away sin, nor
                            make the comers thereto perfect, because it was weak through the flesh, the works of which
                            it condemned without abolishing them. It was given to restrain transgression ; to bind man's
                            lawless nature till the seed should come whose are the promises of eternal redemption. This
                            refers to the woman's seed that was to crush the Serpent's head, the sensual nature, and
                            purify the heart by confession and repentance. All the righteousness of the world and all
                            its systems of religion can not take away sin from the heart. They may restrain sinful
                            desires within narrowl imits and the most virtuous do, but only by continual conflict. The
                            gospel of Christ in a virgin life, as taught in his second appearing,� the gospel of the
                            harvest of the world through cross bearing,�the gospel which proclaims the season of God's
                            judgment now come, obeyed, will take away sin completely and so purify the heart that sin
                            can not return. Those worldly professors claiming to be rightful interpreters of the will of
                            God to man who teach that it is impossible to keep the commandments of God and to live in
                            this world without sinning, do thereby accuse God of being arbitrary, unjust, tyrannous and
                            cruel, severely punishing his creatures for not doing impossible things. Such have evidently
                            adopted a false ideal of God and are blinded by the false prophet who teaches lies in the
                            name of God and of religion for gain and whose end is destruction in the second death. The
                            true prophet teaches us to crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts on the daily
                            cross of Christ and to expose all its hidden works to the <pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> light in his
                            Witnesses. This cross and the testimony of truth that attends it is the ax that is laid at
                            the root of the tree of human depravity to hew it down and cast it into the fire of truth
                            which every true Christian must necessarily pass through to become refined and separated
                            from the dross of nature. For as the Apostle saye,�They that are in the flesh can not please
                            God, because the carnal mind is enmity against God. It is not subject to the law of God
                            neither can it bo. It is therefore lawless and all who yield to be led by it are its
                            bond-slaves and come under the same category of inability and lawlessness. May all my young
                            readers carefully attend to the following reflection. Our material bodies are like a
                            chemical laboratory wherein the vital action extracts the finest essences of food, drink and
                            air which are used by the spirit in constructing its future mansion or psychic body in which
                            it must dwell and which it takes with it until it has ripened for further change. In this
                            body is the record or stored up fruits of all the deeds and experiences of things done in
                            the body and they can be read like an open book by comrades and superiors in the spirit
                            spheres,�except those which have been erased by confession and repentance. As it is easier
                            to change the forms of figures while they are being woven into cloth than it is after the
                            piece is finisht and taken out of the loom so it is easier to weave beautiful spiritual
                            garments by carefully regulating our motives and conduct while in time by the law and
                            testimony of the gospel, than it will be afterward to remove the effects of negligence and
                            exchange deformity for the splendors which would have been and are the result of discipline
                            in the way of the pure heart. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Retrospect and farewell. A tribute to D. Clinton Brainard" TEIform="index"/> RETROSPECT AND

                            Or strike the harp of life and make it dumb Before thy thought had any pulse of fear. But
                            when it came we felt the sudden pain And awe that mingles sorrow with surprise, The
                            sharpness of the tension-weight of strain That he can bring upon our tenderest ties. And
                            tender were the ties that formed the bond With thee our brother, tender, close and strong,
                            Yet with reliance on the world beyond We say to grief "Thy time is not for long!" The law of
                            sorrow has its work to do, <pb n="103" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> We must accept it in its highest sense, The
                            storms of winter late in fury blew, But bloom of promise now is recompense. We could not
                            penetrate the dreary cloud, But trust and memory taught of coming spring, We may not pierce
                            these heavy glooms that shroud, Yet faith and gratitude their solace bring. We were
                            sustained through trials hard to bear, Let us give thanks, and ask for aid anew, Let us bow
                            down in sweet dependent prayer, Let us again our covenant renew. Our loss is great, our
                            brother stood the tests That challenge all who tread the upward way, Met them sublimely,
                            there the glory rests That made his life a blessing and a stay. The ancients of the people
                            oft recalled The little child that into wonders pried, The gentle youth by faith and duty
                            walled. The manhood lofty in its native pride. Named for the Governor�-his father's friend�
                            Endowed with statesman's dignity and grace, With kindred proud who glad their powers would
                            lend To lead him on to wealth, to fame and place. 'Twas thus the kingdoms of the world were
                            spread Beneath ambition's mountain, and the voice Of the old luring tempter archly plead,
                            Yet he lookt up and made his heavenly choice. Again when war produced the torturing draft,
                            And men were mad with valor, greed and fear, Some called him "Captain," while they mocking
                            laughed And claimed him as "recruiting volunteer." But still he walked unharmed, aloof,
                            serene, His mind his fortress and his faith his tower, From which the will of God for earth
                            was seen, From which he saw the dragon's cruel power. His first brave leaders past the
                            mystic bound, Companions sometimes faltered, fell or died, Yet with the true he firmly held
                            his ground. And on the truth his inner soul relied. We give him honor such as angels prize,
                            And wealth of love that earth could never buy; Happy his place among the pure and wise And
                            bright the fields that now before him lie. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="If you know aught against another's name..." TEIform="index"/>

                                unpleasantly cool chilly vernal season. Spring has been a week or more later than last
                                year. Altho it has continued cold until the close of May, yet we have not had vegetation
                                nor fruit injured by frost; for this we are thankful. Our crops, except fodder corn are
                                planted. This has been done by the Brethren, with cheerfulness and pleasure. We have
                                releast our hired help with the exception of two. This reduces our expenses from last
                                year $2000 for hired help This is so much gain temporally and spiritually. The sooner
                                Believers depend upon themselves without hiring, the better off they will be. We have
                                planted six and one half acres of potatoes, two and one half acres of sweet corn, eight
                                acres of oats and several acres of fodder corn. We are also able to do our own
                                mechanical work. On May 8, Elder Wm. Wilson and Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H.,
                                arrived here and we spent a week with them very pleasantly and profitably. May 14, they
                                went to Hancock. With but few exceptions the family and Community are in usual health.
                                May 11, we were startled by a telephone announcement of the death of Elder D. C.
                                Brainard. The funeral of the deceased was held at 2 o'clock, May 13th, in the Meeting
                                Hall of the Church family. Several friends not of our Society were in attendance. Such
                                is life! to-day, apparently, we are full of life and vigor; to-morrow we sleep the sleep
                                eternal. Calvin G. Heed. North Family. June, 1897. The rare quality of June weather is
                                better exprest in poetry than in experience in this latitude. Mitchell came nearer the
                                truth than did Lowell when he wrote that "June usually came in with a cold in her head
                                and a shawl wrapt closely around her," but in the "Vision of Sir Launful," Lowell struck
                                the key-note of a happier thought, and while human hearts admire the beautiful, his
                                wonderful picture poem will be repeated. So much for an introduction to the far
                                weightier items of interest. Eldress Anna White and Sisters Lydia Staples, Julia Lincoln
                                and May Kullhausen have painted three hundred and twenty-five windows twice over. This
                                represents an amount of labor and patience which it is difficult for some of us to
                                realize. The dining-room of which we wrote as undergoing repairs two months ago, is <pb n="105" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> finisht and is very handsome in its rich coverings of wood and
                                varnish. Seven varieties of timber were used and we will promise to see any number of
                                our Brethren and Sisters out of the woods who choose to meet us there. S'ster Maria Blow
                                who has been quite sick for some weeks has recovered and is as ready as ever to help and
                                bless. We have just received a box of pond lily roots from Enfield, N. H. They bring
                                to mind the recent visit of Elder William Wilson and Br. Frank Theobald, the only fault
                                to be found with their visit was that they brought no Sisters with them. In our family
                                meetings we have adopted the plan of having the Sisters conduct the services alternately
                                with the Brethren and think it both wise and just and in accoi'dance with the principles

                                season. In this section of the state the spring rains have more than equalled that of
                                the two preceding seasons. As we reviewed the list recorded in the June Manifesto

                                we realized that our friends are passing one by one from our mortal sight. But why
                                should we be sad? Steadily the procession moves on and we lose sight of the head of the
                                column,� but only for a little while and then the joy of our heavenly reunion. Since our
                                last communication we have witnessed the translation of one of the veteran souls who
                                gave all they had to the cause. On the 17th of May our gospel Mother Lydia Dole was
                                received into that mansion not made with hands. Over sixty years had been spent in the
                                Community and many of them, years of heavy burden and care for the people. Such are
                                numbered with those that the Revelator saw "who had come up out of great tribulation and
                                made their garments clean and white." Heavenly Father and Mother we thank thee for the
                                inspiration and blessing that comes from such as these, for in their presence there is
                                no darkness nor death but all is light and life.

                                stated in his last Note, brings to mind the text, "First that which is natural then that
                                which is spiritual." The outgrowth of the law of evolution; from earth life developt and
                                spiritualized as intelligence masters <pb n="106" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> all forces and habits that
                                are akin to animal life. To affirm that there were individualized spirits without first
                                being vested in materiality, not only explodes the immutability of nature's Laws, which
                                throughout all ages have ever chimed out the fact, first the seed, then the blade, after
                                which the fruit; typical of progressive human life, but also heralds the fact that God's
                                work was a failure; for degeneration began after his construction of the Adam's family.
                                Reason can not view the Infinite, individualized with characteristics of a butcher and a
                                sensualist. Therefore, the honored, dearly cherisht poem of mythology, "God made man in
                                his own image," should become as obsolete as monarchal government in America. Mere
                                tradition that conflicts with scientific facts as regards human creation, is as
                                unsatisfactory to the light of reason, as must have been the results to our young
                                kindred of Sabbathday Lake, who "fisht all day and caught none." In the valley of
                                meditation I culled a flower of soliloquy; its petals of thought, questioning, "Is it
                                possible for any class of people to deal with each other as they would be done by, under
                                the pressure of such vastly different ideas of things essential and non-essential?" The
                                glorious failure of the Greeks in behalf of the opprest Cretans, the lamentable, cruel
                                conditions of the Cubans and home affairs, all present many answers, but the bell of
                                brevity rings down the curtain of silence for this time. George It.

June,�the month whose praises poets have sung, whose bright days are so
                                joyfully anticipated through the cold season preceding them, is with us. But how
                                different is the reality from the picture. Since her entrance not a cloudless day have
                                we seen, but steadily night and day, with only slight pauses, in which to gain renewed
                                force, the rain has descended. Some few days ago a slight tremor of the earth was telt
                                by several members of our family, but as it ocurred at night and was of short duration
                                it was attributed to a strong imagination. But upon reading of the earthquake shocks
                                felt in different parts of the country, our belief was confirmed, that we also had
                                received a slight touch of the shock. A company of Sisters attended a meeting held in
                                the Baptist Church of Pittsfield for the purpose of listening to a sermon delivered by
                                the Eev. John McNeill, the Scotch evangelist who has conducted revivals in many
                                countries, and received a hearty welcome in our own. His address was plain, pointed,
                                pleasant, practical and interesting to all. We would encourage all such workers, for
                                like the forerunner, who so many years ago taught the necessity of repentance, they are
                                preparing the hearts of men for the reception of divine truth,� opening the field of the
                                world to receive the seeds of spiritual life. We, who claim a wider knowledge, who by
                                divine mercy, have been given a clearer light, should welcome all such evidences of the
                                world's advancement. Grateful for our light realizing the responsibility of extending it
                                to others, applying our faith to daily life, thus proving its practical value. Not
                                echoing the Pharisaical prayer "God, I thank thee, I am not as other men are," but "I am
                                thankful I am not tempted as they." We received a very pleasant call from Elder William
                                Wilson and Frank Theobald of Enfield, N. H. and we hope the visit will be renewed at
                                some future time.

                                his ax upon his shoulder and enters the wild woods, soon rinds unseen difficulties in
                                his way, as to working a home of wealth and comfort. His motto is�"Nothing venture,
                                nothing have," and he enters upon his allctted work, when by continued perseverance he
                                begins to see that all his efforts are not a failure. The truly courageous man or woman
                                is the one who is going to succeed, and he must apply intelligence, thought and his best
                                judgment to the question in hand. He must abide by the results, till new light brings
                                something better to view. Our cool, invigorating weather has now changed to the severity
                                of summer heat, and for a few days old Sol has sent out his rays with the greatest
                                intensity. The nier cury stands at 90 deg. and we shall in all probability have settled
                                weather for the next four months,�and this will be the rainy season. The heat will be
                                somewhat modified by frequent showers, and the farmer will have a good chance to plant
                                his sweet potatoes. We are having a few visitors from the surrounding towns to
                                investigate our material success. We hold very closely to the testimony of Mother Ann
                                Lee,�"Hands at work and hearts to God." All success in a life of virtue is gained by a
                                willing heart with willing hands. Our crop of rice is beginning to put on new life, and
                                our peach trees are springing forward as by magic. The pine-apples are ripening and
                                everything is saying,� "With a little patience you will build up a good home in

                                things that the farm produces. Two or three of the houses have been visited with a coat
                                of paint, and under this special privilege they form a conspicuous contrast with those
                                less fortunate. Several rods of new fence have added to the va}ue and beauty of our
                                earthly home, while a visit from the painter to other fences that so sadly needed a new
                                coat, now gives joy to every one who pass s on the street. Some several years ago every
                                new building must have a flat roof and this must be covered with gravel or tin.
                                Sometimes old things pass away, and sometimes things not so old. Most of these flat
                                roofs have not proved satisfactory. At the present time one of these roofs is being
                                removed and a gable roof covered with shingles takes its place. Farewell to the honey
                                bees. The last colony has gone. Some have been lost through improper care during the
                                winter, wink, the bee thieves have also secured a' share. We may not have so much honey
                                and we may not have so many bee stings. This however, is the first time since 18(30 that
                                we have been without a c ilony of honey bees. The bird that interests us the most at
                                present is the Whip-poor-will. In the early morning and just after the closing of the
                                day, he comes quite near to the buildings and gives a private recital of his peculiar
                                and interesting song. While he may be so distinctly heard but few persons are ever able
                                to see him. As the Whip-poor-will belongs in the same family with the Night Hawk, some
                                have thought it to be the same bird. Henry C. Blinn.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="That which ascends must be the same as that which descends..." TEIform="index"/>

                            And now we're bereft of her presence, But know her spirit is near To bless every earnest

                            Men and women were hel as chattels, which seriously conflicted wit the anti-slavery views of
                            the Shakers tha came from the free states. They could not harmonize the gospel of Jesus
                            Christ which brought freedom of soul and body with the southern Christian view of mak ing
                            merchandise of the souls of men. In some instances these views of the Shakers proved to be a
                            very objectionable feature. It seems that one of the good Deacons or Trustees had taken the
                            liberty to express his mind a little too freely on the subject, to suit one of the slave
                            holders and was informed very decidedly,�"Mr. Shaker, I am your enemy, and if I should meet
                            you alone, and away from your home I would kill you." Nearly two years had past before the
                            anticipated time came. The Deacon had been from home on business. One day on entering a
                            piece of woods while on his return home, he saw in the distance his avowed enemy coming
                            toward him. When within a short distance of each other, the Deacon sprang from his horse and
                            threw the lines over a small tree. Off went his coat and rolling up his shirt sleeves, he
                            hailed his enemy,� "My friend, this is the place the Lord ' has appointed for you and me to
                            meet. Now we will see who is on the Lord's side." Not a word was spoken by the slave holder,
                            but by the use of his- spurs, the horse and his rider were suddenly out of sight and the
                            good Deacon remounting his horse rode pleasantly to his home and never afterward was

                            true fidelity to principle; but it does not follow that he does, if he simply relies upon
                            what his parents have told him. Neither should a person be governed by what some minister
                            may tell him to believe and practice. The minister may be far better informed upon correct
                            interpretations of the Bible, and the duties which it enjoins, than some of his hearers are;
                            but this is no good reason why they should not think for themselves and study for themselves
                            and invoke the wisdom of God upon their efforts, that they maj intelligently apprehend those
                            truths and doctrines and commands which they ought to believe and practice. It matters not
                            how highly they respect the intelligence and piety of their parents and minister and
                            friends, they should not blindly follow their belief and practice. Instead of all this, they
                            should form an enlightened and independent judgment, from what they, themselves, may obtain
                            by prayerful investigation and thorough study. By pursuing this method, they may arrive at
                            the same conclusion which their parents, and minister and friends have, or they may not.
                            But, whatever may be their convictions and conclusions, they should be obtained in a
                            thoroughly understanding manner, and then they can afford to be true to them under all
                            circumstances and for life. Too many get their religious views at second hand, and can no
                            more tell why they believe them than they can tell how old the fish was that swallowed
                            Jonah. Let "us have more intelligent faithfulness to principle.Holland Patent, N.
