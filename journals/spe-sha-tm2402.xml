No. 4.</head><p TEIform="p">ON the 25th of Sept. 1811, an order of Ministry was appointed for the Society at South Union.
                            Those forming the order at this date were Elder Benjamin S. Youngs, Br. Joseph Allen,
                            Eldress Molly Goodrich, Sr. Mercy Picket. They were very kindly received and made welcome by
                            the Believers who had anxiously waited for their arrival. On the 17th of October, 1811, the
                            Society was organized and four families were arranged in the order of Believers, with
                            Elders, Trustees, and Family Deacons. A Covenant corresponding to the one at New Lebanon was
                            signed on the 4th of July by thirty Brethren. [We find no record of the signing of the
                            Covenant by the Sisters, but this was, without doubt, attended to in due time. Ed.] The
                            establishing of the Society in the order of Believers was attended with great anxiety, that
                            all who had accepted the faith of the cross might be saved, and become an honor to the
                            gospel work. With the spiritual order moved also the duties of the temporal interest, and
                            while many were engaged in cultivating the land, and in the raising of stock, others must do
                            the work of the blacksmith, the carpenter, the mason, and the mill-wright. All must be
                            industrious to build up a home for the accommodation and the protection of so large a
                                family.<pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 26 THE MANIFESTO. Additional anxieties began to present
                            themselves before the little Society, in the rumors of war that were being discussed more or
                            less publicly, and which were fully realized on the 18th of June, 1812, when the United
                            States declared war against Great Britain. Several of the Brethren were drafted, but
                            preferred to hire some other person to do the fighting, rather than to shoulder the musket.
                            In 1814 the Society at South Union contained some three hundred souls, and the Center family
                            was able to build a large, beautiful, brick dwelling, which afforded ample accommodations
                            for all at that place. The bricks were molded and burnt by the Brethren and were of a very
                            nice quality. We find in a letter written by Joseph Allen in 1812, who was in the order of
                            Ministry, some very interesting items. He says: "South Union is thirtysix degrees and forty
                            minutes north latitude and fifteen miles from the line which divides the state of Kentucky
                            on the north, and the state of Tennessee on the south. It is two hundred and seventy-five
                            miles southwest from Union Village, and one hundred afrd thirty miles southwest from
                            Pleasant Hill. "During three winters the earth at this place was never covered with snow.
                            The ground is scarcely ever frozen. We begin to plow in February and to sow our oats and
                            flax. So soon as this is done we begin to plant our corn, which continues from the first of
                            April to the last of June, and frequently corn is planted in June, where flax was sowed in
                            February, and if you should see this great field of corn, you would think it a very curious
                            sight; one part of it would be higher than your head, another part as high as your knees,
                            another six inches high and the last just coming from the earth; and yet it will all get
                            ripe before the season closes. We usually plant two hundred or more acres." "The country is
                            very good for some things, as corn, wheat, oats, hemp, tobacco, indigo and cotton, but we
                            lack timber of all kinds and have but little grass. The soil is too dry for tame grass, but
                            we have a wild grass which answers a good purpose in the forepart of the season. Early peas
                            and potatoes are harvested in May." "We have planted fourteen hundred apple trees, have
                            finished a brick dwelling 50x30 ft. and two stories high; also a stone building 45x34 ft.
                            and are now making a tan yard. Have also laid the foundation for a meeting-house." This
                            year, 1812, marks a very singular visitation of sickness, which was designated as the "Cold
                            Plague." It made its appearance in South Union on the 25th of March, when two persons were
                            attacked. It was not confined to the Shaker Village, but was more or less prevalent through
                            that section of the country. Between the months of March and June about one hundred and ten
                            persons were on the sick list, which resulted in thirteen deaths. On the 30th of Sept. 1815,
                            there was another visitation of the "Cold Plague," and fifty persons were more or less
                            afflicted. It made a sad change<pb n="27" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 27 in the order of our
                            business engagements. No sound of the hammer was heard on the anvil, no cloth was placed on
                            the bars, and a few persons, only, were left at the brick yard to attend to that business.
                            The harps were, indeed, hung upon the willows, and sickness was in every house. The Society
                            was not only visited with sickness and made to endure many privations and much burden, but
                            along comes an ungrateful horse thief ; a man who had left the family a few months before
                            this date, where he had shared all the blessings of the home in common with others. Ke now
                            returns in the night and steals one of our best horses. Two men were put on his track and
                            after chasing him for two hundred and fifty miles, they secured both, the thief and the
                            horse. A trial follows and a term in the state prison is the result. In 1824 another horse
                            thief makes his visit at South Union and secures three horses. Five Brethren went in pursuit
                            and overtook the thief in the state of Indiana, at a distance of one hundred and sixty
                            miles. Taken entirely by surprise he gave himself up without the least resistance and
                            returned with the Brethren to Russellville where he was tried and sentenced to the
                            penitentiary. The recovered horses were much injured by their severe journey. A singular
                            incident occurred from the bite of a spider. The poison was so active that in a short time
                            the patient's life was in great danger. Quite a variety of remedies were administered and
                            two weeks were consumed before health was restored. The gospel of Jesus the Christ which was
                            to make both soul and body free, made South Union the home of both master and slave, and
                            changed their relations toward each other quite essentially. Those who accepted the faith of
                            the Believers, gave freedom to their slaves and permitted them to find a home as best they
                            could. A negro, while held as a slave, would instantly take off his hat on the approach of
                            his master, but would surprisingly lose all this so soon as he obtained his freedom. One
                            negro on being asked by a former master to saddle his horse, made this quick reply,�"No,
                            sab, tank God the time am come for ebery man to wait on heself." Several of these colored
                            people, either slaves or free blacks, were admitted into the family of the Believers. As one
                            of the slave-holders had arranged to return to his former home, his four slaves were anxious
                            to remain with the Believers, and the Brethren paid him eight hundred dollars for them.
                            After the Brethren had finished the mill, which was begun the 23rd of July, 1812, they must
                            have some millstones. To obtain these, five Brethren were sent to the quarry and after
                            working four weeks, had prepared two pair of stones, one being 3 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and
                            the other 4 ft. 1 in. in diameter. The two pair cost two hundred dollars. It required three

                            eleven days to haul them from the quarry to the mill at South Union. At the time of
                            gathering the corn we have a "husking" as is the custom in most of the slave states. The
                            corn is thrown into a long ridge and on a designated evening, all turn out to have a
                            pleasant time. Two captains are chosen, and they alternately choose from the company till
                            all are taken. The next object is to see which party will finish its husking first. Twice
                            during the evening the party is treated to some wine, or something stronger, and they not
                            unfrt quently work till ten o'clock. After the husking is closed a supper of roast pig with
                            bread and coffee is served. At the close of this midnight meal all return to their several
                            home s. The following was taken from the Bowling Green Gazette of Sept. 1835. "Since our
                            last, the Asiatic Cholera has raged with much less violence in Russellville, but it is
                            probable this may be owing in pait to the fact that but few of her citizens have continued
                            to remain in town. "The disease was presented in its most frightful form, its ravages were
                            almost unprecedented in its whole history, hence it is not a matter of astonishment that a
                            general panic and consternation should have taken possession of her citizens, and this, no
                            doubt, greatly added to its horrors and the number of its victims. "At present we are
                            advised that the citizens are returning to Russellville and resuming their usual business.
                            Out of a population of four thousand, sixty whites and forty-three blacks were taken out of
                            time! One fortieth of the whole population. The like is nowhere else on record of the
                            frightful ravages of this fell destroyer." "During this panic, and especially the latter
                            part of July and August, South Union has been greatly crowded upon, and the Trustees' Office
                            has been filled to its utmost capacity by the frightened refugees from the vicinity of
                            Russellville, seeking shelter and protection." For the space of three or four weeks there
                            were from twenty to thirty persons to cook for, daily. We could not turn them away, although
                            some were already marked with the disease, and others were in a fair way to take it. The
                            greatest burden was the attention that had to be rendered night and day, in the
                            administering of medicines and food. Three deaths occurred among this class at our Village."
                            One young man, Mark McGraff, arrived here on the 29th of July. He was quite exhausted by the
                            constant care that he had given to others. In the evening of the next day, fifteen hours
                            from the time he arrived, he was a corpse. All possible attention was given to him, but all
                            of no avail, as he continued to fail from the attack until he expired. He was kindly and
                            carefully laid away in our cemetery. During the time of this sad affliction our Brethren
                            carried a liberal supply of provisions to the poor people of Russellville. (To be
                            continued.)</p></div2><pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Peace offerings at the world's exposition" TEIform="index"/>PEACE OFFERINGS AT THE WORLD'S

                            Toil and Art Would teem to-day in every clime. Long ages ere the midnight choir That sweet
                            momentous message bore, Isaiah said with tongue of fire, That nations should learn war no
                            more; Their weapons beaten out and changed To implements for bough and sod; Then man no
                            longer strife estranged Might walk within the light of God. Yet after crimson lapse of
                            years, Fringed by the so-called Christian reign; With smoke, flame, flood and quenchless
                            tears All unfulfilled the words remain.<pb n="30" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 30 THE MANIFESTO. To-day there
                            is no nation ripe ; Yet, there are workers tried and true Who strive with zeal of es-ery
                            type, The vast millennial work to do. Yea, they who in the name of Peace Bring pruning-
                            hooks, and plough and bell, Would see the Bethlehem light increase O'ev fields of snow-white
                            asphodel. For needy sufferers that abide, Would bid rich ambient harvests wave; And thus
                            remember side by side The home of life and soldier's grave. Oh, who of all the motley line
                            That thither crowd, shall know or feel, The import of the Day Dawn Shrine Whose incense
                            would the nations heal? Or who will prize the wedge of worth, The ploughshare fashioned from
                            the swords, That shall upturn the glad new earth, When Christians own, it is the Lord's? The
                            pruning-hooks must thought prepare, Strong as the cedars of the hill, Till growth of wisdom
                            all can share, In fruitage of parental will. Yea, they must cut the deadly bane, The
                            branches of the strange wild vine, Till earth can bear on every plane Fair clusters,
                            dropping heavenly wine. When Christians turn from compromise To their own law with peace
                            agleam, This war-carsed earth will realize, The angels' song, and prophet's dream. Mt.

                            our little messenger of light and truth, The Manifesto and meantime realizing how clearly my
                            duty was portrayed on its simple pages, I queried whether there were not among its readers
                            in the wide world some others who, like myself were touched by its message of truth. Are
                            there not some, I soliloquized, who are prepared to forsake the world, to leave its turmoil
                            and strife, which renders life so miserable? And would they not do so if they only know how
                            to take the first step toward real happiness? Let me assure you dear readers that there is a
                            band of devoted Christian workers in this land of religious liberty who can give you the key
                            to solid happiness: whose whole interest is enlisted in promoting peace on earth by exalting
                            in daily life the practical purity which the Savior taught. Permit me therefore to reiterate
                            the question? Are there not some souls who are willing to engage in a cause by which one may
                            become spiritually elevated? Who from the requirements of its noble, yet humble position,
                            are able to help lift others out of the thralldom of sin, which has such a strong tendency
                            downward? I seem to hear one reply; "I would�but�;" Another; "I cannot�because;" The third;
                            "I surely would�if;" Ah me! how similar are these excuses to those made in the days of our
                            Savior. Luke ix., 59-62. You perchance, may think such very close questions, and such as do
                            not concern any one outside of yourselves. To some extent I know that one is allowed to be
                            master of his own business but fully understanding as I do, the natural resistance to such
                            intrusion, I yet avow, that my heart is so filled with love for humanity, that I would be
                            happy to persuade even one of my fellow-kindred to enter the same self-denying way which I
                            once loathed. Yea, I would entreat all who have not known and felt the true love of God to
                            the extent that it saves from sin daily, to accept the means right speedily whereby this
                            love may be secured. I was once an alien, a wanderer in darkness but after receiving and
                            obeying light, found God's forgiving love and through prayer and supplication was finally
                            led to a Shaker Community. Here I learned, as I had never learned before, the way to obtain
                            that rest and peace for which my soul had fasted and prayed. That peace which is promised to
                            all who "bear the yoke" of Christ which I can assure you by experience is easy, while the
                            burden becomes light, as I put Christ fully on. Having come into possession of peace of mind
                            consequent upon surrendering all to God's work, as preached through his Christ it has
                            created within me a desire so to act as to help some other one into the same happy
                            condition. For this very reason I invite you to investigate the life and principles<pb n="32" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 32 THE MANIFESTO. of the Shaker or Millennial Church. If consistent so
                            to do, make us a visit, thus learn for yourselves the blessedness of seeking to create
                            heaven upon earth. I am not very far advanced on life's journey but far enough to feel the
                            necessity of improving time unto God. Our Savior prayed,�"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
                            on earth as in heaven." Mark vi., 10. Was this prayer to be only a dream for the future?
                            Nay, my friends, it is a possibility of the present. I am witnessing its fulfillment daily
                            and long to tell the glad story, that the "salvation of the Lord may cover the earth, even
                            as the waters cover the sea." I appeal to your hearts while I say : Ye sin-sick, ye truth
                            seekers, ye who hunger and thirst after righteousness and can not obtain present salvation,
                            know that there is a way opened, through divine revelation, upon the earth, where the will
                            of God is made manifest in purity and truth, through human agency, even as it is in heaven.

                            cumulus clouds that rolled leisurely toward the south-east, the morning stars glittered with
                            more than common brightness ; the wintry winds were still; the frost fairies absent, and the
                            ground was bare and brown. The sun rose above the Taghanic ridge with glory that was a happy
                            surprise to all, and the hours that succeeded until the eventide, were pleasant and warm as
                            those of an April day. In the early hour before the clock struck five, while the family were
                            yet asleep, seven young Sisters passed through the halls and sang a very pretty Christmas
                            song, timed to the merry chimes of silvery bells ; this was kindly appreciated and heartily
                            responded to by every one. To make the time more pleasant, more abundant in love, in
                            heavenly union and communion, all of the Canaan family were invited to spend the day with
                            us. They arrived in time to attend the meeting that opened at 9 o'clock, a. m. This was a
                            season of worship, of prayer and praise, a time of blessing and of being blest; good gifts
                            were bestowed upon one another and spiritual treasures received from the world above. A few
                            minutes before the noon hour, the two families sat down to a nicely prepared table and
                            partook of fruits, golden, green and purple that grew in the clear air and warm sunshine of
                            the tropics. In remembrance of the many who have no bread, who suffer for the comforts of
                            life, our supplies were limited, though at the same time sufficient for all, nor was the
                            tiniest life destroyed to cast a shadow in our midst.<pb n="33" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 33
                            At 1, p. m., seventeen of the younger members of the family, known as the "Self-Improvement
                            Society," gave an Entertainment. The large meeting-rooai had been previously arranged and
                            the whole Order were seated in circles, one within the other, the smallest children
                            occupying the innermost and the S. I. S. the second from the centre. Winter blooming plants
                            and evergreen twigs were tastefully grouped together with which the room was decorated in a
                            very pleasing manner. The "Self-Improvement Society" were dressed in uniform and all wore
                            badges. The Entertainment opened by singing a hymn entitled 'Songs of Cheer,' composed by A.
                            R. Stephens, at the close of which, Catharine Allen, president of the Society, spoke a few
                            words of welcome to all who were in attendance. An address prepared for the occasion was
                            then read by C. C. Vinneo; following, a beautiful and original poem was read by Lydia
                            Staples, subject, 'Confirmation.' The 'Debating Circle' composed of seven boys and girls
                            next came forward and gave an interesting and amusing rehearsal into which singing wras
                            introduced and the waving of pretty banners that bore the inscription of such words as,
                            'Watch, Hope and Pray ;' taught and guided by A. R. Stephens. At the conclusion of this, a
                            numerous recitation called 'A Confession,' was given by Grace H. Bowers; then an essay upon
                            the subject of 'Health' read by Martha A. Burger; Song, 'Let us lift up our hearts,'
                            composed by L. S. Bowers. An essay by Louisa Bell, 'Christ's Yoke ;' and another by Sarah J.
                            Burger, 'Mental Therapeutics ;' Succeeding these a song called, 'The Summer Day' was sung
                            with organ accompaniment by six of the younger members of the S. I. S. after which the same
                            group engaged in a long and interesting dialogue upon various subjects, varied with
                            instrumental music, and at the close sung a song called the 'Snow Storm' with organ
                            accompaniment ;f the whole was composed and managed by L. S. Bowers. The Chairman next
                            called for the reading of poems by A. R. Stephens, 'Day-Dawn Prophecy;' Margaret Gibson,
                            'Christmas-Day;' and Cecelia De Vere, 'The Pilgrims and the Mile-Stone.' This finished the
                            programme, whereupon the President made a few closing remarks in which a brief synopsis was
                            given of the mental labor performed during the past year by the S. I. S. Among other things,
                            she stated, that in the line of orignal writings, seventeen poems, sixty-seven essays and
                            four hundred and fifty-two short paragraphs had been presented in their weekly meetings,
                            beside eleven Biographical Sketches and a great variety of choice extracts. The
                            Entertainment was closed by singing a hymn entitled 'Orisons' with organ accompaniment,
                            composed by A. R. Stephens. At the conclusion, the Elders expressed hearty approval of all
                            the exercises in kindly words of commendation and blessing, and all the Brethren and Sisters
                            joined in words of thanks and praise for the good and substantial matter, wholly original,
                            that had been presented, and the excellent manner in which every part had been rendered. It
                            was by this time 3-30 p. m., and we all parted, feeling grateful to God who alone is the
                            source of all our spiritual joys, who giveth every good thing and maketh us to understand
                            his holy truth, and calleth upon all to work the work of peace and love on earth.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="B., L. S." TEIform="persName"/>L. S. B. Sec.

                            by the sun's last, lingering ray. The warblers, chirping forth their latest songs, Betokened
                            peace and rest. The flocks and herds Grazed drowsily in the verdant meadow-lands Through
                            which the murmuring brooklet winds its path. The air was rife with scent of new-mown hay And
                            mingled redolence of fragrant flowers. The glint of sunset's gold through leafy boughs Was
                            as a faint remembrance of the day. The dusky pines reared their brown, moss-clad trunks In
                            gloomy outline 'gainst the deep blue sky; And the whippoorwill's sad note from yonder Covert
                            seemed an oracle of sorrow. The dying breezes whispered sweet farewells. All nature's myriad
                            voices, slumbering,. Bespoke the calm, still hush of eventide. But lo! anon the sky was
                            overcast With darkness, and above the mountain's crest Loomed huge, black clouds like giant
                            pedestals, Inlaid with a strange, peculiar redness Which foretold unwelcomed visitations.
                            The lightning's flash, rending the ebon mass. For a moment, made more intense the gloom. The
                            distant thunder, peal on peal,, drew near And louder grew. The storm came on apace With
                            dreaded fury, and at length it burst In wind, and rain, and hail upon the earth, Whose
                            fields, once fair and smiling in their pride, Now met their doom in one, short, fated hour.
                            It seemed as if the gods had kindled wrath Against the people,�as when the fiery Majesty of
                            Zeus, blazed in anger At the brave Prometheus, who, amid<pb n="35" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO.
                            35 The din and roar of the tempest, still spake Of the day when good would triumphantly rise
                            O'er the unjust power.� Still the storm increased � And raged in madness,�as a beast of
                            prey, , � . Wounded, springs upon its helpless victim.� ���;. All hearts were filled with
                            terror, as volley On volley of hailstones struck the dwellings, And 'mid the roaring,
                            crashing thunder-peals,' The lightning's vived flashes, prayers arose, Silently entreating
                            heaven's protection. When lo! a calm; as when the Savior stilled The waves on Galilee, the
                            gentle voice now Seemed to rise above the storm, commanding The elements of turbulence,�"Be
                            still."� Once more quietness reigned throughout the land And night's dark pall enveloped all
                            below, Concealing desolation from the view. The hours wore on and soon the morning dawned.
                            The light of day revealed the harvest fields, Whose golden grain just ripened,�kissed by
                            Sunbeams and swayed by gentle zephyrs,� Told of plenty, now ruined and laid low. The whole
                            scene bespoke of devastation. The ground was strewn with leaves, as in Autumn; Here and
                            there a branch hung, cleft from its trunk. The gardens, once so fair and beautiful,� Filled
                            with many lovely plants and flowers That fraught the atmosphere with odors rare; From whose
                            waxen chalices, rich nectar Offered substance for the bee to gather,� Now were blighted and
                            their glory stolen. Yet, e'en while the flowerets lay withering, Emanating from their torn
                            and bleeding hearts, Mingled perfumes floated up to heaven As an essence of sweet, forgiving

                            On inquiry of our enthusiastic President, we are glad to report that there is no dimunition
                            of interest among the members. During the summer months they met fortnightly, now they have
                            resumed their weekly gatherings on Wednesday evenings. The meetings ure opened with music,
                            then the regular programme is read; usually there are three or four essays or compositions,
                            besides the original paragraphs to be read. Last week there was a reading from ''Self Help,"
                            by Samuel Smiles, an able article on "The injurious effects of tea and coffee," by Sister
                            Lucy Bowers, and other short pieces. The next subject to be discussed with its pros and cons
                            is Re-incarnation, which, as Sister Catharine says, does l.ot detract from the vital
                            principles of our faith, as it is simply the law of evolution and developnient through many
                            physical existences. Several propositions have been laid before the meeting, which will add
                            interest and variety ro future gatherings. There is increasing harmony, freedom and
                            confidence among the members, which speaks well for high aims and purposes along the lines
                            of self-improvement. Thankful Hale of Washington, an outside Sister of our Order, visited us
                            a few weeks ago, and gave us a course of lessons on "Mental Therapeutics," containing much
                            valuable information on the Science of Life, the relations of matter and spirit, body and
                            soul, and the power of mind over physical infirmity. The monotony of Shaker life, is only in
                            the minds of those who have never lived it, or perhaps with some who do every thing in a
                            half-hearted way. Every one who realizes the great importance of the work we are engaged in,
                            and the grandeur of the principles which build up and sustain our Communistic homes, feels
                            inspired day by day to go forth with cheerfulness of heart, consecrating all to loving
                            altruistic service, satisfied with the reward of a justified conscience; and feeling blest
                            in lifting the standard of righteousness and truth, high above the plane of selfishness and
                            injustice, where the Grod of this world rules and reigns. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            year, the subject of thankfulness, for both temporal and spiritual blessings seemed very
                            appropriate. When we look abroad and see the suffering even in a physical sense that is
                            destined to be the lot of thousands of our fellow mortals the coming winter, a just
                            appreciation of those seem in order. We always want to look on the bright side, and "never
                            cross a stream until we get to it;" but, judging from past history, the most potent factor
                            to arouse the human mind to a just appreciation of its duty to the divine Spirit is
                            suffering; to cause it to yearn for something higher than its present state. We earnestly
                            hope that the present unsettled conditions of human society will be the means of awakening
                            the dormant spiritual energies of the race. We believe it will, and that those who have
                            treasured in their storehouses the truths of the divine life, will be blest with the
                            privilege and enjoy the pleasure of dispensing them to needy souls. Through the kindness of
                            a gospel Sister we were favored with a loan of some of the sayings of Mother Lucy Wright,
                            compiled by Isaac N. Youngs in 1820. The divine truths therein expressed and handed down to
                            her spiritual children, can be transmitted through the ages without any dimunition of their
                            lustre. At present date, Dec. 1st, fall work is about finished on the farm, and we have
                            begun to haul our supply of wood, and are building and repairing fences. The present
                            indications are that we shall have a mild winter. If the prognostications are correct, we
                            can not say that we are sorry, but time will give us evidence of the truth. Applicants for
                            admission into the higher life are few and far between, but we will toil on and not faint;
                            and though the "harvest is great and the laborers are few," yet we will with fervor of
                            spirit and in faith pray the Lord of the harvest to send more laborers into the field.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="DeGraw, Hamilton" TEIform="persName"/>Hamilton DeGraw.</byline></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="It is impossible for souls..."

                            the great good that will result from the expending of so much precious time and money and
                            mental anxiety, to establish the fact that all nations do believe in God, who is the Father
                            of all. "Devout men from every nation under heaven" have discoursed of the Fatherhood of God
                            and of the brotherhood of man quite as freely and as fully and as satisfactorily to the
                            masses, as have the multiplied sects of the Christian church. Even the Buddhist from Bombay
                            was free to say that "Spiritual progress is impossible for him who does not lead a life of
                            purity and compassion. So long as one is fettered by selfishness, passion, prejudice or
                            fear, so long the doors of his higher nature are closed against the truth." If the knowledge
                            that has been obtained through this meeting of the nations shall lead men to have more
                            gentle consideration for each other, to preach peace instead of war, to preach love instead
                            of hatred, it may be an enlarged ray of light, which will lead all to more peaceful
                            habitations in this world, and possibly in the world to come. As the spiritual head of the
                            Christian church was in theory and practice, a peace-maker from the heavens, then above all
                            people the Christians, as his disciples, should establish the reign of peace upon the earth.
                            For more than one hundred years after the mission of Jesus was preached at Jerusalem, no
                            person could have been found in the Roman army that was designated as a Christian soldier.
                            It was left for more modern Christians to sing with Young,� One to destroy, is murder by the
                            law, And gibbets keep the lifted hand in awe, To murder thousands, takes a spurious name,
                            War's glorious art, and gives immortal fame. Our weapons of warfare, said Paul, are not
                            carnal. We have no occasion to hurt each other, and the church that carries the earthly
                            sword to destroy its enemies, will in all probability, agreeably to the Scripture record,
                            perish with the sword.</p></div2><div2 type="editorial" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="As the mission of The Manifesto, is to do good..." TEIform="index"/>

                            this much to be desired work for suffering humanity, there seems to be abundant opportunity.
                            It comes through multiplied avenues and kindly solicits our constant and earnest attention.
                            In the great family of man may be found every phase of want, which calls for aid from any
                            and every good Samaritan. How true ! "The poor ye have always with you." As Jesus classed
                            himself among those who were poor, so must every one who bears him company. "The son of
                            man," said he, "hath not where to lay his head," after the selfish manner of the children of
                            this world. The accumulation of a private inheritance is the foundation of all selfishness.
                            It establishes the narrow order of this is mine, and that is thine. Any infringement upon my
                            possessions arouses the baser passions of man and the spirit of hatred and strife is soon in
                            the ascendency. A Christian church can not be a selfish church, as it is not in harmony with
                            the universal testimony of Je$us the Christ. "Except a man forsake all that he hath, he can
                            not be my disciple." This was the order of the little church in Jerusalem. They had all
                            things in common. If prosperity came to them, all enjoyed the blesssng ; if they met with
                            adversity, it touched every heart. Peter stands as our witness of the life of this first
                            Christian church. "Behold," said he, "we have forsaken all to follow thee." Peter had
                            entered the narrow way that leadeth unto life. He had made a sacrifice of all that he
                            possessed. It was the price of his salvation as a Christian, but it enabled him to say as
                            did Jesus, Except a man forsake all that he hath, he can not be a disciple of the Christ.
                            Our response must harmonize with that of Peter. It can be no more, it should be no less.</p></div2><div2 type="editorial" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In our gospel experience..."

                            our pilgrimage through time, but this above all others should stand first. This is the
                            treasure which may be worthy to be placed in the kingdom where moth and rust can not

                            soul. "Every breath is continual prayer to God." In this, goodness occupies a pre-eminent
                            place and the labors of the mind are unceasing for the peace and happiness of all mankind.
                            In this spirit, prayer becomes worship. All forms and ceremonies are only used as helps to
                            give expression to present emotion. In a harmonious feelinothese may be made profitable for
                            exhortation, for admonition, for prayer and for praise.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Regenerate life, No. 2" TEIform="index"/>REGENERATE LIFE, No. 2.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Sevester, E.

                            plane of life. Although he lives, yet he is dead, a spiritual death far more to be dreaded
                            than the physical death. "The soul that sinneth, it shall die;" this does not refer to the
                            physical death, because Adam lived more than nine hundred years after the transgression. The
                            most glorious truths, Mother Ann Lee advanced more than one hundred years ago, and which
                            were wholly unknown to the people at that time, now prominent men advance; teacn these very
                            same truths, and they are believed in by thousands. Mother Ann's prophecy is now in process
                            of fulfillment. She said, "The time will come when this Gospel will be preached to all
                            nations and they will come as doves to your windows to hear the word of the Lord." Do we not
                            see this occurring in this, our day? Mankind are gradually leaving their low, sensual, lost
                            condition and growing into better, higher, more spiritual conditions; living purer and
                            nobler lives. God is preparing his people to serve Him. We live in a most remarkable time; a
                            flood of spiritual light is poured out over all nations of the earth. "Watchman, what of the
                            night," the night of spiritual darkness ? The blessed dawn is breaking; soon the glorious
                            day of truth and righteousness will appear. Oh, may we be ready to receive souls and
                            administer unto them the word of God. Can we in the spirit of Christ administer the bread
                            and water of Life to those who call upon the name of the Lord ? Or leave we them hungering
                            and thirsting with but husks to feed upon ? Oh the winning of souls unto God! How important

                                Jan. 1894. How true it is that a busy life gives velocity to the wheels of time. No
                                wonder that our worthy editor writes of the rapid ity with which we pass around the
                                year's cycle. "Seed time and harvest, cold and heat. summer and winter, day and night,"
                                pass in such swift review, that each duty therein seems to overlap its predecessor
                                without being fully accomplished. Still all that we can do is to grasp the real Now and
                                stamp our best upon it, trusting that since in the work of the tapestry weavers, each
                                thread adds to the beautiful pattern, though unknown at the time to the workers, so if
                                every day finds us steadfast in duty, true in thought, word and action, we can present
                                our life pattern to the Master workman, without fear or remorse. How wisely the times
                                and seasons are arranged. Surely they "builded better than they knew" who planned that
                                the New Year should open with its spotless page so soon after the Christian celebration
                                of the reign of the Prince of Peace, which brings a renewal of Christian love, peace and
                                forgiveness to all whose spiritual ear has heard the gentle call "Follow Me." Our
                                holidays�if they may be so termedwere fraught with blessings so serene that we trust
                                they may long cover us as a mantle, and breathe upon us a benediction. Our school-room
                                is filled this winter to its utmost capacity, both boys and girls attending, with
                                interested and devoted teachers. As a family we are remarkably blest with health,
                                considering the devastation made by "La Grippe" and fevers in the adjacent country; and
                                were it not that duties and requisite strength, are not always balanced, our temperate,
                                pure and regular manner of life, would ensure us perfect health. Infirmity will
                                accompany age; still our loved elderly people have a panacea for useless and unhappy old
                                age, by keeping an interest to do all the good they can, by loving and blessing the
                                efforts of surrounding friends, and by being in sympathy with the young lives about
                                them. Thus we are all endeavoring to so wisely study Life's problem, that we shall be
                                able to garner both time and strength with which to serve God and our neighbor. Amelia

                                Our winter continues quite open scarcely any snow and no sleighing at present writing,
                                our help have to draw wood on wagons; no ice has been stored as yet though the house is
                                all ready still we expect the old Indian proverb will hold good which was, "Winter never
                                rots in the sky," but we may have to wait till March as we did some years ago. Many
                                years in the past we had a number of industries that afforded for the Brethren and
                                Sisters an abundance of work with remunerative returns, these have all left us or ceased
                                to yield sufficient to warrant us in keeping them going. There are none coming in among
                                us to keep this large inheritance of the Fathers intact, and we see or think we do, that
                                hired help is incompatible with Community life and we are driven to'the alternative of
                                hired help or fields lying waste. We have heard for the past forty years that the people
                                would come, in great numbers by and by and fill our houses, "come like doves to the
                                windows." "Watchman tell us of the night what its signs of promise are?" Answer.
                                "Traveler o'er yon mountain's height see that glorious beaming star." We want to see the
                                star in all its glory and beauty and we want to see Zion's ranks filled up and so full
                                there will be no need of a hired man in all Mount Zion. Timothy D.

"Hold fast that which is good," is advice worth regarding. If we desire to

                                characters. It is our privilege to grow better, purer, more true and loving. We should
                                make ourselves worthy of being loved. Deeds of sympathy, words of encouragement and love
                                to each other, are tending to our spiritual elevation. Our hearts will be full of love,
                                if our lives are full of purity. Let us discipline ourselves to take what each moment
                                brings to Us of duty and of privilege. Let us perform the duty of the hour now passing.
                                If we grasp well the meaning of the one little fragment of time present, and perform the
                                duty that this hour brings, we shall thus do that which will please God and perfect our

                                run together on that acre. A flock of one hundred should be divided into four small

                                Youngs were sent from Watervliet. The article brought to our minds much that we have
                                heard our older Brethren and Sisters tell of the hardships these pioneers passed
                                through, and the noble sacrifices they made, leaving comfortable homes, friends and
                                relatives; all that was nearest and dearest to .the human heart, and bravely wtnt forth
                                on their mission of love, to preach the gospel of Christ, publish the testimony of
                                Mother Ann Lee and establish Societies in the west. We have in our possession a letter
                                wrtiten by Elder Issachar Bates to his son Issachar Bates Jr. in 1806. This letter is
                                short, but full of exhortations to him to cleave to the way of God. Issachar Bates Jr.
                                was reared in this family and moved to the South family where he was for many years an
                                Elder. After he was released from this office of trust at the South family, he returned
                                to the home of his childhood and youth, where a few years afterward he died, a devoted,
                                consecrated soul to the end of life, beloved by all. We had a very satisfactory meeting
                                at the North family on Christmas; the spirit of Christ and the testimony of Mother Ann
                                pervaded throughout the assembly. While we read of the hardships and privations the
                                pioneers had to endure to establish the Gospel in this land, let us who are young, not
                                peruse it as a romance, but let it awaken us to more soul energy, more conviction which
                                will bring us nearer to the saints who have gone before and laid the foundation for the
                                spiritual and temporal blessings we enjoy. They labored unselfishly, "let us do the same

                                The New Year opens with scarcely six inches of snow on the ground; line sleighing and
                                pleasant weather. It is the season for "good resolutions" and we will "weary not in well

                                comes to the Church to be associated with Elder Abraham Perkins. We make them all
                                heartily welcome, and trust that they will find in the strength of our numbers a
                                consolation that will in some degree, compensate for the loss of their dear old home. It
                                is one hundred years since the South family was established. On the 7th ult. we held a
                                Society meeting at their home to commemorate this event. From the older Brethren and
                                Sisters, we received many beautiful lessons of patience and forbearance, through
                                examples and incidents drawn from the lives of the first Believers in this place. The
                                room in which we met, is 50x30 ft., arched overhead and contains what has been called

                                literature, so are all moral and secular improvements, however slight, additional
                                strength to formulate our soul redeeming cause and to bless as we would be blest.
                                Fervent are our prayers that "Zion may arise, her glorious light shine forth," not only
                                on home relations, but environ Br. Dowe in his western mission of manifesting the fruits
                                of the spirit and advocating the gospel lessons of regenerative life. Yea, "Zion's
                                interests press a little heavier than ever before," and gospel kindred let us give heed
                                to the cry that Zion's overladened heart sends forth; "Let Zion move as the heart of
                                one," on toward the Mount of Calvary and again listen to the ten commandments which
                                harmonize and beautify after the pattern of the inspired Revelator. However irregular
                                the landscape round about, to the artistic mind there lies beauty and grandeur. Even so
                                in viewing the deformities of human beings; however marked and deficient in virtue, the
                                angel side is there. Varied opinions on various subjects will ever exist, but where the
                                spirit of Christ abounds, these are not used as weapons to combat and destroy, but are
                                regarded as among the non-essentials of life. Bigotry and ignorance are antagonistical
                                to love and wisdom, and they should mellow before the effulgent rays of truth and
                                justice and tlius purity and equality will have its progressive work of mind and soul

                                of our spirits for the immortal life. As our acts form a readable character, as daily
                                they become added to the Book of Life, let us impress upon our gospel friends' Book of
                                Memory, records of enduring worth; for it should be a truth that "I and my people are

                                important use we have for the snow, sleighing being a secondary consideration. The
                                Brethren say they have already done more in the woods than all last winter. The ice
                                harvest for ourselves and townsmen was finished the 3rd the crystal blocks being 12
                                inches thick. There is but little frost in the ground and not a great body of snow
                                although the inch that fell last night, makes the fourteenth snow-storm. La grippe has
                                come near to us but kindly passed us by. Light colds are all we have to complain of. Our
                                Covenant was read to us yesterday which reminded vis of the full consecration we
                                promised to make when we placed our names with our forefathers. We renewed our vows of
                                consecration, pledging that the present year should find more of the Christ spirit
                                abiding with us, than any of the years that have preceeded it. With this accept our love
                                and prayer for the prosperity of Zion.

                                some time past. More like spring than winter. Christmas-day, the Thermometer registered
                                10 deg. above freezing, something that has not occurred in this section for jears. In
                                fact the writer can not recollect a similar event. We enjoyed Christmas very much and
                                the love and good-will that was expressed was quite encouraging. In the evening a
                                company of the young Sisters accompanied by some of the older Brethren and Sisters from
                                the Center family came up, and we spent an enjoyable hour or two. Such social gatherings
                                are one of the many incidents which help brighten our pathway through life. The
                                entertainment spoken of in the last writing was held at the appointed time, and the
                                programme that was carried out reflected great credit upon both teacher and scholars. A
                                treat to the school closed the exercises. Education is receiving much encouragement and
                                we are much pleased that a desire for progression exists. Health of Society quite good

Jan. 1894. The dawn of the New Year has already appeared and with it hopes
                                and anticipations for the future. I desire to render praise to the giver of every good
                                and perfect gift, for that I have, and all I am, and all that I may hope to be. There
                                are many external hindex*ances that conspire to arrest our progress in the higher life,
                                and we might well despair of perfection in time, were we left alone in the conflict. But
                                our minds may be preserved by the holy influences of the Divine Spirit. My heart is in
                                sympathy with the Apostle who found evil present when most intent upon good. I earnestly
                                desire a mental apprehension, quick to discern the things of highest moment, and bow
                                before the mercy-seat for a renewing grace to descend in my hour of need. Is not every
                                effort for success a matter of deepest concern? There is no gathering tiie harvest and
                                sitting down to rest; no time to remit labor until the power of watching is removed. In
                                no department of human effort is assistance more devoutly pledged by the great Helper
                                than in our incessant attempt to pain the victory over our inbred foes. To this end let
                                us carefully watch, and humbly pray. There is but little of interest to mention. The
                                wood is being sawed and put into sheds. All the old apple trees are beingcut down and
                                cleared away to make room for a better selection of fruit. There has been little snow as
                                yet; the weather is mild and spring-like, although for health cold weather at this
                                season of the year is preferable. Health prevails in our Society which is a great

Beloved- Eldeb Henby;�As we are holding our Christmas to-day, we have a little
                                to contribute to The Manifesto. We have enjoyed a very pleasant time for which we are
                                very thankful. Santa Claus came in all his glory with a Christmas tree loaded for the
                                children which they as well as all the Brethren and Sisters seemed to enjoy. While we
                                were partaking of our breakfast we also listened to some beautiful songs, contributed by
                                the Brethren and 46<pb n="47" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 47 Sisters. Several of the
                                Brethren assisted in the kitchen by washing dishes and doing other duties, through the
                                day as an aid to the Sisters. When it came noon we all sat down to an excellent dinner
                                for which we felt very thankful to the good Sisters. While at the table we thought of
                                the poor and how thankful they would have been with even the half that was before us. We
                                have a great deal to be thankful for when we think of those who are so destitute, and
                                some even starving for the want of proper food. We passed into the meeting-room at 2-30
                                p. m. and had a beautiful meeting. The spirit of good was manifested by all present, and
                                peace and union reigned through the whole Society. At 6-30 we held an entertainment and
                                listened to some vocal and instrumental music which was furnished by those in our home.
                                We will now close by sending our love and blessing to all the Societies in the second
                                coming of Christ and by wishing all a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year. Henry

We had a delightful visit from Elder Joseph Holden of the Mt. Lebanon
                                Bishopric, which gave us great comfort. He arrived on Dec. 3rd and departed for Mt.
                                Lebanon the 11th. His visit was very highly appreciated by every one at Union Village
                                and we shall, I trust, retain his ministration of the necessity of maintaining union,
                                Christian order and discipline. Our winter so far has not arrested the growth of the
                                grass, wheat or barley. Christmas sent the mercury up to 10 deg. in the shade. We
                                enjoyed Christmas very highly. An inspiring meeting at 9�30; a Christmas dinner and a
                                very pleasant Social in the evening, constituted the order of the day. It was insisted,
                                both on the Sabbath and Christmas, that no hard feelings nor lack of brotherly love
                                should be permitted to reign in heart or family after the Christmas-tide, and I judged
                                by the friendly feelings in our Social, that this good proposition had been well
                                accepted. The Brethren and Sisters were in attendance from the other families, both at
                                our morning service and in the evening Social. Sisters Anna Mills and Eebecca Armstrong
                                arranged the programme, and it was a great success. The girls and boys acquitted
                                themselves splendidly, and the music rendered by the choir was excellent. The mildness
                                of the winter is quite a saving of stock feed. We depend on the sale of stock for a
                                living, for grain is so low as to be scarcely worth raising. Our school,
                                (co-educational) re-commences on Monday, Jan. 1st. (2nd Term.) Elder James H. Richardson
                                called on us for a few hours, from South Union. We had a very good time with him in a
                                meeting on the evening previous to his return. Ruth Terry lives here in the Office. She
                                is a young Believer and is about two years old. In general she is quite a good child,
                                but occasionally,�well you ought to hear her hold forth. I guess she will come out all
                                right. If she don't, it will not be because she is not smart. Every day I live I am more
                                and more astonished that Believers will use animal food. Mirabilla Dictu! If we had all
                                the money for all the meat we have eaten in the last hundred years, each Society might
                                have twenty-five acres under glass and raise all the tropical fruits,�oranges, bananas,
                                pine-apples, dates, melons, yams and almost everything else. We might travel quite
                                around the world and preach the Gospel to every nation, baptizing them in the name of
                                the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. But I fear we shall leave these blessings to another,
                                and God grant, a more worthy generation. I herewith bespeak for the Editor, publishers
                                and readers of The Manifesto, a very happy New Year. O. C.

It takes some philosophy, faith, hope and trust or whatever else you may
                                choose to call it, to say or sing, as I have recently read� "Whichever way the wind doth
                                blow, Some heart is glad to have it so; Then blow it east or blow it west, The wind that
                                blows, is always best." I think, however it is a very good way to try to make the best
                                we can of things as they come, for sometimes I have been made sensible that the thing
                                very much dreaded was the one thing needed to bring the best result. I am glad that in
                                New Hampshire and Massachusetts there seems to have been so much union of feeling in
                                regard to our Centennial, and am surprised to find the interest there is in the reports
                                published of the meetings held in commemoration thereof and take it as an earnest of
                                good for the future. If no man comes to Christ except he is drawn by the Father, the
                                Father must have helpers through whom to do the drawing; and it would seem that the
                                united effort of souls consecrated to God and in whom Christ has taken his abode, as an
                                ever flowing spring of gladness, even in the midst of storm and tempest, are among the
                                most efficient means he can make use of. In this connection I esteem the kindly
                                breathings of love and good-will in "Home Notes as very effective. We do not want to be
                                heard every-time, but are very interested listeners every-time, and would want to bless
                                every wind that blows good tidings at least. Since commemorating our Centennial we have
                                had Christmas and its duties in which good Believers have special interest. The day was
                                ushered in by some of the young who are with us, in songs of joy and gladness, breathing
                                peace and goodwill to all mankind. Our usual meeting in the a. m. was very interesting
                                and well supported. In the p. m., the gathering about the finely decorated tree, was
                                much enjoyed, accompanied by music, dialogues, and stories. All were calculated to
                                foster the kindest feeling and good determinations. Health with us is much better so far
                                than during last winter, though there has been much sickness around us, of which our
                                dear Harvard friends have had a portion, but at this writing there is marked
                                improvement. Now as I am thinking of the many dear friends, among Believers and outside
                                too, whom I would like to take by the hand and say, "God bless you! and give you a Happy
                                New Year," I would wish they might accept this as a personal offering to them, and as I
                                this day have had my Commission renewed to extend love and kind feelings wherever I
                                desired on behalf of the Brethren and Sisters I would again say, "God bless you all!!"

                            disciple of the meek and lowly Savior. One who in early manhood gave all that he possessed,
                            to follow the Christ as manifested in his first and second appearing on earth. Although for
                            a series of years he was chosen to occupy a spiritual trust, and to this was added the
                            office of Treasurer of the Community yet, with this two-fold responsibility, he never seemed
                            to lose sight of the dominant purpose of the Christian; the salvation of his own soul. No
                            voice to him was so potent in meaning or dictation as the "still small voice of Conscience,"
                            whose behests he dared not disobey. Hence, no human praise, no adulation, no emoluments of
                            office, had power to raise him in his own estimation above his fellow laborers in the cause
                            of truth. He was ever the same spirituallyminded father and brother. Childhood and youth in
                            simple, confiding trust, were alike attracted to the good man as to a devoted father. The
                            sin sick, the wayward, found in his sympathetic soul and prayerful ministries, the relief,
                            the forgiveness for which they sought. The dear 'Departed' was a man of fervent prayer,
                            consequently, his earnest intercessions, were often signally answered. Like him, may the
                            Church continue in prayer, until able to perpetuate in its every member a life as genuine,
                            as honest before God, as stands the subject of our sketch to-day. Let us all so live, that
                            we may yet rejoice with him among the ransomed. Canterbury, N.

                            flight, as each moment comes to you, labor with your might. One moment is all the time you
                            can have at once. Use it as though you appreciated its value. It is sinful to waste time.
                            There is happiness in every moment spent for God. Spend your moments well. Patient
                            continuance in right-doing is sure to win. Time spent in gaining lasting treasures is well
                            spent. To-morrow you say you will perform neglected duties, and when to-morrow comes you
                            still say, to-morrow. Duties neglected for a time accumulate and become burdensome. A good
                            to-day is the preparation for a good to-morrow. Perform today's duty, fight to-day's
                            temptation. "Draw nigh to God in your warfare and He will draw nigh to you. Correct the
                            faults in yourselves that you think you see in others. You will spoil your happiness if you
                            spare your sins. Days spent in doing right, no need to wish them back again. Make every day
                            bright with good deeds and kind words. You will have none too much time for repentance.
                            Consider the brevity of life. Swift your moments pass away, make your heaven while you may.
                            Wisely improve your time and you will have time enough. So live that you can make others
                            better, and there may be more good people. "Let no one miss the road to heaven for lack of
                            help you might have given." Commit yourselves to God for instruction and guidance. Add a
                            jewel every day to your spirit's shining crown. Cultivate heavenward thoughts. Gain wisdom
                            of mind and virtue of heart, from the high path of duty never depart.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Orcutt, Daniel" TEIform="persName"/>Daniel Orcutt.</byline></div2><pb n="50" id="p28" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To the memory of sister Nancy G.

                                    all the teachers of the three counties represented were there. The amount of
                                    ^biblical and theological knowledge they had was something astounding. On the last
                                    day of the convention the high chief ranger of the affair announced to the four
                                    hundred delegates that he would be pleased to have the knowing ones think up some
                                    hard questions on subjects pertaining to their work, write them on slips of paper
                                    and submit them to him, and that evening, at the last session, which was to be a
                                    sort of entertainment, he would answer them. A lot of people wrote their questions
                                    and gave them to the great professor, and when evening came he had about fifty good
                                    old gnarly problems in his bunch of paper slips. The evening's exercise began with
                                    reading and answering the questions, and though some of them were from away back and
                                    very obtuse, the good man who had put himself up there as a mark, coped with them
                                    successfully and impressed the great gathering with his vast knowledge. Finally he
                                    ran against a question that made him knit his brows. He scowled at it a moment and
                                    then laid it aside. When he answered all the rest he picked up this side-tracked
                                    query and said: "Here is a question which I confess I am unable to answer. I submit
                                    it to the audience, and if any one is able to give the answer I will be glad to hear
                                    what it is." Then he read this query: "Who was the boy and what was his name who
                                    held the basket containing the five loaves and two fishes which fed the multitude?"
                                    Nobody made any effo�t to answer it, and the professor said: "It seems that nobody
                                    knows any more about it than I do. I will have to call on *he person who submitted
                                    the question to come forward and answer it. Will you please do so?''<pb n="51" id="p29" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 51 To the great surprise of the four hundred people
                                    and of his mother as well, Frank Jones, a thirteen year old school boy, got up and
                                    modestly walked up the aisle. Everybody looked at him amazed. The professor said:
                                    "Did you submit this question?" "Yes, sir." "Can you answer it?" "Yes, sir." "Well,
                                    I am sure everybody will be glad to hear it." "The boy," said Frank quietly but
                                    steadily, "was Ben Ezra, son of Miriam, who was a sister of Philip, one of the
                                    twelve disciples." A murmur of astonishment ran over the audience. Here was
                                    something too deep for even the professed theologians in convention assembled. The
                                    professor turned to the boy: "Did you find that in the Bible?" "No, sir." "Where,
                                    then, did you get it?" "In Greek history?" That was the cap sheaf. A lad of thirteen

                                    in an unassuming way that he dug the information out of Greek history. I think it
                                    will be well to give this boy room to spread himself when he becomes a man.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Chicago Mail" TEIform="index"/>Chicago Mail.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>Deaths.</head><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Kaime, James S."

A
                                    writer in the Kentucky Live Stock Record thus calls attention to the evil, which is
                                    as common in its practice in this city as in the blue grass region:� "Let any one
                                    who has the care of a horse these cold, frosty mornings, deliberately grasp in his
                                    hand a piece of iron; indeed, let him touch it to the tip of his tongue, and then
                                    thrust the bit into the mouth of a horse if he has the heart to do it. The horse is
                                    an animal of nervous organization. His mouth is formed of delicate glands and
                                    tissues. The temperature of the blood is the same as in the human being, and, as in
                                    man, the mouth is the warmest part of the body. Imagine, we repeat, the irritation
                                    that would be to the human, and, if not the same degree, still the suffering to the
                                    animal is very great. And it is not a momentary pain. Food is eaten with difficulty,
                                    and the irritation repeated day after day causes loss of appetite and strength. Many
                                    a horse has become worthless from no other cause but this. Before India-rubber bits
                                    were to be had, I myself used a bit covered with leather, and on no account would

                                Park Square, Boston. The Columbia Desk Calendar, which is issued annually by the Pope
                                Manufacturing Company, of Columbia Bicycle fame, is out for 1894, much improved in
                                appearance. It is a pad calendar of the same size and shape as those of previous years,
                                having a leaf for each day, but its attractiveness has been heightened by the work of a
                                clever artist, who has scattered a series of bright pen-drawings through its pages. It
                                also contains, as usual, many appropriate and interesting contributions from people both
                                bright and wise. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Indian Helper" TEIform="index"/>THE INDIAN HELPER

                                its first pages i\ character study of Prof John Tyndall in which Dr. Beall explains many
                                points of great value to students of Phrenology. The veteran phrenologist, Dr. J. L.
                                Capen, contributes some very original and surprising views on the organ of Weight which
                                will excite interest if not controversy. Prof. Sizer continues his elaborate series, How
                                to Study Strangers, and in this number, discusses Quality, with many illustrations. His
                                phrenological delineation of the celebrated reformer, Lucy Stone, is especially
                                sympathetic and closely analytical. It will be read with profit and pleasure. Mrs.
                                Charlotte F. Wells gives an account of George Combe's remarkable experiments with the
                                daughter of Prof. J. J. Mapes, which deserves very particular mention, as it contains
                                certain proofs of phrenological principles which will satisfy the most incredulous and
                                exacting investigators. The editorial features are unusually strong, and a published
                                letter from the eminent scholar, Joseph Cook, on the value of Phrenology, will command
                                wide attention. The other departments are replete with good things. Price, 15 cts; $1.50

                                magazines. Four hundred thousand copies�200 tons �ninety four million pages�enough to
                                fill 200 wagons with 2000 pounds each�in a single line, in close order, this would be a
                                file of wagons more than a mile and a half long. This means not less than 2,000,000
                                readers, scattered throughout every town and village in the United States. The course of
                                The Cosmopolitan for the past twelve months may be compared to that of a rolling
                                snow-ball; more subscribers mean more money spent in buying the best articles and best
                                illustrations in the world; better illustrations and better articles mean more
                                subscribers, and so the two things are acting and reacting upon each other until it
                                seems probable that the day is not far distant when the magazine publisher will be able
                                to give so excellent an article that it will ciaim the attention of every intelligent
                                reader in the country. 52</p></div3></div2><!--

WOMAN'S APPEAL.
The Farmer's Wife, published at Topeka, Kansas, requests every one of our
readers to send fifty cents for a year's subscription to that grand exponent of equal
suffrage. Equal suffrage means continued prohibition. When women vote, prohibition is assured. The Farmer's Wife
pays no salaries; every dollar received
goes toward carrying the amendment in
Kansas next November. Every Christian
prohibitionist should help the cause by
sending as many subscriptions as possible.
