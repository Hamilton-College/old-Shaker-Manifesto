TEIform="persName"/> By Elder Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> TO form a Community on a religious basis, is to change the life of men and women from one of
                            selfishness to that of universal interest and care. The doctrine of me and mine must give
                            place to that of consecration to the Lord, and for the good of his people. The Community is
                            a family on an enlarged plan and requires more care in its management to meet the increast
                            want, and to secure the protection of all the members. Officers must be appointed to direct
                            the varied occupations of those who are expected to take a responsibility in protecting the
                            temporal interests and in securing the peace and happiness of every member. An Order of
                            Ministry presides over two or more Societies. Elders are appointed as the spiritual advisers
                            of a family. They are expected to be present at all religious services and to take the
                            general management. They also instruct the family in the Rules and Regulations which have
                            been adopted and call in question any deviation from these rules, as well as assist in
                            settling any misunderstanding that may have arisen among the members. Other persons may be
                            appointed to take charge of the branches of business and be responsible for their own
                            faithfulness in their respective duties. Upon the Elders, however, devolves the first care
                            and a family that numbers one hundred or more persons, of all ages, all temperaments, and
                            with all the habits common to the race of man, must have some system of government that will
                            make the family one of peace and harmony. The office of Trustees includes several persons
                            who buy and sell and trade in the interest of the Community and hold the deeds of all real
                            estate. These Orders form a committee for the general prosperity of the Society. <pb n="178" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> The Shakers retire at an early hour, and rise early in the morning, allowing
                            some eight hours of rest to all who may wish it. Some families take their breakfast at six
                            o'clock throughout the year, while others prefer a later hour. All due consideration,
                            however, is made for the aged, for the sick, and for little children. No arbitrary rules
                            could be enforced as the age, health and protection of the members need judicious care.
                            Every person in the Community, who is able, is expected to be engaged in some manual
                            occupation, unless other duties prevent. Each family manages its own domestic affairs,
                            agreeably to its own interests. Monday in most Shaker Villages is "washing day," and
                            something unusual must occur to throw it out of place. As there are some fifty or more
                            families among the Shakers, there may be not less than fifty ways of managing this
                            indispensable branch of business. While some do most of the work by hand, or with a small
                            amount of machinery, others have all the improvements that can be found in a first-class
                            laundry. The Shakers regard the Sabbath quite like our Puritan fathers and engage in no
                            temporal business any farther than may be absolutely necessary. It is expected that the day
                            will be devoted to the cultivation of a religious thought especially in the reading of
                            books, pamphlets and papers. All the Societies arrange for seasons of religious devotion,
                            but in this, they are governed by the circumstances that surround their own homes. Some are
                            able to maintain commendable Bible classes or Sabbath Schools, while religious services aie
                            held more or less during the week. The Shakers accept the doctrine of Jesus the Christ and
                            speak of him as the anointed Savior or the Son of God. Jesus was the father of the New
                            Creation of God, and his work was to lead his people into the spirit of God that they might
                            become sons and daughters of God. He led them from a life of generation to a life of
                            regeneration. It was difficult for the Jews to understand this change of discipline when
                            they were already God's chosen people. They were blinded by their carnal commandments and to
                            make them understand this fact, Jesus told them in plain language; "That which is born of
                            the flesh, is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit, is spirit." Adam and Eve were the
                            parents of the old creation. God told them to multiply and they rendered the same obedience
                            to God's will in this respect as did the beasts, birds and fishes. In the ministration of
                            this office all the creation of God are on a level and for six thousand years no improvement
                            has been made in the law. The Shakers admit marriage to be a civil right and properly placed
                            under the authority of the laws of the country. As Jesus never entered that relation, he
                            never gave his disciples any advise to enter it. On the contrary all his testimony was
                            against the selfish life of the world, and against that relation which forms the selfish
                            life of the world. Tolstoi says that if he should see a bear about to strike down a human
                            be- <pb n="179" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> ing, he would settle an ax into the brains of the beast, but he
                            would not do that if he saw one man murderously approach another. Peter in his zeal to
                            defend his Teacher, drew his sword, and Jesus rebuked him, "Put up thy sword, for all they
                            that take the sword shall perish with the sword.*' His people are represented as a peaceable
                            people, dwelling in peaceable habitations. Celsus, a heathen philosopher, who wrote against
                            the Christians near the close of the second century, brings this charge against them as
                            enemies of the state,�"They refused to bear arms even in case of necessity," and they
                            refused because it was contrary to the Christian principle. A funeral among the Shakers is
                            conducted agreeably to the customs of their own order. All the members of the family where
                            the death occurs are present and sometimes those residing in other families. At an appointed
                            hour all enter the chapel and the services are opened by a short exhortation from the
                            officiating Elder. This is followed by the singing of a hymn. Liberty is then extended to
                            any one who may feel so imprest to make a few remarks. During the meeting several pieces may
                            be sung, and in this manner the service continues about an hour when the body is taken to
                            its final resting place. Persons entering the Society become probationary members and may
                            retain the lawful ownership of their property, but the interest accruing therefrom must be
                            devoted to the benefit of the family in which they reside. If they ever become covenantal
                            members, the property will be dedicated and become a part of the consecrated interest. It
                            must be obvious to all, that persons coming into the Society must necessarily have a time of
                            probation in order to prove their faith and integrity, before their sincerity can be tested
                            and their ultimate union as faithful members be establisht. East Canterbury, N.

TEIform="persName"/> By Martha J. Anderson.</byline><p TEIform="p"> IN the recognition of men's need of each other is laid the foundation of the structure of
                            society, and also the growth of the moral sentiment, which places duty before pleasure in
                            the relation we hold to each other in the social compact. The non-fulfillment of the true
                            plan of human life, brings unhappiness to those who are blest with means and power to do
                            good or misery to those who are deprived of the benefits that brighten and bless existence.
                            The former waste their energies in luxury, idleness and self-destructive passions; the
                            latter are driven to enforced idleness and crime by the crying needs engendered by poverty.
                            It is not in the liberal distribution of alms that blessing alone redounds to the giver; but
                            in the rendering of heart and soul service, in de- <pb n="180" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> vising means for
                            the uplifting and bettering of low conditions among the unfortunate. Men are not the
                            separate individuals they are wont to imagine themselves. We are all placed in this world in
                            relation to others, to make of ourselves the noblest and the best in rendering all we have
                            to give for mutual love and service. Our thought of sacrifice, must not be for emolument or
                            reward, but an altruistic self-surrender for unity of attainment in the good that is the
                            inheritance of all. Individualism must lose the ego, in the higher ideal of the greater
                            breadth of-life, love and happiness, that belongs not only to^ one but to many. "Thus the
                            advance of humanity is carried on. But still it remains true, that for the individual the
                            richness and fulness of his life, depends upou the extent of his own givings up. It can not
                            be done for him; for however much may be taken from him unwillingly, it is not until he
                            makes it his own act that he begins to live. It is in this moral sphere that the truth of
                            positive denial receives its most important verification. Not only from the blessed
                            experience of those who have proved that the only true having is in giving up; but equally
                            in the empty, weary discontent of those, who, refusing to accept this law have tried to
                            retain their good things in the self form, and have found that the reality eluded them and
                            what they held so tightly clutcht was a vain shadow." "To him that hath, (holding in the
                            spirit of brotherhood,) shall be given more; to him that hath not, shall be taken away even
                            that he seemeth to have" (all illusory selfish pleasure.) There is a self-consciousness that
                            seeks dominion over the soul, that limits, narrows and draws away from real life, it is
                            inimical to the law of universal love. If we withdraw from the chrysalis of exclusiveness,
                            and expand the higher social and religious elements of our nature, we shall enlarge the
                            sphere of our usefulness and ministration. "It is not good for man to be alone." The scholar
                            and recluse are apt to grow misanthropic. Association with others, gives balance to mind and
                            heart. Self-control is the pivot of harmony. Too much by ourselves we create a surrounding
                            aura that is infilled with our own ills and weaknesses, thus we foster that which we might
                            overcome with the magnetic life currents of others which are strength, hope and
                            cheerfulness. "True love casts out all fear ;" it is brave, helpful and reciprocal. If our
                            thoughts and feelings are engaged in devotion to the high behests of duty, there will come
                            renewed life and activity in every sphere of needful service, but if we are continually
                            seeking to gratify some selfish ambition, we shall fail of attainment in any noble endeavor,
                            and miss at last that which we so ardently seek. How true the thought, ' 'It is only with
                            renunciation that life, properly speaking, can be said to begin. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            people, those who value their reputation, close their doors against him, and banish him from
                            their circle. And here is another man, Senator of the U. S. who in years gone by, had led a
                            wild, fast life, being irregular in his habits. It is declared of him, that he walks under a
                            cloud. Now, that man may have lived for years an exemplary life, otherwise he would not have
                            been chosen to such an exalted position. And yet there is a shadow darkening his life. The
                            influence of our present conduct, is far-reaching into our future state of existence. What
                            we sow that surely we shall reap, the law of compensation is inexorable. If we sow to the
                            wind we shall reap the whirlwind. Often we bring upon ourselves, what we are pleased to call
                            the visitations of Providence. Let all take such examples as a solemn warning, redeeming
                            past error by present uprightness. Forget the past and reach forward into a new life.
                            Forgive as we hope to be forgiven, bearing noill-will against any one. In taking a
                            retrospective view of my past life, I can see how often I have failed and wavered in my
                            faith or strayed from the narrow path yet G-od in his mercy has drawn me back into the right
                            path by means unlookt for and powers unthought of but I knew a Father's and a Mother's care
                            was ruling the billows. In the tempests and the storms of temptation, a strong arm has
                            always been uplifted for my salvation ; a kind hand has been extended for my protection,
                            until I can proclaim that Christ is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God
                            through his testimony and life. Shakers, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Of all great things below, above..." TEIform="index"/>Of all great things below, above...

                                me quite absurd to call the tenth month of the year the eighth. To be logical it should
                                be named December instead of October. To be Astronomical, its proper name according to
                                number should be Uni-december; but it does seem the more unnatural statements are made,
                                the better people in general are suited. Theological creeds and dogma's evidence this.
                                For example; The Trinity, Vicarious atonements, heaven, hell, the fall of man, etc.
                                Well, notwithstanding all the inconsistencies of names, October has been quite a
                                favorable month. It has given us but one rainy day, so we have had an opportunity to
                                prepare for the oncoming cold winter. It has also f urnisht us some pleasant
                                associations. We have had gospel relation from Watervliet, N. Y., Harvard, Mass, and
                                Union Village, Ohio. Oct. 14th our lawsuit terminated in our favor, for which we thank
                                kind Providence. Oct. 31st we had an unusual meeting. We assembled in the Meeting House
                                and listened to a lecture by Ernest H. Crosby of Brooklyn, N. Y. The subject; "Single
                                Tax" as advocated and promulgated by Henry George, lately deceased. The lecture was
                                given by request. It occupied an entire hour, and was very interesting. This closes
                                public meeting for this year, In the evening we had a meeting composed of the Church and
                                North families. Ernest H. Crosby was present and was deeply affected by the spirit of
                                the meeting which was truly inspirational. The Angel bands were with us. We felt their
                                heavenly influence. Meeting occupied at least one and a half hours. Our visitor thought
                                we did not do right in not spreading our doctrines through the aid of missionaries of
                                our faith. Elder Joseph sent me a note stating that the Ministry would leave Enfield on
                                Nov. 4th for Hancock. The probability is that befora-many months an electric R. R. will
                                run from Greenbush through our place to Pittsfield, Mass. Work has commenced on it

                                Calvin O. Heed. North Family. Nov. 1897. Among the list of visitors we had the pleasure
                                of entertaining the past month is the name of E. H. Crosby, an earnest <pb n="184" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> worker in the social as well as political movements of the day. Spending
                                the Sabbath with us, he was invited to address the assembly on the "Moral and Religious
                                aspect of Single Tax." As it was Sunday he took (as he usually does on such occasions)
                                his text from the Bible. "The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's, but the earth
                                hath he given to the children of men."�Psa. cxv., 16. While he does not believe that the
                                Single Tax movement is the beginning and end of all things, yet he recognizes the fact
                                that the taxes should be placed on the valuation of the land instead of the individual
                                labor of improving the homestead, which necessarily raises the taxes, to the
                                discouragement of the laboring classes. The land belonging to the Lord who has a right
                                to monopolize it! They who own the land also own the people who live on it, proving his
                                statement by quoting from Gen. xlvii., 23. "Then Joseph said unto the people, behold
                                have I bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; lo, here is seed for you and ye
                                shall sow the land," showing forth the fact that the command of tlie landlord requires
                                obedience or expulsion. In the course of his very interesting discouse he alluded to
                                Elder F. W. Evans1 writing. "The practical principle which Christ instructed Jesus, was
                                brotherhood, to love his neighbor as himself, and not to appropriate to his own selfish
                                uses to the exclusion of those on the same plane, either of the life elements�earth,
                                air, fire or water." Roger W. Montgomery a traveler and writer, also spent a week with
                                us. With the many opportunities of giving as well as receiving we find our measure
                                filled with the good things of God. Sarah J.

                                Father in the New Creation, we thought of many of those blessed saints who have past on
                                before and we askt; Are they still interested in us, their children, to help ns by their
                                heavenly influence, giving strength to the weak and encouraging the faint-hearted? In
                                the silence of our meditations the answer came; "We are still with you and our influence
                                is growing stronger as the years roll on." When we read of what they suffered for the
                                Truth's sake we are ashamed even to think of crying the burden of the Lord. As we see
                                the portends of the coming upheavals in social and religious life we feel that strong
                                souls are needed to meet those conditions with a courage befitting the times. The
                                testimony of the new life is not dead neither doth it slumber, for like a mighty army
                                with banners cometh those sainted souls from the summer land with love and power and
                                their march is one of triumphant victory. In conjunction with our singing school Sunday
                                afternoon, an effort is being made to establish a school for moral and intellectual
                                development, on the lines of original thinking. A subject is announced at one meeting
                                and essays are written or spoken upon that topic the succeeding Sunday; the object being
                                to develop the latent powers of the young by providing that which is both interesting
                                and instructive. Hope that success will crown the effort.

                                tiny flea to the Palmetto and Pines which cover the land as far as the eye can see. [Not

                                for the first two years. Patience and a clear conscience, have been the remedies for
                                mental and physical sorrow. And they have workt wonders. Cold and rainy October has
                                past, but it gave us a good opportunity to put in our fall crops. The lakes have risen 3
                                ft. 2 in. and that is one foot too high for cultivating the low muck lands. Our northern
                                potatoes which were nearly all planted on these low lands, have rotted, but as the
                                weather seems settled we shall replant them. In the past two weeks we have cleared
                                another three acres of pine and oak land, for the spring crop of sweet potatoes. A good
                                measure of health abides with us, and an occasional ride through the pine groves affords
                                us some of nature's best remedies to keep off malarial troubles and may be other
                                diseases. At this season of the year the pine groves of Florida are beautiful and
                                fragrant. Thousands of flowers are in full bloom which nature has so bountifully given

                                season, our crops of hay, grain, tubers and fruits are fair. Sufficient for the usual
                                needs of the family and some over. Our dairy stock is now occupying the new barn, with
                                every prospect of passing the winter comfortably. The last week of Oct. was made very
                                pleasant to us by the presence, for a too brief visit, of Sisters trom the South family
                                of Watervliet. They introduced themselves to us at the opening of onr Sabbath meeting
                                and won our hearts at once by a beautiful gift of song, rich in ministration of Angelic
                                love and power. Our social unions with them dining the visit were also very enjoyable.

                                love and encouragement to us, the greatest of these is Sister Ednah Fitts, who is kindly
                                sent by the Society at East Canterbury as a teacher of music. We realize the sacrifice
                                it must be to her and her people and also the great benefit to us. In her we find a true

                                ploughing and fencing, working faithfully during Elder William's absence, thus proving
                                that their interests are truly centered in our consecrated home. "In Union there is
                                Strength." This motto is true for when we are all at home together, even tho our numbers
                                are small, we feel strong, and naught shall ever sever the bond of love which unites us.

The lovely autumn days have past. Days of beauty ever new; of fresh glowing
                                tints on trees and shrubs; of magnificent sunsets, when the mellow tints of day meeting
                                the darkening shades of night uniting in rich harmony flood the earth with glory. And
                                the clear nights! As we look at the cloudless sky, perforated with its numberless
                                shining stars, we think how aptly Longfellow describes it;� "Silently, one by one, in
                                the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget- me-nots of the
                                angels." Certainly we can not doubt the loving care of a Father who thus proves his
                                remembrance of us. In the early history of our Society there leaned upon the side of the
                                mountain, rising at the west of our valley, a barn, famous for its spacious apartments.
                                In these rooms Eld. James Whittaker often spoke to large audiences the simple and
                                powerful words of life. As years past on, like other barns, less famous, it became
                                useless and was destroyed, but the beams marking the pulpit of the noted preacher were
                                preserved and placed in the new barn which was built upon the site of the old one. For
                                nearly fifty years it has stood like a fort, its walls painted by sun and rain in
                                Nature's water colors, its doors and windows smiling a welcome alike to summer tramp or
                                wealthy traveller seeking a shelter from the storm. On the 27th ult. flames were&gt;een
                                ascending from its roof and encircling its sides. And so it fell, leaving a pleasant
                                memory and a good insurance. Some forest fires have also visited our mountains. One
                                burned about eight acres making quite a desert in the thick wooded hills. Sr. Catherine
                                Allen of North family, Mt. Lebanon is sharing our home for a few days, and we are
                                grateful for the opportunity thus given of enjoying the presence of one so earnest and
                                true. Thus life passes! We can not call the daily work a duty, if we partake freely of
                                the spiritual life which Jesus said should be like a fountain of water, overflowing
                                because its waters are constantly supplied from unfailing springs, for we shall
                                transform these duties into glad privileges.

After a long and painful drouth, which dried up our pastures and threatened
                                to destroy all our wheat and barley prospects on the 1st of Nov. it began to rain
                                moderately and about three inches of water have fallen, very much to our advantage � and
                                comfort. On the 25th of Nov. we <pb n="187" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> shall be able to render due
                                thanks to our Heavenly Father for his mercy and kindness in this as in all other matters
                                in which he has kindly noticed us during the present year. The greatest by far, of all
                                these blessings, is the Gospel which enables us to walk in innocence and purity, as good
                                Elder Matthew used to phrase it. I suppose that none are so unfortunate and unhappy, as
                                those who having been blest with this unspeakable treasure have turned once more to the
                                beggarly elements of the world. Let us hope that through this crucible of misery, they
                                may eventually be restored to a better estate. Well�we are trying to carry the
                                Institution along as nearly according to the principles of godliness as the conditions
                                will allow, giving no license to anything we think would compromise these principles.
                                Through joy or sorrow, what better can we do? We are repairing some, burning hedgebrush
                                and trimming trees, and the young people have been on two or three expeditions into the
                                woods for nuts. It is raining again this morning and our fall pastures will do nicely
                                and our wheat and barley "take root downward and bear truit upward," with the blessing
                                of the good Father and Mother of all upon it. So we are under heavy obligations to our
                                Heavenly Parents, for so much blessing and let us not forget that he that is unthankful,
                                is unholy. We have had no cholera among our stock so far this season, and it is all in
                                fine condition. What a heavenly thing it is to forgive. No wonder our Savior insisted on
                                it so strongly. When we forgive an injury it can give us no more pain, and will give the
                                offending party a great deal of pleasure, besides exciting him to a radical reformation.
                                It is such a blessed thing to forgive that I never need any apology for injuries;�I can
                                always forgive without any such apology so far as I am concerned. "Mercy is seasonable
                                in times of affliction, as showers of rain in times of drouth." What an invaluable
                                blessing it is to be improving every moment of life in getting more and more imbued with
                                charity and purity. I never felt so clear of the lower proclivities of our common nature
                                in my life as now, still I must progress and persevere forever. If I should cease to
                                grow my existence would become an unbearable stagnation and monotony. Mother Ann
                                said,�"If I could, I would make all the world full of peace and happiness." I feel just
                                so myself. May The Manifesto float the glad tidings of Salvation to a rudimental and a
                                needy world. Oliver C.

H.</head><p TEIform="p"> Nov. 1897. I see by the Progressive Thinker, that there is a large band of
                                Anti-Spiritualists banding together, to suppress all mediums from their labors, also to
                                stop the spreading of Modern Spiritualism. I hope that every fraud medium will be
                                shelved. To assert that the teachings of Spiritualism, contain no elevating influences,
                                no truths that Jesus the Clnist taught and lived, is self-accused ignorance of
                                understanding the lessons of life, of him who said, Let him who is without sin, cast the
                                first sfone. Neither do I condemn thee, go and sin no more. Before I answered to the
                                call of Shakerism, Spiritualism was the divine guide that kept me in early life from
                                many of the courts wherein sin and folly slowly and surely sinks below the waves of
                                moral degradation, thousands of young people. As I glance over the lai'ge volume of
                                Shakerism, I see that Ann Lee like Jesus, received revelations from intelligences, not
                                of themselves also wrought out in life, marvelous works of spirit power. Otlu-r &gt; have,
                                and which all tlie Anti-Spirituaii s can not do. If those spirit manifestations were the
                                result of human trickery, then let us learn the trade, to heal the sick, give
                                impeachable messages of spirit return, preach pure, honest living to God, and fill the
                                world with literature, art and music, radiant with divine wisdom and <pb n="188" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> beauty, as is the strife of the true cultured Spiritualist. We are

                                        be used in this way, and the windfalls of early autumn, when one is fortunate
                                        enough to own an orchard, will be found quite available. They should be peeled,
                                        cored and freed from every blemish, then cut up in quite small pieces. A large
                                        earthen jar with a cover should be ready to receive them. Into this put first a

                                        then more sugar and cinnamon, and so on until the jar is full. The sugar should
                                        be regulated according to the tartness of the apples, from a quarter to a half
                                        pound for one pound of apples being the rule. The jar should be placed at the

                                        day. It should then be set away to cool and the apples taken out only as they
                                        are needed for sauce and desserts. Having no water mixt with them, apples

When something tempts jou to grow angry,
                                    do not yield to the temptation. It may for a minute or two be difficult to control
                                    yourself, but try it. Foi-ce yourself to do nothing, to say nothing, and the rising
                                    temper will be obliged to go down because it has nothing to hold it up. What is
                                    gained by yielding to temper? For a moment there is a feeling of relief, but soon
                                    comes a sense of sorrow and shame, with a wish that the temper had been controlled.
                                    Friends are separated by a bad temper, trouble is caused by it, and pain is given to
                                    others as well as to self. The pain, too, often lasts for days, even years�sometimes
                                    for life. An outburst of temper is like the bursting of a steam boiler; it is
                                    impossible to tell beforehand what will be the result. The evil done may never be
                                    remedied. Starve your temper. It is not worth keeping alive.

                                judging from its past history, it will not be many weeks in finding its way into homes
                                and offices all over America. It is much larger and finer than any previous issue. It
                                contains 116 pages, is splendidly printed and illustrated on fine book paper, having the
                                finest portrait ever given of Prof. Hicks. It can no longer be denied that the
                                publications of Prof. Hicks have become a necessity to the family and commercial life of
                                this country. His journal Word and Works, aside from its storm weather and astronomical
                                features, has taken rank with the best literary, scientific and family magazines of the
                                age. Do not believe hearsay and reports. See the Hicks Almanac and paper for yourself.
                                You will then know why they are so popular. They are educators of the millions, and
                                unrivaled safeguards to property and human life. It is matter of simple record that
                                Prof. Hicks has foretold for many years all great storms, floods, drouths and tornadoes,
                                even the recent terrible drouth over all the country. The Almanac alone is 25 cents a
                                copy. The paper is $1,00 a year with the Almanac as a premium. Send to Word and Works
