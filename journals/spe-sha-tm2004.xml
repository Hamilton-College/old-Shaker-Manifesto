                            OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 10.</head><p TEIform="p">EDUCATION. This subject may prove interesting to those who may read of the
                            progressive steps taken by the Believers, in obtaining a good and substantial education. The
                            first Elders, who came from England, were limited in their privileges, and could not secure
                            for themselves the advantages'which are so much to be desired. On embracing the testimony of
                            living truth, they became too deeply absorbed in their gospel mission, to turn aside for
                            even that which was so desirable. Those, in this country, who embraced the faith, had only
                            limited opportunities for an education, as was the case with the common people, generally.
                            All the district schools were very deficient, and the people were in no condition to pay
                            much attention to a more liberal education for their children, and for several years the
                            subject was very much neglected. After the organization of the Community the children were
                            provided for much better, and the common branches of education were taught very
                            satisfactorily. In 1808 better privileges were secured for the pupils, and more attention
                            was paid to the proper use of language. Evening schools were established and a good degree
                            of interest manifested in support. These were open to any Brother or Sister who wished to
                            attend. These schools were alternately opened and closed, as circumstances demanded.
                            Sometimes they were in session only for a few weeks and then for a much longer term. In 1815
                            more attention was paid to education and the school was kept more regularly. The number of
                            pupils had so increased in the several families that in 1817, a public school was opened for
                            the benefit of all the children. This was formed on a plan known as the "Lancasterian
                            System." The school was under the direction of the Church family, and the teacher was a
                            member of their family. A session was held in the summer for the boys and in the winter for
                            the girls. From thirty to sixty pupils attended each term. Considerable attention was given
                            to reading, spelling, writing, geography, arithmetic and grammar, as well as to other
                            miscellaneous in-<pb n="74" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> struction. A special interest was
                            manifested in 1830 in the formation of a Bible Class, in which recitations were made from
                            Scripture, questions proposed and explanations made, to give a better understanding of these
                            subjects and to promote the principles of virtue and morality. The public school moved along
                            prosperously for about eighteen years, when in 1835 it was thought best to establish other
                            district schools in the Community, and essentially lessen the burden of teaching. In 1831) a
                            school-house was built, and since that date the school has been kept regularly summer and
                            winter, each having a term of four months. The new house gave better accommodations to the
                            pupils, and a commendable advancement was soon to be discovered throughout the whole school.
                            Several other branches of education were added as essential to the general welfare, such as
                            music, algebra, astronomy and agricultural chemistry. Our school, from the first, has been
                            under the inspection of the S. S. C. of the town, and been governed by the same law as other
                            districts. In our efforts to maintain a good school we have universally obtained the
                            approbation of the Committee. BL ACKSMITHIXG. This was a very important and indispensable
                            branch of business. Among those gathered, several were good workmen, and still continued in
                            the business. They not only did all that the Believers needed, but accepted jobs from those
                            not of the Community. At the same time they made axes, hoes, knives and clothiers' shears.
                            Very little was done at iron work in the line of nice machinery, till 1793, when Benj. Bruce
                            invented and made an ingenious machine for the setting of card teeth. Valuable improvements
                            were made in 1800 by the introduction of a trip-hammer, although it would now be considered
                            of an indifferent construction. In 1828 the first foot lathe was made and used for turning
                            and drilling. A machine was built in 1846 which was very valuable for the gumming of saws,
                            punching holes in heavy irons, &amp;c. These were followed by the manufacture of several
                            engine lathes, to be propelled by water power. These greatly facilitated the iron work and
                            contributed very much to the advancement of machinery. A new building was fitted up for the
                            blacksmiths in 1846, having a water power sufficient for driving a triphammer, a large lathe
                            and various forms of machinery, to answer the purpose of some four or five workmen. From the
                            first there has been a gradual improvement in tools, conveniences, as well as in general
                            machinery. In connection with this we refer to the business of making hammered or wrought
                            and cut nails. For several years this was a profitable business, and a source of
                            considerable income. These wrought nails were used in the coarser work while building, until
                            the year 1812 when they were superseded by the cut nails. Wrought nails were also used as
                            early as 1780 for shingling and lathing, but on the introduction of cut nails, soon after
                            the organ-<pb n="75" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> izatiou of the Community the wrought nails
                            passed out of use. The machinery for cut nails, and the work of forming the heads by a hand
                            hammer, employed not less than twelve persons and yielded a very profitable income. After a
                            few years, nail factories were opened in different parts of the country, affording the nails
                            so cheaply that the business became unprofitable for the Believers, and we closed the
                            manufacture in the year 1830. Beside the usual work of a blacksmith, the Brethren made door
                            trimmings, as hinges and handles, also cooking utensils, shovels and tongs and a great
                            variety of articles in all the various departments. The great improvement that has been made
                            in the manufacture of iron and steel, in its form and size, has relieved the blacksmiths
                            from a great deal of laborious work with the hand hammer.

                            spirit of forgiveness. As we are all human, born into the world with a nature prone to*evil,
                            we must expect to be tried on all points by the opposing elements of good. When such trials
                            and conditions come, which they surely will, in the course of things, then is the time to
                            bring into exercise this noble spirit of forgiveness. What is more exalting in an
                            individual, when they see their faults, than to have enough of the true spirit of Christ to
                            acknowledge them ? What heart is so hard or feelings so cold that can withhold from a
                            Brother or Sister, this beautiful spirit, who knowingly have in an unguarded hour dropped a
                            careless word which has wounded the good spirit in a companion. Seeing his fault he comes
                            with a penitent spirit acknowledging the wrong. In an unguarded hour I was overcome by a
                            wrong spirit which led me to speak hard words to you. CJpon reflection I see I am wrong and
                            now 1 have come to make reconciliation, and ask your forgiveness. With this spirit in an
                            individual he will never rest until every debt is cancelled. Like the apostle John, who by
                            his preaching had gained a very noble spirit to the faith, (Polycarp,) after being an
                            earnest worker for a time in the Christian cause, turned therefrom and joined a band of
                            robbers. John hearing of the failure of his disciple, went in search of him ; and it is
                            said, followed him to the robbers' camp and found hiin captain of the band. The robber
                            recognized John and falling upon his knees before the apostle, implored his forgiveness.
                            John, whose noble soul was always full of this spirit, stretched forth his hands and took
                            him again into his affection and love. A worthy example for imitation. Truly, this brings
                            home the injunction of our Savior, not only seven times but seventy times seven, 490 times.
                            This to the understanding mind would seem impossible for an individual to be offended so
                            many times. But Jesus in all his sayings was governed by great wisdom. He knew the
                            impossibility of being offended so many times, but to show the necessity of forgiveness he
                            made the remark.

                            grieve it." Iu speaking of the youth Father James said, "You are the branches of a good
                            tree, and I can see the branches flourish and grow. Remember you are not the root, but the
                            branches. It is my privilege to speak against all evil, and when I cannot speak against it,
                            I will breathe against it."� John Warner. In the winter of 1788 two Brethren and eight
                            Sisters residing in the town of Harvard, Mass., went to Watervliet, N. Y., to see Mother Ann
                            and the Elders. One sleigh accommodated the whole company. Deep snow drifts in some places
                            and the ground quite bare iu others, made the journey long and wearisome. In some instances
                            most of the company would leave the sleigh and walk a short distance, but the meltiug snows
                            of one day would so wet their garments that they became very uncomfortable, while on the
                            next day their garments would be so frozen as to prevent them from enjoying much
                            satisfaction on the trip. They arrived at Watervliet before the rising of the sun, having
                            for the last twenty-four hours interrupted their journey only to feed their horses and to
                            partake of some refreshments provided for the company. Klder Calvin Harlow met these friends
                            from Harvard, and falling upon his knees, said,�"Dear friends, I have been praying for you
                            all night." When they reached t'.e house iu which Mother Ann dwelt, she opened the door and
                            came out to see them. "You are the \~ery ones," said she, "that I have borne on my heart and
                            soul all through this night." Mother Ann aud the whole company th?,n kneeled aud returned

                            the threshold to the kingdom of man divine. How expressive and intelligent, strengthening

                            admonishes and advises faithfully, constantly and unmistakably. How faint yet positive the
                            voice is in dilliculties which former experience has not encountered yet, or in affairs
                            close to the boundary line of wrong and right, wrhen the least step either leads into the
                            kingdom of right or into the anarchy of wrong. How unfailingly follows satisfaction when
                            ours was the right step, how inevitable remorse, when wrong. How careful and prayerful,
                            trusting and full of faith should we be, not once to suppress this monitor which the more it
                            is obeyed, the quicker and louder it becomes till- the truly redeemed steers his life-boat
                            safely through life's ocean, whereas when once disobeyed the voice is but faintly heard the
                            next time, and will be missed entirely after repeated disregards. Often do I wish to find a
                            talisman which forever may protect me and be a never failing guide in sudden emergencies, a
                            support and strength in times of sickness, excitement, weakness, doubt and temptation ; a

                            usv into regions unexplored by our experience, a rule in all undertakings and business
                            whenever we voluntarily leave the secure harbor and willingly face and engage in new battles
                            and struggles to gain more good by risking the already gained for a fuller victory. And this
                            talisman, after having accomplished all this, would be a brake on the chariot of victory, a

                            what spirituality there yet remains with Believers in our sacred worship. One or two, who
                            have no real interest in the meetings, would be pleased to have the innovation. A few, are
                            indifferent. The Elders, while in no way prejudiced against instrumental music, if it can be
                            kept subordinate to the spiritual, unite with the gift of our Lead. But, seeing humanity is
                            constitutionally lazy, spiritually, and is ever seeking to climb up some other way than
                            laboring for a trae spiritual gift with which to feed their own and other sonls, we should
                            look upon the introduction of instrumental music into our worship meetings with disfavor.
                            When that wave of deep conviction which we are all looking for reaches mankind, and souls
                            are made to feel their hungry and naked condition, will it be the foolish things that now
                            agitate Believers they will ask for? Is it not the living bread and waters of life that they
                            will be expecting? They have the fashions and pleasures of this world in perfection, as
                            Believers in Christ and Mother's Gospel can never enjoy, as these will not satisfy the
                            hungry soul. One soul who is trnhy baptized into the virgin life of Christ will bringmore
                            conviction to the souls of men, than all the instruments of music the world ever saw. Zion

                            Proud was thy spirit when it rose and smiled, Intent to reach its own ambitious height; The

                            trial, steady was thy aim, Thy soul's devotion centered to Her Cause, And to Her love
                            confidingly laid claim. Her peorle were thy kindred, in their hearts Thy home of homes was
                            found and made secure, The Blocking enemy sent poisoned darts, But thou wert shielded by an
                            armor pure. Not through the lenses of to-day we view The worth which we have counted year by
                            year, Not in the tearful time when flowers we strew, Do we first learn to prize and hold
                            thee dear. Could gold of Ophir buy thy loving toil Or prompt the hand so ready to bestow'?
                            Could station give the balsam and the oil That thro' the soul's affections had their flow?
                            Half o'er a century the field extends Whereon broadcast thy glorious deeds were wrought,
                            Where sainted, hallowed souls became thy friends, And blest thee with the love thy spirit
                            sought. Then what to thee was all the world's false show? Its aspirations were the tempest's
                            breath; When once thy feet had found the valley low The road to glory was the path to death.
                            Thy faith had tests severe, when kith and kin And comrades loved and cherished in the way
                            Turned from the fold to devious wiles of sin, Thy choice was heavenward, where Oh where are
                            they? Immortal life is thine ; thy soul is strong To bear the changes of the transient
                            state; Thou hast a trust, a triumph and a song, With which to enter at the Morning Gate. The
                            flowers of earth to thee were more than fair, They were the gifts of God so freely given In
                            answer to the world's sick, yearning prayer, When mortals craved some token�boon from
                            heaven. There in that land where all the bloom is sweet, Beyond the loveliness of which we
                            dreamed, Shall Zion's faithful ones united meet. And by her laws refining be redeemed. The
                            opaque pebble-crust from souls removed, The diamonds polished by the life divine, Shall
                            blend their lustre with the hosts beloved� God's living jewels�evermore to shine. Such is
                            the end of faith to us revealed, However much to do or long to wait; Through labor are the
                            promises unsealed That bear the glory of the holy state. There is one baptism, above, below,
                            One way, divided by a mountain cloud, We climb the steep up which thy feet must go, While
                            only silvery screening mists enshroud. But, we shall miss thee from external sight, Our
                            outward senses oft will feel a void, Yet from earth's shadow to eternal light The bond of
                            union cannot be destroyed. We give thee thanks for the unmeasured good Which in thy
                            consecration had its root; We give thee blessing, that will ever brood Upon a life that bore
                            unselfish fruit. The ministrations coming from the gift Bring fortitude and courage to us
                            all; Dear angel-hands the burdens help to lift, And angels' soothing accents gently fall.
                            These spirit friends that now our numbers swell, Are from our Zion home that is above; We
                            dare not emphasize the word, Farewell, But we have clothed and crowned thee with our love.

                            Pure religion then manifests itself in acts of kindness and charity toward our fellow-men.

                            you'll greet. Fear not the rolling river, Nor dash of the boatman's oar." She then embarked

                            passer-by is fortunate if he escape some rudeness or insult. When I see ministers, editors,
                            and public teachers using the* contemptuous expressions of "Tom" Paine, " Abe " Lincoln or "
                            Ape " Lincoln, and "Bob" Ingersoll, I ask myself, "Were these men, when boys, taught good
                            manners ?" They are zealous, religious advocates of Sunday laws, applicable to a day which
                            they select, out of the seven days ; and that day not the Scriptural Sabbath at all, but a
                            heathen /S?mday. These men presumptuously assume to select the day, determine how it shall
                            be kept and by whom; compelling, like familiars of the Holy Inquisition, by fine and
                            imprisonment, those who have no faith in it, and who want nothing to do with it. I say,
                            "Great is the mystery of" ��godliness. "Mystery" was written on the forehead of the symbolic
                            woman who represented church and state�Babylon ; the mystery of a trinity of three male
                            Gods. The absurdity of an atonement�of one person being punished, and that person a God, for
                            other persons' iniquities ; and the d-v-1-t-y of an Inquisition that would fain torture
                            human beings for not believing its doctrines of devils; believing, not from evidence, but by
                            authority. Those are God-&amp;-Christ-in-the American constitution people, who seek to
                            destroy the only civil government upon earth that impinges not upon liberty of conscience
                            the inalienable right of human beings. Are not the infidels to this persecuting church and
                            state system, like Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Franklin, Abraham Lincoln and Robert
                            Ingersoll, the "horns"�rationalists�that grew out of the head of the Beast; who hated
                            "Mystery" the whore that rode it, and tormented her with the ;Age of Reason,' with 'Common,
                            Sense,' with the 'Rights of Man' and with the 'Crisis,' which produced the American
                            Revolution, the Declaration of Independence, and finally established a civil government that
                            is no more a Christian than it is a Buddhist or Mohammedan government? Honor to whom honor
                            is due ; respect and reverence to those friends of man who founded a republic free from

                            PENN.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">The case of William Penn is perhaps the fairest and fullest
                                    illustration of pacific principles, in their bearing on the intercourse of nations.
                                    The king himself had expressly abandoned these Quakers entirely to their own
                                    resources. 'What!" said Charles II. to Penn on the eve of his departure, "venture
                                    yourself among the savages of North America? Why, man, what security have you that
                                    you will not be in their war kettle within two hours after setting your foot on
                                    their shores?" "The best security in the world," said the man of Peace. "I doubt
                                    that, friend William ; I have no idea of security against those cannibals but a
                                    regiment of good soldiers with their muskets and bayonets, and I will tell you
                                    beforehand, that with all of my good will to you and your family, to whom I am under
                                    obligations, I will not send a single soldier with you." "I want none of thy
                                    soldiers; I depend on something better." "Better, on what?" "On the Indians
                                    themselves ; on their moral sense, and the promised protection of God." Ah! this
                                    good man trusted in the Most High, and knew Him in whose promise he confided. He had
                                    experimental knowledge that if he trusted in Him he would never be confounded�if he
                                    stayed upon Him he would never be dismayed. "It is better to trust in the Lord than
                                    to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence
                                    in princes." He tried "the holy experiment," and found it to succeed. ''He had in
                                    view the glory of God by the civilization of the poor Indians and the conversion of
                                    the Gentiles by jvst and lenient measures to Christ." In the great treaty under the
                                    elm, "Penn's honored tree of record," the wanderers of the forest solemnly pledged
                                    themselves "to live in love with 'brother Onas' and his children as long as the sun
                                    and moon should endure." More has been said in praise of this treaty than of any
                                    other ever transmitted to posterity. Voltaire says ; "This is the only treaty
                                    between those people and the Christians that was not ratified by an oath, and that
                                    never was broken." Noble remarks : "No blood was shed, and the Christian and
                                    barbarian met as brothers. Penn has thus taught us to respect the lives and
                                    properties of the most unenlightened of nations." Robert Proud tells us "he treated
                                    the Indians with great justice and sincere kindness. It was at this time when he
                                    first entered person�lly into that friendship with them, which ever afterwards
                                    continued, and which for the space of more than seventy years was never interrupted,
                                    or so long as the Quakers retained power in the government. His conduct in general
                                    to these people was so engaging, his justice in particular so conspicuous, and the
                                    counsel and advice which he gave them was so eminently for their advantage, that he
                                    became thereby very much endeared to them; and the sense thereof made such deep
                                    impressions on their understandings t^at his name and memory will scarcely ever be
                                    effaced while they continue a people." No marvel is it that such a man could take
                                    leave of his friends, one of whom was his tried true, and beloved Thomas Story, with
                                    "My love is with you; the Lord preserve you, and remember me in the everlasting
                                    covenant," or that the testimony could be borne on his behalf that "he had the
                                    inward appearance of the enjoyment of the Deity Himself by an almost constant
                                    communion with his Holy Spirit."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Messenger of peace" TEIform="index"/>Messenger of Peace.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Let us measure our goodness by our love to God..."

TEIform="persName"/>Amelia J. Calver.</byline><p TEIform="p">This cruel and devastating war, caused by the contest between the Roman
                            Catholics, and Protestants in Germany, began iu Bohemia in 1618, and ended by the Peace of
                            Westphalia, at Munster iu 1648. By the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, sixty-three years
                            previous, it was left to each State to prescribe the form of worship within its own
                            boundaries, and all subjects were allowed to move from those Mates where their worship was
                            forbidden, to those in which it was not. But Church and State, or religion aud politics,
                            became iuvolved in so many controversies, that perpetual and bitter strifes pervaded the
                            whole country, and it needed ouly a spark to cause the great conflagration of war; and the
                            spark was given when Ferdinand of Styria, a fanatic, educated by the Jesuits, was crowned
                            King of Bohemia, a Protestant State, as successor to rulers who had pledged themselves to
                            support the laws regarding religious liberty. The war falls into four distinct periods. The
                            first part extended to 1623, during which time the contestants were Frederic V., to whom the
                            Bohemians offered their throne, and Ferdinand who had been appointed by Matthias. Frederic
                            was defeated in 1623, placed under a ban, and bereft of all his possessions. The war which
                            might have ended here, but for the improvidence and stubbornness of the emperor Ferdinand,
                            took on a new phase. Two Austrian armies under Tilly and Wallenstein, now marched against
                            the North German princes, who were under the leadership of Christian IV., of Denmark. In
                            this campaign as in the other the Catholics were victorious, and the Peace of Lubec
                            compelled Christian of Denmark to withdraw his assistance from Germany. Here again in 1629,
                            the war might have closed, had it not beeu that Ferdinand confiscated all ecclesiastical
                            estates in possession of the Protestants aud ordered Tilly to move northward and crush eveiy
                            attempt at resistance. At this critical moment Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, stepped
                            forward to assist the Protestants, and the third phase of the war commenced. It was during
                            this campaign that the horrible plunder and massacre of Magdeburg, a Protestant city, took
                            place, under Tilly, where 130,000 of the inhabitants were destroyed in three days, and only
                            one hundred and thirty houses left. In November 1632, Gustavus fell at Lutzen, but the
                            Catholics under Wallenstein were defeated, aud retreated to Bohemia. The war now changed
                            character to one of political interests, where crowns and not religions were fought for.
                            Here France stepped in, by the advice of Cardinal Richelieu, whose aim it was to humble the
                            House of Hapsburg. The French fearfully devastated the country, and their participation is
                            considered the worst chapter in the war. The last contest took place where it began, in
                            Bohemia, and when the Swedish army was about to make an attack on Prague, news came of the
                            Peace of Westphalia Oct. 24, 1648. The entire exhaustion of Austria, the offensive party,
                            caused the final cessation of hostilities. The emperor Ferdinand did not lose his title, but
                            was deprived of the greater part of his author-<pb n="84" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> ity ;
                            while the power of the princes was so considerably extended, that the empire became nearly
                            dissolved. Holland and Switzerland were declared independent. Alsace was given to France,
                            Pomerania to Sweden. Such is history. The pure aud peaceful religion of Jesus Christ, and
                            its form of worship, taken as a pretext for the annihilation, by cruel war, of the very
                            flower of civilized and Christian Europe, while the apostle says,�"'The wisdom that is from
                            above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy, and good
                            fruits." And the prophet declares that where the peaceable kingdom of Christ is established,
                            on earth, "�The wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid ;
                            and the calf and the young lion, and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead

                            Physical hunger can only be satisfied by material food. With the masses, this can be secured
                            only by arduous labor. Such as have never suffered to obtain subsistence cannot feel the
                            gratiude and appreciation experienced by those who pay the price with brain or muscle. Those
                            who share an abundance in earthly possessions too often know nothing of the true soul
                            satisfaction ; for the soul immortal even though cramped aud dwarfed by earthly conditions,
                            asserts its need of spiritual sustenance. But they alone who hunger and thirst after
                            righteousness, that is, after God, the knowledge of the truth pertaining to right living,
                            "�shall be filled." Desires for worldly honor and riches should be subordinate to this prime
                            object of seeking for righteousness. The promise of God to all who desi-e far something
                            beyond self are very encouraging ; none need hesitate. "Ask and ye shall receive, seek and
                            ye shall find." What we sincerely desire we usually seek with uninterrupted zeal until the
                            coveted object is within our reach. Living in good society and having the knowledge of much
                            truth will fail to perfect our lives in the beauty of holiness if we are self-satisfied and
                            contented with our limited knowledge of God. We read that it is one of tin; most difficult
                            tasks to keep the soul of man open to the iufinite and the smaller the' soul the more
                            difficult the task. Blessed, indeed, are those who seek for spiritual life, for they are in
                            a receptive condition and will surely be filled with goodness from Eternal sources.

                            weapon but the gospel sword. It is powerful enough when wielded within. With eyes open to
                            all the foes within struggling lo overcome the powers of good, I would burst the fetters and
                            scatter the foes that dwell in my own heart. For there is no greater enemy than one's self.
                            The conflLt is not won in a day, a week, a month or a year, but is a life struggle. It
                            requires a bright burning light within, a daily refilling and trimming of the lamp of the
                            soul, and a burning indignation against all that would retard the travel of the soul. To
                            gain a rich increase, labor is required and this labor is to cultivate true Christian
                            virtues, by uprooting all that is evil. One may possess a very bad habit which, growing for
                            years may have taken deep root, it is just like the obnoxious weed in the garden it requires
                            the united strength of each other to uproot it, the attempt is made, the visible part is
                            cropped off but ere long growth is observed, coarse green leaves appear and we know the root
                            remains. In the spiritual growth, is a deep work, it searches, it goes down to the
                            foundation, undermining, te iriug and pulling apart all those elements of the natural
                            disposition which cause rebellion and destruction, making room for the rise and progress of
                            the spiritual life. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                preached to the whole world is quite evident. Without this general diffusion of the
                                truth, it could not become universal in the common, Christian acceptation of the word.
                                If it has been our good fortune to be made the recipients of that testimony which leads
                                on toward God ; if we are bearing the cross by which we are crucified to the world, and
                                are living the life which gives a conquering power over the elements of a selfish
                                inheritance, then, indeed, are we in possession of "good news and glad tidings," which
                                we have no right to monopolize, either for our earthly comfort or for our anticipated
                                heavenly fruition. Do we not say, as good men have said before us, that it is more
                                blessed to give than it is to receive, and does not even this well timed admonition
                                reach to the sympathy of our hearts, "Freely ye have received, freely give." The day
                                will never dawn when any class of people can be justified even before men, in making the
                                religious privilege an exclusive one. It is God's free gift to man. Personal triumphs,
                                however, may be clearly and beautifully defined in the character, which will insure the
                                commendation of men; but all this, like the treasure of selfrighteousness, must occupy a
                                very narrow space as a field for action, and at best afford an inferior hope to those
                                who would wish to grow in the boundless love of God. To the increase of God's kingdom,
                                among men, there can be no end. / But in its unfolding it will be as is his heavenly
                                kingdom, into which nothing can enter that defiles or is untrue. Jesus in his mission of
                                love, would have the will of God operate among men while on their pilgrimage through
                                this world, as it operated in the kingdom of God, that they might be the children of
                                their heavenly Father, and sons and daughters of the resurrection order which the son of
                                God came to establish. In the acceptance of this spiritual privilege, the gift of
                                manhood and womanhood is raised above the earth<pb n="87" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> ly
                                plane," and through the baptism of the Spirit they become pure and peaceful, and able to
                                overcome the world. Christ was the manifestation of God on earth, and a fulness of that
                                divine life dwelt in him, so that to be one with Christ, the disciple must be actuated
                                by the same spirit, and certainly it r.eed not demand much time to readily discriminate
                                between the spirit of divinity and the spirit of the world. While one leads into all the
                                gifts that develop the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and works with diligence to
                                make men as the children of God, the other introduces into the mind the elements of
                                discord and encourages the selfishness that rules-the world. The gospel, which is the
                                embodiment of love, is the power of God to salvation. In it may be found the saving
                                principle which not only enables the possessor to conform to a few outward rules, but so
                                fully renews the heart that a new life is brought forward and new gifts and graces form
                                the adorning of the mind. No one, for a moment, would dispute the power of remolding
                                that may be developed in those who carefully and conscientiously determine to walk in
                                this heavenly light. In it they obtain an active, living element, and a present
                                salvation. It, at once, becomes the "new way" which Jesus had so fully promised to those
                                who accepted the work of the cross, and were baptized with his baptism. Having this
                                beautiful treasure, how shall we estimate its value ? It will, undoubtedly, do us good
                                and as a shield protect us from the sins of the world. It will be to us a great comfort
                                and consolation while on the King's highway, and afford us an assurance of our
                                individual happiness in the City of the redeemed. This gift is certainly the light of
                                the world, so long anticipated, and made the subject of earnest prayers before God. A
                                treasure well worth our every effort to hold securely in honest hearts. Kings and
                                Kmper*ors who rule over worldly possessions may acquire to themselves immense wealth,
                                and selfishly hold their valuable treasures in caskets, hid in the earth. In this
                                condition they can add nothing to the happiness of the owners, or to any of their
                                friends, and can only be considered the selfish property of a selfish person. It is, as
                                was the light that was hid under a bushel, of very little value. These lessons of life
                                should act in harmony with the admonition that was given to the disciples of Christ.
                                "Freely ye have received, freely give." Is it not good to practice what we preach ?
                                Believers must admit that God has blessed them, abundantly, in "their basket and in
                                their store," and this not wholly for themselves,<pb n="88" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> but
                                that it might be increased in its value and in its blessings by diffusion among;
                            men.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/> NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/>Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</head><p TEIform="p"> North Family. Mar. 3. 1890. Another link in the chain of time has been
                                looped and welded. It is short but mighty. Its experience we never want repeated,
                                although we have learned some very valuable lessons. Sometimes we think we have learned,
                                but amid time's changing scenes we often find we do not remember till afterwards. There
                                seems to be in all of us an innate desire to pry into the future; but wisdom keeps it
                                concealed. "Who can lift the veil that screens the future from our view, Who can pierce
                                the misty shadows that obscure the good and true; Hath not the Father wisely kept the
                                fount of knowledge sealed, And only for our present need Ms boundless love revealed? Yet
                                we wander not in darkness, nor wear the shrond of gloom. God's light our way illumines,
                                and flowers immortal bloom: Faith triumphs in earth's conflict, is strong amid the
                                strife That fits the soul for pure abodes, in blessed realms of life." It seems to me
                                that we can, if we will, reason from cause to effect and look a long way ahead, but the
                                exact manifestation of the effects, few can foresee. Our new boiler and steam works are
                                in full operation and I think will prove very satisfactory. It reflects great credit on
                                the firm of Robbins, Gamwell &amp; Co., of Pittsfield, Mass., and the men who did
                                the work were the most respectful and quiet of any men ever employed on our premises.
                                This was fully appreciated by the Sisters who were passing through an ordeal of
                                affliction that cannot be written. We have made out to get our wood home and are nearly
                                ready to work it up. Are laying a new floor in our wood-house, over the old one and
                                putting tarred felt between; this we do to keep out the frost and prevent the mice from
                                getting into the cellar below, which we are going to make into an apple cellar. The
                                weather has been very favorable for our operations most of the time, but we have no ice
                                in yet, which causes some anxiety. We use one hundred tons or more, and how to keep from
                                spoiling without ice, we shall have'to learn in the future. Our beloved Mother, Eldress
                                Ann E. Taylor, we are happy to learn is very much improved. She contracted a severe cold
                                in passing from Lebanon to Watervliet Let all our aged friends learn by her experience,
                                when passing from the warm cars to ride in the open air to put on extra wraps : and we
                                that are young, whose duty it is to convey our gospel friends from place to place,
                                should not forget the extra wraps, and when possible provide a covered carriage with
                                noble, trusty steeds attached. When long journeys are to be taken, a warm soapstone put
                                in will be very acceptable. These should be heated or warmed in the oven, and not on
                                a'hot stove. By so doing they will not get hot enough to burn. Mar. 9. On account of the
                                peculiarity of the season, we have been having quite a new experience. Up to the first
                                week in March, and no ice. We began to feel somewhat alarmed; for ice is not now a mere
                                luxury, but a necessity. Well, on the 5th. and 6th. we had a splendid snow; the first to
                                make sleighing this year, and on the 7th. the mercury fell to 11 degrees below zero and
                                on the 8th. to 4 below. Such a fever at that temperature was never known before. Every
                                man and every team was called out to the ice harvest: but to harvest ice enough in two
                                days to supply our large Society could not be done. So it was suggested that we use the
                                Sabbath and gather the harvest, and we did use it in good earnest. (I write now, only of
                                the North Family.) We secured forty-five loads from our reservoir and packed it away. It
                                was real music to witness the quiet zeal and harmony that pervaded the whole company.
                                The only discordant note, was when one of the little boys slipped into the water. Now
                                the question is, was there anything in this proceeding contrary to our religious<pb n="89" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> faith? Speaking for myself, and of the faith planted
                                in my soul, there was nothing out of harmony In the first place Sabbath, (Sunday, the
                                first day of the week,) is only a man-made institution. Second, the ''Sabbath was made
                                for man, and not man for the Sabbath." Third, the Sabbath of the God of Israel, of the
                                scriptures, was established to curb the selfishness and over-reaching element in
                                unprogressed humanity, and pointed toward a perpetual Sabbath. Fourth, we have entered
                                that Sabbath, by taking up our crosses against selfishness, and consecrating all our
                                time and talents to the benefit of the household of faith. Thus, our labor is worship;
                                and such labor is far more acceptable worship than going to church to display our
                                outward adornings and cultivate our pride. There is a mighty effort being made to
                                establish a national Sunday law, which u only the thin edge of the wedge to open the
                                door for God to enter the constitution of the United States. Already in many of the
                                states Sunday laws are enacted, and are in active operation. These are the beginnings of

                                between slavery and freedom, unless the powers of good, working through the more
                                progressed part of the people, shall keep the ascendency. The Sabbath day is a blessed
                                institution and has done a great deal of good; but when a sectarian fence is erected
                                around it, and a few would-be monopolists undertake to drive everybody into their
                                sectarian pen, the blessing the Sabbath was intended to bring to the people is lost, and
                                turned into a curse. Let us make every day a Sabbath, by resting from our own selfish
                                ways and wills ; have all our time religiously devoted, and on Sunday let our devotion
                                be more interior. Use the time to cultivate our spiritual natures, but not laziness;
                                then can we sing in truth, "Blessed day of rest, the holy Sabbath." ( I want to thank

                                were not much troubled here by his unwelcome visit. We are doing our best to secure
                                enough ice to carry us through the summer. The blocks are about nine inches in

                                balmy. Recently we have had quite a rush in putting up medicine for a New York firm.

There is but little of interest to communicate at this season. The
                                severe storms of rain and wind which prevail almost continuously, prevent outdoor
                                business going on to much extent. In the field north of the barn a large washout has
                                caused some work, as it uncovered the water pipes, a depth of four feet, and was a long
                                distance badly washed. The wood houses are nearly filled with the yearly supply of wood.
                                As yet no ice has been secured, but this month may bring a cold wave with ice upon its
                                surface. There has been very little snow. Mar. 3rd. the ground is covered with snow
                                three inches deep, and the air is cold and at freezing point. We hope the fruit trees
                                may not be damaged by the sudden change. One of our orchards has been cut down, to be

                                and we must make the most of it. "It is better to wear out than to rust out," but there
                                may be such a thing as too much work, as there may be too little thought. Better not
                                till too much land. Stick to what can be done well. Concentration may be wiser than
                                expansion. It is the quality of work that tells in the end, just as brain work tells
                                better than muscle. What is the use of a brain if it is not exercised? To cultivate the
                                land may not be "the chief end of man," but it was the first work<pb n="91" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> given him to do, and that he might keep it in mind for all time, a

                                grain should be fed to fowls at night, because it is slowly digested and fills up the

                                is of more importance than size or weight. If two hens are set the same day the broods
                                can often be put into one, and save time and labor. Is not a hen's time worth something?

                                telling us that we are also marching forth toward the great beyond; that this is not our
                                abiding home. Only for a brief time are we permitted to dwell here. As we read the
                                account of the last acts of devotion bestowed in memory of the dear brother Elder Elijah
                                Myrick, we were deeply impressed with his parting benediction, "Your abiding Brother."
                                Grand and comforting is its import to his many friends on this side. Though the "clouds

                                three years ago a large colony of honey bees sought refuge in the South chimney of the

                                interference. Every sunny day they may be seen flying around and hovering over their
                                "adopted home" seemingly jealous of the slightest intrusion. Their protective agency is
                                of such powerful force, that no one can be found brave enough to encounter them. Perhaps
                                it is best not to disturb them, as they place before us tliis valuable lesson. Keep as

                                mud and tide are often against us. We have been afflicted to a considerable extent with
                                La Grippe, but it has passed on and our general health is good at present. This winter
                                we have made, in our Family, ten or twelve new gates, and during 1889 we made a very
                                neat picket fence along our street front, and quite an amount of repairing of fences has
                                been done this winter. The good Sisters have lately had the whole kitchen whitewashed,
                                the ceilings and mouldings painted in lively colors, and these processes have improved
                                the appearance of things, thereabout, wonderfully. Yesterday Elder Joseph Slingerland
                                and I measured off and marked places along our street between Center Family and
                                cross-roads south, for an avenue of over one hundred sugar trees, (Acer Saccharinum)
                                which in a few �years will be quite ornamental and refining in their influence, like the
                                sweet harmonizing influences of instrumental music. We put new wringers in our Laundry
                                during 1889, and toward the end of the year, and partly the present year, we have torn
                                down and removed the debris and cleared up around two unsightly buildings which were not
                                worth repairing. Yesterday received a boy 18 years of age into our family�his two
                                sisters have been here a number of years. Br. Thomas Reider who made our new gates

                                Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Charles I., died as a prisoner in Carlsbrook
                                Castle, Isle of Wight. When the people made Cromwell protector, after beheading King
                                Charles, she was put in prison in sight of the barred window where her father had been
                                held. The little princess only read her Bible and gazed out of the window, day after
                                day. A month after she had been brought to Carlsbrook, her attendants entered her room
                                and found her Jying dead upon her bed. Her pale face lay upon an open book. It was her

                                truly said, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon," and we must choose between the two. It is
                                a very important choice and should be made rhoughtfully and prayerfully. The decision
                                determines our iiappiness or unhappincss both for this life and the next. "Aow is the

                                After all the warnings and exhortations found in the Bible, we cannot fail to see the
                                necessity of serving the Lord now and not allow that "thief of time" Procrastination to
                                take possession of us. Our daily prayer should be, "Lord help us to bf true followers of
                                thee." We cannot be true followers of Christ without a thorough study of his life. If we
                                do, we will find that he, like us, was tempted, but yielded not, and left us a precious
                                example of forgiveness, forbearance, love, meekness, hopefulness and prayerfulness. He
                                began while young to do good and to be good and if we are true followers of him we shall
                                begin now while young and then when we are older we can look back upon a wellspent life,
                                and forward with a full assurance of at last hearing the sweet reward, "Well done, good

                                families,� a number of earnest women in the little village met one day to solve the
                                problem: How can we furnish intellectual food for ourselves and our children in this new
                                land? It was a, vital question. They had come, many of them, from New England homes; and
                                inherited tastes are not easily laid aside. They wanted books and lectures ; but books
                                were scarce, and lectures scarcer, and money, alas! scarcest of all. It was clearly a
                                case for organized effort. What one could not do, many might; and when earnest women
                                organize to help themselves and their children, who will predict failure? The immediate
                                result of that afternoon's work was the organization of a society whose avowed objects
                                were the establishment and maintenance of a circulating library,%,nd the promotion of
                                literary culture in the town. From that day to this, a period of nearly forty years, the
                                Association has been in active operation, and has. deviated not one hair's-breadth from
                                the original objects. The means have varied with the growth and literary advancement of
                                the town and the requirements of the age; the end has been the same.�From "A Successful

                                perusal of its pages. It is, indeed, a fight with Rome, over a subject that will in all
                                probability remain a disputed point so far as the Catholic and Protestant Churches are
                                concerned. This theological pugilism into which the Christian Churches enter with so
                                much zeal, becomes sometimes, the subject over which non-professors are left to wonder,
                                and to speculate on the advantages of Christianity. The worthy Dr. proves to his own
                                satisfaction that Mary, the mother of Jesus is nbt entitled to the honor which is
                                accorded to her by the Catholic Brethren. He Contends that Mariolatry and idolatry are
                                the same; that "the Virgin Mary of the papal church and that of some Anglicans worsh p
                                is a heathen goddess." The Doctor's zeal for Protestantism is equal to that of Peter's,
                                and if he carried a sword, some people would be likely to lose one of their ears. Send

"THE STORY OF TOHIiTSTOWHr."
The   Book That Everybody is Waiting'
for J&eg'ai'diiig' the Great flood
JLaNt   yi:%y.
We have received a copy of "The Story
of Johnstown," the first edition of which
is now ready and will be distributed as
rapidly as the agents can be supplied.
The volume is worthy of the subject, and
wTill be a welcome addition to thousands
of well-selected libraries all over the land.
There are many illustrations of the highest artistic excellence, 
which cannot be duplicated anywhere or by any person, besides dozens of superb portraits. The
printing is from new type, on extra paper;
the typography is faultless and the binding exquisite. In short, the book is all
that skill, money and intelligent enterprise can make it. How it will sell may
be conjectured from the success canvassers
are meeting. They report the demand
unprecidented and our readers will, most
assuredly, not be disappointed in their expectations of securing an admirable work
if they give their orders at the earliest opportunity. The public has no reason to
be deluded by cheap imitations, no matter
whence they come, x>rinted to make money
and dear at any price. The only full,
complete, trustworthy history of the
great flood and the devastated region is
the one for which people have been waiting patiently, written by J. J. McLaurin,
editor of the Tetjegram, illustrated by the
most expert artists and published by Mr.
J. M. Place, of Harrisburg. The net proceeds of the sales will be applied for the
benefit of flood sufferers. Noth with standing the magnificent liberality of the people in responding to the appeals for help,
there are many of these sufferers who will
need assistance for years. To aid such is
a duty which good men and women should
be willing to perform cheerfully. In no
way can they do so more advantageously
and profitably than by purchasing this
truly valuable book.
