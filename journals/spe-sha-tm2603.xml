THE MANIFESTO.
In 1894 Eugene Field wrote a story which he
called "The Werewolf." When it was finished
he laid it aside and a year afterward entirely
rewrote it, and during the nine years between
that time and his death in November last,
he rewrote it eight times. His revision pleased him and he decided to print it. But death
came too suddenly, and the story was found,
unpublished, among his effects. Mrs. Field,
concluding to have the story appear, gave it
to the editor of The Ladies' Home Journal which
magazine all of Mr. Field's work, outside of
his newspaper articles, was presented to the
public. The story will be printed in the next
issue of the Journal, strikingly illustrated by
Mr. Howard Pyle.
Among the unique exhibits at the Atlanta
Exposiiion is a collection which is in itself a
miniature biblical museum. The Smithsonian
Institution has prepared the exhibit, and Dr.
Cyrus Adler, of the Institution, writes in The
Sunday School Times of Dec. 7 an article
which gives one a clear idea of the varied and
instructive features of the collection. The
geography and natural history of the Bible',
its plant life, its animal life, and its archeolo.
gy, are all represented. For the many who
will not have an opportunity of visiting the
Exposition, Dr. Adler's article otters an unusual opportunity of becoming acquainted
with the life and conditions of ancient Palestine.

"Reaching the Masses." This is an address
to Preachers by H. L. Hastings, Editor of "The
Christian." Preachers will, no doubt, want to
read it and learn its valuable lesson. The
masses will be quite as interested to know
how they are to be reached and for what purpose. It is safe to say that no one will lay the
book aside until they reach the closing of the
thirtieth page. The good man asks, "Are we
certain that we really wish to reach the masses? And if so, for what purpose do we wish to
reach them? What is the good of reaching
them? Have we anything they wish? What
do we want of them after we have reached
them? Published at 47 Cornhill, Boston,

"No difference how much one knows intellectually that would enable him to believe in
a God and the angels and in a great future life
no difference how good he may be morally,
nor how much he may do toward helping humanity with love, money or means, it is of a
lower order of life than this grand possible
unfoldment of spiritual expression in man
which in its higher development enables him
to know all things and control all things to
the best interest of the world of mankind."

The Living Topics Magazine is a unique
publication which will greatly interest all
who wish to keep informed concerning the
progress of the world, and especially all owners of cyclopedias.
It records such items concerning current
events and the progress of knowledge as one
would naturally look for in a first class cyclopedia were it up to datewhicli no cyclopedia
is or possibly can be. Even the latest cyclopedias.are generally one to five years behind
date of consulation; and yet the average
reader inquires more concerning things of
the past three years than concerning things of
the preceding three centuries.
Topics are treated in strict alphabetical order, and as often as the alphabet is covered a
new volume begins and the same course is resumed. Subscriptions only 50 cents for each
ooo pages. Specimen sent free on request.

                            face of affairs in the moral, political and religious world, my unseen adviser commenced a
                            close examination of my own particular moral standing as a rational and accountable being.
                            He began to expose to my mental vision the secret motives which moved me to action ; showed
                            me their interior indications of selfishness, and seriously called in question their
                            sincerity, purity and sound integrity. My internal state and real moral condition was shown
                            up as clear as anything had previously been exhibited and my partial, selfish feelings were
                            arraigned as being in antagonism with the general good and as having a tendency to
                            perpetuate the evils of existence and to poison the streams of human life. About this time
                            in the course of my experience, I became feelingly sensible of the operation of an influence
                            acting independent of the operations of my own mind or the suggestions of my own will, often
                            strangely producing effects even contrary to my own voluntary volitions. Sometimes it opened
                            before me a flood of light and such a power of perception on a particular subject as would
                            enlighten my understanding to see with unerring certainty the truth of a proposition which I
                            had previously rejected and thus commanding my assent and final belief. At other times by an
                            intuitive perception, which at first sight was repugnant to my former mode of thought and
                            entirely foreign from any view of the subject which had ever before been presented to my
                            view. Thus my MARCH <pb n="42" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 42 THE MANIFESTO. familiarity with this unseen
                            "mentor" increased daily and my confidence in his wisdom, justice and purity continued to
                            increase with our aquaintance until I found myself almost constantly in his company and
                            listening to his counsels. Our intimacy continued until I yielded almost entire obedience to
                            his suggestions and submitted my difficulties to the censorship of his decisions and always
                            found increasing safety and protection from his friendly and faithful guardianship. About
                            this time a circumstance occurred which I will record as it shows the stronghold my unseen
                            friend had gained on my feelings, and how awrse I was to do anything which might mar the
                            amicable relation between us. In the town where I resided there lived a man who had been an
                            old schoolmate. Between us for a long time had unhappily existed a state of open,
                            undisguised enmity in our feelings so far that we did not speak to one another when we met,
                            or give the most remote recognition of a friendly disposition. We finally settled down into
                            a formal indifference, and a most thorough contempt for one another, and it seemed probable
                            to all that it would continue through all coming time. Sitting in the presence of my kind
                            instructor and having grown so familiar as to hold converse with him by plain question and
                            answer, and entirely unsuspicious of the existence of anything wrong in my own case, the
                            following soliloquy took place. Mentor.You have done well. You have been guided by my
                            counsel and have been favored in all your understanding. Your mind is tranquil and thankful
                            for my aid and protection. I have hitherto required nothing at your hand, but to enjoy life
                            and do nothing wrong in your knowledge, but the pathway of the just can only grow brighter
                            by the renunciation of self and the mortification of pride. Are you ready to malve a
                            sacrifice? Ansiver.I am ready to make any sacrifice which your goodness may demand, only
                            grant me the continuation of your kind protection. Mentor.It is required of you that you
                            humble yourself to Jthat you confess in his presence the way you have spoken of him and the
                            contempt with which you have treated him, and in all things in which you have misused and
                            ill-treated him, you must make all the reparation of which you are capable. Confess it all
                            in his presence and then ask his forgiveness for the injury you have done him.
                            Horror-stricken at the idea of humbling myself in the presence of my equal, and of all men
                            the most hateful. I attempted to reason the matter. It seems to me unfair to descend to him
                            in this abject manner as I can not help thinking of him as most to blame. He,has said and
                            done everything to injure and distress me and to make life uncomfortable. Mentor.What he has
                            done he is accountable for and he alone must bear it, but you must do right whether any
                            other one does or not. To you it has not been awarded to judge your brother. Your present
                            peace and justification can only be maintained by obedience to my request. <pb n="443" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 43 After long meditation on the subject and summoning all the
                            fortitude of which I was master, I aro^e from my chair and walked slowly to the door. I
                            intended to comply with the command of my instructor. To my utter astonishment I met the
                            very man at the door. I faltered a moment through excess of my feelings and then in a
                            subdued tone of voice invited him to come in and sit down. He did so and after a few moments
                            silence, I commenced my confession and honestly exposed the errors of my conduct in regard
                            to him, to the best of my ability and asked his forgiveness. When I began he scowled on me
                            most contemptuously, but as I proceeded and taking all the blame to myself and laying
                            nothing to his charge, his countenance changed and became profoundly solemn. His lips
                            trernbled, tears flowed from his eyes which he had no power to suppress, and he soon melted
                            into a kind and forgiving spirit. Both of us were overcome by the intensity of pur feelings
                            and rushing into each others' arms, silently buried every inharmonious sentiment, and the
                            accumulated wrath of months and years was swept away, and forgotten forever. A mutual
                            cultivation of kind feelings was entered into and all our disunion was conquered and
                            subdued. After this scene my mind became remarkably calm and my soul seemed to be bathed in
                            an ocean of love, and for many days the measure of my joy was full. My self-love was
                            extremely mortified, but my interior consciousness was strengthened and I retained the
                            friendship of my guardian spirit. I felt in truth that righteousness was on my side, and my
                            time for many weeks rolled on as a placid stream, and I was strengthened and instructed and
                            it began to seem as though the bitterness of death had passed, and the bright morning of
                            eternal life was just dawning in my spirit. I was thus solacing my soul in its infant,
                            spiritual existence, and was instructed in its visions which were continually opening to my
                            astonished view. I was now subjected to another test. Sitting in my room, and enjoying the
                            society and converse of my spiritual attendant, the following scene was opened. (To be
                            continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="As birds wake up..." TEIform="index"/>As birds wake up...

                                faithful workers and readers of The Manifesto. Although many thousand miles divide us we
                                are one in spirit. I would like to say to all the Brothers and Sisters just a word. In
                                1854, it was predicted, when the ranks were well tilled, that man}' of them would be
                                sent out into the world to spread the gospel. The word" was,-Do not think of them as
                                wanderers but as your missionary workers. Even though some make mistakes it is better to
                                be illy spoken of than not at all. When I was quite a young girl, I stepped into the
                                railroad station to wait for the train for Troy, N. Y. There was a woman there sewing
                                over and over and I remarked how rapidly she did it and she answered, "Oh yes I learned
                                to do this at the Shakers." I asked her about them and her answer was, "their belief is
                                all right, but they do not all live up to it." I could not believe what she told me so I
                                wrent to try it myself and found that the wrong was within herself and not with the
                                Shakers. I believe the time is not far distant when the fruit will be gathered home to
                                Zion from the seeds that have been scattered. I feel that there is a great and mighty
                                power working in the world for good although it seems like an age of disbelief and I
                                believe that Mother's gospel will spread over the land. I, for one, will do what little
                                I can to live according to the teaching of the gospel, precept and example. I never miss
                                an opportunity of spreading the teachings of the gospel. Your Sister,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Powers, Cornelia R." TEIform="persName"/>Cornelia R.

                            "Humanitarian" is a communication by Paul Tyner entitled "The Christ Ideal in Shakerism." He
                            says that the spirit of Jesus came to our Mother Ann Lee when she was in prison in
                            Manchester, England. No doubt it was Jesus, the Christ, for from that time she was clothed
                            with the Christ as with a garment. In that prison more than one hundred and twenty-five
                            years ago, principles were revealed unto her which the development of the Sciences have been
                            unable to overthrow. Principles that will stand to the end of time. The Revelation which she
                            received was a harvest from the generative life. Also that the mission of Jesus upon the
                            earth was to teach a higher life to those who were able to receive the doctrine. When she
                            returned to her people from the prison, she took up the work where Jesus had left it, and
                            her followers were not of the world even as the followers of Jesus, in his day, were not of
                            the world. In the Order or Community which she founded, she was second to Jesus. Jesus was
                            the first to teach the higher life, Ann Lee was the second. Both were inspired by "The
                            Christ." Our Mother being second to Jesus in the Shaker Order, was the cause of her
                            followers making use of the expression, "Christ made his Second Appearance in Ann Lee."
                            Christ had appeared in thousands before our Mother lived, and also before the days of Jesus.
                            New truths have been revealed to the disciples of Mother Ann from time to time, ever since
                            the Shaker Order has been established. Our brother, <pb n="46" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 46 THE MANIFESTO.
                            Paul Tyner is right in this, fast upon the downfall of the generative life has come the
                            enlightenment. Creeds have fallen before the Star of Revelation. The Trinity is dethroned.
                            God is our Heavenly Father and Mother. The Atonement by the death of Jesus has passed away.
                            Endless punishment is also routed, and an angry God is no more. But the sinner finds
                            punishment enough. Each must atone for his own sins, by bringing them to the light and
                            forsaking them forever. When reformation is complete the punishment is removed. Progression
                            after death is also established. A travel of the soul from one degree of grace and glory to
                            another forever and ever. A soul can recede from G-od after death, yet the farther he gets
                            away the harder he will find it to return, but return he must, sooner or later. Even the
                            Parsees bring back their first old evil one, Ahriman and his rebellious host. After being
                            purified by fire they all return and are forgiven. In the Shaker Community woman has taken
                            her place as an equal with man, by intellectual if not by physical strength. Where there is
                            an Elder, there ' i's also an Eldress, where there is a Deacon, there is a Deaconess,
                            considered equal in their powers of government. ' A Shaker must live in the light, he must
                            walk the straight path of purity, and consecrate himself and all that he has to the
                            upbuildi'ng f the cause1, should he depart from either of these principles he ceases to be'a
                            Shaker. The arts and sciences, in a future day, will flourish under the patronage of those
                            living the highest life,the Shaker life. 'Heretofore the1 work'of drawing the lines between
                            flesh and spirit'have be'en so great that there has been no time to give to any other
                            thought but that of watching'kll' the 'avenues to keep out the evils that might enter and
                            destroy the good that had been gained. In the New Heavens arid Uew Earth, all that is pure
                            and elevating in Art and the Sciences will be understood and appreciated. Sabbathday Lake,

                            gospel of the Christ, in this country or since the Shakers moved into the town of
                            Watervliet, N. Y. After reaching their new home they toiled faithfully for three years to
                            establish a soceity on a religious foundation, without having any accessions to their order.
                            To some of the company this was very discouraging, but Mother Ann never doubted the
                            sacredness of her mission. She placed her trust in God, and in the spring of 1780 the
                            Believers were visited by people from many of the adjoining towns. The word of God was
                            preached and the testimony of the cross accepted. Ignorant and simple minded people
                            circulated the story that the Shakers worshiped Ann Lee, and in accepting her doctrine they
                            must ignore the doctrine of Jesus the Christ. Ignorance, like every other thing, will have a
                            place and a chance to display itself and it does not hesitate to appear before the public to
                            be heard in its own defense. A minister on meeting one of the Shaker Elders, said to him,"I
                            understand that the Shakers worship a woman,Ann Lee." We worship neither man nor woman, said
                            the Elder, but we worship the Christ, whether it be found in man, woman or child. Jesus, as
                            history informs us, was the son of a Jew and was born in Bethlehem. His father was a
                            carpenter and Jesus worked with his father till he was thirty years of age. Ann Lee was the
                            daughter of an Englishman, and was born in Manchester, England. Jesus earned his daily bread
                            as a carpenter. Ann Lee earned her daily bread as a domestic or servant. These Saviors thru
                            moral and spiritual discipline arose to a position from which they were called as
                            instruments in the hands of God to accomplish a spiritual work for the peace and salvation
                            of mankind. Moses, Joshua, Deborah, Samuel, David and others received largely of the same
                            spirit and were engaged as leaders of the religious work of their day. Other saviors have
                            arisen with more or less light, in the civil and religious world, and have so advanced the
                            cause of freedom of thought and action that in all fully civilized countries every one can
                            worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Thru our great distance from
                            those of the first advent of the Christ, and thru the legendary stories that have been
                            written and thru the confusion of religious tongues and of creeds and of churchal dogmas
                            that <pb n="50" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 50 THE MANIFESTO. have arisen in the world and have been forced
                            upon the minds of men, we have been induced to believe many things for which there can be no
                            substantial evidence. Of this one thing, however, we are quite certain. All good comes from
                            God and the manifestations of righteousness are received of God by his witnesses and then
                            given to man. George Fox the first Quaker was a shoemaker, and yet a man inspired of God, in
                            whose heart the spirit of the Christ found a receptive place, and the doctrine of
                            non-resistance which he urged upon his people has never been excelled since that day. It was
                            thru a daily self-denial that Ann Lee received the spirit of God and become one of the
                            saviors that should stand upon the Mount Zion. "Other foundation can no man lay than that is
                            laid, which is Jesus the Christ," "who is the power of God and the wisdom of God." In the
                            power of this spirit Ann Lee became a savior of the children of men, and thru her
                            faithfulness in teaching her followers to build on the foundation,Christ, in the power and
                            wisdom of God, she aided largely' to save her people from the sins of the world. Other
                            "saviors shall come upon Mount Zion and the kingdom shall be the Lord's." A savior is one
                            that saves, and salvation may be equally, as well for the body as for the soul. The savior
                            who could heal the multitplied diseases of the civilized world of to-day, would stand in an
                            exalted position. But above this would stand the one who carries the healing balm for the
                            many diseases that afflict the moral and spiritual world. If the testimony which Ann Lee
                            delivered before the world is allowed to be obscured by the rubbish that may accumulate
                            around worldly minded Christians it will inevitably result in the loss of that soul. The
                            foundation has been laid on which to build and Jesus has said, "Follow me." To follow is
                            death to the worldly mind, but the the beautiful promise in return is the treasure of
                            eternal life. Our Lord Jesus may have gone before us to glory, nearly two thousand years,
                            and Mother Ann may have passed on for more than an hundred years, and still we need, to-day,
                            living Saviors of a living God, who can be to us what Jesus was to his disciples and what
                            Mother Ann was to her faithful children. To call on the name of Jesus because it has become
                            a popular expression of the churches, is worship without vitality and of no more use than
                            the "sounding brass or tinkling cymbal." All our protestations of care and deep anxiety for
                            the cross of Christ is no more than the blowing of so much wind, unless our lives correspond
                            in the thoughts we cultivate, in the words we speak and in the work which we perform.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.

                                out of repair, and the season is not a favorable time for making improvements, the small
                                one alone was filled, which holds sufficient for all necessities. The ice is conveyed
                                direct from reservoir to storage room, by means of a slide regulated by crank and rope.
                                Though the winter by some is thought to be rather unhealthy not having the heights and
                                depths of snow-banks to encounter, yet colds and influenzas have kept their proper

                                discontinue its publication for the present, we were depressed at the visible lowering
                                of the banner that had so long waved, upholding the testimony of the higher life. But
                                when the report came that it would continue its monthly mission, the reaction was great,
                                and we felt like shouting Glory! long live The Manifesto. The feeling here at the North
                                family is unanimous for its prosperity and continuance. Our winter to present date lias
                                been an average winter. Not as much snow as the preceeding one, but enough to make fair

TEIform="persName"/>By Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p">It was on a Suuday morning, several years since that Br. Colby and wife and Sister Grover
                            held religious services in the school-house in District No. 2. As the disciples of Jacob
                            Osgood are not very numerous, and their meetings held only semi-occasionally, there may be
                            many a wise man who has not been privileged to be with them on the Sabbath. From a little
                            book which we purchased at the close of the service, we are enabled to learn authentically
                            some things concerning the "Life and Christian Experiences" of Jacob Osgood, or as he is
                            known by his followers, the "Prophet Jacob." Jacob was born March 16, 1177 in South Hampton,
                            N. H. When twelve years of age he moved to the town of Warner with his parents. At fourteen
                            he was the subject of deep, religious impressions, but did not join the church till he had
                            reached his twenty-first year. The church members, however, could not appreciate the Prophet
                            very highly as they were unable to regulate him in his manner of preaching. In 1812 he
                            announced himself the leader of a distinct order, and from that time the sect was known as
                            the "Osgoodites." The society arose in Merrimao Co., and held almost wholly within its
                            boundaries. In the western part of the town of Canterbury is a section now known as "Zion's
                            Hill," a beautiful location, which was formerly the abode of several members or this church.
                            In speaking of his own people, Br. Osgood says,"The sect suffered much from persecution.
                            Oct. 4, 1820, they took Br. Wheeler and put him in Hopkinton jail for his faith in Christ.
                            They robbed Br. Wheeler of between six and seven thousand of brick. They drove off Br.
                            Morrill's cow which was worth twenty dollars." The "Prophet" follows up a long list of
                            persecutions which were inflicted upon his people, and then notes a reaction of peculiar
                            significance. "In 1826, God made grasshoppers and they troubled the persecutors and ate up
                            almost all before them; but they did not hurt my farm much." From his own testimony, it
                            would seem that the church people dreaded to see the Prophet enter their places of worship.
                            While speaking in one of these churches "the young preacher jumped up and commanded Br.
                            Osgood to stop;saying, 'It is my meeting.' Br. Osgood answered; 'I guess it is your meeting,
                            it isn't God's' and sat down." His biographer says that the Prophet, at one time, weighed
                            not less than 356 lbs. He died in Warner, Nov. 29, 1844, at the age of 68 years. Kesuming
                            our stoiy,We were pleasantly surprised on our arrival at the little, lonely hall of
                            education, in the western part of Canterbury, to find that so many were already in advance
                            of ourselves. Nearly every seat was occupied at this early hour, and before the services
                            closed the room was densely packed, while many were obliged to listen by the doors and
                            windows. The congregation which had met for worshipful interest, or for instruction or for
                            curiosity, included members from many of the best Christian families within a circle of some
                            eight or ten miles, to which was added a fair representation of "City boarders." Br. Colby
                            occupied a chair in front of the Teacher's desk. Throwing off his coat, he conducted the
                            services in his shirt sleeves. He had no especial form of ceremonies; but accommodated
                            himself to the necessities of the hour, by standing or sitting, while he addressed the
                            audience. He informed us that he had been in the faith some forty years. During the meeting
                            he made several exhortations in a plain, straightforward manner, but dealt unsparingly with
                            the churches, the ministers and the temperance societies. He thought the ministers were a
                            pest on the earth. They worked on Sunday and for this were paid large salaries, and yet they
                            were always begging for more. "Where do we read in the Bible" said <pb n="53" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFES TO. 53 he, "that the prophets and apostles were ever paid for preaching the gospel?"
                            He made free and extended remarks, having reference to the temperance societies, but which
                            he preferred to designate as "Cold water societies." At one time the curse of their
                            preaching was so powerful," said he, "that for fifteen years the apple crop was almost a
                            failure throughout New England." As the Prophet Jacob, however, had blessed the orchard and
                            the vine, the speaker thought that the prophet had prevailed over all his enemies, and the
                            apple trees and the grape vines were again yielding bountiful returns to the faithful
                            husbandman. Mrs. G-rover, or Aunt Sally, as she was familiarly addressed, after making a few
                            remarks against the habit of lying and stealing, kneeled, alone, in prayer. Her humble
                            petition to God was eminently practical, and no doubt proved as effectual as many of greater
                            pretentious. At the close of the prayer she sung a hymn, which had been committed to memory.
                            When Christians to Mt. Zion start, They leave the world behind; They leave their spirit and
                            their pride A better world to find. And as they travel on this way Some people, they will
                            cry Come hack! come hack! and stay with me Or you will surely die. And if you meet Apollyon
                            You must with courage stand; And never turn your back to him, But do the best you can; And
                            if you will stand fast in faith, He soon will have to run, This is the way, my brethren
                            dear, That we must overcome. Br. Colby also sung a hymn of eleven verses, giving an account
                            of a plague of locusts. As the piece closed we learned that, by the prayer of the Prophet
                            Jacob, the locusts were driven away. "In eighteen hundred thirty-two A band of locusts hove
                            in view They had great meetings all around They were quite thick in every town." Those
                            interested in the entire hymn can obtain it of Br. Colby. Before the close of the service an
                            invitation was given for any one to speak, and several persons availed themselves of the
                            opportunity. Br. Colby next exhorted all to come to Christ, to the only true church, and
                            save their souls from the sins of the world. He then made the closing prayer. Ko change of
                            position was needed. Eemaining seated, and rocking easily in his chair, he offered up a
                            sympathetic and universal invocation. As in every place of religious worship there may be
                            some chaff among the wheat, still it must have been a stolid mind that did not obtain a
                            treasure of good by this peculiar privilege. The neglect to maintain order during the
                            service was most unfortunate as it gave a license to a few unbalanced minds to trespass upon
                            the kindness of our Osgoodite friends, by laughing and talking so that they might be heard
                            across the room. Alter dismissal, a general good feeling prevailed and Br. Colby and the two
                            sisters conversed with us quite freely. East Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Let in sunshine" TEIform="index"/> LET IN SUNSHINE.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">Man is a product of naturelike the grass and the flowers.

                            send swift forth, to fill The world with good results, or ill. That which we call our secret
                            thought, Speeds to the earth's remotest spot And leaves its blessings or its woes Like
                            tracks behind it, as it goes. It is God's law. Eemember it, In your still chamber, as you
                            sit [known, With thoughts you would not dare have And yet make comrades, when alone. These
                            thoughts have life, and they will fly And leave their impress, by and by. Like some marsh
                            breeze, whose poisoned breath Breathes into homes the fumes of death. And after you have
                            quite forgot Or all outgrown some vanished thought, Back to your mind, to make its home, A
                            dove or raven it will come. Then let your secret thoughts be fair; They have a vital part
                            and share In shaping worlds, and molding fate, God's system is so intricate.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilcox, Ella Wheeler" TEIform="persName"/>Ella Wheeler Wilcox.</byline></div2><pb n="55" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In memory of sister Catherine Van Houten" TEIform="index"/>In Memory of Sister CATHERINE

                            the Lord told Jonah to go and preach to the people of Nineveh a second time he did not run
                            away, but set out on his journey at once. He entered the city crying, "Yet forty days and
                            Mneveh shall be overthrown." This duty must have been very hard for Jonah, but the power of
                            God was with him. It took him a long time to go through that large city. He felt repaid for
                            his work however, for on the first day the people began to repent. The king himself was one
                            of the first to repent and he sent a message throughout the kingdom for all people and
                            cattle to eat no food and drink no water. The king took off his royal robes and put on
                            sackcloth; instead of sitting on his throne he sat on the ground with ashes on his head and
                            all around him. This was a sign of deepest grief; but God would not have pitied them if they
                            had not repented. This lesson should teach us to repent of our wrong-doing. God will ever be
                            with us if we ask him and give us strength to do right as he did to Jonah. Hancock,
                        Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Trust" TEIform="index"/>TRUST.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><index level1="Harding, Florine" TEIform="index"/>Florine Harding.</byline><p TEIform="p">It is a trusting and reverent heart that God loves, on such his fullest blessing rests. If we
                            pray to Him how willing He is to give ear to our pleadings. He has promised if we trust Him,
                            He will remove the burden and give strength to bear it; to clear the path, or guide us
                            through it; to lighten our sorrow, and give us comfort. With all these precious promises why
                            should we not love and trust our Heavenly Father? The Savior set the example of a trusting
                            and prayerful heart, he "leaned not in his own understanding" but trusted that the Lord
                            would guide him through all temptation. It is said "God had one son without sin but no son
                            without temptation," but he resisted only by his Father's help. This teaches that of
                            ourselves we are weak, and if we wish to overcome the wrong in ourselves we will follow the
                            example our loving Savior set, to seek guidance from God and trust all things to his
                            keeping. To those that love and trust him he has given the promise, "I will never leave thee
                            nor forsake thee."

TEIform="persName"/>By Granville T. Sprout.</byline><p TEIform="p">"Delays," says a quaint writer, "are the pickpockets of time. The sun does not wait for his
                            hot water or his boots, but gets up at once. Delays are like sponges, they wipe out all our
                            good intentions." Fretfulness is a pickpocket. We spend more time in fretting over one evil
                            than it would take to cure a thousand. "If this and that had not happened," we say; "or if
                            it had only been so and so," and then we sit down and fold our hands and fret, instead of
                            rising with clenched fists to light and overcome the evil of which we complain. Care is a
                            pickpocket, an arrant thief; with a file in his hand he tugs away at the bolts and bars of
                            life and digs into the foundation of the strongest citadel. No Burroughs, with his steel and
                            aquafortis is half so busy as he, lie will break through stone walls and barred windows and
                            steal away all the sweet wine of life. Pleasures are pickpockets. They rob us of our armor
                            and leave us weak and helpless in the battle of life. We grow weak in the sun of prosperity,
                            lying down and basking in it like the Dutch captain in the story who, in a calm at sea tied
                            up his rudder, got drunk, laid down and went to sleep heedless of the rocks on to which his
                            vessel was drifting. Great talkers are pickpockets. They steal from us our minutes which are
                            the "golden sands of life." They talk on, who of all persons have the least to say, stealing
                            at once our own precious time and their own borrowed moments thus committing a double theft.
                            Working energetic men have always been impatient of such. "Madam," said the sarcastic old
                            Dr. Abernethy to a patient who was describing to him her disease with a tongue that ran like
                            a trip-hammer, "Madam how much longer time will it take you to finish your story? I was
                            thinking, I have a patient across the way, I will go and visit her, in the meantime you can
                            sit here and keep on talking, I will return in about half an hour, perhaps in that time you
                            will have finished your story." Idlers are the greatest pickpockets. One would think that
                            time was to them a gift to be treated as a child treats its toys, to be broken to pieces and
                            thrown away. Do not parley with such, but make them feel by word and example, how highly you
                            prize the wealth that they so lightly esteem. "Have you any business with me?" Cecil used to
                            say to those persons who taxed his time too heavily, "If you have not, pray excuse me,
                            because Time and I have weighty business together." ''You are welcome to my house, my
                            grounds, my horses, my pictures, my books, but I cannot say thus to you of the best portion
                            of my estatemy time." A ate great scholar and statesman used to say to his guests, after
                            having devoted to them what time he could well spare from other duties: If I have ever been
                            able to do anything worth mentioning in life it has been by setting a trap to catch the

Rev. Makk Guy Peaese tells the following story:
A member of the church once got drunk.
He sought to go back to God and get his
peace restored. He could not find the
Savior, so he sought again. His minister
called upon him. The minister said to him :
"You pray again."
They knelt down together. "O God!
Thou knowest thy servant in a moment of
unwatchfulness was overtaken by sin."
"Nonsense!" said the minister. "Tell
the Lord you got drunk."
He began again: "O Lord! Thou knowest thy servant in his weakness and frailty
was overtaken by a besetment."
"Nonsense!   Tell the Lord that you got
drunk."
At last the poor fellow said: "O God,
have mercy upon me! I got drunk."
Then very speedily that man was at
peace with God again.Selected.
