                            love and wisdom free. So prays the weary hearted world. " �Lyric of the Golden Age.
                            Emep.sok, an intuitive seer, with great descriptive force, says, "Our age is retrospective.
                            It builds the sepulchers of the fathers. The foregoing generations beheld God face to face,
                            we, through their eyes. Why should not we have poetry, and philosophy of insight, and uot of
                            tradition [only.] and a religion of revelation to us, and not [merely] the history of
                            theirs?" These utterances of poet and sage, voice a need of the age, and for every absolute
                            need of humanity, an All-wise Providence has ample supply, accessible to all who will pay
                            the price. This feeling is caused among the thoughtful and penetrating, by the present
                            shaking of the powers of the old heavens, preparatory to their removal as a scroll when it
                            is rolled together, which Jesus said would occur just before the appearing of the sign of
                            the son of man in *Christ here means anointed female leader, teacher and emancipator. <pb n="267" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>heaven. Hence it isfoue of the signs of our time. Jesus, on one
                            occasion, upbraided the Jews who could forecast the weather by the face of the sky, for not
                            discerning the signs of their time of spiritual visitation, implying that the latter are as
                            plain to be interpreted as the former. Cariyle, gifted with almost spiritual insight, says,
                            "The crime of being deaf to God's voice, of being blind to all but parchment and antiquarian
                            rubrics when the Divine hand-writing is abroad on the sky, certainly, there is no crime
                            which the supreme powers do more terribly avenge." To say that the revelations of the Holy
                            Spirit given to man in ancient days are sufficient for all after generations, is .absurd, as
                            it would be to suppose that all the suushine and showers necessary to fructify the earth for
                            a year, should be given in one month, and leave the remainder to moonshine and desolation.
                            What then shall be the estimate of the fragmentary record of that revelation which has no
                            more light in itself than a broken mirror, or a chart which can reflect only the light which
                            is brought to bear upon its interpretation. 'While the dead letter cannot compensate the
                            absence of the life-giving spirit, it is yet of exceeding value as a history of spiritual
                            experience and culture, and of the �dealings of the Holy Spirit with man in past ages, and
                            as a witness of what that spirit designed further to accomplish. That revelation cannoi be
                            final which announces another to succeed it, or which requires another to properly interpret
                            it. It is true that Jesus foretold a cessation of revelation when he said the time would
                            come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man and shall not see it.
                            That the Sun would be darkened and the stars fall from heaven, and the night would come
                            wherein no man could work the works of God. Micah uttered a similar prediction when he said,
                            "The Sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them that they
                            shall not have a vision." But when after this, mankind should see the Son of Man coming upon
                            the clouds of heaven, revelation would be restored. For none can see spiritual objects
                            without spiritual sight, and such sight of holy beings, is itself a revelation. And as
                            agreement is one criterion of truth, the new revelation must accord with the old in some
                            degree, and the old must witness for the new, that it may be known to be the one announced.
                            Those who have heard the call of the messengers whom Christ said he would send to gather his
                            elect, at the end of the age, possess a revelation which marks the beginning of a new
                            dispensation, wherein the judgment work makes a plain division between truth and error,
                            light and darkness, and the tares from the wheat are separated in faithful Believers, with
                            whom the harvest is begun. When the seven thunders uttered their voices in hearing of the
                            Revelator, he was directed to seal up the things they spoke, and not write them. Then a
                            mighty spiritual messenger raised his right hand toward heaven and testified that in the
                            days of the voice of the seventh Angel, when he shall -begin to sound, the mystery of God
                            should be finished. The voices of the seven thunders, are the voices of the seven Spirits of
                            God, mentioned Rev. iv., 5, and are represented in the original, (Ch. x., 4,) in<pb n="268" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> the feminine gender. Their utterances were not to be unsealed until the period
                            of the seventh trumpet, which announced that the kingdom of this world had become, or was
                            born of our Lord and his anointed. That is, was born of the spirit from above, that the time
                            had come to judge the dead ; hence it was the time'for their resurrection, and to give
                            reward to the servants and prophets of the Lord, and to those revering His name ; therefore
                            it is the harvest season of the fruit of their painful labor and travail; and to destroy
                            those that corrupt the earth ; that is, all the vile seed and products of the enemy of
                            souls. If it is the season of judgment, it is also the season for promulgating the aiouian
                            gospel. For the Revelator says (xiv. G. 7.) " I saw an Angel flying in mid heaven, having
                            the everlasting gospel to preach to those dAvelling on the earth, to every nation, kindred,
                            tongue, and people ; saying Fear God and give glory to Him, because the hour of His judgment
                            has come ; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
                            waters. " Hence it will appear that human probation does not end with the beginning of the
                            judgment, but in that solemn hour, the creature is instructed in a superior and abiding rule
                            of life to walk by, (which being aionian, must ultimate in complete separation from error,)
                            and starts upon a new probation, fora higher, spiritual state of existence. That is, to form
                            in himself the character exemplified in Jesus, and in the 144, 000 virgins who stand with
                            the Lamb on Mount Zion, (xiv.) which is the character and likeness of Sons and Daughters of
                            God. In the Judgment, each revives in memory and carefully scrutinizes hispast history,
                            perceives the value of the gifts and talents bestowed' by the Creator, with his present gain
                            or loss by the right or wrong use of those gifts in the past, and feels the importance to
                            his peace, well being, and happiness, of a wise improve men t of those gifts in the trial
                            season that remains. Every transgression of known obligations must be atoned for by the
                            labor or sufferings of the doer, in order to restore and preserve the equilibrium of the
                            balance of Justice, before the culprit is released from self imposed indebtedness to the
                            general economy of social life to which he belongs, and to which he owes the best use of the
                            talents given him, for mutual increase, and benefit. The offense to the spirit of goodness,
                            kindness, or mercy in others caused by wrong-doing, may be forgiven, that is, taken away, or
                            covered, (which is what the scriptural atonement means, and nothing more,) by honest
                            confession and repentance on the part of the offender. But evil consequences to ones self
                            and associates, which have become the causes of other evils, and all their resulting
                            progeny, can only be remedied by the toil or sufferings of the offender, sending forth an
                            antidote, or countervailing good. The atonement effected by Christ, and still continued in
                            his messengers, is an at-oue-ment of the will and desires of the creature, with the Divine
                            will, in those only who accept the messengei'S in their mediatorial capacity. This restores
                            the culprit to favor and enables him to cancel his debts by voluntary labor, instead of
                            suffering; in duress and banishment. He that has been faithful in his first trial is
                            prepared to advance, with the<pb n="269" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>gain of his good conduct to assist him.
                            All commence this new life with as full knowledge as can be given them of the results to
                            themselves, both of obedience and disobedience, and as sure as God is just, He is pledged to
                            give every soul a free and fair trial, and no final consequences can ensue to any soul, from
                            actions not done with knowledge of their character, and in perfect freedom of choice. All
                            have also, to assist them, the wisdom gained by experience and reflection, in their first
                            trial. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            and rum. It became necessary for the support of the family that they should leave their
                            school and form an acquaintance with that class which the boy in Oliver Optic's called
                            *'workuses. " St Paul was a lawyer. It is said that he was brought up at the feet of
                            Gamaliel and taught the perfect law of the fathers. Paul was able to preach the gospel as
                            the Spirit gave him utterance. The circumstance of his education enabled him to give us his
                            permission gospel, of t; all things to all men." Had it not been for his education, his
                            writings might have been as few as some of the other apostles, and possibly his permission
                            gospel would never have been written. Some individuals are so deficient in their creation,
                            physically, intellectually and morally that a life time would not suffice, under good
                            teaching, lo bring them to be good moral people. Two acorns, equally alike, fall from the
                            parent tree. One falls into a space where there is a good proportion of sunshine and shade.
                            It germinates and grows until it becomes the monarch of the forest. The ship builder finds
                            in it some of his most valuable timber. The other acorn falls under the wide spreading
                            branches of a hemlock. This also germinates and shoots up among the branches of the
                            overshadowing tree, which being swayed by the wind breaks the top of the young oak and
                            obliges it to remain a mere scrub,�nothing more.�Man was made a free agent. Had this not
                            been in the creative plan it would seem to us a wise thing for God to sweep from the
                            generative world all that were not perfect in their generations, and even those that did not
                            remain so. I suppose that St. Luke gave us the right solution when he said that where much
                            is given, much will be required, and where little is given, little will be required. This
                            being the fact, the man having but one talent has far less responsibility than the one
                            having ten talents, and yet it may puzzle him more and cause him more anxiety of soul to
                            place his one talent where it would be safe from harm and draw interest, than it would the
                            man with ten talents. Sometimes we think,�What have we in the talent line? Neither birth nor
                            education ever gave us a shadow of a chance in comparison with St. Paul, and even he
                            compared preaching to foolishness. If all were as we are, where would the preachers be? We
                            thank God that<pb n="270" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> all are uot like us. If we were to be the mouth-piece to
                            preach the gospel, we should be obliged to tarry at Jerusalem until we received power from
                            on high, and the probabilities are that we should make a protracted visit before that
                            propitious moment should arrive. Yet we will not be faithless as was the "ate keeper in the
                            day of Elisha the prophet. One of the apostles has said, There are diversities of gifts, and
                            something may meet our capacity in some quiet way. God has placed some in the Church as
                            Apostles, some Prophets, some Teachers, some Workers of Miracles, some gifts of Healing,
                            some Helps, governments, diversities of tongues. It is possible that we may help in some
                            way. The poor widow with two mites cast more into the treasury of the Lord, than the rich
                            man. We will give freely all that we have. Canterbury, N.

                            one of their own settlements, and on Saturday last, in acceptance of a standing invitation,
                            we made a flying visit to Shaker Village, Alfred, Me. Elder Vance awaited our arrival at the
                            depot and took us in a carriage to the village�some two miles distant. The ride was a
                            pleasant one, with its varied hill-country aspects�and we noticed that the apple orchards iu
                            this region promised a fair yield. The land owned by this community embraces about twelve
                            hundred acres, and is mostly situated on very elevated ground, called Shaker Hill. Its
                            southern ascent (our way of approach) is very steep, while its northern slope stretches
                            gradually away by the road for about half a mile�at the end of which is a saw mill, owned by
                            the community. Embosomed in a happy valley and folding its loving embrace around the western
                            base of the hill nestles Shaker Pond, a beautiful sheet of water some half a mile Avide by a
                            mile or more in length. Upon seeing it,� whether reposing with unruffled mirror face, or
                            swept now and then by mountain airs which, "�playing a wizard rout," swoop down to brush its
                            fair surface,�one is led to exclaim " How beautiful the water is ! To me 'tis wondrous fair.
                            " Upon the top of the hill is situated the village, consisting of about twentyfour
                            buildings, and composed of two families one of which contains about sixty persons and the
                            other fifteen. The smaller family, with its cluster of houses, lies a little apart from the
                            other. Fine views of the surrounding country are obtained here. Grand old hills loom up in
                            the distance, across the valley into which flows the stream which carries the mill. The
                            houses of the village generally have the appearance of old-fashioned farm houses, and most
                            of them are above eighty years old, but have been repaired and kept in good order. There
                            being a line of houses on the street and another straight row in the rear, extensive green
                            lawns stretch out between, intersected by foot-paths. "A flue place for croquet,'* we
                            remarked, but did not observe any signs of the game. " Yea," said the Elder, u a very
                            innocent game, well adapted to those of sedentary habits ; but our people gener-<pb n="271" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>ally find something more useful to employ their time." Upon our arrival at the
                            village, we alighted at a good-sized house, having something of the appearance of a neat
                            country inn. Over the door were the words, iu conspicuous letters, "Trustee's Office." Here
                            business was transacted and visitors received. We were at once shown the room in which Ave
                            were to make ourselves at home during our stay. It was large, light and airy, and contained
                            two attractive beds. They were high and narrow (compared with the family beds with which we
                            have been acquainted,) designed to be occupied by only one person at a time, but very
                            inviting indeed to the tired wayfarer of the world. That night, for the first time in our
                            life, we slept iu a Shaker bed. " And, to sleep, you should slumber In just such a bed. "
                            "Shaker neatness" is a proverbial expression, and it was well exemplified not only in this
                            apartment but all others which we visited. Our meals consisted of an excellent, wholesome
                            bill of fare, uncxceptionally, and were served with fastidious care and neatness in a little
                            dining-room, where alone and unobserved, we took our own time to satisfy the tangible, outer
                            man�the world's people not being admitted to the table with the Shakers. The largest
                            building in the village is the dwelling-house, a large three-story structure perhaps a
                            hundred feet long, broadside to the street and having two front doors, wide apart. It is
                            surmounted by an open belfry and a large bell which calls the people up in the morning and
                            to their meals. The people all eat and sleep iu this house, with a few unavoidable
                            exceptions. The prayer or conference meetings are also held here, and are not open to
                            strangers. In rear of the dwelli::g-house is quite a large building called the infirmary,
                            where the aged and sick reside, with attendants to take care of them. Another building is
                            used as a laundry, where the washing for the whole family is done with conveniences not to
                            be excelled in any city. The water is supplied, by simply turning a faucet, from a spring
                            higher up on the hill, and instead of employing the slow process of wringing by patent
                            hand-wringers, whole tubs full of clothes are put into a press similar iu shape to some
                            cider presses wehave seen, and the water very quicklyexpelled. The waste water is poured
                            into a receptacle through the floor, from which it runs away. Truly, this 13 the
                            washer-woman's paradise. One building is used for a store-house, one for a paint shop and
                            carpenter's shop, and another as a lounging place for superannuated old men�the fathers of
                            the order. We conversed with one nearly eighty-two years of age. He had lived here �' on the
                            hill, " he said, sixty-seven years, having joined when fourteen and a half years old. He
                            would not exchange his lot with any rich man he knew�the victory which he had gained over
                            self seeming to be the chief reason for rejoicing. One of the main houses on the street
                            occupied by the pistcrs as a workshop�the younger portion of the Shakeresscshaving a large
                            department by themselves, where they engage in the manufacture of useful and fancy articles,
                            while the eldresses and older women engage in a room by themselves in labors appropriate to
                            their years. Here is also a room<pb n="272" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>where the Elder officiates as a
                            tailor, and cuts the garments for th? men. There are separate barns for cows, oxen and
                            horses. They are all ample, with ground mows, and arranged with a driveway to the second
                            story, so as to allow of pitching the hay down instead of up. AYe entered one, built in
                            1833, which was probably as good a barn as Avas to be found in New England of its day. It is
                            one hundred and forty-four feet long by forty-five wide. They were all well stocked with
                            hay, it having been so good a year for the crop that some, of inferior quality, was left
                            unharvested. There are other buildings on the premises, including a blacksmith shop. On
                            Sunday forenoon we attended public service. The day was pleasant, and forty carriages
                            brought people to the Shaker meeting, some coming a dozen miles or more. Directly opposite
                            the dwelling-house is the church edifice, an old-fashioned gambrel-roofed building,
                            broadside to the street, with two doors corresponding to and facing those of the dwelling.
                            Flagstones are laid from the sisters' end of the house across the street. "When the hour for
                            commencing services arrived, the doors of the dwelling opened and the Shakers and
                            Shakeresses passed out simultaneously, two by two, with slow and solemn step, making two
                            parallel lines across the street to the meeting-house. The Shakers were uncovered, and with
                            long hair on the back of the head, but cropped short in front, made a unique appearance. The
                            dresses of the Shakeresses were almost white ; the skirts were not superfluously ample, were
                            neatly plaited at the waist, and stopped short of the around. Some of them had white
                            handkerchiefs, unshaken from the ironing folds, pinned squarely at the waist. All (except
                            the little children) wore white capes, and white gauze caps neatly plaited around the back
                            of the head. They formed in rows, in the church, four and five abreast, the Bible was read
                            by the Elder, when they marched and countermarched, singing songs and waving their hands,
                            palms up, and as they thus k' praised God in the dance, " singing, �' Let us clasp the hands
                            of the angels. " we imagined that if they had such "unseen company " and we were
                            clairvoyantly endowed, it would be difficult to tell which were the angels and which the
                            Shakeresses. The following is one of their songs :� " The voice of God is calling us : Come
                            away, away from worldly strife; All ye who name the name of Christ. Come up and live a
                            higher life. O live to God and die to sin, That ye with Christ may enter in, For only the
                            faithful few shall win And wear a robe of righteousness. No prayer was offered. It is very
                            seldom, we were told, even in their private meetings, that a Shaker prays audibly. They do
                            not believe in making long prayers to be heard of men, but follow the direction of Jesus,
                            '"when thou prayest, enter into thy closet. " After singing a few songs, the Elder. J. B.
                            Vance�preached a very able discourse on the confession of sins, taking for his text the
                            first epistle of John, first chapter, ninth verse:�" If we confess our sins, he is faithful
                            and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The speaker
                            said it was well understood by the Jews as to whom the confession of sins was to be made,
                            and what it consisted of. Instead of goals' awav in secret and<pb n="273" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>talking
                            them over to Him who knew all about them, or getting up in public meeting and confessing
                            that they were sinners in a general way, the demand was that the very act committed should
                            be confessed ("in that thing") to a man of God appointed to hear, with a repentance which
                            led to the forsaking of their sinful deeds and making reparation, as far as possible, to
                            those who had been injured. Other passages, both from the Old and New Testaments, were
                            quoted in support of this view. It might be objected, to observe this rite of confession was
                            too much like the Catholic Church. That the Catholic Church was the immediate successor �f
                            the early, true church could not be doubted; but it had suffered many abuses to creep into
                            it. The mistake of Luther was in abandoning all its rites instead of correcting their
                            abuses. The confession of sins, rightly conducted, was regarded by the speaker as perhaps
                            the most important means of assuring an upright life. At the conclusion of the sermon, the
                            settees were put aside, some of the Shakers gathered in a group in the center and sung,
                            while others marched around them, singing and waving their hands. At the close of the
                            services the audience was requested to remain seated, until the Shakers had passed out, and
                            thus ended the only public service of the day. It was the calm still morning of Monday last
                            that we rode down Shaker Hill to take the early train for Lynn. Inanimate nature wore its
                            best smile, and upon the placid bosom of Shaker Pond floated a loon in conscious safety. Our
                            good impressions of this people were well sustained, in seeing them at their home, and we
                            came away feeling that we had been greatly benefited, spiritually, by this short visit among
                            them.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="True greatness" TEIform="index"/> TRUE GREATNESS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anderson, Martha J."

                                Gladstone, Parnell, and yourself, as British Statesmen. Gladstone represents the British
                                Government and of course its morality. Its actions in Egypt were but to secure to
                                Egyptian landholders their dividends, (which, as you are well aware, must be paid by the
                                laborers of Egypt) and to keep open a water-way to India through which the wealth
                                annually created by labor may flow into the Thames. The morality of said actions, have
                                no altitude whatever. Parnell represents the worst cared for people within the limits of
                                modern civilization. His position has a certain potential altitude. What does he profess
                                to do with it? To increase the number of land-holders, and to give them the power to
                                control their own affairs. Under this altitude, millions of the Irish people will be as
                                in oth^r parts of the British Empire, denied access to the land; and of course be
                                servants�slaves�commodities, to those who have land. To be denied access to land, is
                                perpetual eviction. And a recognition of the right of the Duke of Argylle to demand that
                                a Gun-boat be sent to Skye to subdue the poor Crofters. Hence the moral altitude of
                                Parnell, is as that of Gladstone, nowhere! Your position is best denned by those who
                                traduce you. " That you would confiscate, and inaugurate communism. " Your traducers are
                                blind to the fact, that an evicted man, denied access to the elements of subsistence, is
                                also evicted from under all moral responsibilities. Your position is neither more nor
                                less, than to bring every person within the pale of moral responsibility. Hold that
                                position. "The gates of Hell shall not prevail against you. Moses the great Law-giver
                                and Emancipator�the type of Jesus Christ; gave to every family a portion of land. He
                                founded his Moral Code, upon a just apportionment of the land of Judea. Hence every Jew
                                was held under moral responsibilities. Point your traducers to Moses the servant of God.
                                Did he not institute the " Acceptable year of the Lord "�the Jubilee�" A Land
                                Restoration Law? " � Did he not inaugurate communism? Declaring that every seventh year,
                                the whole land of Judea should be one common table. That the fruit of the olive-yards,
                                vineyards, and fields, should be common property. That the rich, the poor, and the
                                shiftless should all fare alike ! What a glorious year for Tramps, the whole land of
                                Judea is alive with them. Sound an alarm in "Scotland yard!" Call out the "Horse guards.
                                " Let the Duke's Gun-boat take a position ! For " The reign of Law "�divine law, is
                                inaugurated. The castle of Imeraray shall lose its isolation, and a tidal wave from the
                                Garelough shall wash away the sinecures of the House of the Lome. If Moses was but a
                                shadow of Christ, what will ultimate communism be? Through you, allow me to say a few
                                words to Socialists, Internationalists, and to Dynamiters. You complain, that "Society "
                                is organized against you. That you produce, and that others consume the products of your
                                industry. That you sustain Governments instituted to oppress you, and forms of religion
                                for which you have no reverence. Pay interest on enormous debts, which you did not
                                contract. And to support Military establishments designed to oppress you. And to support
                                swarms of idlers, whose chief employment is to devour your substance, and to corrupt
                                public morals. That you are the wealth producers ; yet you have no possessions. You also
                                state, that the enormously productive energies of mechanical and chemical appliances of
                                our times are not the products of a class, and that they belong of right to all. And
                                being destitute of land, your necessities compel you to set and keep these mighty forces
                                in motion till you glut the markets of the world. And that you suffer destitution from
                                the very abundance you have created. Again you complain, that you are denied access to
                                social elevating enjoyments. And that you are degraded personally by enduring unhygienic
                                conditions, alike destructive of morals and of life. On the presentation of these awful
                                verities ; why should not " Society" be seized with remorse, and rush to embrace you;
                                relieve youTHE MANIFESTO.<pb n="275" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> 275 from such terrible pressure, assuage
                                your anguish, and soothe your broken hearts. Invite you to their mansions, to the
                                luxuries of their conservatories, and to the sweet air of their ample parks. And that
                                all who call themselves "Society" would unite to bless you for your long endurance of
                                such stupendous wrongs. And wonder, that ir your desperation you had not torn "Society"
                                into pieces, and strewed your pathways with destruction. And in profound gratitude for
                                all they had enjoyed of the products of labor, crown you as the industrial moral heroes
                                of the ages. " Society" also has its complaints. Complains that you are ready to do
                                violence. Well we know what Christ said "Whatever measure ye mete unto men, will be
                                measured unto you again. " Suppose Mosaic justice is applied in this case. "A blow for a
                                blow '' would clearly justify applying forms of force, ,,to remove burdens
                                unjustly^imposed. " Society" has no cause of complaint. If she is dealt with, as she has
                                dealt with you. But stop here, make a halt; consider a few points. Are not the Great
                                Land-holders who rule in their own favor, the fruit of long established usages? would
                                you have done any better, had you been trained as they were? Take you as a whole, where
                                is the man among you who would object to accepting a Dukedom? And where is the average
                                woman who would not like to be a Duchess? Is it not an all pervading, an ever present
                                fact, that man's lower self-hood, with its animal loves and impulses, has created modern
                                civilization just as it is. Suppose you had been so unfortunate as to be a Duke, would
                                you like to have a little bit of dynamite applied to you? There is a better way. Suppose
                                you try force, would not that invite repression, and cause the inevitable coming change
                                to be an explosion? In such a case, the millions whom you represent would most largely
                                be the sufferers. To deplete the population of Europe by ten or twenty millions would be
                                to the "Law and order men," a godsend. For war, famine, pestilence, are factors in the
                                creed of their economy. Do not give these men any such an opportunity. Those among
                                yourselves who are the most violent, were they of the favored few, would be the most
                                reckless in applying force to you. " There is a better way. " Is it wisdom to meet an
                                army in front, when you can take it in rear? " The better way " to subdue armies is,
                                never come into contract with them "The iron Duke " fresh from Waterloo, and flushed
                                with victory, tried to rule with an iron hand. Public sentiment spoke six words, ("stop
                                the Duke, go for gold ") and brought the Duke to his knees. Public sentiment can make,
                                or dismiss armies. " The better way " is, speak peace to all and maintain it among
                                yourselves ; for the day of your deliverance is nigh. The Law has gone, and is going
                                forth from the Throne of the Eternal, that all men are equally his children, and equally
                                entitled to have access to all the elements of subsistence. Declare that the acceptable
                                year of the Lord is now, the Jubilee, the Land Restoration year. Declare through all
                                nations, that Land being the source of human subsistence, of social and judicial
                                equality; and a regulator of the exchange and values of commercial equivalents ; that
                                every person should have access to land at all times. Declare, that the possession of
                                land operates as a brake upon the fly wheel of destructive competition. And as a
                                nullifier of the causes of Panics, Strikes, Want, and Crime. Declare also, that Gold was
                                not made to grow, nor Mortgages to yield a crop. To have them do so, is to destroy the
                                conditions of human equality. Kossuth remarked "the Christian nation is not yet" under
                                Christian ideas and sentiments, land can neither be bought nor sold. To do so, is to
                                make those who cannot buy, a commodity, a servant, a slave. The veriest opposite " of
                                loving the neighbor as we do self." The Ballot and the Vote, are to the " landless " but
                                " glittering generalities. " Get land and work it, and the comforts of life will soon be
                                yours. The really useful goods of all nations, are reproduced every few years. And ever
                                remember that destructive modes of acquiring property are demoralizing. The Better way
                                has been shown. Shall I show you the Best�the Higher way. When you get to the land, and
                                have enjoyed a fullness of the good things treasured up in the<pb n="276" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>
                                rich grains, and refreshing fruits, you may be better prepared to listen. However, I
                                will venture now to'do so. It has been stated, that modern civilization is the product
                                of man's lower self-hood. The organic Law of that civilization is, " Me and Mine. " Its
                                mode of operation is to get all you can at the expense of others�make servants�slaves�
                                commodities of men, women and children. If they resist, coerce them with the resources
                                of civilization "the musket, the bludgeon, the crowbar, and said Gun-boat. There is not
                                a single nation on earth's wide circumference, which represents the "Higher Life" in
                                man. "The Christian nation is not yet." There is indeed a phenomenal people " called
                                Shakers, " whose mode of procedure is love to the neighbor. They hold to the Mother, and
                                Fatherhood of God. They say, that goodness is religion, And that to be beneficent is to
                                be divine. And that any other kind of divinity is a spurious article. They also state,

                                questions, which you may depend upon are not prompted by idle curiosity. First, What is
                                the whole religious creed and doctrine of the Shakers? Second, What are their various
                                rules and regulations and the benefit to be derived from the same? Third, do the Shakers
                                believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God, and that Jesus Christ is the Son of
                                God and our only Savior? Fourth, do Shakers believe that miracles can be wrought in

                                morals, by their general diffusion, to be the most effectual instrument in the warfare
                                with sin and the lusts of this life? Sixth, do Shakers believe ignorance to be the root

                                series of well put questions, which I will answer by numbers. No. 1. It would take all
                                the books we have published to give you the "whole religious creed and doctrine of the
                                Shakers. " I have not time to write it out. No. 2. Our rules, &amp;c, we can send to
                                you in print. The benefit the Order promises, to an obedient member, is salvation from
                                the comiptions that are in the world through the lusts of the flesh and the mind. No. 3.
                                Do not believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God, until the learned, who wrote
                                and printed it, get through revising it. And then, we, also, may desire to revise it in
                                the light of the revelation of Christ's second appearing, in which we are living. In
                                this light we learn what the apostles did not know, to wit., that Jesus is not the
                                Christ, nor yet the " Son of God, " only as his disciples became the Christs and Sons of
                                God, by being baptized with the Christ Spirit, and living as he lived�a celibate,
                                non-fighting, non-private property holding man and woman, and working out their own
                                salvation just as he did. A person can nev-<pb n="277" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> er be saved from any
                                evil except by ceasing to do that evil, and learning to do well�-daily self-denials. No.
                                4. These signs shall follow them that believe in me. They shall lay hands on the sick,
                                and they shall recover. They shall restore the blind, speak with many tongues, cast out
                                devils, &amp;c. Are these miracles? Is not the growth of grass a miracle? The ascent
                                of sap to the top of a tree 300 feet high is a stupendous miracle, if a miracle be
                                something for which we can not give a scientific reason, No. 5. "In Christ are hidden
                                all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. " If so science and religion are one and the
                                same. There is no science, except what is falsely so called, without religion And there
                                can be no true religion that is unscientific. Pure and undefiled religion is to gather
                                the widow and fatherless, the sin-sick souls, into the kingdom of Heaven that has come
                                upon earth, wherein they have daily bread, are separated and kept, unspotted by sin,
                                from the world that buy and sell and then fight about it continually. The . lusts of the
                                flesh and of property being the source whence come wars and fightings, rich and poor,
                                male and female, capital and labor. No. C. We believe lust to be "the root of all moral
                                depravity," ignorance included. Light�knowledge�is sown for the righteous who deny
                                themselves of all ungodliness and all worldly lusts, living Godly and soberly in this
                                present evil world. No. 7. All Shaker societies have the same fundamental principles.
                                They may stand in different degrees of knowledge respecting the increase of the work of
                                God. One degree of seven is about closing, and another degree is about opening. This
                                makes diversity, as in a school of different classes, without contrariety. No. 8. We
                                cannot take minors without consent of parents or guardian, and we pay no wages, even to
                                adults, much less minors. At the first pentecost, when J-5000 were baptized with the
                                Christ Spirit, they loved one another so well that they converted their private property
                                into community, having all things common, no one calling anything mine but ours. This is
                                the Order of the second Pentecostal Church, now established under the second appearing
                                of the Christ Spirit, the Kingdom of Heaven so long prayed for by all professing
                                Christians. F. W. Evans. West Pittsfield, Mass. Sep. I88f). Beloved Sister Makcia E.
                                Hastings ;�After many months delay we are forming a reply to your most beautiful letter
                                to Sister Deborah.�How passing strange that- Father Time of such vast age, can so
                                adroitly and nimbly snatch away the precious, God given moments of this earth life. It
                                seems a brief space of time since the reception of that welcome missive and lo ! the
                                golden autumnal season is with us in its display of gorgeous apparel, tempting fruitage
                                and almost endless variety of earth yielding products. This hallowed day (Sabbath) is
                                one of unsurpassing loveliness and beauty, with a glorious sky and a balmy atmosphere.
                                All nature seems in harmonious accord with our own uplifted thoughts. It is as though
                                the mystic veil was lifted and heaven's rich glory had descended, flooding the earth
                                with its marvelous light and matchless beauty. In our transport of wonder and admiration
                                we had nearly forgotten the object for which we had taken the pen. Sister Deborah
                                received your word, and will transcribe a few remarks of her own pencilling :� "Dear
                                Sister Marcia, I think you are as the morning when the sun riseth : even a morning
                                without clouds. As the tender grass springing out of the earth by the clear shining
                                after the rain. Give of my best love to Sister M. whose memory I fondly cherish and
                                whose love is fragrant with Christian grace and heavenly meekness. Finally to all the
                                gospel friends. Your Sister. Deborah." Sister Deborah is 79 yrs. of age. The writer of
                                this would also be remembered to beloved gospel friends. Affectionately, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Sweet, Julia L." TEIform="persName"/>Julia L.

                                    preachers had often called Satan's stronghold, underwent a moral awakening such as
                                    this world had never beheld, says John B. McMaster, in his "History of the People of
                                    the United States, " writing of a Kentucky " Revival. " Two young men began the
                                    great work in the Summer of 1779. They were brothers, and preachers, and on their
                                    way across the pine barrens to Ohio, but turned aside to be present at a Sacramental
                                    solemnity on Red river. The people were accustomed to gather at such times on a
                                    Friday, and by praying, singing, and hearing sermons, to prepare themselves for the
                                    reception of the Sacrament on Sunday. At the Red river meeting the brothers were
                                    asked to preach, and one of them did so with astonishing fervor. As he spoke, the
                                    people were deeply moved, tears ran down their faces, and one, a woman, far in the
                                    rear of the house, broke through order and began to shout. For two hours after the
                                    regular preachers had gone the crowd lingered,<pb n="279" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>and were loath
                                    to depart. While they tarried, one of the brothers was irresistibly impelled to
                                    speak. He rose and told them that he felt called to preach ; that he could not be
                                    silent. The words which fell from his lips roused the people before him "to a
                                    pungent sense of sin. "�Again and again the woman shouted and would not be silent.
                                    He started to go to her. The crowd begged him to turn back. Something within him
                                    urged him on, and he went through the house, shouting and exhorting and praising
                                    God. In a moment the floor, to use his own words, " was covered with the slain. "
                                    Their cries for mercy were terrible to hear. Some found forgiveness, but many went
                                    away "spiritually wounded," and suffering unutterable agony of soul. Nothing could
                                    allay the excitement. Every settlement along the Green river and Cumberland was
                                    filled with religious fervor. Men filled their wagons with beds and provisions, and
                                    traveled fifty miles to camp upon the ground and hear him preach. This idea was new
                                    ; hundreds adopted it, and camp meetings began. There was no longer any excuse to
                                    stay away from preaching. Neither distance, nor lack of houses, nor the scarcity of
                                    food, nor daily occupations prevailed. Led by curiosity, by excitement, by religious
                                    zeal, families of every Protestant denomination, Baptists, Methodists,
                                    Presbyterians, Episcopalians, hurried to the camp ground. Crops were left half
                                    gathered, cabins were deserted, and in large settlements there did not remain one
                                    soul. The first regular camp meeting was held at Gaspar river church, in July, 1800
                                    ; but the rage spread, and a dozen encampments followed in quick succession. Camp
                                    meeting was always in the forest, near some little church, which served as the
                                    preachers' lodge. At one endof a clearing was a rude stage, and before it the stumps
                                    and trunks of hewn trees, on which the listeners sat. About the clearing were the
                                    tents and wagous, ranged in rows like streets. The praying and preaching and
                                    exhorting, would sometimes last for seven days, and be prolonged every day, until
                                    darkness had begun to give way to light. Nor were the ministers the only exhorters.
                                    Men and women, nay, even children, took part. At Cane Ridge, a little girl of seven
                                    sat upon the shoulder of a man and preached to the multitude until she sank
                                    completely exhausted on her bearer's head. At Indian Creek, a lad of twelve mounted
                                    a stump, and exhorted until he grew weak, whereupon two men upheld him, and he
                                    continued until speech Avas impossible. A score of sinners fell prostrate before
                                    him. At no time was the '' falling exercise" so prevalent as at night. Nothing was
                                    then wanting that could strike terror into minds weak, timid, and harassed. The red
                                    glare of the camp fires, reflected from hundreds of tents and wagons ; the dense
                                    blackness of the surrounding forest, made still more terrible by the groans and
                                    screams of the " spiritually wounded " who had fled to it for comfort; the entreaty
                                    of the preachers ; the sobs and shrieks of the downcast, still walked through the
                                    valley of the shadow of death ; the shouts and songs from the happy ones who had
                                    crossed the delectable mountains, had gone on through the fogs of the enchanted
                                    ground, and entered the land of Buelah, were too much for those over whose minds and
                                    bodies lively imaginations held sway.<pb n="280" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/>The heart swelled, the
                                    nerves gave way, the hands and feet grew cold, and motionless and speechless they
                                    fell headlong to the ground. In a moment crowds gathered about them to pray and
                                    shout. Some lay still as death. Some passed through frightful twitchings of face and
                                    limbs. At Cabin Creek so many fell that, lest the multitude should tread on them,
                                    they were carried to the meeting house, and laid in rows on the floor. At Cane Kidge
                                    the number was three thousand. The recollections of that famous meeting are still
                                    preserved in Kentucky, where not many years since, old men could be found whose
                                    mothers had carried them to the camp ground when infants, and had leU them at the
                                    roots of trees and behind logs, while the preaching and exhoi'ting continued. Cane
                                    Ridge meeting house stood on a well shaded, well watered spot, seven miles from the
                                    town of Paris. There a great space had been cleared, a preacher's stand put up, and
                                    a huge tent stretched to shelter the crowd from the sun and rain. But it did not
                                    cover the twentieth part of the people who came. Every road that led to the ground
                                    is described to have presented for several days an almost unbroken line of wagons,
                                    horses and men. One who saw the meeting when it had just begun, wrote home to
                                    Philadelphia that the wagons covered an area as large as that between Market street,
                                    and Chestnut, Second, and Third. Another, who counted them, declared that they
                                    numbered 1145. Seven hundred and fifty lead tokens, stamped with the letters A or B,
                                    were given by the Baptists to the communicants, and there were still upwards of four
                                    hundred who received none. Old soldiers who were present, and claimed to know
                                    something of the art of estimating the number of the great masses of men, put down
                                    those encamped at the Cane Ridge meeting, at twenty thousand souls. The excitement
                                    surpassed anything before known. Men who came to scoff remained to preach. All day
                                    and all night the crowd swarmed to and from preacher to preacher, singing, shouting,
                                    laughing, now rushing off to listen to some new exhorter who had climbed upon a
                                    stump, now gathering around some unfortunate who, in their peculiar language, was "
                                    spiritually slain." Soon men and women fell in such numbers that it became
                                    impossible for the multitude to move about without trampling them, and they were
                                    hurried to the meeting house. At no time was the floor less than half covered. Some
                                    lay quiet, unable to move or speak. Some of them talked, but could not move. Some
                                    beat the floor with their heels. Some shrieking in agony, bounded about, it is said,
                                    like a live fish out of water. Others rushed wildly over the stumps and benches, and
                                    then plunged, shouting "Lost! lost!" into the forest.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Catholic" TEIform="index"/>The Catholic.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Prayer" TEIform="index"/> PRAYER.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilson, Hannah E."

                            spirit of consecration which actuated the founders of these societies, with that which is
                            manifested by the present inmates. They, as �pioneers endured persecution for their faith's
                            sake ; yet were happy in the consciousness of serving God. With what steady, unwavering zeal
                            did they pursue their course of self-abnegation and devotion to a cause dearer, to them,
                            than life. Are we true sous and daughters of such a parentage ? Can we claim an heirship
                            with the truly consecrated. Some in our ranks are giving daily �evidence of self-sacrifice
                            by their willingness to spend and be spent for the interests of Ziou, and the salvation of
                            souls ; but is not that number comparatively few ? If we believe that we have found the
                            pearl of great price ; the revelation of the gospel of Christ through Mother Ann, why should
                            not every one, even those of the least experience, be anxious and earnest to help sustain
                            the cause? Is it to our credit that the religious element wanes among us? We know that such
                            is the case in the world at large, and that such conditions are liable to effect us to a
                            greater or less extent, yet with greater religious fervor we may be able to combat and
                            conquer the spirit of the world. We can have but little confidence in the spirit which says,
                            "It is God's work, and in his own time and way lie will sustain it. We believe that God's
                            work is a soulsaving work and whether we devote ourselves or whether we forbear, He will
                            assuredly raise up agencies through whom to accomplish the same, leaving us in a condition
                            similar to that of the Jews who, after waiting so many years for the coming of the Messiah
                            neither knew nor accepted him when lie appeared, and as a consequence, are still waiting his
                            advent to return them to their "place and nation. " Our fathers set us an example of
                            activity in the work of God, they established homes, and went from place to place preaching
                            the testimony of selfdenial and the cross. They braved all opposition with an ardor and zeal
                            which proved their sincerity and devotion. We have the benefit of their consecrated interest
                            in the things spiritual and temporal, and unless our consecrations are equal, according to
                            the day in which we live, can we reasonably expect to be counted as rightful heirs?

One by one the days
                            and weeks and months have gradually passed away from us in the completion of another of
                            those wonder working cycles. Prayers have been made, hymns have been sung and God'j
                            word-spoken, to the end that righteousness may be impressed upon the mind, and that our
                            lives may be more fully in accord with the life of our Savior, Jesus Christ. Testimonies of
                            living witnesses have befii carried into the world, and righteousness has found many
                            interested advocates that have an established belief in the efficacy of practicing that
                            which they preach. They have learned that the beauty of holiness, and spiritual loveliness
                            are best attained by the combination of a living faith and of good Christian works, aud that
                            through these the love of God is made manifest by faithfulness to duty and an honest life
                            before all men. The world is filled with lessons of wisdom from which we may reap abundant
                            satisfaction. In these, if we lose sight of ourselves, through prayer and a faithful
                            continuance iu well doing, we may be able to accomplish the work that is now placed before
                            us. Every Christian worker travels through the experience of indifference, neglect and
                            sometimes total want of appreciation. If this, however, was the whole of life, in a good
                            cause, the majority of workers would faint by the way or become disheartened aud return to
                            their former estate. But happily for the world this is not the case. The light which came
                            into the world and which lighteth every man, .grows brighter aud brighter and the harvesting
                            of good fruits for God is mere extensive than at any former a^c. Nothing could be more to
                                the<pb n="283" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>point than the lesson of wisdom in the parable of the sower in
                            Matt. xiii. Some seeds fell by the way-side and the fowls devoured them. Some fell on stony
                            places and they were scorched by the heat of the sun, while some fell among the thorns, and
                            the thorns choked them. Had the parable ended at this discouraging point, the workers in
                            righteousness might with propriety have given up all hope, but there were "great and
                            exceeding precious promises " to be looked for. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he
                            reap. " God's word had been sown in the world, and neither the labor nor the seed could all
                            be lost. Some of the seed had fallen on good ground and had yielded a harvest of thirty or
                            sixty or a hundred fold. There were some who could hear and Understand the word, and were
                            also able to treasure it in an honest heart, and this was the blessing that followed the
                            earnest labors of the servants of God. Our mission to be effectual must be in harmony with
                            the life of the Divine Teacher, and the ruling element that seemed to direct his words and
                            deeds, was a love to do the will of his Heavenly Father. It was, indeed, a beautiful
                            attainment, and an element that accomplished so much for good in the minds of men. This same
                            precious gift is needed, equally, as much at the present time for the protection and
                            salvation of those who may choose to walk in newness of life. What has been gained during
                            the passing year and held sacred, may go far toward the suppressing of evil, and in the
                            encouragement of a life for God. Certainly no effort in the cause of righteousness can ever
                            fade away and no deed that is stamped with mercy and peace can ever be lost. To-day we
                            recount the blessings of a past age, and share with those who walked with God, the joy and
                            satisfaction of a Avell ordered life. Whether in Eden or on the mount of Sinai, the same
                            spirit is productive of the same good results. Prophets, lawgivers and Apostles, in their
                            zeal for the restoration of Zion, have all advocated a strict self-denial, and a
                            consecration of life that were eminently calculated to harvest them from the spirit of the
                            world and make them the sons and daughters of God. The fact which Jesus so pleasantly
                            brought forward to prove to his disciples that like begets like, reaches back into the whole
                            history of man. " Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?" or by a better
                            illustration, " A good man out of the good treasures of the heart brinjjeth forth good
                            tilings." It is through the increase of this work among men that we may yet be the witnesses
                            of the millennial age, "when men shall not hurt nor destroy in all God's holy mountain, for
                            the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.

                                        to one in the sweating stage. With all due regard for the thermometer, good
                                        sense and enlightened and careful observation should regulate these essential
                                        conditions. Every one admits the necessity of keeping the air of a sick-room as
                                        pure as possible, yet how seldom, except in cases of contagion, do we see
                                        disinfectants about a sick-bed. Chloride of lime and carbolic acid are cheap and
                                        effective and something of the kind should always be used wherever fresh air
                                        cannot be freely admitted. There should always be a towel-rack in the 100m, or
                                        just outside, where moistened cloths can be quickly dried. Cloths wet in pure
                                        water even give out an unpleasant odor if left lying in a heap to mold or dry as
                                        they best can. Keep one stand or table for food or drinks and another for
                                        medicines. A clean newspaper often renewed makes a better eovering for such
                                        tables than a cloth. Have a basin of water always at hand, that whenever a spoon
                                        or wineglass is used, it can be rinsed immediately and ready for use. Guard
                                        against irritating noise, creaking doors, chairs or shoes, also against too much
                                        light and cross lights. Holes in window-shades and gaps in shutters are often
                                        first-class nuisanees. Many an invalid is tortured by a single point of piercing
                                        light, which seems, like a faithful eye, to pursue him everywhere, and to which
                                        in spite of himself he is ever returning. A little daily change in the
                                        arrangement of furniture, a little planning for such pleasant surprises as an
                                        invalid can bear, in the way �f food, company and amusement, will often be more
                                        effectual in hastening the convalescence of a patient than all the tonics that
                                        have been used in the building up of infirm humanity since the days of
                                        Esculapius. A soft tread, a mild, persuasive word, a magnetic hand, a tact�or

                                        invaluable adjuncts of good nursing. Clatter of firearms, rattle of dishes and

                                        plants are usually interdicted in a sick room, but cut flowers are great

                                        of God to preach the way of salvation to lost sinners, must depend upon a filthy

To forgive sin is the exclusive
                            prerogative of Jehovah, of whose law sin is the transgression, and the gospel makes known,
                            not only that there is forgiveness with God, but also how he can forgive sin. and still
                            maintain unsullied, the infinite purity and holiness, and perfection of his nature,
                            government, and law, and even clothe them all with new glory. That all mankind have sinned
                            and that none can be justified, accepted, and saved without forgiveness, none who believe
                            the Scriptures of truth, will pretend to deny ; and it is a truth equally undeniable, that
                            without confession of sin, there can be no forgiveness. We read in the Scriptures, " He that
                            covereth his sins shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
                            mercy. " Prov. xxviii., I'd. Let not the sinner say, he hath no* sinned. It is with the
                            mouth that confession is made unto salvation, and confessing our sins to God, by Christ the
                            mediator, m his saints, is the only door of hope for salvation. We read also "that they of
                            Jerusalem and all Judea and the region round about Jordan, were baptized of John in the
                            river Jordan confessing their sins, " which was the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
                            The consciousness of guilt is universal, hence, in all parts of the world among Christian
                            and Pagan, savage and civilized, are found institutions or customs which have a direct
                            reference, more or less clearly defined, to expiation and forgiveness, but the Christian
                            scheme alone makes known a way of mercy, through Christ and offers forgiveue.-s full, free,
                            and everlasting, to all who will believe and obey the gospel. The duty also of mutual
                                forgiveness.,<pb n="286" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> is urged upon man with the most solemn sanctions.
                            This lesson is profitable and to the point, " Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me,
                            and I forgive him? Till seven times?" Jesus saith unto him, " I say not unto thee until
                            seven times ; but, until seventy times seven. " Therefore in view of this great salvation,
                            let us forgive our erring brother or sister, as we hope to be forgiven of God. Let us labor
                            continually to keep the unity of the spirit, in the bond of peace, which signifies a union
                            of judgment, affection, and feeling, among those who constitute the one body of Christ. It
                            is the gift of God, and in the primitive church, was remarkably enjoyed, and to-day is to be
                            desired and sought after as among the chief of Christian graces.

                                    these tilings. The religion, which is to save the world, will not put all the big
                                    strawberries at the top and the little ones at the bottom. It will not make one half

                                    chapter. The first thing to do is to stir up human souls to their depths with
                                    fundamental principles, and reach down to the motives and springs of action, that
                                    things may begin at the beginning. There is dire necessity of a radical change like

                                Broadway, New York. We have just received " The Western World Guide Book of Useful
                                Information. " It is one of those indispensable hand-books that every one wants on the
                                table where he reads or writes. With its thousands of ready references, covering almost
                                every department of interest in this world, we obtain at a glance what might be sought
                                for in vain without the book. In it are found colored maps of all the States and
                                Territories, also a brief history of each one, which is well worth the price of the
                                book. The area, population, products, government, etc., etc., of the several states is
                                neatly represented by colored diagrams. It is surprising what a fund of information has
                                been brought into a small compass and at so trifling an expense to the fortunate owner
                                of this valuable little book.

The Committee in charge of the construction
of the pedestal and the erection of the Statue,
in order to raise funds for
its completion, have prepared, from
model furnished by the artist, a perfect facsimile
Miniature Statuette, which they are delivering
to subscribers throughout the United States at
the following prices:
No. 1 Statuette, six inches in height,�the
Statue bronzed; Pedestal, nickel-silvered,�at
O'no 1>ollixi'  each, delivered.
No. 2 Statuette, in same metal, twelve inches
high, beautifully bronzed and nickeled, at

No. 3 Statuette, twelve inches high, finely
chased, Statue bronzed, Pedestal, Heavily
Silver-Plated, with plush stand, at
Ten    r>ollax"s   each,   delivered.
Much time and money have been spent in
perfecting the Statuettes, and they are much
improved over the first sent out. The Committee have received from subscribers many
letters of commendation..
The New York World Fund of $100,000 completes the Pedestal, but it is estimated that
$40,000 is yet needed to pay for the iron fastenings and the erection of the Statue.
Liberal subscriptions for the Miniature Statuettes will produce the desired amount.
