TEIform="persName"/> By Elder Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> JESUS stands in advance of all who have accepted the system of united fj inheritance, where
                            the selfish interests are made to give place to a more universal care for mankind. Paul in
                            speaking to the Hebrews has said ;�"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day and
                            forever. Be not carried away with diverse and strange doctrines ; for it is a good thing
                            that the heart be establisht with grace." From the earliest ages, God has called out his
                            witnesses from among mankind and some of them have been as true as the needle to the pole,
                            while others have failed to receive a very deep impression and have hardly been raised above
                            the level of the world. The first witness of God's power�the man in Eden�signally failed and
                            years past away, before another special witness was called. These messengers of God,
                            including a long list of prophets, judges, kings and priests have accomplisht a wonderful
                            work among mankind. The influence being more for good than for ill, is world-wide, and it
                            will continue to increase toward God and for humanity while time lasts, and of this there
                            need not be the least doubt. The most remarkable of these witnesses is found in the person
                            of Jesus the Christ. His work was wholly on the side of good, as righteousness became the
                            foundation upon which his life and testimony were establisht. The disciples and apostles
                            were also witnesses of the same good work. Even of more modern date, without the knowledge
                            of John Calvin, Martin OCTOBER, <pb n="146" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Luther, George Fox and Wm. E.
                            Channing, thousands might have been left in greater darkness on the subject of Christianity.
                            Prominent among all the witnesses of God, the Christ life of Mother Ann Lee has been
                            accepted by the Shakers. As a preacher of righteousness, she taught her followers as did
                            Jesus, to take up their crosses against the pernicious influences of the world, and to deny
                            themselves of "all ungodliness and every worldly lust." Her mission is wonderful in that a
                            woman should dare to teach when the Bible, the Christian's word of God, was wholly revealed
                            unto men. Paul had also expressly taught that the women should accept all religious
                            instructions from their husbands. The unmarried, of course, were ruled out. But Ann Lee
                            broke all these barriers and taught publicly and privately, as did Jesus, that the pure in
                            heart, the meek and the merciful, should be called the children of God, and that the
                            disciples of our Lord could never engage in warfare with carnal weapons,�that in preference
                            to all other things, we must seek the Kingdom of God and its righteousness. Persecuted in
                            England by the inquisition of the Protestant church, a few only of the number came to
                            America and establisht a Community of united interest. In 1810 they were able to publish a
                            book of some oOO pages. It set forth their views of the Christian life, and a review of the
                            antichristian churches. This has been called the Shaker Bible, but' the Shakers were
                            innocent of the charge and went on as before, reading and making their sermons from the
                            authorized version, by King James, which within a few years has been, and is still being so
                            thoroughly pruned by the I). Ds. of the churches. Referring to the united interest, we are
                            justified in believing that it was the order of the Primitive church. Jesus and his twelve
                            disciples are our first examples. They were Shakers in the full sense of the word. To the
                            rich it was said,�"Go sell what thou hast, give it to the poor, then come and follow me." To
                            those who owned less of this world's goods, selfishly, it must be said in the words of the
                            disciple, "Behold, we have forsaken all to follow thee." The rich and the poor gave all to
                            Christ and became as brothers and sisters in the church of God. It was to forsake all. The
                            Pentecostal church was organized on this same basis. They sold all their possessions and
                            gave the money into the consecrated interest of the church, the same as the Shakers are
                            doing at the present time. While the Apostle Paul establisht a reformatory church at
                            Corinth, Ephesus and at Rome, he at the same time establisht them on a very selfish
                            foundation, and admitted all the relations of the old inheritance, which had been so
                            thoroughly opposed by the testimony of Jesus. It was a Gentile, Christian church. It may
                            have been the best that Paul could do under the circumstances, but it presented only a
                            slight resemblance to the church of the disciples. To let every man have his own wife and
                            every woman her own husband, is <pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> all Bible doctrine, and we only wish
                            that the Christian conscience was strong enough to keep it as disciplinary as Paul felt
                            authorized to organize it. The Shakers, however, have no controversy on this point, as they
                            consider it a phase of life that no more concerns them either among the saints or sinners,
                            than does any business relation which men and women may choose to follow. The Shakers have
                            never lookt upon the marital relations as being either very good or wholly bad. Marriage
                            began very early in the history of our race and will, in all probability continue, so long
                            as the race lasts, even tho it is in violation to the testimony of Jesus the Christ. The
                            Infidel and pseudo Christian churches, have tried to amalgamate marriage with Christianity,
                            but have so far most signally failed. At best it is only a civil right and all its
                            privileges, as well as all its penalties, are directed by the voice of the civil law. Paul's
                            advice to those carnal Corinthians, which the Christians so loudly eulogize, was perhaps,
                            the same as a Shaker would be inclined to give to a polygamous church, but it presents a
                            sorry picture of the gospel of Jesus, and after the experience of two thousand years, the
                            Christians are looking back and claiming the indulgences of a lower order. Very little did
                            these people think of establishing the heart in righteousness, or of denying themselves of
                            all ungodliness. The disciples of Jesus were higher types of character and were ministers of
                            influences for which it would be an honor to contend. They were the guides to that place of
                            rest, where "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and where no more death, neither
                            sorrow nor crying shall be known, for the former things have all past away." East

                            nature consequent to a wrong system that fosters many evils. While intemperance is in itself
                            a cause of many ills, it is also an effect of still greater underlying causes, therefore so
                            long as those causes exist, it seems that the wisest and most rigidly executed laws of State
                            which should relate to temperance as a single reform, could at best prove only palliative
                            and temporary in nature. While the government is so constituted as to express the will of
                            the governed, improved legislation can only be enacted as a consequence of a broader, higher
                            and wiser education;�with that awakening of the National conscience which will insist upon
                            the conditions of radical democracy. An in- <pb n="148" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> telligent study of public

                            this would, in our opln'oi, result more favorably to the cause of Temperance than all other
                            measures c nnbined. "When proportional Representation is adopted as a means of registering
                            the real voice of the people, they will not be long probably in placing the currency under
                            government control and in restoring the land to the people. This accomplisht, all other
                            monopolies will hi thoroughly under.n ned; but there is little hope that these or other
                            important reforms can be consummated until woman exercises the right of franchise. Then, we
                            believe, there will be power to reach to the root of all the vice and misery by whicli the
                            earth is afflicted, for the reason that so many noble women of clear vision are anxiously
                            waiting that opportunity to use their influence in the purification of social life, when she
                            will reserve to herself the right of choice in the dutie.4 of maternity. Of such measures,
                            superior offspring will be an immediate result. The conservation of vital force is
                            fundamental to the success of every true reform and will soon be manifest in a higher
                            physical, intellectual and moral life in humanity. Through the development of the divine and
                            spiritual nature in man, the well-springs of life will be opened within, then the soul will
                            thirst no more, neither will abnormal physical appetites and inflamed passions demand that
                            hell-creating "fire-water" which ruins the body, blights and stultifies all that is noblest
                            and highest of mind and soul. Intemperance having no longer a cause will then cease to
                            exist. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Teachings of mother Ann Lee alphabetically arranged" TEIform="index"/> TEACHINGS OF MOTHER

                            needy. Cry thou to God that He may give thee true desires. Dress modestly and as becometh
                            the followers of Christ. Every soul can not be dealt with alike, some must be drawn to God
                            through love; some through mercy, and yet others must feel the judgments of God. Faith is
                            the anchor of the soul, and holds it in times of trial and temptation. God will answer the
                            prayer of those who call upon his name in faith. Hate covetousness, be joyful, cheerful and
                            diligent in doing good. If you wilfully do that which is wrong you debar your soul from the
                            Kingdom of Heaven. Just in proportion as you heed the cries of the needy, God will heed
                            yours. Keep the word of God and do Ms will and all that you do will be blest. Labor to feel

                            occupation. Man must first be redeemed from "the fall" before the animal creation will be
                            subject unto him. No one can enter the kingdom of heaven with hard or unkind feelings toward
                            another, for the law of this realm is Love. <pb n="149" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Only through prayer and
                            suffering are the gifts of God obtained. Put not your trust in man, but in the power and
                            gift of God. Quell the spirit of fault finding; do not complain of the way of God until you
                            have proved it, none ever thought it hard who really were in it. Remember the poor and
                            suffering, feed the hungry and clothe the naked. Speak not harshly, but let your words be
                            few and seasoned with grace. Those who through faith and obedience find a just relation with
                            Christ will of all souls be most blest. Under trial be not discouraged, for your Heavenly
                            Father seeth your soul in its adversity, and sendeth succor in time of need. Voluntarily
                            bear the cross of Christ and faithfully endure to the end and ye shall become kings and
                            priests unto God. Whoever follows Christ in the re-generation will be cleansed from all
                            unrighteousness. Xact of no man more than is your due. Your lives should be godly; your

                            part with those who by their faithfulness have won love and affection, our loss is
                            nevertheless hard to bear. No one was more sincerely mourned by those who knew her best,
                            than was our precious Sister and Mother, Eldress Lydia. Not alone in her own home, but by
                            all who knew her. She had lived a Shaker life for seventy-five years and had filled all
                            positions of trust and care with that evenness of hand, and kindness of nature, that
                            motherly feeling, all could realize that came in contact with her that she was a practical
                            Christian. To those under her care, she was the wise counselor, the kind mother and the
                            loving friend. She was ever ready to extend sympathy and relief to those who needed it and
                            by loving words and kindly acts proved that her interest in all was sincere. As one writer
                            in an obituary in one of our local papers exprest it; ' 'Eldress Lydia Annas was a
                            remarkable woman." Possest of a cheerful, loving disposition by nature, by living the Christ
                            life she became more so in her advanced age. Altho she had reacht the ripe old age of
                            fourcore years, she maintained that youthful, cheerful spirit to the close of life. Perhaps
                            it was the selfishness of our human hearts that made us unwilling that her precious form
                            should be taken from us and laid in the cold grave <pb n="150" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> hidden from our
                            mortal vision and made us unwilling to give her to the loved ones waiting for her on the
                            other side, and perhaps this same spirit for our beloved Mother makes us still reluctant to
                            say, "Thy will O God, not ours be done." May her Christian life example ever be a light, a
                            guiding star to lead us to the home she has made and gained in heaven. We know she will meet
                            friends who will welcome her with those sweet words,�"Well done thou good and faithful
                            servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." May her mantle rest upon us, is our prayer.

TEIform="persName"/> By Edwin P. Sevester.</byline><p TEIform="p"> I HAVE been reading an account of Frank James, ex-member of the notorious band of train
                            robbers, and brother of Jesse James, late chief of said band. Frank James repented of his
                            evil ways, living now for some years, an honest, an upright, a sincere, and in every
                            particular, a good life. Nobody has any fault to find with his present conduct. That man
                            complains that the newspapers of the West are constantly referring to his past life and in
                            his despair he exclaims,�"Why can they not let me alone?" He is very anxious and ambitious
                            to obtain an honorable position in society, aspiring to become Mayor Bourge-master of St.
                            Louis, but he finds that his past life and bad record bars his progress, clouds his future,
                            and prevents most effectually, his being taken into the circle of respectable <pb n="151" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> society. Managers of Theaters and Shows have offered him a large salary if he
                            would give himself to be exhibited on the stage, but he sternly and steadfastly refuses to
                            do so. Thia account made a deep impression on my mind. We read in one of the Prophets,�"-Our
                            sins are following us, are hedging us in, are fencing us in, are building a wall around
                            us.'" How true this is! Not that our sins in themselves, as such, necessarily must follow
                            us, for there is power in the gospel to overcome sin, but the consequences, the results of
                            our wrong doing, are following us, are hedging us in. We can not escape them. When a man has
                            pursued a wrong course and the angel of conviction touches his soul, he is then awakened and
                            convicted of his sinful course and wishes to lead a better and a purer life before God, and
                            before all men. It is then every one is distrustful, and does not believe he is sincere.
                            Paul found it so. After his conversion, he wisht to enter the room where the Apostles were,
                            but they were afraid of him; did not believe his reformation was sincere and closed the door
                            against him. Those of us who are convicted and know of the better way must go straight
                            forward, neither turning to the right nor to the left, being true to our convictions and
                            living to our most holy faith, or publicans and harlots will enter the kingdom before us.

Now a rock between
                            two persons will certainly prevent them seeing each other. Our Rock is spiritual. Jesus
                            said, "God is spirit"�the most substantial of all substances. Therefore it is impossible
                            fora natural person to see any one that is shielded by this rock, that is, any one who is
                            living a spiritual life in the inmost of his soul. Christ is a Rock, and Jesus said, "Upon
                            this rock will I build my Church." Man has two natures�natural and spiritual. The natural or
                            generative is first, and it develops first. As the person grows to a condition in which
                            natural things will not satisfy the mind, he feels dissatisfied with all around him,
                            relatives, friends, neighbors, with all the earth possesses and produces. When in that
                            condition, there is nothing that can be presented to him that can satisfy the soul's
                            cravings. What then is the matter? Why, the spiritual within him is beginning to develop,
                            and it will not be, it refuses.to be satisfied with anything that is of and from the mere
                            natural and genera-. tive order. The soul now requires spiritual ministrations and
                            sustenance from the Church whose rock, foundation and walls, are Christ. <pb n="152" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> On a certain occasion, when Jesus was preaching to the people, perhaps in a
                            synagogue, some one went to him and said, "Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand
                            without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who
                            is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples,
                            and said, Behold my mother and my brethren ! For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
                            which is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother." We dare say his mother,
                            the virgin Mary, as she is called and worshipt by millions, thought this was very hard talk.
                            But he meant what he said. For his mother was no more to him than was any other woman,
                            except she had more virtues, and was more in affinity with his spiritual life. And so it is
                            with us of the household of faith. We have entered, or ascended the spiritual sphere, and
                            what have we to do with natural relatives, as such, or with those who live in the natural
                            and generative sphere ? Nothing at all. They also, every one of them, will develop, and will
                            come to a condition in which natural things will not satisfy their soul aspirations. Then we
                            can approach them and do them good. But at present, we are similarly situated to the prophet
                            Nehemiah, when he and others were building the walls of the second temple. He sent
                            messengers to those who pretended to be his friends, but were indeed his enemies, and who
                            would not assist him in the work, saying, ' 'I am doing a great work, so that I can not come
                            down ; Why should the work cease while I leave it, and come down to you?" And like him we
                            say to our natural relation, friends and neighbors ; We are doing a great work ! We can not
                            come down to you! We can not fraternize with you ! We do not hate you, but we do hate the
                            elements and principles in which you live, and by which you are actuated. We love you as we
                            do other persons, that is, with a willingness to do you good, if you could and would receive
                            the good we have to give. But we can not come down to you. You whom the things of this world
                            can not satisfy, may come up to us, and then we will acknowledge you as our brethren and
                            sisters and friends, and you shall realize the truth of the Savior's promise to those who
                            will forsake all for his sake and the gospel. You shall have spiritually, a hundredfold of
                            all your relatives, friends and associates (excepting only the wife and the husband) and of
                            all needed physical blessings. God is our Rock, and all the so-called good things of the
                            natural and generative order, including wife, children, friends, neighbors, riches,
                            pleasures and honors of this world, which we have been called to forsake, are, compared to
                            the spiritual good we are called to inherit, but as loss and dross, knowing and feeling that
                            we possess the unspeakable privilege of beginning upon earth, to live as do angels in
                            heaven, so that when we shall leave this body, we may find ouselves approved and accepted
                            and dwellers in the society of justified and glorified spirits. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            impressions of a religious life, and realizing that these are usually the most lasting, and
                            as my experience has been confined largely, within the limits of the Shaker Church, I feel
                            it my privilege and my pleasure, to speak of its benefits and manifold blessings. Indeed, I
                            am under the most sacred obligations to fulfill the pledges honestly given to sustain its
                            vital principles. Notwithstanding the fact that in our Shaker Homes, as they exist to-day,
                            there is abundant opportunity for those who have no more honor, or self-iespect than to live
                            a life of selfishness and idleness, let us remember that this is in direct opposition to the
                            teaching aud practice of the founders of our Church, whom we profess to love so well, and
                            whose motto, "hands at work and hearts to God," is just as binding upon us, as it was upon
                            them, and is just as faithfully carried out by every loyal member. If any individual
                            violates this principle of hand and heart service, so essential to the maintenance, growth
                            and prosperity of the communal home, while sharing its common blessings, then is he
                            dishonest and disloyal, and no amount of charity or mercy on the part of others, can make
                            such crooked paths straight; neither can it be a passport to the union and friendship of the
                            consecrated. If any individual in our ranks, is untrue to these vital principles of our
                            Institution, and has not the moral courage to change his or her life, then, as beloved Elder
                            Giles has said;�"War should be proclaimed to the subduing and casting out of such elements
                            and influences of evil." We want no peace which involves the sins of ourselves or others.
                            The peace and happiness which the gospel gives, is not to be bought at such a price. It is
                            not to be obtained by coming down from our standard of virgin purity, or compromising with
                            any spirit or influence that is below the standard of a Christian man or woman anywhere. By
                            this testimony of eternal truth we shall be judged, and not by the number of years spent in
                            a community where our presence is an outward profession of faith. This has nothing to do
                            with our merits or demerits, our justification or condemnation, only in the sense that
                            "where much is given, much will be required," and if we have neglected our opportunities for
                            moral and spiritual growth and development, then, instead of being a help and strength to
                            others, we are simply as stumbling-blocks in the way and as such shall have our reward.

                                week. Some of us are trying to mend our ways both spiritual and temporal. The spiritual
                                is an uphill path, straight and narrow but it requires a strong, unflinching will and a
                                firm determination to ascend continuously the rugged hill of heavenly progression, and
                                few there be who undeviatingly and successfully make the ascent. Our temporal paths we
                                have rectified in part, and if strength and life are continued to us, we may complete
                                the work of leveling the pavements so that we may walk safely without stumbling. Our
                                harvest is great but the laborers are few. Grain is under shelter, also most of our hay.
                                The gathering of apples, pears and plums call for preservation. We pickt the first ripe
                                tomatoes this year on the 26th day of August. We ought to have had tomatoes at least a
                                fortnight earlier, and doubtless should, if the rain and wind had not injured them
                                sadly. Public meetings opened July 4th and we have not missed a Sabbath since. There are
                                several able expounders of our faith, so we are ably and honorably represented. Several
                                novitiate members have joined the North Family. "In love the righteous are remembered
                                While they journey here below. Every toil and care is numbered Grief and sorrow as they

                                the opaline mists that enwrap the distant hills in dreamy radiance, the gorgeous and
                                brilliant coloring of the foliage, all remind us that we are in the month of October.
                                Despite the golden glory of the month, we know that death and decay have replaced life
                                and growth. But the year dies royally. And like a long and godly life that grows more
                                beautiful towards its close, so the earth seems to enwrap herself in a soft, spiritual
                                brightness, before the melancholy rhythm <pb n="155" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> of the wintry wind-harp
                                sighs its last requiem. The passing season has brought its usual activities. The
                                Brethren have harvested over five hundred tons of hay, which has been secured under the
                                most unfavorable circumstances. The heavy rains of the past season in this locality,
                                have done considerable damage; the usually quiet, meandering mountainstreams have been
                                swollen to impetuous torrents. We have gathered fifty-six bushels of cultivated
                                blackberries; the greater part were sold in the Pittsfield market. Sisters Martha
                                Anderson and Lydia Staples are spending the present week at the Chatham Fair, exhibiting
                                the handiwork of the Sisterhood, from which they expect satisfactory sales. Several
                                companies of the Brethren and Sisters have also visited the Fair. We should be glad to
                                speak of our spiritual status, but things that appeal to the inner senses are more
                                difficult to describe, than those that speak to the outer eye and ear. Our wealth
                                consists not in houses and lands, but in the noble, uplifted lives of inspired Brethren
                                and Sisters, who are seeking for the highest expression of truth in their daily lives,
                                having these, we are rich in all things. Despite outward evidences to the contrary,
                                never before was spiritual evolution in progress as to-day. It is the duty of each and
                                all to cultivate the truth-seeing power of the soul, to follow the inner light that it
                                may shine brighter and clearer. In doing this we may not only be able to flash its
                                bright rays upon the pathway of others, but all errors, mistakes and seeming chains of
                                spiritual bondage will melt away before the shining of the God light within. For are we
                                not made to stand as sons and daughters of God holding all things under our feet? Annie

                                our Communities, and coming from an organ under the jurisdiction of that powerful
                                ecclesiastical organization, the Catholic Church, we realized the fact that the boundary
                                line of sects and parties could not prevent the communion of kindred souls and all who
                                love the truth were as brethren and sisters, regardless of the organization, religious
                                or political with which they are associated. Let those who think that the testimony of
                                truth which Believers have held forth has fallen on barren ground, because of our
                                disparity of numbers, remove their doubts; there never was a time when the testimony was
                                working with that fullness as at present. The more advanced minds are going deep to the
                                foundation of the causes which are producing the discordant effects portrayed in our
                                political and religious life. The opening years of the twentieth century will witness a

Septembek, the month which summons the army of workers from their summer's
                                rest, has come to us and we realize that our pen, having enjoyed the universal summer
                                vacation must now resume its duties. But what can it relate that will interest or
                                entertain? Certainly all of our friends know of the weather, of which we have had almost
                                "too much" and of such variety, that there was no chance for monotony. The rain has
                                fallen liberally and regularly, scarcely a day passing whose record does not tell of a
                                shower. There has been a strife between the rain and the hay-makers as to which would
                                secure the hay. No sooner would "the hum of the reaper be heard on the hills," than a
                                distant mutter would resound through the <pb n="156" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> valleys, signaling the
                                approach of the opposing forces, the rain. The farmers, I believe, expect to complete
                                harvesting the hay during the present week. The potato crop through our locality is an
                                entire failure altho that of our home is much better owing to the favorable place of
                                planting. The corn also yields but little. Apples and pears are plentiful. Berries were
                                of excellent quality. So we find in balancing each day's accounts that the mercies far
                                exceed the ills, and thus our gratitude and trust is strengthened. Our list of visitors
                                for the summer is very short, but none the less valuable, for we were pleased with the
                                brief visit of Sisters Mary Hazard and Hannah Ann Agnew of Lebanon, both true witnesses
                                of the value of a long life of usefulness and true righteousness. Even now their hands
                                and hearts are constantly employed in helping others. To such we are sure a full
                                recompense will be awarded, for they who seek earnestly the best gifts are assured that
                                no good thing will be withheld. With hands earnest in labor, and hearts strong and true,
                                our part is to work and to patiently wait. Not only intellectual and spiritual gifts
                                will insure a holy life, but a wise combining of the temporal with the spiritual, thus
                                ennobling and beautifying daily life. We rejoice that our loved Brother Ira occupies his
                                place in our home once more, altho we are aware that often much exertion is required in
                                doing so. We think we can extend no better wish to our friends in parting, than that
                                written so many years ago. ' 'And the peace of God which passeth all understanding reign

                                of this may be on the religious side and a part quite its equal on the side of the mere
                                animal nature. When we bear in mind that the righteous man shall receive the righteous
                                man's reward we have through hope, an anticipation of a satisfactory reward, and for a
                                season go on our way rejoicing. Trials and crosses which are sure to come, change the
                                whole order of our being, and then we bear in mind that "nothing that defiles or makes a
                                lie" can enter into: the Holy City; and we wonder what will become of us in that day of
                                reckoning. If we are so lucky as to get "wholly saved" as some of the Christian friends
                                express it, then we can laugh at all trials and rejoice in the midst of every burden. As
                                the season moves along, the usual changes take place, and already the singing birds have
                                past to warmer climes. Scarcely a bird is to be seen on the premises. A growing anxiety
                                is felt in regard to the apple and potato crops. Both will be very light. Pears are
                                plenty, and many of these may be kept for winter use. The Sisters who went from home to
                                sell "Fancy Goods" have all returned. As a whole the sales have been very satisfactory,
                                and a markt kindness extended to them in all places. By invitation, the "Qui Vive"
                                Quartet are on a visit to the ' 'Poland Spring House'' and will also visit the Believers

During this month we have been so blest with showers that they have modified
                                the heat, and even those not working under shelter ha ye been measurably comfortable.
                                The pine-apple harvest is finisht and we are resetting more slips and shoots for the
                                harvest of another year. We have secured five tons of good hay, which is needed for the
                                horses and oxen. The sweet potatoes that were planted the 3rd of June, are now ripe for
                                use. The cost of raising these, is about the same as <pb n="157" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> would be the
                                white potatoes at the North. Tomatoes furnish the best crop during the winter, and we
                                are now preparing the land for the coming winter. Every month brings a little change for
                                the better in our new home, and at the close of five years, the time given to us to make
                                a home, we shall look upon the work of our hands and be satisfied. Our stationary number
                                still holds to the mystic seven. Our beloved Sister Elizabeth Sears entered our home
                                just five months ago. She is one of God's noble women, and our doors are open to as many
                                as may wish to come, who can make the same sacrifice, by living the same life. In our
                                new home we find it is a constant toil, filled with the spirit of perseverance. Decision
                                and energy may be good in undertaking a great work, but in most cases, quiet
                                perseverance must step in to complete the work. Our good Sister Nancy is trying to take
                                a new lease of life by holding to the higher thought�there is no disease. Andrew

The weather at this time is very warm. One would think that mid-summer was

                                This pleased us all very much, and we returned to our home well satisfied with their
                                success. Not long since, two of the Brothers from the same place, gave us a call. .Like
                                John the Baptist, they proved the forerunner of the visit which is now ours to enjoy.

                                Russell, Lizzie Curtis, with the writer spent a few days at the Spiritualist's
                                Camp-meeting held at Lake Sunapee, N. H. The evening of August 15th the Association
                                tendered to us the use of their Hall and choir, so that we could let shine the light of
                                Shakerism. A flash of Eldress Rosetta's illumination cast out. The Christ spirit to us
                                means the spirit of truth, teaching that there will ever be a divine force intelligently
                                working in humanity to accomplish divine ends. In the year 1770, Ann Lee, while
                                imprisoned in Manchester, England, on account of her testimony against sin, believed
                                Jesus came to her as he came to his disciples after his resurrection and transmitted to
                                her truths that led her to go forth with the resolution to teach as he taught humanity,
                                a life of personal purity and fellow helpfulness and only as we come under the
                                influences that lead from the world's corroding elements and make a personal application
                                of his teachings, do we become the true followers of Jesus the Christ. The inspiration
                                which the thought of this noble life gives to us is the assurance that truth will
                                finally triumph over error, <pb n="158" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> the spirit of equality aright
                                injustice. A ray from Sister Isabella's light heralded, resurrection from death to life
                                is the forsaking of the sins and errors of the past and the soul henceforth walking in
                                the light of truth. Always bearing in mind that only as we forego the pleasures of a
                                sensual, selfish life, and cultivate the falculties which constitute our spiritual
                                nature can we become co-workers with Christ in the redemption of mankind. Years before
                                the advent of modern Spiritualism, the light of Shakerism shed forth the fact of
                                intercommunion between the spirit and material worlds. Also, that wicked spirits could
                                visit their former abodes, mingle with old associates with appetites still alive and
                                craving indulgence, but the power to satisfy those desires withdrawn. Could the drunkard
                                conceive a hell more to be dreaded than this? Is it any wonder that those interested in
                                the wellfare of humanity proclaim,�The Saloon must go? and that anti-tobacco societies
                                are springing into existence to crush the evil which is threatening to destroy every
                                prospect of a noble manhood? It is indeed a blessing to those who have been educated in
                                a manner that brings them into harmony with the advance truths of the present day, all
                                of which bid union of spirit with the true and good, thus create a heaven within, and
                                escape the reapings of a misspent life, in days to come. George H.

                                        which, curiously, is seldom referred to by writers upon dietetics. The reason
                                        for this may be the fear of criticism in view of the experiments of
                                        Boussingault, which have been so frequently quoted in physiological treatises
                                        that they have assumed almost equal authority with the classical experiments of
                                        Harvey upon the circulation of the blood. The observation of many travelers, as
                                        well as many facts of common experience, contradict the conclusions of
                                        Boussingault regarding the necessity for the addition of salt to the food of
                                        human beings. For example, Mungo Park found the native tribes among whom he
                                        traveled living entirely without salt. The natives of Siberia make no use of
                                        salt; and in all Central Africa, salt was unknown until introduced by travelers
                                        and missionaries. The native tribes of North America, when discovered by white
                                        men, and so long as they remained in a primitive state, made no use of salt.
                                        Travelers have observed that the antelopes of South Africa do not visit the salt
                                        licks, as in some other parts of the world, and it is well known that the
                                        herdsman on our Western plains never give salt to the thousands of cattle that
                                        are there raised for the Eastern market. In certain parts of England it is the
                                        habit of farmers to give their herds no salt, yet the cattle produced in these
                                        countries have the reputation of being the finest in the world. The conclusion
                                        drawn from these observations is that the use of salt by human beings is rather
                                        a matter of habit than of necessity, nature having probably exhibited the same
                                        wisdom in regard to the amount of salt placed in our food as with reference to
                                        the other salts required by the system. It is evident from these facts that the
                                        use of salt as a condiment is injurious to digestion in two ways;� 1. It
                                        diminishes the amount of hydrochloric acid present in the gastric juice by
                                        provoking the secretion of a large quantity of neutralizing alkaline mucus. 2.
                                        It diminishes the disinfecting power of the hydrochloric acid which is
                                        unneutralized. In view of these observations, it must be clearly evident that
                                        the amount of salt used should be reduced to a minimum. The presence of so much
                                        of it as exists in <pb n="159" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> the urine and perspiration is evidence
                                        that it is not utilized in the body in the same way as organic food
                                        substances,�in other words, it is neither changed nor retained in the body, but
                                        is rather discharged from it; and it may be easily conceived that additional
                                        injury may arise from the excessive eliminative work required of the kidneys in
                                        consequence of its excessive use. For many years the writer has found it wise to
                                        urge upon patients suffering from indigestion, the importance of lessening the
                                        quantity of salt taken with their daily food. Several eminent French and German
                                        authorities have been investigating the influence of salt upon digestion, and
                                        find that it does not in any way encourage either the secretion of gastric juice
                                        or its activity; that it deteriorates the quality of gastric juice, and hence
                                        interferes with digestion. This is true even when the quantity of salt used is
                                        small. It has been found that so small a proportion of salt as four-fifths of
                                        one per cent, not only diminishes the activity of the gastric juice, but
                                        increases fermentation in the stomach by neutralizing the anti-septic properties
                                        of the hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice. So, no more shaking of the
                                        salt-dish in the dining-room!</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Good health" TEIform="index"/>Good Health.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Copies of the ''Beautiful City'' will be sent to Believers..."

                                much interesting information about the historic Wallkill Valley, in New York State, and
                                tells of the troubles with the Indians, the founding of a Huguenot village, the first

                                ex-President Harrison's i'Oi tljcoming book: General Harrison has just completed the
                                revision of his articles �which have appeared in The Ladies' Home Journal, making
                                extended notes and additions to them. There is a little story in connection with both
                                articles and publication. When the arrangement for the articles was made with General
                                Harrison by Edward W. Bok, editor of The Ladies' Home Journal, the General was paid for
                                them, with the understanding that when they were put into book form the magazine was to
                                share the royalties accruing therefioni. Mr. Bok, however, of his own accord, generously
                                releast General Harrison from paying him any royalty, for the reason, as he states, that
                                by the publication of the articles by General Harrison the subscription list of his
                                magazine was enlarged many thousands. The profits to The Ladies' Home Journal were more
                                than the publishers anticipated, and in view of this Mr. Bok asks nothing further.
                                General Harrison placed the disposition of his book in Mr. Bok's hands. The best offer
                                came to the editor from the Scribners, and to them Mr. Bok gave the book for his
                                distinguisht contributor. General Harrison's revision of the book has just been
                                completed, and the volume will appear in the autumn. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Outlook" TEIform="index"/>The
