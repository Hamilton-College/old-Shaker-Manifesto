                            eloquence the gifted tongue may speak Hath e'er the human heart so deeply stirred. The
                            parent true�for little ones who cares� Whose faithful heart forgets no earthly need, But
                            patiently all toils and trials bears, And in their weal alone seeks joy or meed, Can in that
                            sphere but dimly symbolize The higher, purer gift of Motherhood, Which in my angel home I
                            realize, And daily proves the source of lasting good. How few among the countless throngs of
                            earth Have found a mother for their longing souls; Or of that consolation known the worth
                            Which bideth ever where lier love controls. Unworthy though I am, 'tis mine to know Maternal
                            care that meets my spirit's needs; And feel within my heart the hallowed glow Of love that
                            from all earthliness is freed. And ye, O precious ones! who bear this love, Are unto me as
                            saviors true and dear; Baptized of Christ, with unction from above, Ye guard the altar I
                            would gather near. The altar whence that spark celestial came, That kindled in my heart
                            faith's quenchless fire, Which will regenerate from sin and shame, And God-ward turn each
                            feeling and desire. Whate'er has been my burden, pain or grief, The door of hope has opened
                            unto me, Where I have found a healing and relief, And peace, that dwelleth with a conscience
                            free. And who could e'er such tender mercy show, And patiently with all my trials bear, As
                            ye, to whom confidingly I go, And from the truth no evil prompting spare ? Ah ! none but
                            God's Anointed One, so blest, The Heavenly Comforter revealed on earth, The Mother true, on
                            whom that love doth rest, Through which the soul may find angelic birth. This name with
                            gratitude�of living greenAround my heart entwined shall ever be; And there affection's
                            fadeless flowers be seen, With lilies fair of spotless purity. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            a relief from sufferings ! It is the perfect work of righteousness, illustrating in its
                            career the love, mercy and goodness, of our Heavenly Father and Mother. It is a power,
                            ministered by angels, and saints who serve God, that is turning tlio old earth and old
                            heaven orders of the natural man, upside dowu. and, in their stead, building up a new earth,
                            and new heaven?. It is an epistle written in the life character of the children of God, to
                            be seen and read of all men. It opens the lips of humanity to those soul expressions of
                            praise and houor to God, and glory to humanity, that reprove all unrighteousness of
                            language, conduct, or feelings towards a fellow being. It is an iconoclasm that demolishes
                            all the false theologies of human invention that have made a mystery of godliness, in all
                            ages, and among all peoples. It is a surgeon that amputates from the body of Christ every
                            member that is incurably diseased, and probes and cleanses every diseased member who will
                            receive i!s healing ministrations. It is the " good Samaritan " physician that ministers to
                            the healiug of the soul, who, wounded with sin, hath fallen by the way-side, and fainting in
                            shame with the loss of spiritual life. If accepted and obeyed, the Christian testimony is a
                            present power of salvation from sin ; hence, from the guilt, condemnation and power of sin.
                            It points out a work to be performed, not merely a faith to be believed, by every follower
                            of the " Lamb of God " this work is crucifixion of all those passional elements in the
                            nature of man that lead to sin, by their indulgence. It is a testimony which, obeyed,
                            destroys the old crooked man of sin, makes of man a New Creature, the fit inhabitant of a
                            New Creation, a Paradise in the mansions of our Heavenly Father and Mother; a heavenly
                            inheritance here in time, while waiting the possessions of the brighter world above. Mt.

                            the association of highly cultivated society, as Modest}-. It seems to be the paramount of
                            all acquired abilities while it brings the individual in rapport with all classes of minds.
                            To be modest in our daily performance of duty and connection with society we need not great
                            knowledge of Rhetoric, or deep insight into the many languages. Our intellectual powers may
                            be great, but what advantage to society without the crowning "race of Modesty. True modesty
                            will always present chastity of feeling and spirit. It is an elevating faculty that holds
                            the individual above low and demeaning practices. It depends not on the fine coat or silk
                            dress for one to be in possession of this virtue. We find it in the cottage of the humble
                            toiler as plentiful as in the gorgeous mansion of the millionaire. To be modest is to follow
                            out the conscientious principles of right God has implanted in the soul. The principles of
                            truth and purity are always crowned with Modesty as the outgrowth of those cardinal
                            principles, and it is to them what the perlume is to the Rose. The perfume is not the Rose
                            but a\ hen we<pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>find the true rose it is not complete without the sweetest
                            aroma. So with the man or woman who has built their character upon honest principles. With
                            them Modesty will have great influence. Their very being will speak forth refinement in all
                            conditions of life. In the social circle there will be a carefulness to breathe forth purity
                            of spirit and feeling. And never through the slightest insinuation, feeling cr look be
                            willing to let it be known that an impure thought be ready to have utterance. How much
                            depends upon true government of the thoughts. How many wrong actions have been checked by
                            expelling the first thought. Kill the Lion while he is a whelp is more easily done than wait
                            until full grown. One of the highest characteristics of manhood is in puiity of speech.
                            Nothing will send a man or woman's character so far below par as improper conversation. An
                            ob~cene story, a filthy joke, a questionable word or gesture, a sentence that would make a
                            pure, modest person blush for shame in any company is a blot or stain on any one's
                            character. An obscene story is next to obscene actions. A filthy joke as wrong as a filthy
                            deed. He or she who has impure lips and indulges in impure speech is a disgrace and
                            corrupter of the morals of the young. All these points will be shunned by a modest person.
                            An impure mind feels but little necessity for modest behavior, for out of the abundance of
                            the heart, issues forth our life deeds. Harvard, Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Religion cannot pass away..." TEIform="index"/>Religion cannot pass away...

                            Syriac Testament. �"But it is beyond controveisy that the inferior is blest by his superior.
                            " Here are three statements of a law running, so far as we can see, through the entire
                            Universe of sentient being. Indeed it may be said to dominate all conditions of finite
                            existence. This law is sometimes expressed by the terms positive and negative, as of the
                            Electricities, which are exactly the same in essence, and differ only in quantity and force,
                            and so of all things else, capable of comparison. Their relation is one of less and greater.
                            This law of relation is evidently and especially traceable in the vegetable and animal
                            kingdoms. In the animal the relation of offspring to progenitor is one of helpless
                            dependence. That of progenitor to offspring is one of fostering inierest and love. When
                            these relations are properly seasoned by Wisdom andLove, they result in ties of affection
                            which cannot be dissolved in time or eternity. By being so modified these relations admit of
                            a wise and loving dictation on the part of the greater to the less, and an equally wise and
                            loving obedience to, and compliance with, such dictation, on the part of the less to the
                            greater. This law is so natural, so inevitably rich in blessings, that were it not for the
                            rude coarse nature of undisciplined man, we should all be so sweetly attracted thereby as to
                            move together in obedience and conformity<pb n="148" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>thereto, in the same harmony
                            and beauty and glory and gladness in which the planets move in their orbits around their
                            sun, and sun, planets and all revolve around still greater systems and so on to infinity.
                            But alas ! how imperious we are inclined to be in the use of our authority over our fellow
                            beings and how very little are we inclined to submit ourselves to helpful and needful
                            discipline and obedience to those who are able to lead aud direct us in paths of peace we
                            could not otherwise find, even though such may not always be blessed with that amount of
                            wisdom and love we might suppose they ought to possess at all times. Nevertheless these
                            unfortunate facts and conditions in no way excuse us from a compliance with the great law
                            under ^consideration, neither do they militate in the least against the philosophy of the
                            positive necessity as well as blessing of such law. I have not the shadow of a doubt that
                            were we all as we should be, and shall be some of these days, either in time or eternity, we
                            should feel the force and heavenly attraction of this sublime law and should so sweetly and
                            spontaneously respond to its serene dictates, as to feel the force of no power or authority
                            external to ourselves�but merely the Divine attraction of the "less to the better." Any one
                            wishing to learn music, painting, or anything worthy his attention and effort does not hate
                            his preceptor as a tyrant, but loves him as a teacher who is wiser and more experienced than
                            himself, and one whose direction and instruction it is his pleasure and benefit to follow.
                            There is no slavish obedience on one side, nor haughty dictation on the other. It is only
                            benevolent and sympathetic counsel and instruction aud guidance on the part of the teacher
                            aud loving peaceful and pleasurable compliance on the part of the taught. Now this is really
                            the whole foundation of what among Believers is generally denominated the visible Order of
                            the Church consisting of Ministry, Elders, Deacons, Brethren and Sisters. There may be many
                            graces and beauties to which we have not yet attained ; there may be also many defects of
                            character among leaders and led, which go to mar the beauty and success of its consoling,
                            saving and redeeming processes ; yet the inevitable outcome is surely the glorious and happy
                            culmination hinted at above, a culmination to be reached by all who in patience and
                            perseverance endure to the end. Things might be differently manipulated, provided we had all
                            been endowed with a power of infinite independence of each other. But alas ! " God never
                            made an independent man 'Twould mar the beauty of the general plan. Some are wonderfully
                            exercised over the idea of losing their individuality by being merged into the conditions of
                            a Community, including the observance of those rules and by-laws necessary for its success
                            and perpetuity, and also including the law by which "the less is blessed of the better. " My
                            ideas on this point, which are result of 0&gt;2 years experience and observation in the
                            practical and actual life of a Community, are exactly the reverse of the above anxiety about
                            losing one's individuality. It is of all cases and places by far the best experience for
                            developing one's individuality. We have an excellent opportunity to bring every shaky,
                            unstable principle to the altar of self-sacrifice, so that when we are through with it all,
                                we<pb n="149" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> find that all that is in our Heaven and Earth "that can be
                            shaken, has been shaken and shaken to pieces, so that that which could not and cannot be
                            shaken may remain." At this sta;e of our experience we find ourselves in possession of a
                            completely rounded out individuality, and perfectly free from every fitful fugitive vagary
                            of both flesh and spirit. We find ourselves indeed soaring among the bright clouds of
                            perfect independence of all rudimental proclivities and sailing on the wings of progress to
                            higher and higher attitudes of glory and perfection forever.

TEIform="persName"/>ELLA E. WINSHIP.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Most persons have read, no doubt, many articles upon the subject of Home. Some describing
                            its outward adornings, others its social and mental enjoyments, and still others its moral
                            influence, its restraint and protection from evil. The burden of this article is the true
                            spiritual home ; by which is meant neither locality, circumstances, nor surroundings. It is
                            nothing less than a home in the eternal principles of truth and righteousness; a perfect
                            affinity with godliness ; a spirit so firmly established on the rock of truth that it would
                            be at home nowhere else ! Should it stray never so little, there would be no rest, no
                            contentment, until the wanderer should return. How many of us, when thinking of Home, or
                            when singing beautiful songs upon the subject, think merely of our outward surroundings and
                            associations ? How many when we sing, '; I am on my journey to that beautiful land, " have
                            in view only a future home, a clime beyond the grave ? There is a more exalted meaning than
                            either of these, another conception of a spirit home. Many individuals may dwell upon the
                            same bit of consecrated soil, and yet their spirits may not dwell together. The habitual
                            frame of mind, the aspirations, the faith, the trust, in short, the virtues or vices of an
                            individual constitutes the spirit's home. It is sometimes a startling question,�wheredo our
                            spirits dwell?�and how shall we answer it? Is it in the worldly element, in the realm of
                            selfishness, weakness, and sin, or is it in the principles of uprightness, purity, and
                            holiness? That is a glorious land in which to dwell, where vices, temptations and:
                            weaknesses, will be regarded as foreigners and trespassers ; and the soul whose home is
                            there would feel like a stranger who had lost his way, if lie should once leave its blessed
                            borders. Let us dear young friends, having found our Spirit Home, our " Holy Land," continue
                            life's journey with gladness and zeal, our spirits securely resting in eternal principles ;
                            and may our friends both seen and unseen, always find us at home. Groveland, N.

                            Well, sisters, are we all ready for the entertainment this evening? H. I am. Oar last was so
                            pleasant, I even dreamed of it when I slept. E. So did I, and such a funny dream I had. I
                            thought I was dancing and could not stop ; my feet seemed to be moved as by magic. I was
                            weary enough, as you may fancy, and glad to awaken. F. I dreamed of gathering flowers, and I
                            thought as fast as I touched them, they seemed to wither and fall in pieces. M. And I,
                            sisters, had a vision that I cannot forget. I saw a fountain in the midst of a beautiful
                            land. Sweet flowers grew on its brink, a.;d rainbows spanned it. Many bright beings were
                            bathing in the clear waters, and I saw that when they came out their faces were radiant with
                            beauty, and they seemed to be filled with exceeding joy and peace. 1 longed to bathe in the
                            same fountain, but just as I was about to plunge into it, I felt a hand resting lightly upon
                            my shoulder, and turning saw a beautiful angel standing near me, but a mournful look was in
                            her eyes as she said, "Not now, not now." Just then, I awoke. O sisters, 1 am going to seek
                            that fountain that I may bathe in its waters and find peace. I am weary of the frivolous
                            dance and the gay song. This life of worldly pleasure has no rest. Who will go with me? F.
                            Not I indeed, I am not weary yet of pleasure. //. Nor I, let us leave such a pilgrimage to
                            others less young and happy. E. There is no such fountain, it was only a dream. M. Nay,
                            sisters it was a vision from Heaven, I must go to seek that fountain. H. And leave us ? M.
                            O, will you not go too? Angels will guide us and we shall find peace and rest. Others have
                            sought and found it and why not we? Will you leave me to go alone ? F. You cannot mean to
                            leave all of life's joys for an uncertainty. ( ?) E. and H. We are very sorry to part with
                            you, but we are bound for pleasure. The three sing, " Would you know where our barque is
                            going O'er life's sunny sea, Down the tide gaily, freely flowing, Will you go with me ? The

                            Fountain of Peace that I may find rest. L. The way is straight and narrow, can'st thou walk
                            therein? M. Yea, O blessed Angel, if thou wilt direct my steps. L. But thou must be tempted
                            first and tried and if thou wilt endure to the end, I will return and lead thee to the
                            Fountain ; but the way often proves a weary one, a path of tears. Dost thou not shrink ? M.
                            Not if angels guide me, not if it is a path leading to peace and rest. L. And wilt thou turn
                            from the wild joys of thy youth, from the vain pleasures of the dance, from the flashing of
                            gems and of gold ? Can'st thou leave thy gay young companions behind? M. Yea, blessed Angel,
                            I turn from all these and pray for peace. But will it take years of trial? L. Trust me, my
                            child, thou art yet untried, thy young happy life is now free from blight; be wise and on
                            thy guard, for the tempter will come in many dazzling forms of beauty, wealth, worldly
                            ambition and all that would lead astray thy young heart. Wilt thou bear the testing and
                            leave all of earth's fairest and brightest treasures, and geek only those gifts that will
                            enrich thy soul toward God? M. Bright Angel, I have counted the cost: now J pray, " Lead me,
                            lead me, angels, lead me To the fountain pever dry, Heed me, heed me, angels, heed me, Do my

                            never know sorrow. "Your path is thorny, rough and rude, And mine is broad and plain; My

                            leads thither ; is it straight and narrow ? //. O nay ! it is broad and beautiful, flowers,
                            singing birds and bright waters are on every side. Come, walk therein with me. M. (turning
                            away.) Nay, bright one, the path wherein I would walk is straight and narrow, but it leads
                            to the Fountain of everlasting peace. O tempt me not, for� " I will not give you my hand at
                            all, And I will not walk with you ; Your way is the way to endless death. Your words are all
                            untrue. " Scene IV. M. alone. M. " Vainly has the siren tongue, Of alluring Beauty Tried to

                            give ? Can'st thou lead me to its Fountain ? E. O yea, fair mortal, my way lies through
                            gorgeous palaces, where the sunlight falls through silken curtains, where the air is loaded
                            with costly perfumes, where gold and gems gleam on every side, where statues and paintings
                            charm the eye, and rich music lulls away all care. " My path, you see, is a broad fair one.

                            path where I would tread, a path of purity and tears, a straight and narrow way. E. "I will
                            change your dress fora costlier one, I will give you pearls to wear, beautiful satins and

                            world were offered him. E. Such offers as I extend to you do not come everyday. I pave the

                            friendship and fill your cup with perfect happiness. M. And through all this, can I preserve
                            a stainless character? E. Be not troubled about that, for where I lead, why fear? My power
                            will shield from all apparent blight or stain. Dost thou now refuse to follow me? M. O
                            spirit of Wealth, I know thy glitter is spread but to decoy. The fruits of thy life are
                            bitter, they yield no lasting joy. Begone from my presence. Wealth retires. Scene V. M.

                            rest that I seek; does thy path lead to the Fountain of Peace ? F. O nay ! There is no rest
                            with me, my votaries seek not for rest, but for activity and for the praises of the world.
                            M. But if I succeed in reaching the Fountain, shall I not find as great characters there,
                            whose lives are glorified by deeds of love, charity, and unselfishness ? That lovely throng
                            I saw by the Fountain in my dream, must have done something great to have won such
                            happiness. F. I never heard of that Fountain, I never heard of such characters. Their names
                            are not recorded on the annals of Fame, but my path leads to earthly glory. Come with me and
                            bask forever in its dazzling light. M. Leave me, thou wily tempter ; I have chosen a better
                            part, I know the path wherein I must walk is straight and narrow, but the end thereof is
                            perfect peace. Angels will guide me there, and the light of their presence will cheer me on.
                            Dearer to bask in the smile of an Angel than in a flood of earthly glory. F. And die
                            unknown. M. Go ! you shall not take from me my spotless name, for, " Though I stand with the
                            wealth of the ages, Encircled with fame and renown; Though my name upon historic pages, With

                            and believe." F. What! reject this golden opportunity? Fame, honor, renown and vast
                            research�All this shall be thine. M. Depart! depart! Tempt me no longer, lest judgment come
                            upon you, for He hath given his angels charge concerning those who would seek that Fountain.
                            Fame retires. Scene VI. M. alone. M. Tempted, but not forsaken, tested, but still I choose
                            the path that leads to the Fountain of everlasting Peace. Sweet Angel of my dream, come, I
                            need thy holy presence. (Angel enters.^) Blessed Angel! wilt thou now lead me to the
                            Fountain of Peace, that I may bathe in its waters and be forever at rest? L. My child, thou
                            hast borne thy trial bravely. I have watched ove thee with jealous care ; thou hast in-<pb n="154" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> deed been sorely tried and tempted during thy short experience; yea,
                            thou hast been permitted to realize in a meas lire the severe tests incident to a long life
                            in Christian self-denial,�but hast not yielded ! Lo, now I will lead thee to the Fountain of

                            in the guise of tempters are really guardian angels from my own bright spirit band, and
                            were, at my bidding, sent to test the sincerity of thy faith. They will appear to thee as
                            they really are, and now they come to accompany thee to the home of the blessed and welcome
                            thee to the beautiful Fountain of everlasting Peace. They enter, singing. " Beautiful !

                            profane persons as the word God, composed of only three letters. And perhaps there is no
                            word so little understood when used in an unlimited sense. Who by searching ever did or ever
                            can find out God unto perfection ? And yet we may leaim and know all that we need to know to
                            make us wise unto salvation, by Revelation, and by his works. We need not look beyond the
                            starry regions to find God, because lie is every where present. God is "Spibit" not a
                            spirit, for that would imply a finite being like ourselves. The difference between God and
                            man is, the former is infinite, the latter is finite, and in his present condition, is not
                            worthy of comparison. God is Spirit, and infinite filling immensity�all space�and no place
                            in the universe where he is not. He knoweth all things. We can have no secrets hidden from
                            him. He keeps a record of the human race. His infinity covers the whole ground. We shall not
                            fear to meet him i'n judgment, if we keep his commandments and serve him through love.
                            Although there are lords many and gods many, yet to us who believe, there is only one living
                            and true God, not a descendent of the Egyptian priesthood, nor of pagan deities, but the God
                            of the universe "in whom we live, move and have our being," "who works in us both to will
                            and to do of his good pleasure, " possessing the attributes of father and mother in the
                            Godhead. Romans, i., 20, revealing Himself indiscriminately, to all nations in the
                            nineteenth century, who rules in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of earth.
                            Man is a compound being made up of soul, body, and spirit, and originally was the offspring
                            of God. Acts, xvii., 28, and will be again, when redeemed by the cross of Christ. His body
                            was created for time, and must die and return to dust, and never have a resurrection ; but
                            his soul and spirit were created for eternity, and must live forever. He was created.for a
                            higher and nobler purpose, than to spend his time in this world in carnal recreations, and
                            vain amusements ;<pb n="155" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> " enjoying the pleasures of sin for a season," and
                            then pass into another sphere of existence, either higher or lower, according to what his
                            earth-life has best fitted him for. We repeat God is Spirit, self-existent, unlimited, and
                            undefinable. Man is a spirit, and recognized as such, when he says, although absent in body,
                            I shall be with you in spirit, and at the same time he may be some thousands of miles
                            distant. How can this be unless man is a spirit, and as such, is a part of God? " Lo ! I am
                            Avith you, alway even unto the end of the world, " said Christ, and his disciples understood
                            him, whether in the body or out, it is just as true now, as it was when it was spoken.
                            Although his disciples cannot see him with their natural eyes, because Christ is a spirit�a
                            spiritual man, and woman in this day. As God is Spirit, his kingdom is spiritual; his people
                            are spiritual; and at times abound in spiritual gifts ; for �' where there is no vision, the
                            people perish. " And in all things, the spiritual should have the pre-eminence. Because we
                            cannot see the Spirit with our natural eyes, shall we deny its existence, and say there is
                            no spirit? If we do, we deny God. Because we cannot see the wind with our natural eyes shall
                            we say there is no wind? John, iii., 8. What is man that he can withstand the wind in a
                            cyclone? One of the natural elements, representing God? All things are possible with God
                            which do not conflict with his spiritual laws, by which He governs the universe as well as
                            by his natural laws.

                                1885.</dateline><p TEIform="p">Robert Aitken, Dear Friend ; Your letter of March 17th. was duly received, and I have
                                taken time to consider it, and weigh the arguments contained in it. I am glad to find
                                the commendations you bestow on my statements and the spirit of my inquiries, and that
                                it I can satisfy myself on a few more points I shall be a good Shaker. Perhaps none
                                would be more difficult, you say, for me to see than the necessity tor a life of virgin
                                purity. I must admit, that had it not been for celibacy the order of Shakers would have
                                been overrun with all kinds of libertines, free lovers, and cranks. But this
                                self-denying article of belief has turned aside the tide which would otherwise have
                                overwhelmed them. This much I can plainly see. The Oneida Community lived many years
                                despite their license and libertinism, but it finally succumbed to the inevitable march
                                of events. Your observations on the Spiritual and the moral, and the distinction between
                                the two, I kind of perceive darkly, as I understand it the Spiritual Divine is a state
                                of mental clearness and serenity, the result of inspiration, which is not passive, but
                                active and aggressive. On the other hand the Moral is good, but deficient in Spirit. .
                                As to Spiritualism of the present day, 1 have no faith whatever in it. Judging it by its
                                fruits I should say it was the offspring of lewdness and disease rather than purity and
                                health. I remember the J. P. Greaves you refer to, of Ham Common. If I re-<pb n="156" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> member right he published a paper called "The Healthian" which I took and
                                read with great profit. As you remark, how little is left of the great Socialistic
                                movement of Robert Owen's time. Many you say joined the Shakers ; many left, but some
                                remain. Still, the seed sown by that great and good mat), has produced fruit in the
                                co-operative societies of the present day in England, which may yet resolve into
                                producing societies, on somewhat the same principle, as Robert Owen advocated, but with
                                perhaps more individual or personal liberty. I take it then that you place Spirituality
                                above mere, morality. In this too I agree, if by spirituality you mean Inspiration. But
                                still we must have morality and the deductions of intellect to guide Spirituality, or it
                                may lead us into grave errors. You say that perhaps you " do not express the ideas of
                                Shakers generally on this point." That "we look at it differently, i. e., the
                                practicability of a new condition of society on any other ground than a virgin life of
                                purity. " If then this be an open question it may be fairly asked ; What is purity ?
                                Certainly at the present day there is no purity in this respect. But is total abstention
                                from all sexual intercourse the only axiom of purity? Can we not rather kill lust and
                                have love in all its purity ? If Inspiration be all-powerful, cannot that, in
                                conjunction with thorough conviction, be sufficient to effect the object? I speak
                                deferentially on these matters, as I know you must necessarily have had more experience
                                than I on all these subjects. I have never been a Quaker, and am not thoroughly
                                acquainted with their doctrines, but I understand that while they discourage all prudery
                                and false shame, at the same time they suppress all levity in members of either sex, in
                                either words or action. I notice that in the seven fundamental points which you
                                enumerate they somewhat vary from the seven in the "'Brief Exposition*' published in
                                1879, though not materially. As you will perceive from the address of this letter, I am
                                just now in Florida. I have now been here about sixteen months. If a second Eden is to
                                be established, I think the Shakers, of all sects, are the most likely to carry out the
                                mission, or at least to pioneer it. Where I am located is about midway between the
                                Atlantic Ocean on the East and the Gulf of Mexico on the West. I do not think it the
                                best for spiritual welfare, however it may be for material. In Summer the winds from the
                                Atlantic on the one hand and the Gulf on the other meet about here, and we have too much
                                calm weather. In the absence of a breeze the heat is very oppressive. On the East coast
                                the Ocean breeze sets in every day and keeps down the temperature. There is a Mr.
                                Quinby, a Quaker, who owns a large tract at Aurantia, on Indian River. Indeed, there are
                                several towns, or settlements from Aurantia on the Indian River to Ormond (formerly
                                called Little Britain) on the Halifax. To revert back to celibacy, I think men and women
                                would enjoy each others company and conversation more in a state of celibacy than at
                                present. But I do not see how the population is to be kept up. I have been rather long
                                in replying to<pb n="157" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> your letter, but I have had but little leisure of
                                late. It has not been for want ef interest in the subject, and I have been very
                                deliberate in expressing myself.

                                regards the distinction between the Moral and the Spiritual ; to my view it is thus :
                                Jesus Christ said, ye miiot be born again before you can enter into the Kingdom of God,
                                that is out of the natural into the Spiritual. The Highest the natural man can attain to
                                is the moral, but the spiritual man embraces or takes in both. You do not, in my view,
                                put it in order when you say the spiritual is aggressive, passive ; as I view it, it is
                                passive, active against all sin and wrong. The spiritual is what is needed to guide and
                                rule the mental and the animal in man, to bring all things into order. The spiritual man
                                is under increasing inspiration and is God-guided in all he says and does ; the natural
                                man gets all he knows not by submission as the spiritual man, but by outward observation
                                through the sense medium. You ask me, What is purity? I would reply, it is obedience to
                                all moral and divine law. Man can be pure as a natural man, as he walks in obedience to
                                moral law. The spiritual is a step higher, and embraces the moral, takes that in as a
                                necessity ; for, though man can be moral but not spiritual, he cannot be spiritual
                                without being moral. The difference between Virgin Purity and moral purity is, when man
                                keeps moral law as a generative man, that does not make him a Virgin character: it is
                                only he who follows Christ in the regeneration that can be termed a Virgin ; for
                                regeneration involves a ceasing from generating. You ask, if all were to do this, wonld
                                not the race run out? Most assuredly it would ; we do not profess to have any revelation
                                as to what God intends with the continuance of the race of man, but we do say that He
                                has revealed his mind and will to us that, as professed followers of Christ, in order to
                                follow him, we must cease generating or we cannot be Christian or spiritual. We then
                                leave it to God to dispose of, how the race will continue to exist. There is one thing
                                sure if man goes on in violation of all moral law as he is doing, it is only a question
                                of time as to the continuance of the race. Robert Owen and J. P. Greaves, were two great
                                and eminent characters, and I am much indebted to both those men for what I am to-day.
                                As you observe there remains some of the fruit of their labors in the co-operative
                                movement, and there is a very extensive movement in dietetic reform, that is the fruit
                                of the labors of J. P. Greaves and others in England to-day. You will I think perceive
                                the difference, from what I have said, between the natural and spiritual, and between
                                the order of Christ's Kingdom and the order of the world. The two cannot be blended ;
                                flesh is flesh, and spirit is spirit, and the one is antagonistic to the other ; for the
                                flesh lusteth against the the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, and these are
                                contrary the one to the. other. You observe truly that were it<pb n="158" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> not
                                for a life of Virgin Purity we should have been overrun by all the various schemes
                                afloat at this day. I was formerly acquainted with a number of Oneidan members. From the
                                first of my acquaintance with them I saw they were doomed to fail, if they adhered to
                                their disgusting idea of male continence. But such was their delusion that they had in
                                that idea something of a far more self-denying life than we could lay claim to. My
                                experience in two attempts at community life, before I joined the bhakers gave me ample
                                evidence that the relation between the sexes must be pure, or there could be no success.
                                I have good reason to believa that failure m this respect was the cause of the end of
                                both the experiments I was in. You remark that Shakers are the most likely of any of the
                                sects to introduce an Eden state or be pioneers of the same. I would here say, that we
                                are full believers that by taking up our cross against all wrong in our knowledge we are
                                enjoying that state, and that it secures to all, who truly live out the self-denying
                                life of Jesus Christ, a condition of blissfulness and rest from the fruit of sin. It is
                                admitted by all who profess the Christian name that sin is the root of all unhappiuess
                                and misery ; even we socialists perceived that it was the violation of the laws of
                                nature, that was the source of all unhappiness, and as sin is a violation of law it
                                follows that all man needs is the power to live above all sin. This we can confidently
                                affirm to our fellow man, that we find in the life we live, and we see no other way
                                'whereby man can live a happy and justified life. It is easily to be perceived that so
                                far as man in the order of a worldly life, lives up to a moral standard of right so far
                                he enjoys its fruit, yet it would be impossible to find perfect happiness under any
                                condition in the order of a worldy life. I send yovx a pamphlet that may give you
                                further insight into the grounds of our life. We have larger works that are more
                                elaborate and explanatory of our life, faith and principles. Should you like to examine
                                further I shall be happy to furnish you with the loan of them. You say truly that an
                                association of virgin brethren and sisters can enjoy each others society far better than
                                it exists at present in the order of the world ; and I would add that even were the
                                world to enjoy all that a pure generative condition would give they would then come far
                                short of that which is to be enjoyed in the order of the Kingdom of Christ. Inasmuch as
                                the natural man understandeth not the things of the spirit of God, these being
                                spiritually discerned, so all out of this order of life are incapable of knowing the
                                higher relationship that exists between brethren and sisters in Christ. Hoping that
                                these few remarks may aid you in your investigations after truth, I will pledge myself
                                to do all that is in my power to aid you in your honest pursuit of truth. Were you
                                acquainted with William Galpin, who was Secretary of the Ham Colonization Society? He
                                lived at the Ham Society when I was there. He died among the White Quakers in Ireland.

                                at Ham. When I was there, there was a printing press and we published a weekly called
                                the New Age. Altogether there was a deep movement in that affair, and its effects are
                                still leavening into English society. I hear through the Vegetarian Society that the

                            God ; that it was His inspired utterance to man through man, and was to be accepted
                            entirely, Avithout adding to or taking from, as the guide and infallible law of humanity in
                            its duty to the Father of all. If this view were true, to what should we be led in this age
                            of light and of unfettered thought? Surely, into the blindness and bigotry of the past, into
                            its errors, its crimes, its wars, its light regard for human life, and its lack of " that
                            most excellent gift of charity." The advocates of religious wars, persecutions for
                            conscience sake, the taking of human life in punishment for crime, polygamy, human slavery,
                            the use of perhaps the greatest bane of the age, alcoholic drink, usury, and numerous other
                            wrongs, all go to that source and say, that there they find authority for all. Is it to be
                            wondered at that respect and regard and love for the Bible have decreased as the years have
                            passed? When leading thinkers in the world's history have held this book up as the actual
                            and infallible word of God and have said, " in it we are told that eternal torture is sure
                            for the unrepentant sinner, that some are born for glory eternal and some for punishment
                            eternal, and therefore the doctrine should not be questioned ; " what becomes of the
                            attributes of love and justice in the character of the Creator? The writer was educated in
                            the old theological idea of the sacredness of the Bible, but has lived to see some " old
                            things pass away ," and to accept the estimate of one of the advanced men of the age about
                            this book as nearly correct. He gays, " I have<pb n="160" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> lost my traditional and
                            educational notions of the holiness of the Bible ; but I have gained greatly, I think in my
                            estimation of it. As a divine book I never could understand it; a sa human composition, I
                            can fathom it to the bottom. Whosoever receives it as his master will necessarily be in
                            bondage to it; but he who makes it his servant, under the guidance of truth, will find it
                            truly serviceable. It must be examined, criticised, accepted or rejected, like any other
                            book, without fear and without favor. Whatever excellence there is in it will be fire-proof;
                            and if any portion of it be obsolete or spurious, let that portion be treated accordingly. I
                            am fully aware how grievously the priesthood have perverted the Bible, and wielded it both
                            as an instrument of spiritual despotism and in opposition to the sacred cause of humanity.
                            Still, to no other volume do I turn with so much interest; no other do I consult or refer to
                            so frequently ; to no other am [ so indebted for light and strength ; no other is so
                            identified with the growth of human freedom and progress ; and it embodies an amount of
                            excellence so great as to make it, in my estimation, the Book of Books. " If we accept it in
                            this spirit it will surely do us good ; if we accept it in the blind old way, it will as

                            seems desirable to give kind words a place among them. There are vain words, idle words,

                            encouraged. It may not be so much in the belief or in the unbelief regarding any form of
                            Church government or in that of any one particular book, as it is in that which is more
                            essential ; in "living soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. " It is the
                            varied influences for right that meet us on every hand, which aid us so effectually in
                            building on the foundation of God's word. We hear, we learn and finally accept the
                            testimony. On this we build our heavenly home. By a careful and thoughtful study of the
                            righteousness of the Scriptures, we may through them receive an understanding which shall
                            have a potent efFect in this direction and largely assist us in the development of a
                            religious instruction. A well regulated discipline of the body, and a corresponding
                            discipline of the mind, agreeably to the best light of the present day, is a path toward
                            that acceptable righteousness which Jesus so highly recommended to his disciples. It is the
                            life of the Christian order, and a church devoted to the worship of God, in the beauty of
                            holiness, must be a live church. The dull routine of forms and ceremonies may be more or
                            less necessary for an organized body of worshipers, to hold in check the earthly relations,
                            but they have no vitalizing power which shall make of an assembly, worshipers in spirit and
                            in truth. It is not, however, in a special demand | that shall rest upon any one person or i
                            on any one church, that they shall do so I much iti a given time, but rather that they shall
                            do faithfully and conscientiously the work to which God has called them. An example that
                            stamps its impression upon other minds for peacefulness and honesty would be quickly
                            recognized as being in direct sympathy with the evangel of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Men are
                            not so dull of comprehension, that they require a lengthy investigation into the workings of
                            a religious body, iu order to determine its position. The light which is ?hed abroad in the
                            world comprehends all corresponding light wherever it may be found. Truthfulness,
                            faithfulness and temperance are within the reach of the whole race of man. To accept them is
                            to accept a gift of God, a light from heaven. But if the sons of Belial fail to live to the
                            righteousness which they fully understand, and the sons of God, in like manner, drop below
                            their standard of right, with what prospect of hope can a church look forward iu
                            anticipation of harvesting the world into the Kingdom of God. Why may we not in the fullness
                            of our souls, sing in the rapturous strains of the poet:� " Zion, arise, break forth in
                            songs Of everlasting joy. To God eternal ^r.iise belongs Who doth thy foes destroy. Thou
                            Church of God, awake ! awake ! For light beams from on high, From earth and dust thy
                            garments shake Thy glory's drawing nigh. " Men do not light a lamp and put it under the
                            bushel, but on the stand and it shineth unto all that are in the house. This, like manv of
                            the lessons which JULY, 1885.<pb n="163" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> Jesus gave to the disciples, was to
                            stimulate them to work more effectually for God. A light, even of the best quality if hid
                            away in a box, was of no benefit to those who were passing in or out of the dwelling. "Ye
                            are the light of the world." As much as to say, put yourselves in a position where your
                            light from God may do some good. To help others is the Christian's divine gift of happiness,
                            as in this way he most effectually accomplishes his own salvation. Let the pathway to the
                            Kingdom of God be lighted with all the gospel graces, and then we can with confidence, and
                            with a loving assurance, extend the hand of fellowship to every one that starts on a
                            pilgrimage from the darkness of Kgypt to the City of our God.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>SANITARY</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Pure water" TEIform="index"/>PURE WATER
                            </head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> One of the chief agents in transferring disease germs to the
                                        human system is impure drinking water. It is safe to suspect the water of any
                                        open well of containing impurities which are detrimental to health, unless a
                                        chemical analysis proves that the water is fit for drinking. The reason for this
                                        is very simple. Open wells are built with stone or brick sides, both of which,
                                        being porous, allow the moisture in the surrounding soil, above the level of the
                                        water in the well, to trickle through the joints. Now, as the earth is filled
                                        with tmderground passages, through which the water flows, somewhat like the
                                        blood in the veins of an animal, the cutting off of these passages, bydigging a
                                        well, leaves their ends open, and the water naturally drains out of them.
                                        Meeting a porous wall, the water percolates that and enters the well.
                                        Consequently there is an excellently drained area surrounding the well for a
                                        distance of a hundred feet or more. If, in this area, there is a leaky drain, or
                                        a cesspool, then that also empties into the well, with what results may be
                                        imagined. There are two kinds of wells, that are, as a rule, safe. The first is
                                        the driven well, for in that there is no open space, and, of course, no
                                        inclination for surrounding water to drain into it. The pipe is, at all times,
                                        filled with water, and its lower and open end enters the vein from which the
                                        supply is taken. These veins are usually streaks of coarse gravel, that are
                                        surrounded by a compact, hard layer of clay, which is impervious to water. The
                                        other kind of well is made by digging, in the usual way. but, instead of
                                        bricking up the sides, they are built of drain pipe, of, say, ten or twelve
                                        inches in diameter, the joints being cemented, and the earth well packed around
                                        the pipe. This makes an open well, but no drainage can enter it becau e the
                                        sides are water-tight. A pump or bucket may be used in it. Where there is cause
                                        to suspect drinking water of containing impurities of an organic nature, a
                                        simple test may be made by putting into a glass of the water a drop of a
                                        solution of permanganate of potash. This will stain the water a delicate pink
                                        color. Let the color be just perceptible. Upon standing for an hour, if the
                                        color fades away, do not use the water. . In making the test have the glass
                                        perfectly clean, and stir the solution with nothing but a glass rod. All city
                                        water coming from reservoirs contains organic impurities, but they are generally
                                        not of an injurious character, being merely " pond life. " A safe precaution is
                                        to boil all drinking water. This will destroy any organic germs it may contain.
                                        It must, however, be said that the cholera microbe is believed to be able to
                                        stand a much higher heat without being destroyed.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Hall's journal of health" TEIform="index"/>Hall's Journal of Health </bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Some persons are capable of making great sacrifices..."

                            manifested by the Brethren which made the toi's of this laborious passage pass more
                            pleasantly. On account of the low water great care had to be exercised in managing the boats
                            to avoid the rocks and the logs that se largely blocked the passage. At noon, Sept. 25th, we
                            reached the Ohio River and soon landed for the night. We passed Diamond Island the 27th and
                            landed for the night fifteen miles below Red Banks. A heavy shower fell on the night of the
                            27th and our camping ground was all afloat. For a few hours our situation was very
                            uncomfortable, but the rain ceased at about nine o'clock A. M. when we pushed off and came
                            within sight of the town of Henderson before sunset. We had learned of the movements of the
                            " Press Gang, " and were not over anxious about leaving our boats till late in the day. We
                            landed safely in the evening and at 10 o'clock P. M. entered the encampment of the
                            Believers. As we had no covering to our boat, all our goods were thoroughly drenched, and
                            for a while we were kept busy in restoring them to order. All hearts were made glad at the
                            arrival of Brother John Woods from Union Village. He was the messenger of love and
                            encouragement. The church at Union Village had sent him to bear these good tidings. Samuel
                            G. White also arrived the same day with a message of love from the Believers of South Union.
                            The ministration of these good gifts was very refreshing and was received by all with great
                            joy. On the 80th, six of the Brethren returned to Busro to attend to some unsettled
                            business. Those at the encampment put our tents in order, and attended to the care of the
                            sick as best they could. Our hearts were saddened when we realized how we had been cast out
                            from our beautiful home at Busro, from our fruitful fields and well tilled gardens, to make
                            a weary pilgrimage of hundreds of miles, which could only be through great anxiety of spirit
                            and severe toil of body. We remained at this encampment till the 9th of October, and then
                            made preparations to renew the journey. While at this place we had word from home and of the
                            depredations committed on the place by the unorganized militia. The Church at Union Village,
                            under whose direction we were marching, had arranged the programme for the remainder of the
                            journey. We were to move on to South Union, Logan Co., Ky. a distance of 112 miles from Red
                            Bank: then on to Pleasant Hill, Mercer Co. Ky. 140 miles from South Union, and then to Union
                            Village, Warren Co, Ohio 150 miles farther. The " Press Gang" that took our horses, when on
                            their way to Fort Harrison, had now returned them to Busro. James Brownfield was one of the
                            company selected to return and secure the horses and household goods that had been left at
                            that place. He went on horseback. The horses we secured and loaded with such articles as
                            were most needed by the Believers at Red Banks. While this company were absent others were
                            splitting shingles and making a roof to our large boat, for the better protection of our
                            goods while ascending the Ohio river to Cincinnati. On the 7th, Joel Shields and James
                            Veeley arrived from Pleasant Hill with two, five horse teams. By them we received some 1500
                            lbs of flour which was a great blessing, as we had been unable to obtain sufficient, even
                            for the sick. The gift of love and blessing from our kind gospel friends was also very
                            highly appreciated. Arrangements were now made for the continuation of our journey, and on
                            the 9th inst the wagons, foot people, with the sheep and cattle took up their line of march,
                            leaving the Elders and several other persons to wait the arrival of the Brethren from Busro.
                            All were anxious to leave the encampment as we were hourly in dread of the return of the
                            "Press Gang, " and this constant fear made our encampment more or less like an imprisonment.
                            So soon as the company that traveled by land had left the place, the boats were made ready
                            and on Sunday morning, the 11th, pushed out into the river. We will now follow the first
                            company, and they unfortunately met with an accident early in the day by the overturning of
                            one of the wagons. As no one was harmed, nor any-<pb n="165" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/>thing broken the
                            carriage was soon righted and again moving on the road. After going a distance of seven
                            miles we encamped for the night. The next day we traveled thirteen miles, but this was
                            attended with a great deal of difficulty on account of the poorly made and very muddy roads.
                            A heavy shower on the 11th gave us a thorough wetting, and made the roads almost impassable.
                            One of the wagons was overturned which added much to our burden. That nothing was broken in
                            these accidents was a source of much satisfaction. A large part of the night was spent in
                            feeding the fires and drying our wet clothing. As a whole it proved to be a very
                            uncomfortable night for the rest. Our next failure was in a yoke of oxen. Their strength was
                            exhausted and this obliged us to procure a span of horses to take along the load. The next
                            day we spent an hour searching for the oxen that we had so kindly released from the yoke. So
                            soon as these were found we moved on, and before night were again most thoroughly wet by the
                            fall of heavy showers. This subjected us to another night of broken rest and to a large
                            amount of work in drying the clothes. On the morning of the 14th it was still raining, and
                            our beds and wearing apparel were in a sad condition. The roads had in this time become
                            extremely muddy and slippery, so that it was with difficulty that any of us were able to
                            proceed. Seven miles only was the length of the journey for this day. At night we obtained
                            shelter in the house and mill of a man by the name of Wilson. He was very kind to us in
                            making this free will offering, and also in providing an enclosure for the stock. For this
                            blessing we had abundant reason to be thankful. On the morning of the 15th Matthew Houston
                            and Samuel White from South Union, drove into our camp having in charge six horses. Several
                            of the Brethren and Sisters now set off for South Union at which place their services were
                            needed. Near noon of this same day we met James White and lloberi Gray from South Union who
                            had come to us with a load of provisions, and among these were some of the largest sweet
                            potatoes we had ever seen. Before the close of the day a heavy shower fell upon vis, so that
                            we could build no fires till after midnight. We fortunately found shelter for the sick and
                            for the children in a meeting house which afforded them a very comfortable shelter. Those
                            that regained in the woods had but little rest during the night. The drying of our clothes
                            occupied several hours. We left this camping ground the next day at eight o'clock but had
                            not proceeded far before a wheel to one of the wagons broke down. The repairing of this was
                            attended with some difficulty on account of our peculiar situation. Xine more horses were
                            sent to us from South Union, which proved a great blessing to some who had traveled so far
                            on foot. On the evening of the 17th we reached Jasper Springs (South Union) and were
                            received in all kindness by our beloved gospel friends. Every thing was arranged for our
                            comfort, which we received with thankful hearts as it was the first place in which we had
                            found any rest since the 15th of Sept. We remained with our dear friends three days, and
                            found time to shoe our horses and to repair some of the wagons. Others found employment in
                            various ways that proved profitable and very needful. Eld. Peter Tease of Union Village
                            accompanied by three other Brethren met us at this place and brought to us barrels of bread
                            and biscuit; a large supply of boots and shoes and also other blessings. By advice it was
                            thought best for some thirty persons to remain for the present in South Union, and in this
                            number was included many of the sick and feeble. The Brethren also concluded to leave the
                            sheep at this place. Early on the morning of the 20th preparations were being made for a
                            continuation of our journey. After taking a kind and affectionate farewell of our beloved
                            gospel friends, we marched to the road and proceeded on our way toward Pleasant Hill. It
                            proved to be a rainy day. The road became very muddy and the traveling was disagreeable. We
                            reached Big Barrow before night, a distance of fifteen miles, but succeeded in crossing the
                            river with only half of our wagons. On this account we were obliged to encamp on both sides
                            of the river. The next day we traveled sixteen miles. It pleases us to remark that we are
                            now find-<pb n="166" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> ing better roads and that the weather is more favorable,
                            which blessing we fully appreciate. Nothing worthy of special remark occurred till the 26th
                            when we were obliged to travel in the rain and found the roads very muddy and disagreeable.
                            For several days we averaged about fifteen miles each day. On the 28th one of our wagons
                            broke down. The load was distributed to the others, and as the carriage was well worn we
                            concluded to burn it, and save the iron for future use. For the first time on this journey
                            we were obliged to face a cold north east storm. We arrived at Pleasant Hill at 2 o'clock
                            1'. M. on the 21)th of Oct. where our good friends received us very kindly and treated us
                            with Christian friendship during our stay. The sick received the best of attention, and all
                            of the company were refreslied and rested as far as circumstances would admit Louis Willhite
                            of Union Village met us at this place, and in his carriage we found additional
                            accommodations. We left Pleasant Hill on the 31st crossed the Kentucky River and encamped on
                            the hill just four miles from the Shaker Village. On the 2nd of Nov. we passed through
                            Lexington and Georgetown and then encamped for the night. Our journey the next day was over
                            a very hilly road. Heavy showers fell on the 4th and the roads became slippery and the
                            walking \ery unpleasant. At night we found but little rest, and the rain prevented us from
                            building our fires. The morning found us wet and our clothes well bespattered with mud. Our
                            journey to-day was twelve miles. We suffered another cold north storm and were obliged to
                            remain in our wet clothes all day and through the night as the fire-wood was so scarce. On
                            the 8th we met Elder Issachar Bates and John Wallace of Union Village. They came to
                            accompany us to their home. We now moved on with increased zeal and crossed the Ohio river
                            in the ferry boats, and all landed safely at Cincinnati. After continuing our journey about
                            five miles farther we encamped for the night. The roads still continue to be muddy, but as
                            we were anxious to see the end of our pilgrimage, we hurried on and at night encamped at a
                            place only six miles from Union Village.

                            fire, getting up steam in about ten minutes. The oil is thus consumed without any wicks,
                            steam is often raised in five minutes. No smoke is made, no soot. A match puts fire in full
                            blast instantly. 9th. There is a diaphram so arranged as to control the steam so that an
                            even amount can be carried, according to the work required. Thus, suppose 100 lbs of steam
                            is required, set the diaphram so that the pressure of steam will put out the fire at 105 lbs
                            pressure. This diaphram is absolutely an automatic fire regulator, the first practical one
                            ever invented. It is also an absolute safeguard against over pressure in the boiler. Besides
                            this, for double guard, there is a safety, or pop valve. 10. There is an automatic water
                            regulator, so that if the water supply is sufficient this regulator will always keep the
                            proper supply in the boiler, being another safeguard against accident. 11. There is a. water
                            glass, so that the amount of water can always be determined ; this is located close by the
                            pump. 12. A very important feature is a practical automatic oiling apparatus, so that all
                            parts of the engine are oiled without the necessary care otherwise necessary attending it. "
                            The Shipman Engine Co., aforesaid, have dealt so nobly and generously with the Shakers
                            relative to the introduction of the aforesaid engine, (which, being among the first set up
                            was attended with some difficulties, but which, at length, are all overcome,) that we
                            publish this notice for the benefit of all who may see the same, and desire a small
                            practical power. The same is published without the knowledge or solicitation of the company,
