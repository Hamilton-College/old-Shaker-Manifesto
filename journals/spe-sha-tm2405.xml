Superiority Dobbins' Electric Soap, first made in 1869
has been imitated more than
any other soap made, because
it is better than any other.
If every woman in the land
knew for herself the actual
quality of this soap, no other
washing soap could be sold.
Millions do use it. Other
millions have never tried it.
Have you? If the millions
that use it are right, you
ought to use it. It they are
all wrong, one trial only will
demonstrate it to you, and
you will go back to the use
of some strong soda and rosin soap, that costs you a
cent or two less.
for yourself, in your own
laundry, by your own servants, the great economy
of using Dobb;ns' Electric Soap. You don't have to take our
word for it. But be sure, in making this

                            buggy for Union Village, O. They intended to go through Green River and Hartford, and after
                            securing a place for Elder John on the cars or in a steamboat Br. Jefferson would return
                            with the carriage. The condition of the country, however, so frightened them, that they
                            hesitated to go farther, through fear that Elder John could not get back. Some of the
                            officers told them that they could go on to Louisville, but could give no assurance of
                            getting through the lines on their return. After some further consideration they concluded
                            it would be for the best to return to their home as soon as consistent. At Morgantown they
                            met with a company of Union Cavalry under the command of Col. Burbage. They also met with a
                            company of northern Infantry under Capt. McHenry, who gave them a pass on to Hartford. While
                            on their return homeward, they met about three hundred Confederate Cavalry in pursuit of the
                            Union soldiers. Oct. 31. Elder John Rankin and Br. Jefferson Shannon reached home in safety
                            not far from six o'clock, p. m. Their return was a surprise, but gave us great pleasure, and
                            we were interested to inform them of what had happened during their absence. It was on the
                            same day they left home that our horses and wagons were taken from us. To Br. Jefferson such
                            news was ill news and he appeared to be astonished, but Elder John accepted it very calmly,
                            as though it was no more than he had expected. Nov. 1. Lieutenant Col. Campbell with eight
                            pickets rode into the VilMAY<pb n="102" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 102 THE MANIFESTO. lage and asked the
                            Brethren for a place for themselves, and one for th'ir horses over night. They were directed
                            to the Trustees' Office, where the men were kindly cared for, while their horses were taken
                            to the barn. Soon after and during a heavy rain storm, Capt. Level with seventy-five Cavalry
                            calied for shelter, and then informed us that they would stop during the night. This company
                            of seventy-five men were sent to the West family, where they could occupy the new laundry
                            and some other buildings. A supper was furnished for both companies. For their horses they
                            had taken the cow barn without liberty, as the herdsman was away. The cut feed that had been
                            prepared for the cows, they fed to their horses, so that the poor cows were obliged to stay
                            out all night in the rain, and be deprived of their supper. In the morning Capt. Level and
                            his company appeared very grateful for the kind treatment they had received at the hands of
                            the Brethren, especially for being so well sheltered from the storm. They remarked that on
                            the night previous they passed through Russellville, and were obliged to pitch their tents
                            in the dark, as the citizens would offer them no shelter. One man who had promised to let
                            them sleep on his hay mow, securely locked his barn before they arrived and would not let
                            them enter the building, and yet he was a strong secessionist and a pretended friend. One of
                            these poor fellows remarked:�"I wish I was at home," when his companion replied, "I guess
                            you will never see your home again." This company was marching to Bowling Green to report to
                            the General at that place. We now found that we were to all intents and purposes in the land
                            of "Dixie." The western part of Kentucky is now under the control of the Confederates and
                            this includes our (Society. Nov. 18. John C. Breckenridge with Ms brigade passed through our
                            village on their way to Russellville. He had five regiments. One of Cavalry and four of
                            Infantry. They went to Russellville to guard the Legislature that had assembled in that
                            place to form a provisional government for Kentucky. It was sad to see so many human beings,
                            who ought to be engaged in the service of their country, marching toward the battle fields
                            to meet their brother man in deadly conflict. Some were under great excitement and gave wild
                            cheers for Jefferson Davis, while others appeared very thoughtful and depressed. Not less
                            than one hundred and ten wagons passed our home laden with tents or provisions. When the
                            Confederate army under General S. B. Buckner, took possession of Bowling Green, one of his
                            soldiers hauled down the United States flag and then, to express his utter contempt, stamped
                            the flag under his feet. While engaged in this act he fell from the building and broke both
                            of his legs. In a few days he died and, no doubt, received the reward of his works.<pb n="103" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 103 Dec. 9. Capt. Taylor called upon us very early in
                            the morning and asked us to have breakfast ready at eight o'clock for two hundred and fifty
                            Cavalry that had camped during ttie night some eight or ten miles distant. Two of our
                            families united and prepared the breakfast as best we could in the limited time afforded us.
                            The Brethren carried the food to the West family and spread the tables, with which the
                            soldiers seemed to be well satisfied. We us; d Sassafras bark for tea and burned rye for
                            coffee. We also gave them a good supply of milk, and these were probably as good for them as
                            tea from China or coffee from Java. Soon after breakfast the whole company moved on toward
                            Russellville. Dec. 10. Capt. McLamore with one hundred and fifty Cavalry entered one of our
                            fields to rest and to eat their scanty allowance. The Captain called on us for forty pounds
                            of bread for his men, and a dinner for himself and four of his officers. Most of these
                            soldiers were poor Kentuckians. They were tired and hungry and did not seem to be reconciled
                            to their condition. We baked more bread than was ordered and on taking it to the Captain he
                            very gruffly remarked, "I only ordered forty pounds." The Brethi'en who had carried a good
                            supply of apples to the soldiers told the Captain that they would be very modi rate in their
                            charge. Dec. 12. John McLean, our Trustee, made a trip to the Southern States to sell some
                            garden seeds, and to purchase a quantity of sugar with the Confederate money he had
                            received. Prosperity attended Br. John on his journey and he returned with a good supply of
                            sugar. Some of this he could spare for the neighbors and receive for it good U. S. money.
                            Dec. 19. The southern pickets Cavalry, rode into the village at about seven o'clock p. m.
                            and called for supper to be prepared for four hundred persons. The order was to have it
                            ready by eight o'clock. We informed the officer that we were unable to^ provide for so many
                            in so short a time. He then said we could cook for one hundred and twenty-five. All the
                            available help was soon engaged at the family dwelling and the food was in readiness at the
                            appointed hour. The soldiers, however, had not arrived, and we waited until the hour of
                            midnight when, instead of one hundred and twentyfive, the company uumbered five hundred
                            tired and hungry Cavalry men. We did the best we could under the circumstances, and all
                            might have shared in the food if the commander had attended to his duty. After all the food
                            which was supplied to this company had been eaten or pocketed, another company of thirty
                            soldiers came and asked for a supper and said they had not eaten anything during the day. In
                            pity for the poor men, the Sisters were induced to prepare a supper for this midnight
                            company. The Captain had the soldiers enter the dooryard as carefully as they could, that
                            others might not be disturbed and the food was carried to them as they lay on the ground.
                            After this company had been kindly cared for, the Colonel informed the Brethren that two
                            hundred more soldiers were coming who were just<pb n="104" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 104 THE MANIFESTO. as
                            tired and hungry as those who came first. The Brethren, however, insisted that the Sisters
                            were not able to do any more at the present time and after a consultation this last company
                            went on to Bowling Green. Dec. 27. A company of iifty-h've Cavalry fYom Louisiana called and
                            asked to be accommodated during the night. The men were provided with a supper, and in the
                            morning with a good breakfast, and theii' horses also received kind care. Dec. 31. Six
                            Cavalry pickets called for breakfast. This was soon provided. The company then remained near
                            the premises till noon and a dinner was sent them. In the p. m. twenty-one more soldiers
                            asked for accommodations during the night. A supper was furnished and then a house in which
                            to sleep, and in the morning a breakfast was sent to them. Nine others belonging to this
                            same company were accommodated at the railroad station. We learned that this company was
                            sent out to guard the highway and also the railroad.

TEIform="persName"/>By Martha J. Anderson.</byline><p TEIform="p">BY kind invitation of the Rev. Carl G. Horst, the liberal Unitarian minister of Pittsfield,
                            Mass., a company of three Brethren and six Sisters of the North Family of Mt. Lebanon, held
                            a meeting in "Unity Church" on the evening of the 20th of February. There had been a series
                            of Tuesday evening services, at which several prominent clergymen of various denominations
                            had occupied the pulpit, each giving an account of the origin, progress, and good work
                            accomplished by the societies and organizations to which they belonged. The broad-minded
                            idea of instituting these meetings, was for better acquaintance, to strengthen the bonds of
                            fraternal love, and awaken an interest and desire to know more of the various phases of
                            thought and belief, that build up sectarian barriers, and separate churches from associative
                            work along the lines of organized effort for good. The evening we occupied the platform was
                            the seventh of the consecutive gatherings; besides ourselves, only the Salvation Army had a
                            dual representation as speakers. "Unity Church" is an unostentatious little edifice, erected
                            three years ago opposite the "Catholic Church," which is as much more imposing in appearance
                            as it is in ceremony and ritual. The antipathetic contrast seemed a strange paradox, but no
                            less strange did it seem that in one hundred and eighteen years, this was the first time
                            that our neighboring townspeople had invited "Believers" to speak in one of their
                                churches.<pb n="105" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 105 While we were waiting in the
                            minister's study for the appointed time, we unitedly felt an impression to kneel and ask the
                            blessing of God and the good ministering spirits, that we might be able to impart the word
                            of life, and the spirit of the testimony which uplifts and saves. (We afterwards learned
                            that the same gift of prayer, was simultaneously shared at home, especially by the beloved
                            Ministry.) When we were escorted to the platform surrounding the pulpit, every seat and
                            aisle of the sanctuary was crowded with a most respectable audience. Over five hundred
                            persons were gathered and many stood during the entire services, while others could not gain
                            entrance. The meeting was opened at half past seven by the pastor of the church, who is a
                            most earnest, devout, and whole souled man. He passed through the simple preliminary
                            exercises of their own service, consisting of congregational singing, the reading of a short
                            chapter from the New Testament, with responsive scriptural selections, and the taking up of
                            collections. After a few kindly and congratulatory remarks, in which our friend said that he
                            was happy to have the honor of being the first to invite the Shakers to speak in Pittsfield,
                            he introduced Elder Daniel Offord, who replied briefly, tendering thanks for the kind
                            invitation extended, and appreciation of good feeling made manifest in the gathering of so
                            large and intelligent an audience. After reading and singing the hymn, "Conquering Legions,"
                            Elder Daniel gave a very interesting historical and doctrinal discourse, interspersed with
                            passages of scripture, in proof of the essential life and spirit of Christian teaching as
                            exemplified in our Order. He spoke for half an hour. After singing "The Savior's Promise,"
                            Eldress Anna White stepped forward, and with her usual unassuming manner and frankness of

                            had stood for an hour, the dropping of a pin could have been heard, so rapt was the
                            attention. Referring to our long acquaintance with the citizens of Pittsfield and the
                            friendly relations existing between us ; the thread of her discourse was taken up on the
                            life, character and mission of Jesus, the "perfect Jew," the "Messenger of the Covenant,"
                            the "Christ Anointed," and uthe first born among many brethren whom he came to redeem ;"
                            showing that through his travel in the regeneration he made it possible for all to attain
                            the high estate of redemption from sin and the bondage of the flesh. "Be ye perfect even as
                            your Father in heaven is perfect." She spoke of the revelation of the maternal spirit in
                            Deity, and the inspiration that guided Mother Ann Lee, the founder of our Order in her work
                            and mission of establishing the second Pentecostal Christian Church, whose foundations were

                            Peace, United, consecrated labor, and home centered interest. Sister Catharine Allen, the
                            enthusiastic President of the "Self-Improvement Society," gave a brief sketch of the
                            progress made by our people in things material, intellectual and spiritual during the
                            century of our existence as a compact religious body. Her account of the organization of the
                            home circle for individual culture, the acquisition of knowledge, and unfoldment of the
                            spiritual faculties through encouragement, mutual assistance and continuous effort on the
                            part of those who seek membership, was interestingly set forth. Br. Charles Greaves was
                            introduced as the Deacon of the family, which he said, implied that he was absorbed in
                            material things. He made some very pleasing and telling remarks. After giving them some
                            credit, for closing the saloons, he advised them not to progress backwards. "We are called
                            Shakers," said he, "because we are shaking off old habits, sins and customs that do not tend
                            to our progress in the spiritual life, nor enhance our happiness and peace of mind. The
                            world needs the shaking work to rid itself of the great evils and errors, political, social
                            and religious that are dragging the bodies and souls of humanity down to the lowest depths
                            of degradation and crime." � "There was a time when a good whole souled Quaker could stir up
                            the country for twenty miles around with his testimony of righteousness; but there came a
                            change; a state of apathy and coldness rested upon them, and it took the people for twenty
                            miles around to wake up a Quaker, and I fear it will be so with the Shakers if we do not
                            arouse ourselves. Though our numbers are few, we would be all right if we are true and do
                            not marry, as do the rest of the world." He called upon them to investigate our principles,
                            and then come and live, not as wage slaves, but as Brethren and Sisters, toiling unselfishly
                            for the good of each other; there were many vacant places for willing workers in shop, field
                            and garden. The selection, "My Weary Heart Hath Found a Resting Place," was then sung.
                            Sister Cecelia De Vere, whose father was a Land Reformer and an Editor of marked ability,
                            claimed the attention of the audience by her earnest appeal for righteousness and reform in
                            all the departments of government, labor and social life. She spoke feelingly of the present
                            suffering among the poor, who were landless and homeless, because of the greed and avarice
                            of monopolists. She referred to her early experience among reformers who sacrificed fortunes
                            and even life to ameliorate wrong conditions and the unjust rule of those who bartered
                            honor, justice and virtue for gold. There were grave problems that must be met before long,
                            if we would not see repeated, the revolutions of the past. "Christian Love," was sung, and

                            hours and a half, as the clock told the hour of ten, we concluded to withdraw an article
                            that had been written for the occasion. The minister who had been an interested listener,
                            spoke a few congratulatory words, expressing gratitude for all that had been so well said,
                            also thanking the patient audience for their kind attention, and the meeting was dismissed.
                            Many friends gathered around to speak of their appreciation of the good meeting they had
                            enjoyed. Our company were conducted to the church parlors, where we found a table daintily
                            spread with wholesome refreshments, prepared by the ever thoughtful Martha's of the
                            Unitarian Society; which proved a needful repast as we had an eight miles ride to take over
                            the Berkshire hills, and down a dangerous mountain pass, over icy places; but the bright
                            moonlight and calm atmosphere, with the feeling of satisfaction that our meeting had made a
                            good impression, shortened the long distance, though the clock struck one as we retired to
                            our well warmed and lighted rooms, where loving Sisters were awaiting us. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            years, became impressed with the mission of the Christ spirit, with which Jesus was
                            baptized. At fifteen, I received faith in Mother Ann Lee, as being an instrument in God's
                            hand, through whom, the second manifestation of Christ upon earth was revealed. Though I
                            never had particular belief in woman's rights, I was convinced that she was the first to
                            assert the right of woman to all the offices and privileges of man in the New Creation. I
                            searched ancient, ecclesiastical history, beside more modern works, in order to convince
                            myself that I had made no mistake. As the result of all this research, questioning and
                            prayer, I found that I was not mistaken, and from that time forward, have done all in my
                            power to uphold the life and testimony of our Mother. Since this revelation, many women have
                            stepped forward to assert their rights in governmental as well as social life. It is my firm
                            belief that the light which has directed them in their noble work of redeeming woman from
                            the tyranny of the flesh, proceeded from the divine revelation and the righteous example of
                            Ann Lee and her followers. Through this revelation, the Shaker Church was established in
                            perfect order. It is based upon the principles of Christianity as taught by Jesus Christ

                            her brothers in all the relations and regulations of the Community. I also believe that the
                            light and power of this revelation, will go out to the world and cause many souls to accept
                            the gospel, leading them to renounce a life of bondage to come into the freedom of a
                            spiritual life. We read,�"They that are accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
                            resurrection, neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in
                            heaven." The clause,�"as the angels of God in heaven," impressed me much as a youth, and in
                            order to become one of this number, I renounced the life and relations of the world and
                            joined in spirit as well ss in body, the company who lived the virgin life. There has been a
                            peculiar ministration which has followed me all my life, which I am confident, has proved a
                            saving power. Often, when taking a false step, it has arrested my attention with these
                            words,�"William, you are wrong, go no farther," and obeying this admonition, I was led in
                            the path of right and dut}'. From early days, I have found it safe and have established as a
                            principle in my mind, to seek counsel of those godly persons who are able to guide me
                            aright. Having proved the benefit of following their advice, I can recommend the same course
                            to the youthful and inexperienced. All souls may not be able to accept a call to the Higher
                            Life, in time, they live too near the animal plane to appreciate the joys found in a
                            selfdenying life. This having been my call, Brethren and Sisters, I will with you, through
                            all time, be a consecrated worker for Zion and her interests.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Aspiration" TEIform="index"/>ASPIRATION.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Reed, Calvin G."

                                thankful than I can express that after many long years of waiting I have found an honest
                                co-worker on this Coast. As regards locality, I think your suggestion of forming a
                                society in the center of the state is good and that it would be more successful in many
                                ways. The people here seem to run in cliques, while all that I have talked with seem
                                very friendly. I have had several tell me that they would like to join a society and
                                would put in what they had ; but as we did not have a society here at that time they
                                have gone over to the Theosophists. I think as you do about having a home to offer
                                people. It will require all the strength, both physical and mental that we can get
                                together, to be successful in this work, and I do not want the word failure in it, I
                                shall write, this evening, to my people at Watervliet, N. Y., and also send your letter
                                as you have expressed your views of the work better than I can, and ask them to show it
                                to the Ministry and see what they think of it. There is a great amount of fruit raised
                                near here and a canning factory would probably be successful. I lived in Oakland for
                                twenty years so am familiar with that portion of the state. I feel that we can not make
                                any definite plans until we hear from the Ministry and as soon as I receive an answer
                                will let you know. Did you join the Society while at Canterbury? Hoping to hear from you

                                occasionally. I am interested in The Manifesto, and think it is rightly named, because
                                it tells all about your home life, which to outsiders, speaks much. It shows your
                                adherence to Christian principles, and social order and discipline. There is no purity
                                where peace dwells not. The fruit of unity is loving service. The foundations of modern
                                society are out of course. Conformity to fashion and the rules laid down by those who
                                are in the tide of worldly pleasure, shuts out the simplicity that shines with lustre in
                                a truly virtuous character. But, it is as the wise man saith, the end of all is "vanity
                                and vexation of spirit." If people were more eager to speak and spread the truth,
                                instead of discussing the forms of doctrines and creeds of the various sects, there
                                would be more of the true spirit of religion in the earth and not so much infidelity.
                                Man is prone to wander from the known into the unknown, hence, from light into darkness.
                                The teachings of the Master are plain and simple. "Deny thyself of all ungodliness take
                                up the cross daily and follow me."<pb n="111" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. Ill This is a
                                selfish, grasping age, the lust of money and the greed of power, overrule the love of
                                righteousness, and the desire to do good. "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after
                                righteousness for they shall be filled." There are but few who share this blessing.
                                Disunity and confusion prevail in the political, industrial, and social systems that man
                                has inaugurated. The time has not come when the Lion and the Lamb can lie down together
                                and be led by a little child; neither has woman found her just place and position as
                                man's true help-meet in every sphere of life. There will yet be a renewal of heavenly
                                strength and God will make manifest his power, through those whose lives are upright, to
                                the pulling down of the strong worlds of satan. It gives me great pleasure to hear from

It is the "King's highway" to the holy
                            City. It is the life principle that develops the true manhood and raises the man above the
                            common elements that rest upon the earth. "God is Love,'" and this certainly, should afford
                            a legitimate stimulus for every person to obtain that which will in the ultimate make him
                            godlike or like God. Without the gathering of this element of love, into the soul, there can
                            be but little effort made for the advancement of others. The very life of self-denial must
                            be drawn from that active principle of Love which stimulates us as we work for our own best
                            interests, to work also for the happiness and prosperity of those who are around us. If God
                            is Love how can it be possible for true sons and daughters to exist without a manifestation
                            of the same spiritual elements ? Jesus was so fully absorbed in this theme that he made it a
                            special lesson to those who accepted him as a Teacher. "By this shall all men know that ye
                            are my disciples, if ye have love one for another." And he even went still farther than this
                            as he gave his lessons of admonition to his disciples. Not only love those who love you, but
                            said he, "Love your enemies." A test of this qualitv was an active work for God. In the life
                            of estrangement which had been taken by man, there must have been a sad departure from that
                            which was godlike. While nature stood first for a life on the earth and largely for the
                            earth that was with man in common with everv other creature, it was the one ahsorbinotheme.
                            The love for self began to be more anxiously caressed than was the love for God. Men loved
                            the creature more than the Creator. Paul in his exhortation says that "love endureth all
                            things." But as singular as it may seem it required a term of some 4000 years before an
                            apostle was called who could speak this simple fact before the people. New lessons are not
                            generally projected till the. mind is prepared to receive them. In that age when Might was
                            held to be Right, and when brute force was the ruling passion, or even at a later date when
                            humanity had advanced so far as to say, We will only demand an eye for an eye and a tooth
                            for a tooth, it would have been like striking against the air, to have asked the people to
                            love their enemies as they loved themselves. They knew quite well what it was to hate their
                            enemies and to inflict injuries upon them, and even to destroy their lives. But we are now
                            living in a better age. A deeper love for humanity<pb n="113" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 113
                            is being manifested, and instead of having the story of one good Samaritan, they are now
                            multiplied by the hundreds. The light that came into the world at an earlier date and the
                            light that is spreading in the world to-day, is destined to accomplish most wonderful
                            results. The disciples are in no doubt upon this subject. God can not be other than love,
                            and God's love must rule the world. All outbursts of cruelty or of sensuality are from
                            abnormal conditions, and although leading to the destruction jf persons and property, can
                            never be the dominant power of the human race. The Christian life, so fully and beautifully
                            manifested in the evangel of Jesus, was a light for the humanity of the whole world, and its
                            influence to a greater or less degree has become universal. Through this light the
                            brotherhood of man is being much better understood than in earlier times. To embrace this
                            brotherhood and concede to all humanity the same rights and privileges that we enjoy so
                            pleasantly for ourselves, is the only highway upon which the several nations can
                            advance-with hopeful success, and even this is only preliminary to the life of Christ where
                            the test is put directly at the front. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples
                            if ye have love one for another." The lesson was so simple that it could be easily
                            understood, and all could enter at once, into the formation of a new life. In this love for
                            God, the life becomes illuminated and the Christian's duty is brought forward in all the
                            clearness of the noonday All forms and protestations of goodness fade away like the mist
                            before the sun, under this test of true discipleship. The same light that shone on the
                            apostle must also shine upon us and enable us to testify with him : �"If we love not our
                            brother whom we have seen, how can we love God whom we have not seen?"</p></div2><div2 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The chewing or smoking of tobacco..." TEIform="index"/>

                                Center Family. April, 1894. We are having some blustering weather for April, the few
                                warm days of March made us all feel that spring had come to stay, but April proves to be
                                the "true March." The health of our family is quite good at the present, very few colds.
                                Our aged Sister Ehoda Blake, is in good health for one so far along in years. She is
                                still able to do much for herself. Brother Alonzo Hollister is better in health than he
                                has been for a year past. Our Brethren are doing some grafting of both apple and plum
                                trees, also cutting off the black knot which has become very troublesome; We have a few
                                early chickens but the cold weather is very disagreeable to the little downy things. If
                                the bad weather continues our chances for early vegetables will be small indeed. If it
                                does not kill the fruit buds they will be saved through a special act of Providence. Our
                                Sisters have not begun "housecleaning" yet, so our Brethren will not have any trouble in
                                dodging a "Woman's weapon" in the hands of some energetic housekeeper. E. M.

                                time has worn steadily on and with the feathered creation, we are constrained to sing of
                                the glories of the advancing spring. Of March we can make no just complaint, as his
                                roaring, piercing blasts, generally sweeping with unrestrained vigor through our domains
                                seemed somewhat tamer than usual. He gave us a lively visit only now and then, bringing
                                sufficient force to blow away all noxious gases, accumulations from the remains of
                                decaying vegetation which might have proved detrimental to our well being if not
                                dispersed. Thus through this advantage by careful discipline in dietetic habits, and by
                                an observance of hygienic laws which pertain to the development of a good spiritual as
                                well as physical condition, we are pleased to say that the health of the family in
                                general has been maintained. If the cheerful attractions of our Canaan home have proved
                                inefficient to draw to us people of more mature years, we are not destined at present to
                                fall short of numbers as there are continual applications for the admission of children
                                into our Order. Some, no doubt, are necessitated through the conditions of the
                                prevailing hard times and others through an expressed desire to have them disciplined by
                                higher and purer forces than those operating in the world at large. Under such
                                circumstances within the past three months we have taken seven children ranging from
                                three to thirteen years of age, and our only desire is that Sis they advance in years

                                everywhere who are daily striving to further the gospel work, and our hearts' best
                                feelings go out to the faithful few who are now engaged in spreading the gospel in
                                California. Our Sister Cornelia R. Powers and her son of San Diego have been earnestly
                                engaged in this work for several years past. They have been very desirous
                                ofjjestablishing a Community of Believers in that land, and it looks as if the time has
                                come to have their prajers answered. In a letter from Sister Cornelia dated Nov. 26,
                                1888, she says, "I have so often thought that it would be one of God's highest blessings
                                if we could have one of your Communities here where for so much less hard labor you
                                could have much better returns, and there are so many young people who are in need of
                                such instructions as they would receive from you." And from that time on, she has
                                continued to strive for the conversion of souls to the Shaker faith and principles, we
                                have sent her Believers' publications and The Manifesto, and she has been faithful to
                                distribute them. We hope for Bro. Dowe and Sister Cornelia much success in their
                                missionary work, and if we can not do much at present for them, we can at least pray for
                                and encourage them in their efforts for good. There is one thing sure, nothing is gained
                                without a sacrifice, and blessed are they who are willing to work for humanity's good by
                                giving up all for Christ's sake and the gospel. May all Zion's inhabitants awaken to the
                                needs of the hour for certainly "the harvest is great and the laborers are few." Let not
                                our lamps go out for want of oil, which is the testimony of eternal truth against the
                                evils, that would lower the standard and drag us back into the vortex of worldliness and
                                sin. Let Zion offer a universal prayer, that the Pentecostal Spirit may again descend
                                and baptize us with fire and the Holy Ghost. Let us pray in faith, for it is written,
                                "Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto you." Let us persistently
                                knock at the gates of heaven, until they are opened, by confessing a^id forsaking our

                                April. 1894. Our daily life should be that which enables us at times to pause and
                                consider the momentous question,�What are we living for? We hope that it is not to have
                                the "mark of the beast" placed upon us by serving self so supremely that we forget our
                                duty to our fellow creatures. Br. Alonzo's definition seems on reflection correct;
                                though we had not thought to consider it in that light. Br. Arthur W. Dowe's suggestion
                                shows a desire to help the poor and oppressed; but would need great judgment in
                                directing it. We fully agree with Elder Oliver that, first this should be a home for the
                                soul, a place for those who are tired, not merely of the external conditions of human
                                life, but weary of the lusts of the flesh and the mind, are willing to obey the
                                injunction fully to "come out from among them that ye be not partakers of their sins."
                                Those who are willing to obey this spiritual command are welcome to all of the temporal
                                blessings. The month of March was exceptionally fine. Very few stormy days. At present

April 1894. Farming began in earnest in April. We are putting in some
                                soiling crops for our milch cows. These need a variety of feed, and respond to such care
                                in a pleasant manner. The farmer ought to study the conditions that will bring success
                                to his business. At the present time there is more scientific knowledge applied to
                                farming than ever before, and good harvests show the results. We sowed rye last fall to
                                be cut and fed in the barn as early as possible. Oats and peas are the second dainty
                                dish as soon as pastures begin to fail a little. There is a great deal of albuminoid in
                                peas. Corn fodder, oats and peas, fall feed then barley sowed early in July. May the
                                cows furnish us with plenty of milk. We are sowing twelve acres of oats and peas some
                                for early feed, green, some for hay and some to ripen to be threshed for grain which
                                will save buying nitrogenous feed. The haulms of the peas are equal to good timothy hay
                                if cut with dry corn fodder. We have sowed some early garden seeds, and wait in hopes of
                                a taste of the good things there. We were just getting ready to sow oats when last night
                                a heavy snow storm set in and is still with us. Having had April in March, March comes
                                in under the name of April. This will no doubt retard our farming. The fruit trees are
                                neatly trimmed and now patiently await the spray pump. Spring work of housecleaning is
                                rapidly advancing. The blessing of health is desirable in our little circle just now.
                                Our good Elder is confined to the house with slow fever of the typhoid type accompanied
                                with malaria, in January. We hope he will soon recover and be in usual health again, as

                                will not wear away; they are abiding and they supply happiness in time and in eternity.
                                Would we lay up lasting treasures? Let us begin now. This is the harvest time. Let us
                                use it to do deeds of goodness, righteousness, purity, truthfulness, which shall bless,
                                not only ourselves, but others. It is well to have faith in God, but He is not going to
                                overcome our inward foes, that is our work. Are we in our duty? Virtue speaks the same
                                pure, refining language to all. The true and virtuous are childlike, angelic, and Christ
                                said, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven." Let us exemplify in daily life that which is
                                pure and true. Remove the blot of sin's dark stain, Then truth and virtue will remain.

                                than usual, and unless the spring is cold and backward, there is prospect of an early
                                harvest. The maple harvest is finished, and we have had about five hundred gallons of
                                syrup from our two orchards. Our contract for corn-planters is about completed, and we
                                have orders for twenty-five extra machines. The next large job of work is a yard full of

                                surprised by the announcement of Elder Abraham's resignation from the Eldership of the
                                Church. It was also announced that, of choice, he would spend the remainder of his days
                                at the Society in Canterbury. To many who have been blest with his care and
                                ministration since childhood, the change seems but one degree short of a visit from the
                                "Angel Reaper." However, we find a great source of consolation in the fact that he is
                                still spared to us; and though we may not be blessed by the benediction of his presence,
                                still we feel assured that his love and interest for the people in this part of the

                                acquaintances, and honored by all. We know that he goes among those who in years gone by
                                have been cared for and loved by him, and we feel assured that his declining years will
                                be spent in the peacefulness and quietude his long term of service so well merits. Our

                                pure and bright. Another month has gone and springtime is now really upon us, although
                                the weather does not appear much like spring, for it is snowing and the wind wails
                                mournfully without. Still we know that the brighter days will soon come, when all around
                                us will be clothed with beauty. As I am writing I hear children's voices singing;�
                                "Beautiful Brethren and Sisters too Loving companions so faithful and true." and I am
                                reminded of the treasure and blessing which we enjoy in our gospel ki ndred. The patient

                                as your love and care have been extended to us. For our aged ones we often sing the

April, 1894. The last number of The Manifesto is with us. The reading
                                matter is interesting and instructive, especially the article from Pittsfield entitled,
                                "The Shaker's Belief." We have been remodeling our laundry recently; the building that
                                it is in was badly out of repair, so we were obliged t &gt; tear the entire end out from
                                top to bottom and build anew. The building is two stories with a basement and the amount
                                of old brick that had to be cleaned before they could be used in the new wall was
                                immense ; but happily that is a thing of the past, and it will not be many days before
                                the house will be as good as new. The weather has been so changeable that we are not up
                                with our spring work as we would like to be. To-day April 6, is very chilly with
                                indications of snow. Had a very cold season two weeks ago that killed almost all our
                                fruit. The thermometer was down to 18 deg. below freezing on the morning of March 28. We
                                were blest by having the Ministry with us for a few days. Had the opportunity of
                                listening to one of Elder Oliver's excellent sermons last Sabbath day, week. We have had

                                in any 24 consecutive hours, 70. N. A. Briggst. April, 1894. "While the earth remaineth,
                                seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall
                                not cease." Those who accept this promise need not fear as the heat and the summer and
                                the harvest are sure to come. Already, new life is springing forth and little patches of
                                green grass m ly be seen, in some favored places, and the buds on some of the trees are
                                hurriedly giving signs of renewed life. The robins and bluebirds and swamp sparrows have
                                also returned to their northern home, very much to our pleasure. The snow has quite
                                disappeared, and the ice in the ponds, although still covering the whole area has so
                                wasted away that safety for neither man nor beast can be assured any longer this season.
                                The managers of our large kitchen garden, are now arranging the hot beds, and will soon,
                                no doubt, be able to plow and plant for the coming summer harvest. The sawing and
                                splitting of several hundreds of cords of wood for domestic purposes, is progressing but
                                not wholly accomplished. A nice herd of milch cows may be seen at the barn, which are
                                under the faithful management of Br. A. Bruce, who makes the estimate that not less than
                                fifty dollars worth of milk is used by our family each week. For several years we have
                                not kept any sheep as the t:&gt;\vn has been more interested in dogs, and the sheep could
                                not be protected. In the Plome Notes from Enfield, mention was made of the removal of
                                Elder Abraham Perkins to the Society in Canterbury. As it was his own choice to enter
                                this new home, where he has many dear friends, we are pleased to extend to him a loving
                                welcome and wish for him a happy extension of many days, after his long and faithful
                                service in bearing the burdens of the Societies of both Canterbury and Enfield. N.

                            girl of twelve or fifteen years, she solemnly consecrated her life and her all to God, and
                            during her long and useful life she has never once faltered in that holy consecration. The
                            writer has been acquainted with her for some sixty years and through all that long period
                            has recognized the same unflinching loyality to her vows of sacred devotion to her God and
                            her faithful pilgrimage in the path of purity, charity and self-abnegation. Her faith and
                            loyalty to her religious convictions were of that sterling stamp "which works by love and
                            purifies the heart" and which can never fail, "till it bring forth judgment unto victory."
                            Though in this our day such are invaluable to the Church and their loss almost irreparable,
                            yet we are only too well aware that we can not retain them with us always. Our consolation
                            is that our loss though very great is yet their gain and having fulfilled the sufferings in
                            Christ which our Savior left as a legacy for all who should be accounted worthy to reign
                            with him, they enter that land of peace and everlasting consolation, "Where the wicked cease

                            and profitable visit with Elder O. C. Hampton, (He should rightly be named after Gladstone,
                            "the grand old man,") I sat down in my old arm chair to reflect upon our conversation. By
                            and by the clock on the bureau struck nine, and being somewhat weary I rose to retire, and
                            as usual, I knelt down and prayed, making new resolutions on this last night of the old year
                            for the next day and for the .New Year. I had a singular, beautiful dream which I consider
                            worth relating. Suddenly the sky turned a peculiar blue, the sun shone out in almost
                            dazzling brightness and the trees, thick with green foliage were filled with songbirds of
                            every conceivable shape, plumage and color. Honeysuckles and brilliant, crimson flowers, and
                            gracefully waving vines grew in profusion all around and the air was rife with their
                            fragrance. The roses were blooming and the lillies bending low, daisies, white as snow,
                            pansies, gold and purple and on their leaves bright drops rested which a fountain threw
                            around with a melodious, cool sound, rising up and falling gaily all the while. I sat among
                            the flowers, wondering how the buds could know what form and hue to grow and when to burst
                            forth into blossom, when a wild strain of music floated on the air, music sweeter than the
                            birds warbled, or the fountain played. Among the lillies and tulips, whose colors were that
                            of the rainbow, were forms of rare beauty, and the sunlight softly rested on each divine
                            face. They were all Shaker Sisters, but I only recognized one, that was Sister Emily
                            Hampton. I was so overjoyed at seeing her that I burst into a flood of tears. She smiled,
                            and laid her hand in blessing upon my shoulder, while in her other hand was a large crown of
                            pure, white lillies. I could hear her say very distinctly�"For if ye forgive men their
                            trespasses your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their
                            trespasses neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." I called aloud for Sister May
                            Ruth for I wished she might see Sister Emily, also, in her vision of loveliness, but the
                            moment I spoke those lovely beings all vanished and Sister Emily with the rest, but before
                            she passed from view she waved her hand gently and smilingly bade me "wish the whole
                            household a happy New Year, but remember me to Elder Oliver."

                            the pitfalls of sin. To be on the watch tower faithful as a sentinel, is wisdom. Once alfow
                            the adversary to enter your heart and you may soon be entirely his own. The slightest
                            tendency to wrong doing, left unguarded, will destroy your happiness. Groat danger lies in
                            neglecting to watch in little things. Watch yourselves as precious buds and plants, lest
                            evil influences destroy the lovely flowers of virtue and truth. Nothing but ceaseless
                            vigilance and virtuous living can save you from such a dreadful fate. Virtue is "the pearl
                            of great price," and those who possess it have true riches. Shun the malaria of vice, beware
                            when sins entice. Grief and trouble are the wages of sin. Evil proclivities, if not erased,
                            will take root in your mind, spring up and grow, and produce grief and condemnation. There
                            is so much comprised in being watchful. You must have the courage to live above impure
                            thoughts, selfish strivings and sinful desires, as very few do have. You must resist the
                            despotism, tyranny of wrong habits, or there is no safety. It blights the spiiit to live in
                            sin. Beware of "the flatterer's smile," is wise counsel. It is more difficult to expel bad
                            guests than to receive them. Strive for good that you may find, watch in heart, soul and
                            mind. You can not be too watchful. Oh this one word, watch, seems more weighty than all
                            others. Jesus said, "Watch," and well you may. Watching and praying is profitable
                            employment, and satisfying service. Your innocence can be protected only by unremitting
                            vigilance. "The still, small voice" is a reminder of these things. Be wise in the present
                            and avoid bitter experience later. Make strong resolutions and keep them. Find your solace
                            in adherance to duty. Strive for pure, victorious living. If I have said that which will
                            encourage you to more watchfulness, then am I blest and happy.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Orcutt, Daniel" TEIform="persName"/>Daniel Orcutt.</byline></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Spring" TEIform="index"/>SPRING.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bowers, Lucy S."

                                to maintain its purity. Its steadfast purpose is the same. There is the constant
                                condemnation of sin, and the same encouragement is given to all who desire to live a
                                virtuous life. The salvation it preaches is "the one tiling needful" the same yesterday,
                                to-day and forever. When 1 think of the great good our periodical has done and will
                                continue to do to lost humanity, my feelings overcome me and I say, God bless The
                                Manifesto. I can not find words to express the gratitude welling up in my heart, so I
                                send you the overflow.

                            </head><p TEIform="p">The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for April contains an abundance of matter
                                both of a general and personal nature. The frontispiece is a copy of probably the finest
                                portrait of Gladstone extant. An exceptionally powerful and brilliant defense of
                                Phrenology, entitled "Brain and Mind Composite," is from the well-known physician, Dr.
                                H. A. Buttolph. This will be of especial interest to critical and philosophical
                                �students. Dr. H. S. Drayton contributes an excellent illustrated article upon
                                Graphology. Dr. Edgar C. Beall, in a phrenograph from a personal examination of Miss
                                Maud Lancaster, the English "Thought Reader," vouches for the honesty of the young lady,
                                who is said to be the most wonderful clairvoyant living. Prof. Sizer, in his series,
                                "How to Study Strangers," gives character studies of Gladstone, Lord Rosebery, Neal Dow
                                and others in his best vein. Mrs. Wells concludes the interesting reminiscences of
                                Horace Mann's relations to Phrenology. Considerable space is devoted to Hydropathy in
                                the department of Hygiene, and the editorial columns are as full as usual. The eminent
                                Canadian.clergyman, Dr. W. J. Hunter, gives his ardent endorsement of Phrenology,
                                quoting also the testimony of II. W. Beecher. In tbe Personal column handsome portraits,
                                with brief, spicy character sketches, are given by Dr. Beall, of Senators Hoar and
                                Bland, ex-Senator Platt and Mayors Gilroy and Schieren, of New York and Brooklyn. 15

                                days a score of years ago feel that our powers are altogethe r inadequate to the demands
                                upon them when we are confronted with some knotty point in grammar or a more serious
                                difficulty in mathematics. We can only sigh helplessly over our inability to throw any
                                light on the subject, and feel strongly that it was the duty of the teacher to have
                                explained the problem so as to make it clear to the juvenile understanding. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Types and scenes from the midway plaisance" TEIform="index"/>

                                demolished and exploded so many times, and the process has required such frequent
                                repetitions that people hesitated about abandoning the old book at the bidding of an
                                anonymous pamphleteer." One singular feature about the Bible History is that so much
                                reverence should be given to the Book, and then such a hatred manifested by all
                                Christians to God's chosen people who wrote the Book. Published by H. L. Hastings, 47
