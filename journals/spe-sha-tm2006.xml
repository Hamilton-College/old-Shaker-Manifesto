                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 12.</head><p TEIform="p">The Tailors. Fortunately for the Society an experienced workman was accepted as a member, who
                            was able to do the cutting, and take charge of the making of most of the garments. The
                            manager, David Slosson, accepted several apprentices, and some of these after becoming
                            proficient in the business were sent to other Societies to assist them in the same line of
                            business. These early teachers had but few, if any, rules in printed form, and the
                            apprentice was obliged to acquire his knowledge by observation. In 1825 the tailors began to
                            work more by a system of rules, and since that date many marked improvements have been made.
                            GARMENTS. The early Believers accepted the simple, plain form of dress that prevailed among
                            the common people of the world, and laid down no rules that should govern the Societies in
                            this respect. The first American converts were extremely varied in the form, color and
                            quality of their garments, but as they became more associated and united they inclined more
                            to a uniformity, and were influenced largely by the manners of the first Elders. After the
                            organizing of the Church the uniformity of dress became a matter of much more consequence,
                            and they adopted for the Sabbath, a dark blue coat, with a cape that came up to the neck,
                            and lay upon the shoulders. Cuffs to the sleeves were six inches long. Pockets were cut at
                            the waist and a large lid covered the horizontal pocket. The front edge of the coat was
                            nearly straight, having some six or eight buttons of an inch in diameter, and button-holes
                            three inches long. One half of these were for ornament and no place was cut through the
                            cloth. On the back of the coat, at the lower extremity of each side seam, was a large double
                            fold or plait, taking about three inches of cloth and folded twice. At the waist, on the
                            back, was a large "square stitching" three or four inches long, and about one fourth as
                            wide, and a button at the head of each fold, and another button at the bottom of the skirt,
                            which came a few inches below the knee. The vest was from the same cloth,<pb n="122" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> the waist falling a little below the natural waist. The skirts were about seven or eight
                            inches long. In front these were cut off to an angle of about forty-five degrees, from a
                            point at the lower button. In the back, the skirt was divided into two sections, which
                            overlapped each other one or more inches. The whole of the vest was made from the same piece
                            of cloth. If the front was broadcloth the back would be of the same quality. A row of twelve
                            buttons were arranged in front, and large pocket lids were set to the waist line. The lower
                            garment, especially for the Sabbath and for journeys, was black-lasting breeches which ended
                            a little below the knee, these being supplemented by long black stockings. A row of four
                            buttons ornamented the suit at the knee, while the breeches and stockings were secured in
                            their proper places by a strap and a large brass buckle just below the knee in front. As the
                            sleeves of the shirts were made large and very long, a blue silk ribbon, under the name of
                            "sleeve tie" was fastened around the arm just above the elbow to secure them in place when
                            the coat was laid aside. The covering for the neck was called a ;'Stock." This was made of
                            some very stiff material about two and one half or three inches wide and covered with white
                            or blue silk, and fastened by a buckle on the back of the neck. The white stocks were
                            generally worn on the Sabbath, and were considered a part of the uniform, while the blue
                            were for more common use. In 1810 the white stocks gave place to white cotton, linen or silk
                            neckkerchiefs which are used more or less at the present date. (1858) The wearing of stocks
                            was the general custom of the da}? and many of the portraits painted at that time will give
                            a much clearer impression of the style. The hats were made of fur or wool, with low crowns,
                            about four inches high and brims five or more inches wide. These generally were colored
                            black. The form of the hat has undergone some slight changes during the past forty years,
                            and the crown now measures about five inches deep and the brim four or four and one half
                            inches. The children generally wear caps. The shoes were made of calf-skin and fastened with
                            straps and shoe buckles. The foregoing was generally termed the "Sunday Suit," and was
                            preserved in the Society as quite necessary for several years. For more common use, trowsers
                            generally were worn, especially when engaged in manual labor, but the cloth was of a poorer
                            quality and colored with a cheap dye. Surtouts and great coats were made for those who
                            needed extra garments .while on their journeys. The same provision was made for boots,
                            overshoes, socks and mittens. Gloves were seldom seen. This form of dress continued in use,
                            without change till the year 1805. The Society was now resting on a more permanent
                            foundation, and had been blessed with an experience of some eighteen years. From the first
                            the Believers had been studying the<pb n="123" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> advantages to be derived from the
                            principle of Christian economy and utility, in all that pertained to a life in the
                            Community. At this date, the breeches and long stockings were laid aside on the Sabbath and
                            the plain trowsers were substituted in their place. For several years, however, after this
                            proposed change, individuals might occasionally be seen, who were on a journey, dressed as
                            formerly, with long stockings, and with highly polished knee and shoe buckles. (to be
                            continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Kindness" TEIform="index"/> KINDNESS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Whitcher, Mary" TEIform="persName"/>Mary Whitcher.</byline><p TEIform="p">Who treats the weaker with neglect, Or cruelty doth show, Hath not for God or man respect But

                            have spent their lives in the endless round of outward observance. If their lives have been
                            unloving and unworthy, they will hear these awful words, "Woe unto you Scribes and
                            Pharisees, hypocrites; depart from me, I never knew you." The chief end of a virtuous life
                            is to give us as near a resemblance as is possible to the divine nature ; to make us pure as
                            He is pure. It is to raise us to the utmost degree of purity of which we are capable. To
                            defer this work till old age, is to resolve to be as unlike God as possible. It is indeed,'a
                            weak assurance that old age will help our deformity, and give us a good resemblance of Him,
                            and in an instant confer upon us purity of spirit after we have wilfully passed over our
                            whole life in wrong doing. How strange to think that when the purest part of life has been
                            prostituted to vice, that the dregs can be a fit offering for our Maker, and that He will
                            accept of such a sacrifice. It is, then, our best wisdom to walk the paths of virtue in the
                            morning of our days, that the evening may terminate with a smiling serenity, and wing its
                            way to the regions of unmolested security.

                            Why go to the ant? Rather let the Brethren, at least, go to the Sisterhood, not alone to
                            learn industry but also to learn order ; to have a place for everything and to have
                            everything in its place. Let them go into the apartments of the Sisters, and see the system
                            of things. Lamps, tables, chairs, books, and then all the little niceties that make up the
                            "work table;" everything in order and in its place. And much of the order that is existing
                            in Brethren's rooms is the result of Sisters' thought, Care and labor. Go into the kitchen,
                            and observe the absolute cleanliness attained. Food is cooked, not spoiled. And three times
                            a day meals are ready to a single minute. In the year, hardly a variation. Let Brethren note
                            all this, and they �will learn the secret of why the Sisters are more spiritual than their
                            Brethren, and why, in numbers, they are more sure pillars in the household of faith. The
                            Elder Sisters keep the gift� "hold the fort." It is woman's day. The Divine Mother of all
                            sentient beings, who has been hidden from the sight of carnal eyes, for ages and seons, is
                            being revealed : because human beings are less carnal�more spiritual�humanity progresses. On
                            the other hand, the Brethren intervene between woman and the rough, crude elements�human and
                            material�and shield them, so that they can work in safety and peace ; even as woman
                            intervenes between the uncouth, rough male element in the Brethren, and the angel element in
                            the spiritual world. God's house is a house of order. Organization is operating throughout
                            creation: the ant exhibits the law: what can be more perfect than the arrangement,
                            governmental, of the ant-hill or beehive ? In human affairs, perhaps, the military
                            organization exceeds all others in perfection; is it not singular that such should be the
                            case ? Is destruction, rather than construction, the ruling power? It appears to be so, thus
                            far in human history. What is histo-<pb n="125" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> vy but a record of the master
                            minds of the race contending with each other for place and power over the ignorant masses,
                            who are kept in ignorance, that they may thus become helpless tools in their hands ?
                            Education�the key of knowledge� must be assumed as the first duty of government. All
                            children are born equal in ignorance and helplessness ; let them be as equally educated out
                            of that ignorance. Keep all children in public, industrial, self-supporting schools, until
                            twenty-one years of age ; first as learners, then as teachers. Let there be no place found
                            for unrepublican class schools, high schools, academies, colleges, in the great American
                            Republic; unless you want it to become a great military despotism, ending in monarchy. Let
                            the public schools contain all grades of scientific knowledge and branches of learning known
                            to humanity ; and be equally accessible to every child of the Republic. Is there not
                            something approximatiDg this system in China and Japan, and is there not a hint of it in

                            neglected in this branch of the "little things." How often from want of thought and
                            attention, do we see people, really kind people, fail to make others happy or comfortable.
                            How often do we see, in families, those who would do anything to oblige each other if the
                            matter were a great one, such a total neglect of the little kindnesses of life, that by
                            degrees they become selfish, and are unable to perceive wherein they fail, or that anything
                            else ought to be expected of them than what they perform. How often do we hear
                            kindly-feeling, well-intentioned people regretting that they can do nothing, that they have
                            nothing in their power,�while all the time, these little kindnesses are unnoticed and
                            unperformed. Life affords but few opportunities of doing great services for others; but
                            there is scarcely an hour of the day that does not afford an opportunity of performing some
                            little, it may be unnoticed service. Careful and earnest attention to little things of this
                            kind, is of great advantage to our own characters. We can seldom perform little kindnesses
                            without little self-denials ; and the habit once formed of daily attending to others, and
                            trying to please and serve them, is of inestimable use in repressing our natural
                            selfishness. It is n command in Scripture, that everyone should "please his neighbor<pb n="126" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> for his good to edification ;" but it is a duty oftener neglected than
                            trying to serve others. Amongst the many ways of doing this I mention kind consideration of
                            the peculiarities of others. There are few families where there are not some members who
                            require to be studied a little, and if the "peculiar one" be the head of the house, or an
                            aged member of it, this attention is generally paid. But how often do we feel it hard to be
                            the one that must always give up ! How apt wre are to be provoked at the peculiarities of
                            others, instead of endeavoring to forbear, and please them rather than ourselves ! There is
                            much want of knowledge of each others characters to be met with in families, and from this
                            sometimes, proceeds the careless indifference about pleasing them; the study of characters
                            may be apt to lead us into critical and censorious thoughts and feelings ; but if we study
                            others, that we may best know how to please them, and make them happy, it cannot be
                            otherwise than a profitable study. Let us remember young friends the sacred duty of giving
                            pleasure, by doing little kindnesses, that it may be practiced daily. And, if we could but
                            feel what a sacred duty it is, surely we would wish and endeavor to make and find
                            opportunities of practicing it! Is it not a sacred duty to make life as happy as we can to
                            those, who are enduring the heat and burden of the day ? And is it not so still more to the
                            aged, who perhaps have little to cheer them ? and who may have suffered and undergone much
                            during the weary days of their pilgrimage. Let us seek out opportunities, let us slight
                            nothing as too trivial or minute,* if it may give pleasure to others. Do not, because you
                            can do so little for others, do nothing. Look around you, and see whether there be not some
                            one whose burden you can lighten, whose little cares you may lessen, whose little wants you
                            can gratify. All must be done cheerfully, as if it were a pleasure, not merely a duty ; and
                            above all, we must never allow anyone to feel or see that we have made any sacrifice of our
                            own will or wishes on this account. South Union, Ky.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sarah F. Wilson, Dear Friend;-- For the past few weeks..." TEIform="index"/>

                            the "Signs of The Times," and being anxious to know if you receive them regularly, I wTrite
                            to enquire respecting it. I hope that you have received them all, and that you have found
                            them interesting. Doubtless you .have noticed that one especial object of the paper, is to
                            call its readers to the subject of Christ's second coming. The l&gt;ible abounds in prophecies
                            and promises relating to this event, really there is nothing in the Bible more definitely
                            promised than this. Jesus said, "I will*come again." John, xiv. 3. Now if he should come in
                            our day, how important that we should understand about it. To be sure we cannot know the day
                            nor the hour, for Jesus said so, but in the same connection he says that we may know when he
                            is near. Matt, xxiv., 36. xxxii., 35. If you<pb n="127" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> desire the paper longer, I
                            will be pleased to send it for a time, I send them free, only actuated by a desire to place
                            before others, what to me seems of great importance. In your perusal of this paper you may
                            have noticed subjects which are of special interest to you, if so I should be glad to send
                            you reading matter upon them. If it would not be asking too much, I would like you to send

                            valuable papers �"Signs of the Times," also came promptly, more so than my acknowledgement,
                            for which please accept many thanks. I have enjoyed the reading much, and am deeply
                            interested in some of the subjects treated upon. The reason in part of my delay in writing
                            was, I wished to give you some knowledge of my and our religious views, but hardly felt
                            competent for the task, as they are so unlike those of many Christian sects. I would inform
                            you that I am a member of a Christian Community of "Believers in Christ's Second
                            Appearing,"�that it has already taken place ; having evidence of the divine revelation by
                            actual experience. "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be
                            of God," &amp;c. John vii., 17. We look upon this very important event in a different
                            light from many who express their views on the subject, or from the religious world in
                            general. We do not look for Jesus, the Christ, to come literally; but Christ, (Savior,
                            spirit,) of whom Jesus Christ said,�"I am the resurrection and the life ; he that believeth
                            in me though he were dead yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall
                            never die. Jno. xi., 25, 26. "They which are accounted worthy to obtain that world and the
                            resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage." Luke, xx., 35. And "In
                            the resurrection," (in Christ) "they neither many nor are given in marriage ; but are as the
                            Angels in heaven." Matt, xxii., 30. Beautiful thought! worthy aspiration to become like the
                            angels of God in heaven ! in the present life; they "are as the angels." This is the
                            resurrection that we aim at and are working for;�a resurrection from dead works, from the
                            sinful condition of the world, actual or inherited ; with faith and confidence of obtaining
                            it. We have no formulated creed to confine us to a belief of thus and so, rendering a member
                            liable to penalty of being excommunicated if not fully endorsed verbally. We may be free to
                            believe what in our judgment seems reasonable and consistent with enlightened Christian
                            development;-�not as libertines in the bad sense of the word ; while the life and deportment
                            should be above reproach ;�evidencing an exceeding righteousness : Yet we have our by-laws
                            and rules to chasten our conduct and social relations as Broth-<pb n="128" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> ers
                            and Sisters in a Community. And all are expected to conform to these rules, for protection
                            and harmony. The foundation principles of our Order,�principles of the Christ-life,� are, A
                            Virgin life, Separation from the world, (not as ascetics,) Confession and repentance of sin,
                            and Community of Interests, i. e. United Inheritance, to be enjoyed by all the members
                            ;�conformity to said principles being required of all claiming full churoh membership. For
                            nearly a hundred years some seventeen Societies formed on the above principles, having "all
                            things common," after the pattern of the Apostolic Church, have existed in the United
                            States. These Societies containing from one hundred to six hundred each are divided into
                            Communities or families of a dozen to two hundred persons of all ages from eight or ten to
                            one hundred years. These families are of different grades ; novitiate for such as are not
                            prepared to enter into covenantal surrender and consecration of self, property and services
                            ; others for members more fully developed in knowledge and experience of the tenets and
                            manner of life enjoined. We are led to believe in a duality of the divine Parentage,�Father
                            and Mother, God ; we might say, also, Christ Father, Christ Mother. God said, "Let us make
                            man in our image, after our likeness,"�So God made man in his own image ; in the image of
                            God created he him, male and female created he them. Gen. i., 26, 27. Further: "For the
                            invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
                            things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead." Rom. i., 20. The term
                            Bridegroom,� a title conferred on Jesus, suggests the necessity of a Bride to complete the
                            figure. If children cannot be born into the earth world without both father and mother, how
                            can they find birth into the New creation of God without a spiritual parentage, father and
                            mother ? The second appearing of Christ in a female, which we happily indorse, gives us a
                            spiritual Mother to complete the Heavenly Parentage. Just here let me quote from the "Signs
                            of the Times" of Sept. 9th., J. H. Waggoner writes: "The second appearing of Ch rist is
                            figurative or spiritual and has already taken place." This statement coincides with the
                            doctrine that we the Shakers, or Believers advocate. Jesus being the first anointed son of
                            God on whom the spirit descended and abode, ushered in the first Advent; so we hold that Ann
                            Lee was the divinely anointed pioneer in the second Advent. Not casually, but through a
                            baptism of fire and the holy spirit, became the fit instrument in the hands of God to
                            receive and transmit the revelation. The subjeet is a great one. As a Church we have several
                            works upon the same. I will mail one to your address with several copies of the Manifesto
                            published by our Society. A^ith kind regards I am, Respectfully,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilson, Sarah F." TEIform="persName"/>Sarah F.

                                    Cried straightway out, for his heart was moved, "It is our risen Lord� Our Master
                                    and our Lord!" Then Simon, girding his fisher's coat, Went over the nets and out of

                                    longer his heart to cast Like an anchor into the sea� Down deep in the hungry sea.
                                    And the others through the mists so dim, In a little ship came after him, Dragging
                                    their nets through the tide: And when they had gotten close to land, They saw a fire
                                    of coals on the sand, And with arms of love so wide, Jesus, the crucified! 'Tis
                                    long, and long, and long ago Since the rosy lights began to flow O'er the hills of
                                    Galilee ; And with eager eyes and lifted hands, The seven fishers saw on the sands,

                                    faith in our souls Is kindled just by the fire of coals That streamed o'er the mists
                                    of the sea: Where Peter, girding his fisher's coat, Went over the nets and out of

                                    you." Matt, w., 14. The one word that cancels the despair of the world is
                                    forgiveness,� Heaven's forgiveness of earth. Blot out this word, and all hope of men
                                    is dead. All other mercy, all other grace avail nothing if forgiveness is denied. A
                                    vast volume of guilt and penalty hangs over our entire humanity which this word
                                    forgiveness alone has power to lift. God's forgiveness is real and full; legal,
                                    moral and complete. The pardoned one suffers nothing in Heaven's estimation because
                                    of previous offences. The sinner is to the divine Fa-<pb n="130" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> ther as
                                    though he had not sinned. There is no trace of offensive remembrance left in the
                                    mind of the forgiving God. There is no bitter recurrence of the Divine thought to
                                    all the past, though the past be crimson with rankest guilt. There is no latent,
                                    lurking repugnance in the Infinite heart which circumstances may at any moment
                                    arouse into open and pronounced hostility. There is no concealed contingency in our
                                    Lord's forgiveness. The pardoned one may approach the Great Father's face with no
                                    painful fear that the recollection of his previous offence has preceded Mm. "I will
                                    forgive, but I cannot forget," is not Heaven's rule. The pardoned offence is
                                    expunged from the memory of God by eternal love. So does holy heaven forgive ; but
                                    what of sinful earth? This is the Lord's way of pardon ; what is man's ? Thus does
                                    the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit forgive us ; how do we forgive one another? To
                                    forgive after the manner that God forgives, is a superlative Christian virtue. It
                                    is'better evidence of a pure heart than ecstatic emotion, impetuous zeal, high
                                    pretension, apparent consecration or sanctification. Such forgiveness�frank, full,
                                    heartfelt and abiding, is the first-fruit and the highest proof of genuine
                                    soulcleansing. True Christian forgiveness is an actual burial of all unkind
                                    remembrance of the fault or sin committed, so that the offender is to us as though
                                    he had not offended. Napoleon said to an offending Marshal, who fell at the great
                                    captain's feet, "I forgive you, Marshal, but nevermore be officer of mine." But
                                    Napoleon and Christ are quite unlike. To the offending, profane, false, but
                                    repentant Peter, Jesus said, "Feed my sheep." Resume thy apostleship. It is all
                                    forgotten, Peter, "Feed my lambs." Be to my church and the world the great
                                    ambassador I meant thee to be when I called thee from thy fisher's nets. The chief
                                    purpose of my gospel is forgiveness. Go preach it, Peter ; and let my ready, free,
                                    full remission of thy weakness and sin make me dearer to thee, and thee dearer to
                                    me. Brethren, we are waiting for the opening splendors of a kingdom into which no
                                    breath, no taint of malice, envy, jealousy, or the least motion of evil feeling can
                                    be admitted. Do we not need, must we not have as a people, a general and sweeping
                                    forgiveness "one of another" before we enter the holy land? Must not these many and
                                    bitter animosities, that have riven this people asunder into clans and cliques, and
                                    ostracized sincere and accepted children and servants of the forgiving Christ, be
                                    washed out clean by the love of God before we can join the great Anthem of the
                                    redeemed. "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar : for he
                                    that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not
                                    seen?" "He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness
                                    even until nowV This strong language comes from the lips of the mild, loving
                                        apostle,<pb n="131" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> and is consonant with that other saying of John,
                                    "-And every man that hath this hope in him pnrgeth himself, even as he is pure." And
                                    this purification includes the entire eradication of aevery root of bitterness"
                                    every root; so that no germ of evil feeling remains. "Put on therefore, as the elect
                                    of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
                                    long-suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; even as Christ
                                    forgave you, so also do ye. And above all things put on charity which is the bond of
                                    perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye are also
                                    called in one body ; and be ye thankful."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/> Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Be honorable" TEIform="index"/> BE HONORABLE.</head><p TEIform="p">[Contributed by M.

                            spirituality. 2. It would lessen individual responsibility to contribute to the inspiration
                            and interest of the service; and we would soon lapse into mere lifeless forms. 3. It would
                            incline to foster pride and ambition in those who played and sang. 4. There would be a
                            tendency to class and caste, and the monopolization of the singing by a few, as no one would
                            feel liberty to sing only what the choir had selected, and there would be no impromptu
                            songs, in unison wiih any special ministration in the speaking, consequently, many would
                            miss the beautiful soul uplifting influences, that come through the gift of soul-full
                            expression in simple song. 5. The introduction of outside church music would soon supersede
                            the singing of plain melody, and there would be a suspension of all exercise in our
                            meetings. 6. As congregational singing gives all who have voice or talent, a part, and
                            conserves the community spirit of union, and Christian fellowship, should we not continue to
                            improve in it with simplicity, discarding the instrument, only as a help iu our practicing
                            meetings, or, for social gatherings ? 7. Feeling a genuine interest in the gift of singing,
                            and desiring vocal improvement for all, as the basis of soulfull, harmonious and acceptable
                            singing, we would prefer the cultivation of the voice in as perfect a manner as possible,
                            rather than introduce instrumental music in our assemblies for worship, as it inclines to
                            cover the voice anjd renders the words unintelligible to the listeners, and annoys, with a
                            lack in expression of sentiment. Let us "sing with the spirit and understanding also "
                            training ourselves to utterance proper, that the body of the assembly may be edified and
                            blest, with the sweet ministration of song. We are called to be a living people, and, if we
                            draw our inspiration from the Heavnns, whence the fountain of undying melody gushes forth,
                            we shall receive, through this medium, a power that shall satisfy our souls, and uplift us
                            to the sphere of pure delight, where we shall feel a union and relation to tve angelic

TEIform="persName"/>Jennie H. Fish.</byline><p TEIform="p">One Sabbath evening after the day's reading and writing had been laid aside and we were
                            quietly prepariug the mind for prayer service ; sweet music floated out on the evening air
                            from an adjoining dwelling. As I listened, I recognized a favorite melody, to the following
                            words : "I will call home the wandering, And hush their sighing ; To my fold they shall
                            come, And mourn no more.'' We had often sung these wrords, yet to-night they came home with
                            a new meaning. The wanderers, who are they? We had always in mind a dear brother who had
                            been loved, dearer than life, but who had strayed into the far West, and was perhaps without
                            home or friends, and the question had often arisen, Will he ever come home? Again we though;
                            of the many brothers and sisters who had wandered from home and who were dear to other
                            hearts. Is it not our duty to pray, work and sing for all the wanderers? VTe do not know the
                            temptations that may have been placed in their way, when the helping hand was withheld.
                            Certainly we caunot judge another, since "Every heart knowreth its own bitterness." We have
                            often read and been affected with the parable given by Jesus of the prodigal Son, and have
                            looked upon him as very wayward and sinful. He finally repented, and, as we like to believe,
                            turned from the error of his way. His father received him with joy. But what of his elder
                            brother, did he accept him with a Christian spirit? Ah, nay, the constant care and
                            protection of his parents, had made him selfish and jealous. He probably attributed his
                            virtue and seeming stability as nsuliiig from his own goodness, taking the merit, belonsing
                            to his parreuts, home to himself, thus feeling �ebove his younger brother. We do not need to
                            roam into a far country to become wanderers. There are many prodigals at home, who refuse to
                            obey the counsel of friends, ill-treat parents and guardians, and those who have borne extra
                            burden in the heat of the day, that they might find rest. It is very natural for si ch to
                            look out upon their brother or sister, who has wandered from home, as a sinner greater than
                            themselves. Let us not, therefore, judge harshly our fellowmen, lest we finally see that the
                            greatest failure lies at home. Remember the words of our Savior, wLet him that is without
                            fault, cast the first stone." Canterbury, N.

                                men and women, good will. The gospel testimony, so opposed to the military spirit of the
                                world, was preached in all its clearness, without fear at the time of the Revolutionary
                                War, or during the contest between England and the United States, which subjected many
                                of its advocates to a severe persecution. The revelation was from the God of Peace, and
                                made through the Prince of Peace, harmonizing beautifully with the voice of that same
                                God, as given in the ministration of the prophet, where he says ;�"God will teach us of
                                his wrays, and we will walk in his paths, for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and
                                the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. The people shall beat their swords into
                                ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks,�nation shall not lift up sword against
                                nation, neither shall they learn war any more." The glad tidings of the gospel of
                                Christ, which has been brought from heaven to earth, cannot find a resting place among
                                those who are contending with carnal weapons, for under the reign of the God of the New
                                Testament,�"all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." The children of
                                God are peacemakers on the earth. The Manifesto must also have in its mission the
                                fulness of the revelation of Christ;�The fatherhood and motherhood of God ; the divine
                                parentage, whose fostering care shall extend with equal interest over every son and
                                daughter. If this spirit grows into a living principle and inspires the soul to hunger
                                and thirst after righteousness, then we may look with increasing confidence for a coming
                                of the Christ, and no less for a dawning of the millennial age. Those who are anxious to
                                � see the revelation of a more beautiful, spiritual day, in which righteousness shall
                                stand in the advance, must purify their own hearts, "even as He is pure," that Christ
                                may come and take up his abode in the living soul. I'SIfS.nSS.<pb n="135" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>
                                Right, in the life of man, must triumph over wrong. The spirit of Christ which is the
                                light from God, must chase away all darkness, and the baptism of the Holy Spirit will
                                then wash away every stain, that has defiled the mind. Where we have solaced ourselves
                                by accepting a position as expedient under the circumstances, we must in a more thorough
                                self-examination bring the question directly home ;�Is it right ? Our success on this
                                pilgrimage to the city of God, demands that a standard be raised which shall fully
                                demonstrate the faith we have adopted, and the' consecrated life we intend to lead. We
                                have been most thoroughly assured, and that by good authority, that a man cannot serve
                                two masters, as he would incline to love the one, and to hate the other. Our only hope,
                                on the Christian's road to glory, is to be fully persuaded, beyond doubt, that we will
                                walk in the light which so bountifully comes from God. Jesus in his lesson of prayer
                                asked that God's kingdom might be established upon the earth, the same as it was known
                                to be in the heavens, and that God might take up his abode among men. We ask the same,
                                and in the fulfillment of this prayer are led to anticipate a growing interest in all
                                that helps to make men more and more as brothers of our Lord. There is a vitalizing1
                                movement along this line that serves to rekindle an inspiration in the soul, that cannot
                                . otherwise than ultimate in greater righteousness. Already a vast amount of good is
                                being developed throughout the whole earth, so that every habitable place has felt the
                                ameliorating influence of a more advanced civilization, and not less the ascendant moral
                                tone, that is spreading like the morning light, for the peace, prosperity and comfort of
                                all the sons and daughters of God. If faithfulness marks our path, and nothing less
                                valuable ever should, we shall insure the coveted reward of "Well done, good and
                                faithful servant," "for it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." We
                                should know with a certainty the duty which God lias assigned to us, and knowing this
                                duty, an answering righteousness and constancy is demanded at our hands. It is a nice
                                thiug to be able to pass an opinion, aud to be assured in our own mind that our opinion
                                is carried to the convincing point. The opponents to the use of instrumental music seem
                                to have it all their own way, even though their experience in its use has been very
                                limited. It is a pity that those who enjoy the harmony of instrumental music should be
                                judged as having no "real interest in our seasons of religious devotion." This form of
                                expression reminds us of the remark of a good brother :� "An organ" said he, "may assist
                                    those<pb n="136" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> who sing, and we may be sure that it will not say any
                                bad words, aud this is more than can be said of some who are good singers." If the
                                organist is so naughty as to be vain, it will be a wonder if some of those who have a
                                fine bass or soprano voice will uot be found in the same company. It has been said that
                                to sing in harmony has "a decided tendency to a dead formality," and possibly that may
                                be the case, and yet some of us would walk sorrowfully over the road, if obliged to
                                return to the manner of sinking of an earlier date.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mt.

                                clothed in beauty. The scenery of our mountain side viewed from the summit is grand. We
                                have had a very favorable spring for getting in crops; just rain enough to keep
                                everything in a fine growing condition. Some very warm weather which gave everything a
                                good start, then some cooler to toughen and make it pleasant for the teams. Spring
                                grains are looking splendid; and the garden vegetables are coming up finely. Nothing
                                more essential to the comfort of a family, especially of the vegetarians, than a good
                                garden and an abundance of fine fruit. With fresh vegetables, and all the small fruits
                                in their season, with the substantial grains, prepared without extracting therefrom the
                                bone and muscle forming material, give us a diet richer in nutriment and far more in
                                accordance with angelic life, than is a diet composed of fish, flesh and fowl. I hope my
                                young friends, who are laboring to develop the angel within them, will try it. But you
                                must not forget the preparation of the whole grain. This is the secret of satisfaction
                                on a vegetarian regime. Those who use exclusively bolted grains, must of necessity eat
                                meat, or feel dissatisfied. I have learned one of the causes of the lack of enterprise
                                in making public improvements, or private improvement when exposed to public view; it is
                                this; the more improvement the greater the tax, the larger the tax the more exertion to
                                raise the money to pay it. Is it not absurd that we should be fined for beautifying our
                                premises, or the public highways? But this is a fact. A neighbor of ours, bought a few
                                acres of bare land (of us,) some years ago, beside t^e public highway; the tax on it was
                                some two or three dollars. The fence was rather poor and the land needed some draining.
                                Phis man had worked hard and faithfully to buy the land and to build him a house.
                                Recently he has put up a very nice house, drained the land and put up a good fence ;
                                immediately his tax is raised many fold. I have heard that there are those who actually
                                let their buildings run down, and the fences on the highway become dilapidated just on
                                purpose to avoid the increasing tax. Until this system of taxation is changed for a
                                better one, public enterprise will be decidedly lacking. I am happy to know, there is a
                                mighty effort being made to effect a change, and that will give to every one the full
                                reward of his labor. To-day we introduced one of our number to our friends in the spirit
                                world�Sister Olive Walker. A peace-loving, scrupulously clean, and a very unselfish
                                spirit. What a glorious institution is that which is called death. To those who wear out
                                by honest consecrated labor devoted to righteousness, it is a glorious resurrection; but
                                those who rust out in selfishness, will find a field of labor to pass through they were
                                not expecting. Let the music roll. In kindest love, D. Offord. South. Family. May, 1890.

                                Our little family have planted eight acres of potatoes, just west of our dwellings<pb n="137" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> and the wood-chucks are so plenty that the boys are setting traps
                                to catch them. This morning "'Shades of Luben" told us something beside a wood-chuck was
                                to be looked after. Is it wicked to kill? Eldress Anna has been weaving long mats, from
                                pieces of old cloth, but old clothes come to an end and so did the weaving. Of course we

Lovely spring has again returned, and is bringing its beauties forth. The
                                cherry and plum trees are in full bloom. The garden is also in a prosperous condition.
                                As I sit by my window I can count fifteen rows of peas, twelve rows of onions, three
                                rows of spinach, and one row of radishes from two to four inches high. Potatoes are
                                coming up rapidly. It is a busy season for all who are able to work, both Brethren and
                                Sisters. The renovating of buildings has progressed well so far. Without notice we found
                                one of our cellars with three feet of water in it. An Edson pump was applied by three
                                men fours hours, and pumped out fifteen thousand gallons of clear water. It was then
                                found the well had received an accession, water flowing in at a rapid rate about two
                                feet from the top. Whether this is a living spring or merely surface water is at present
                                undetermined; if the former it might be utilized to raise our cream without ice,
                                although we were fortunate in filling both ice-houses in March. Our busy Brethren find
                                it a vexatious delay to stop in their great hurry to make a drain; it may eventually pay
                                for all the trouble however. Man should subdue the forces of nature to make them serve
                                him. Isn't that his destiny ? "Happy the man who foils an envious elf And turns the
                                darts of spleen to serve himself." We are selling our cream to the Somers' Creamery;
                                have had a twelve can Cooley creamery for the past year, the past month have added
                                another of six cans to supply present needs. M. Witham. No time to lose now. Nature is
                                springing to her work, and so must we. Day by day brings with it the round of duties
                                that do so much to sweeten life. Let us plan to till less ground and do it better. Do no
                                more than we can do well. Thrift comes from just that kind of work, so let us do our
                                best. Weeds grow just where we don't want them. They live on the food of plants. If the
                                land is rich, they draw hard on it with their rank growth. Plant food costs a great deal
                                of time and money. We bny it at a high cost. We must not be robbed of it by plants that
                                we do not want. Tares, whether in the field or in the heart, are the most easily subdued
                                when they first spring up. Grass is the great crop with us. More grass will keep more
                                stock, more stock will give us more plant food, more plant food will keep up the land
                                and give us some crop to sell. Fowls should not be fed day after day en the same diet.
                                To keep them in the best condition requires a change. They will eat nearly all kinds of
                                food and there is no reason why their tastes should not be consulted, especially as they
                                thrive best on a varied diet. D.

                                year which is to be no more. To begin our conversation, we will tell you that Easter
                                Sunday was observed in this place. Our Sabbath morning devotions were opened by the
                                reading of a chapter from the Episcopal Service. With the entire exclusion of the great
                                and flourishing display of floral designs, which is ever the leading burden of all other
                                churches throughout the religious world, we participated in a mightier and grander
                                offering, an offering of the never fadeless plants and blossoms, flowers created to
                                flourish only in the spiritual realm, to their increase and beauty there shall be no
                                end. Spring with its usual duties is again with us, and all around us Are fields to be
                                planted and meadows to be sown; Orchards to be caved for where sweet fruits are grown.
                                With plowing and hoeing from morning fill eve, With hands ever busy much good we'll
                                receive. Winter wheat all through the Genesee Valley is quite seriously damaged; the
                                upland fields appear somewhat more promising than the low land; warm days and cold
                                nights, as all farmers know (especially the western class) are most unprofitable weather
                                for wheat; it is far more injurious than constant freezing, even though the ground
                                remains without snow from November first till April last. The wheat fields through this
                                section of the Genesee, will at the present estimate, produce less than a two-thirds
                                crop, though we � may be agreeably disappointed. House-cleaning with its variety of
                                labor is just now one of the principal factors in our household economy; as the rainy
                                days go on a vacation we improve the sunny ones to the best advantage by renovating
                                carpets, mats, rugs and all such useful items that are repositories for dirt and dust.
                                Windows and furniture each in their turn are cleaned, and stoves are blackened and
                                polished to Ethiopian perfection. And when arranged each in its place, They'll envy not
                                the darker race. But the ceiling, Ah! the ceiling, On inspection there's revealing Dots
                                and dashes, numerous splashes Made by traveling insect might. All must be removed by
                                sweeping And the labor keep repeating, Till the dashes, dots and splashes Are removed
                                from human sight. While we strictly recommend practicing the wise old saying "Look
                                Upward" we must admit there are exceptions to this teaching. Here is one of them. When
                                your apartments are ready for the ceilings'and upper walls to be brushed, mark the
                                place, then close your eyes and proceed with your brushing, and so on till the walls are
                                thoroughly dusted; but if you must look up while the sweeping continues do not fail to
                                first shut your eyes tightly. By following this mild plan you can pass through
                                house-cleaning with eyes healthy and shining, undimmed by the falling dust or other
                                foreign obstructions. Summer birds are daily returning, but "Her Majesty's Grand Army"
                                the English Sparrows or pirates have taken up arms against the. multitude of superior
                                excellence and are yearly driving them from home and happiness. These English pets are
                                American pests. Who can devise ways and means for exterminating them? If they are
                                allowed to grow and increase as the "leaves of the forest" which they are year by year,

                                and an asparagus bed prepared with 1000 roots planted. One thousand apple trees have

                                "The Parable of the Sower." This subject fills my mind with many serious thoughts and I
                                ask myself, how can I receive the help and benefit that it is intended to give unless I
                                carefully read and reflect. It causes mo. to pic ture ia my mind two paths in life, one
                                pursued by the wise who are obedieat, and the other by the unwise who are disobedient,
                                and the joy and sorrow they bring upon friends by the choice they make. If by obedience
                                we strive to mould our lives to their counsel and instructions we insure a ten-fold
                                reward, which is the inward consciousness of doing right, and the blessing of God and
                                our kind teachers, who devote so much of their time for our benefit, striving to impress
                                upon our minds these beautiful lessons taught by our Savior. By disobedience we become
                                like the Avayside hearers whose hearts are hardened by neglect and sin,1 so that truth
                                makes no impression, and the wicked one represented by the fowls, plucks away the good
                                seed. "Our scripture examples are Pharaoh and Festus, so is the one who interrupted
                                Jesus while he was preaching to ask him to interfere and compel his brother to divide
                                the iuheritauce with him. If we become hardened as were the wayside hearers, the good
                                seed will find no soil in which to grow, the voice of conscience will be hut-hed and
                                thus step by step the downward course is taken. These reflections prompt me to make a
                                resolve that these beautiful lessons will not be lost on me while having this privilege
                                to learn how to devote my life to God in the days of my youth. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                there lived a man by the same name who had two sisters named Martha and Mary. Mary left
                                Martha to get dinner and do all the house-work while she spent,the time sitting at
                                Jesus' feet visiting him. Martha didn't like to do all the work, no more than I should,
                                so she spoke to Jesus about it and Jesus reproved Martha and told her that Mary had
                                chosen that good part which should not be taken from her. This meant that it was better
                                to stop and visit the Savior than it was to be so anxious about something to eat.

                                        ills which "flesh and blood is heir to." One would think when attacked with the
                                        wheezing, sneezing, coughing, snuffing disorder, that it ought to be given a
                                        Norwegian name of thirteen syllables, each beginning and ending with d or j. But
                                        since the evil "is abroad" and always will be, we deem it sensible, from effect
                                        to study cause and find a panacea. Since a cold is produced by the stoppage of
                                        the two million little pores of the skin, thus throwing into the blood two
                                        pounds of effete matter which should daily escape from these little doors, the
                                        first effort to be made, is to open them again. As soon as the first symptom of
                                        a cold appears, sponge off with tepid water night and morning, roughly applying
                                        friction with a brush or coarse towel to the whole body. On going to bed, drink
                                        hot lemonade, or some other simple remedy to induce a natural perspiration; and
                                        you can soon conquer even a severe attack with all its disagreeable effects. But
                                        should you desire a cold for an abiding guest, take alcoholic medicines, shut up
                                        in the foul air of a hot room, and by remaining inactive, your desire will be

                            Watervliet, N. Y. In all that time, 'mid all the world's experiences, that it has been my
                            lot to pass through, Mother's Gospel has sustaiued me. In that time I have met a great many
                            people and have always been proud to tell them what I knew of the loved Gospel Friends at
                            home, that they were the best people on earth, living and obeying the precepts of Christ,
                            and I know that if the people here could see and hear those precepts taught and lived '
                            there could be a very large and prosperous family established here. Already there are
                            sever/al who have said that they would be glad to live such a life but they cannot travel so
                            far as it is necessary for them to do now in order to reach a Community. I truly believe
                            that the time has come, and that this is the place that Mother meant when she said; "The
                            next opening of the gospel will be in the south-west; it will be at a great distance; and
                            there will be a great work of God." I have faith to believe that this will come true. Your
                            valuable "editorial" in the April number gives me courage to write this and I hope to see
                            the time when you w'll send missionaries into the world and they will have success and make
                            many converts. Some few grains of seed have been sown here and if some good missionary could
                            come the harvest would prove bountiful as the people now are in such a disturbed condition
                            that they are ready to accept anything that gives a promise of the betterment of their

THE MANIFESTO.
FREE EDUCATIONS FQF! GIRLS.
How Girls Can Get   a   College  Education   Without
Cost.
A most praise-worthy movement is about
to be set on foot by The Ladies' Home
Journal of Philadelphia. It purposes t >
give to any young girl of 16 years or over
who will send to it, between now ami January 1st., 1891, thi! largest number of yearly
subscribers to the Journal, a complete education at Vassar College or any other American college she may select. The educ.itiun
offered includes every branch of study, with
every expense paid, the Journal agreeing
to educate the girl irrespective of the time
required or the expense involved. To this
is also pir.n.'d a second offer which guarantees to any girl of 1(5 or over who will secure
1000 yearly subscribers before January 1st.,
a full term of one year at Vassar or any
other preferred c )llesfe, with all expenses
paid, thus making it possible for any number
of young girls to receive free educations at
the best colleges. Any girl can enter into
the competition, and any such can be thoroughly posted by simply writing to The
Ladies' Home Journal at 485 Arch Street,
Philadelphia. The management says that it
has been led to its generous offers by the
fact that there are thousands of parents
throughout the country anxious to educate
their daughters, and yet who cannot afford
the expense. This step helps to a comparatively easy solution of the problem, since it
throws a free education into the hands of
any bright and active girl. The Journal's
movement is one that certainly cannot be
too highly commended and praised.
BLACK BEAUTY.
I have sent a copy of ''Black Beauty,'' to
every member of our Massachusetts Senate
and House of Representatives and to each
master of the Boston public schools, also to
the superintendent and supervisors. It is
proposed to adopt it as supplementary reading in all our Boston public schools.
I am now�at an expense of over $2,000�
sending a copy to the editors of all newspapers and magazines in the United States and
Territories.
I have already invested nearly fire thousand dollars in the printing of 40,000 copies
of this book, and intend if I get the means
to invest not less than a hundred thousand
dollars more in the same way.
I want every man, woman, and child in
this country to read this book, and / ivovld
suggest that no rich man or woman who
loves a horse can possibly do a greater kindness to these faithful dumb servants, companions, and friends of ours than to follow
the example of M"s.  Wrn. Appleton, of Boston, by ordering a sufficient number, at a
cost of tirclve cents each, to gice one to even/
driver and teamster in their respective cities
and toicus.
In addition to the price the Society must
charg � on copies sent by mail eight cents ptjr
copy fti- puslagi-, etc., but when sent in considerable quantities by i xpn ss or tVe'ght it
costs much less. For i i-tmcv, the cost of
sending S00 coph-s the oth^r day to Cliieau1 t
by fast freight was only 84 <>.">; about h>Jfa
cent a copy.
At our Boston book and news stands itsells 'it 2~) cents a copy.
We ti in'c it would p-iy dealers in -ill onr
towns and cities to ord.-r a fi-\v hiitidivds at
12 cents a c >py. In all casts unsold copies
can bi' returned to us in good condition, andice ivill be glad, to refund the 'money paid., a.>
