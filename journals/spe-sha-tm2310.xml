No. 2.</head><p TEIform="p">In the progress of the above exercises of mind, when duty called me, and I providentially
                            fell into company with any of the religious part of the community, stimulated as we were, by
                            the then present excitement, our conversation would naturally turn on some religious topic,
                            but frequently on the new and interesting operations of the day. Having complied with every
                            duty as far as lay in my power, according to my apprehension, I obtained stronghopes that I
                            should attain to the end of my faith. On some occasions, when in conversation with some of *
                            the most zealous preachers of the day, my feelings would excite me to speak with pathos on
                            the necessity of living religion, on the depravity and degeneracy of human nature. They
                            discovering my views and anxiety on these subjects proposed that I should revise my former
                            reading, and suggested to me other scientific books, preparatory to being received a
                            probationer for the Ministry in the Presbyterian order. When I came to address the public,
                            to my regret, I discovered that my former zeal had subsided, my fervor was reduced to
                            lukewarmness, my lively views of the loss of man had become faint, and I felt shorn of my
                            locks, and my strength was wasted on language, science, and speculation on the letter. I
                            knew not what to do, in order to regain life and vigor. The revival had ceased and little
                            more than formality pervaded the congregations. About this time, 1796, I received an
                            invitation by letter from a friend in Tennessee, to visit him. On my arrival, to my
                            astonishment I found the inhabitants of the Presbyterian denomination comparatively a barren
                            waste in a religious point of view. In the month of Jan. 1796, I visited South Union, then
                            called "Gasper's River," and on the Sabbath preached to the people, also preached in the
                            vicinity of Russellsville, Nashville, Gallatin, and other places. In 1798, I returned to
                            Gaspers River and attended a four days' meeting. At this time I was under obligation to no
                            people, as my labors were a voluntary gift. I had no pecuniary contract for a single cent,
                            but supported myself and family from my own resources. In December of this year I moved to
                            Gaspers River, and became a teacher among the people. I labored in this place OCTOBER,<pb n="226" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 226 thp: manifesto. one half of my time and traveled abroad some one
                            hundred miles, where it had been arranged for me to preach. In August, 1799, the Kentucky
                            Revival began in earnest. Due attendance, serious attention to preaching, and solemn inquiry
                            what they should do to be saved, appeared to agitate the minds of the congregations
                            throughout. In the month of June, 1800, the principal members of the three awakened
                            congregations met together at the Red River meeting house, with large accessions of
                            citizens, and two preachers from the state of Ttnn. The multitude sat and heard with
                            reverence. At the close of the meeting, a part of the body went out of the house, while many
                            remained in their seats in contemplative silence. Suddenly a cry burst from the assembly,
                            and some were thrown into strange contortions. Some had singular gestures with words quite
                            inconsistent with presbyterian order. All was confusion. One of the preachers asked, What
                            shall we do? The confusion should be quelled. I replied, We can do nothing at present, we
                            are strangers to such an operation. The cry and burden of prayer to God is for mercy and the
                            salvation of their souls. The next large meeting was held about one mile below South Union
                            in the month of July. The curious came to gratify their curiosity. The seriously convicted
                            presented themselves that they might receive some special benefit to their souls, and
                            promote the cause of God at home and abroad. Many came even from the state of Tennessee. �
                            When I came in sight of this vast assemblage, I was astonished. I said within my heart, "God
                            is in this place." I felt a spirit of thankfulness and prayed God would favor us with a
                            bountiful effusion of his spirit. Through the day and night the exorcises continued without
                            much intermission. Professors prayed to be saved from the least and last remains of sin, and
                            also from lukewarm professors and sinners of every description. On Monday, the last and
                            great day of the feast, the proclamation of the spirit came;�"If any man thirst after
                            righteousness and salvation, let him come and partake of the waters of life freely." Toward
                            evening of said day, inquirers began to fall prostrate on all sides, and their cries became
                            piercing. Heavy groans were heard and shaking throughout the house. At the approach of
                            night, the floor of the meeting house was literally covered with the prostrate bodies of
                            penitents, so that it became necessary to carry a number out and lay them on the grass or
                            garments, if they had them. The night was beautiful; heaven and the elements seemed to smile
                            on the occasion. The news of the meeting spread all around in the adjacent congregations.
                            The subjects of the work would pray with fervency for their friends and neighbors and exhort
                            them to be converted to God. Small children often spoke with boldness and truth in language
                            to which they were unaccustomed, to the astonishment of the surrounding multitude. Dancing
                            and whirling entered into the exercises and<pb n="227" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 227 some of
                            the strangest operations of the day, were the falling into trances for hours and sometimes
                            for days, and then rising in raptures of praise to God for redeeming grace. These would
                            prophesy that they saw the kingdom of God near at hand. The great work increased in
                            searching power from its inauguration, till the year 1805, when the messengers "v\ere sent
                            from the east with the gospel tidings. These ministers introduced with their testimony the
                            oral confession of sin and I have seen respectable people fall upon the floor, under the
                            operations of the spirit, and confess themselves guilty of sin. These facts prove the truth,

                            the writer criticises a letter written in the ' 'Manifesto" where the author makes the
                            statement the Shakers "have no need to run after other religious teachers as they are all
                            below her (Mother Ann's) standard." His theological structure seems to have been severely
                            shaken by the sudden bursting upon his mind of the above fact. He makes the statement that
                            "these people (the Shakers) as well as the great body of professed Christians will treat the
                            messenger of God who comes after Ann just as the people of her time treated her and her
                            followers. Before proceeding further we will state that the views expressed here have been
                            subject to the approval of the leaders of the Church and are not merely personal opinions.
                            While we can not state with certainty what the method of procedure would be with the popular
                            churches, we do assert that if at any time in the future any individual should arise that
                            has a higher spiritual revelation than the one Mother Ann presented to the world for their
                            acceptance, one that calls for a more complete subjection of the elementary forces in the
                            human soul to the Divine will and opens to mortals a higher conception of what is attainable
                            by a strict compliance with the higher law; none would be more ready to hail with joy the
                            new advent and step forward in the increasing work, than the faithful believers in the
                            divine truths promulgated by our founder. Our mission is not merely to build up a sectarian
                            organization, to be called great among men, but to uphold and publish the truths of the
                            higher life; to have a house of refuge for the sinsick soul when weary of the lusts of the
                            flesh and the mind and in the agony of their souls cry out; ' 'Lord what shall I do to be
                            saved." So hold the fort against the encroachments of those demoniac forces that are seeking
                            to draw back into sin and consequent degradation. Mother Ann in one of her highly inspired
                            moments said that she "saw in open vision souls who had passed the dark valley and the
                            shadow, who had come up through deep tribulation and had washed their garments clean." "Poor
                            man in the flesh is always in danger." And the mission of her testimony was to remove that
                            danger by<pb n="228" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 228 THE MANIFESTO. leading them up to a higher plane of life
                            where they in truth could be overcomers. It has been the blessed privilege of the writer to
                            become acquainted with souls while here in mortality, who, through strict compliance with
                            the testimony of Mother Ann, attained unto that spiritual travel where in truth they could
                            say, "the tempter cometh and fmdeth nothing in me." Who stood while here in time with that
                            glorified band that the revelator saw who were "redeemed from the earth." We do not write
                            this for controversy but to vindicate the truth, to do what we can in our humble way to
                            uphold the standard raised by our blessed founder that others may see the beacon light and

Every year we see changes in the people and places
                            about us, and if one year brings about an apparent change, what may not be achieved in a c
                            �ntury of time? Many and marvelous are the events of the past. What some have even termed
                            impossibilities, are taking place in our midst and are thought to be indispensable adjuncts
                            of our life. So it will ever be. That which we have never even thought of will be
                            accomplished. "Necessity is the mother of invention," and as new wants are developed, new
                            articles will be brought forward to supply the deficiency. The number of inventions brought
                            before the public yearly, is almost incredible. "The records of the Patent Office show over
                            21,500 issued in 1889. Edison's patents alone fill one large volume." Life is a progressive
                            march; we advance step by step, from light to light, and should never be content until we
                            have attained to our highest ideal. As this is true the people of 1993 will, no doubt, be
                            more enlightened in many respects, than are those of this age, and the social status may be
                            very different. Of only one thing are we really certain, and that is, the love of our Father
                            in heaven ; this will ever be the same for He is unchangeable, "The same yesterday, to-day
                            and forever." To Him a thousand years are but as one day; hence, the sun will rise and set
                            in its splendor, the seasons come and go, the rain will fall, and through all this his
                            children will share the protecting love of their heavenly Father, a hundred years from now,
                            even as we do now. Listen to the voice of the prophetess : ' 'In that day the sound of war
                            shall be no more heard in the land. Nay, schools for training young men in the art of

                            land, and their weapons shall be the implements of peace�'the pen is mightier than the
                            sword." "All disputes shall be adjusted by arbitration. The tears of the mother<pb n="229" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 229 shall be dried and the load lifted from her heavy heart,
                            for her loved ones shall not be exposed to danger on the battle field. The gray-haired sire

                            days shall be likened unto a deep river flowing through a still, green valley. The money
                            used in this day to defray the expense of war, and of military academies, will then be
                            devoted to the sustaining of free schools and colleges for the higher education and training
                            for the professional life of the people. I know that much, very much has been done in that
                            direction, but in that day whereof I speak all knowledge will be free as the air we breathe.
                            Before a half century shall have passed, laws will be made forbidding the printing of impure
                            and sensational literature, and many a parent's heart will be made to bound with joy wheu
                            the declaration of that law goes forth, and many a life will rise to a more exalted position

                            The revised version reads,�When once thou hast turned again, establish thy Brethren. We
                            might suppose that Simon Peter had not been converted as he is informed what to, do when he
                            is converted, or has again turned to the right way. When thou hast turned again, as much as
                            to say,�Well, Peter, you have attempted to be a Christian, to walk in the narrow way, but
                            have stepped aside. Now when thou hast turned again into the right way, then stablish or
                            strengthen thy Brethren. Peter was a growing Christian, but the growth in grace was slow. He
                            was quick to receive some impressions, and when Jesus called him from his home at the sea
                            shore, he left his ship, his nets and all his business relations and followed the Teacher.
                            Matt, xxvi., 51. From this moment Peter was ready, either to pray or to fight for the safety
                            of his accepted friend. He could pray (Acts ix., 40) and baptise (Acts x., 47) and preach,
                            if need be, (Acts viii., 20) and yet was not quite able under all circumstances of life

                            pattern. When Jesus was talking about the rich men, that they could hardly enter the kingdom
                            of heaven, that a camel might go through the eye of a needle as easily, it brought Peter to
                            his feet who evidently was thinking about his daily bread, and said he, Behold we have
                            forsaken all and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore? Peter believed in the adage,
                            ' 'Look before you leap." We suppose Jesus soon quieted his mind on this subject as he
                            pictured to him the hundred-fold of houses and lands that he would possess in this world,
                            and then of the assurance of eternal life. Peter was so well understood that when he assured
                            Jesus that he was ready to go with him into prison or unto death, Jesus says, 1 tell thee
                            Peter, the cock shall not crow this day before thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest
                            me.�Luke xxii., 33�34. Peter had many chances to turn again and help stablish the Brethren.
                            In his crudeness and roughness, which was his inheritance through the flesh, he manifested
                            the growth of his gospel life, so fast as he obtained it. While another disciple might be in
                            spiritual retirement, Peter was defending the life of his beloved Teacher from the insults
                            of the crowd. A corresponding instance occurred in the life of our good brother Peter Ayers.
                            Peter was about eighteen years of age when he accepted the testimony of Jesus Christ, as
                            preached by Ann Lee. He was full of the life of the world. Every bone and muscle from the
                            crown of his head to the soles of his feet was perfectly sound. Invitations brought Peter
                            into all the dancing parties near his home, and whether it was a cotillion, a jig or a
                            breakdown, he was always on the floor. Peter was also a soldier in the cause of his country,
                            when the red-coats were at Yorktown and Bunker Hill, and later was a soldier of the Lord,
                            Jesus Christ. He was at the surrender of Burgoyne at Bemis Heights, Oct. 16, 1777, but at a
                            later date he threw aside all his carnal weapons and accepted a place in the ranks of the
                            peacemakers. Peter would sing and dance for the Lord, day or night, and if need be fight for
                            his religious teachers with as good grace as he would pray for them. Soon after he became
                            converted, but before he had done much to establish the Brethren in the peaceable fruits of
                            righteousness, he was subjected to the ridicule and mockery of an idle, reckless class, who
                            laughed at the idea that Peter Ayers should have religion. Peter endured the insults like a
                            martyr and suffered much personal abuse with Christian patience. One night after saying his
                            prayers and retiring to enjoy the slumbers of a peaceful conscience, he was awakened by
                            three young men who were calling him, Shaker ! Shaker ! Then they dared him to come out of
                            the house. Peter was not in the least disturbed by this salutation, but when they began to
                            slander his gospel teacher, Ann Lee, and denounced her as a bad woman, he could bear it no
                            longer. Jumping from his bed, and without dressing he was soon on a wild chase and did not
                            return to the house till he had thoroughly pounded his tormentors,<pb n="231" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 231 and left them to mourn their bruises, while he returned to enjoy a night of
                            quiet rest. Peter in his old age, would laugh over this example of zealous, muscu lar
                            Christianity and say it was all the self-denial he had attained unto, up to that date. Simon
                            Peter represents the zealous, muscular, daring, affectionate and great hearted Christian,
                            and he helped to establish his Brethren while passing through all these trials and
                            temptations. Converted Christians are quite often, in their march, like infants trying to
                            walk. The least obstacle in the way and they are certain to fall. The only sure way to
                            success is to try again and every time we try to recover from the fall or have turned again
                            the Lord will help us up, and then we must work more diligently to establish ourselves and
                            the Brethren on a sure foundation.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Christian's prayer" TEIform="index"/>THE CHRISTIAN'S PRAYER.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Davis, Margarette" TEIform="persName"/>MARGARETTE DAVIS.</byline><p TEIform="p">"Our Father who in heaven art," How good to pray to Thee; And "Hallowed be thy holy name" Is

                            placed a glass before him, he would not, I think, condemn in others what he was about to
                            practice, nor shown his ignorance. We quote�"If the parable of the coming of the bridegroom,
                            who hath the bride means anything, it means there will come a personality, etc. It appears
                            from this that the writer is not aware that not only the bridegroom but the bride has
                            already come, and her name is Ann Lee. From the time of her conversion and baptism by the
                            Christ spirit, the bride, the mother of the "new heavens, wherein dwelleth righteousness,"
                            having become one with Christ, taught the same gospel, the same manner of life as did Jesus.
                            As we have heard of no spiritual death nor separation from Christ, what need is there of
                            another bridegroom, or as he terms it, (man�woman.) Now that the true order of Deity is

                            same doctrine that Jesus taught his followers? Had Ann Lee taught a new and opposite
                            doctrine to Christ, there would be a schism, and there might be a net d of that (man�woman.)
                            I would also call the editor's attention to an article the week previous on "Theology." I
                            quote. "Through a partial attainment of righteousness in the perception of one of the ten
                            principles of the pategories of arch-natural life, viz. the chastity of the female, she
                            ordained the Society of Believers, who, through ignorance of what comprises immortal life,
                            believe her to have attained the goal of human aspiration." Was not the writer rather blind
                            to find only one in ten ? Did she not lay the foundation of a Pentecostal Church, where all
                            things were held in common, and naught they possessed was their own, thereby destroying the
                            very foundation of selfishness? It is true she struck at the root of all evil, the lusts of
                            the flesh and mind; but did she not, by establishing a Pentecostal Church, after the pattern
                            of the first, where all were to share and fare alike, no high, no low, no rich, no poor, but
                            all one family of Christ, each working for the good of all, having one faith, one Lord, and
                            one baptism, show the only true solution of the social evil and the financial and labor
                            agitations of our day. If this be "ignorance," "I thank thee, Oh Father, that thou hast hid

                            was by parables, proverbs and allegories. All Asiatic nations held this method in high
                            esteem. Truth couched in comparison or similitude seemed to reach the understanding and
                            arrest the attention of the hearers more readily than when given directly to the point; and
                            when the meaning was too obscure, it provoked a spirit of inquiry or explanation, w Inch
                            served to fix the idea it was intended to convey. With the ancients, a parable or proverb
                            formed the principal illustrative point in the discourse. Sometimes the parable took the
                            form of allegory and again of fable. This method of teaching is prominent in the ministry of
                            Jesus. "And he spake not to them without a parable." In his expansive view there was a near
                            kinship between the natural and spiritual, and his words had a twofold meaning as had the
                            Jewish Law; to the enlightened there was an interior germ of truth not perceived nor
                            appreciated by the plebeian mind, which, occupied solely with material things, received but
                            a vague understanding of his words; and yet, only language borrowed from the outward visible

                            had received from heaven ; to show them the better way, and to lift them up to higher planes
                            of thought and action. "All outward symbols disappear To him whose inward sight is clear."
                            The blessed Master saw the tokens of his Heavenly Father's beneficence on pastoral hill and
                            vale, where the quiet flocks grazed, and the honest husbandmen went forth to sow the seed of
                            fruit and cereal; where the earth teemed with green herbage and lovely flowers and the noble
                            forests lifted their verdant fronds in the pure, sweet air ' of Palestine, which seemed
                            infilled with the life and light of a new dispensation which was about to dawn upon the
                            world. "Bent on his Father's mission !" How wrapt the reverie, as with sandaled feet he
                            walked the green fields, contemplating the utter folly of human life, when material
                            blessings alone were sought; and as his flowing garments brushed the dew-moistened lilies,
                            they bowed their heads and dropped a tear of sympathy, then lifted their sweet faces only to
                            meet his thought, for they had suggested to his mind a suitable theme for discourse. Ever
                            uppermost in all the Savior's teaching is the grand ideal he cherished : the establishment
                            of the kingdom of God upon earth, wherein would be actualized all that was lofty and noble ;
                            the unfoldment of the hidden possibilities of redeemed and regenerate humanity; but, like
                            all great reformers, he lived only to see the seed of that kingdom spring up in a few hearts
                            whom he had imbued with the spirit and life of his soul-elevating testimony. Even those who
                            were the direct recipients of his ministration failed to understand the import of his words;
                            they were dark sayings to the chosen twelve, for when they were alone with him, they asked
                            him to declare unto them the parable of the tares, and inquired of him why he spoke in this
                            indirect manner to the people, and he answered them thus. "Because it is given unto you to
                            understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not, for their heart is
                            waxed gross, and their senses are dull of understanding." Nor as yet are mankind able to
                            receive the full measure of the truth. Sensuality beclouds the mind and bars the soul's
                            receptivity to spiritual influx. How beautifully the good poet expresses it. "Lord what is
                            man whose thought at times Up to Thy seven-fold brightness climbs, While still his grosser
                            instinct clings<pb n="235" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 235 To earth like other creeping

                            foulness of the penal pit, And truth's clear sky Millennium�lit!" After eighteen centuries
                            of manipulation and distortion to "make all things to all men" as Paul expresses it or
                            excuses his digression from Christ's teachings pure and simple, we see a grandeur in, and
                            feel the power of those principles laid down by the great Captain and Pattern of our
                            salvation, designed to disenthrall humanity from the baser selfhood of the two-fold being,
                            and in our souls we feel the expanding, developing and uplifting influence of the Christ
                            inspiration, the holy anointing which made Jesus the Son of God. Under this divine
                            illumination we scale the mount of beatific vision, and behold the day-dawn of the golden
                            prophecy when truth shall rule the world. The grand evolution of the race is on the upward
                            scale, and the climax of the centuries' throes will be the new-born child of immortal
                            virtue, whose garments will know no stain, and whose life will be the love universal of the
                            Dual Christ, replete with the perfection of Wisdom and Love. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            judgment." The happiness of life would be greatly augmented if persons were more careful to
                            reserve their judgment, especially in regard to the faults of others. God alone is able to
                            judge the heart righteously and discern the motives which lie in the soul; but far too often
                            do we harshly and coldly judge an innocent brother or sister from external appearances,
                            forgetting that virtue is sometimes clothed in the coarsest raiment. Too frequently is it
                            the case, that those who have wandered from God, and endeavored to retrace their steps, have
                            encountered so much scorn, censure and unkind judgment, with few to extend the gentle hand
                            of pity, that they sink down in discouragement, thinking that a good name once lost can
                            never be regained. Just here a maxim written by Shakespeare occurs to my mind. "He who
                            steals my purse, steals trash, But he who filches from me my good name, Robs me of that
                            which not enriches him, And makes me poor indeed." How true it is when any one is robbed of
                            his good name, or in other words, when his true worth is depreciated and he becomes a victim
                            to the false judgment of others, he is made to appear poor in the eyes of mortals, but God
                            who searches the heart, sees us as we really are. If we recognized the divine and good in
                            the hearts of others instead of the failings, so common to humanity, we should be following
                            the Christ, who gave to the down-trodden and oppressed words of tenderness and love. Many
                            are so sensitive to criticism and unkind remarks that we can not be too charitable in our
                            judgment. New Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Love, Hope, and Patience..." TEIform="index"/>Love, Hope, and Patience...

                                more clearly the position that a Christian mind should occupy, than did the good apostle
                                when giving instruction to the Brethren in Corinth. It was the life interest of Jesus
                                and his early followers, to become spiritually-minded men, although surrounded by the
                                cares and burdens that are consequent upon a life in this world. This Christian
                                experience soon afforded them the privilege of being able to express themselves Avith a
                                bold assurance relative to their power of gospel protection, as they walked among the
                                children of men. Life to them was very much as life is to us. There was no roseate path
                                in which to walk that should lead them to their anticipated spiritual home among the
                                pure in heart. Thorns and thistles were as common then as now, and the anxieties arising
                                in regard to the accumulation of earthly goods were quite like those which are
                                experienced to-day. This became, at one time, ,so pronounced, that Jesus carefully
                                advised hia brethren not to be over anxious about what they should eat and drink, nor
                                concerning the clothes which they should wear. Eatinoand drinking and even the clothing
                                may occupy, at this day, the greater part of the time of both saints and sinners, very
                                much to their spiritual loss and to their ability to do good, and the occasional
                                ministration of a Teacher like Jesus would prove quite beneficial. The life of
                                self-denial into which the disciples had been called, was away from that of the world,
                                and under the discipline of the cross of Christ. They had learned the value of a
                                Christian experience by "living soberly, righteously and godly in this present world."
                                This was the key to that success which afforded them an overcoming power and enabled
                                them to walk uprightly among men. It became their<pb n="237" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO.
                                privilege as men of God to do God's will in all things, and to accept the blessings
                                which grew out from this new order- of life. They had learned that "to be spiritually
                                minded is life and peace, but to be carnally minded is death." Have we not learned that
                                same lesson, and also learned that these spiritual attainments are the legitimate fruit
                                of a well-ordered life? 'Yea, and we have learned that to be spiritually minded is
                                indeed a great attainment. It is the new baptism into the life of God. It is the
                                entering into the resurrection order; that order into which Jesus had risen, as he says
                                :� "I am the resurrection." Into this life of spirituality and into this order of the
                                resurrection, the Christian disciple must find his place, or he is quite sure to enter
                                the ranks of the carnally minded, and follow after those who throng the broad way.
                                Baptized into a spiritual resurrection, how can the disciple avoid putting off the
                                former conversation that belongs to the old inheritance, and then learn as did the
                                apostle to have our conversation honest before men, and then rais^e it to the spiritual
                                standard in which we now profess to live. Too much care can not be exercised over the
                                language that we use. Careless words and slang phrases are becoming so common that it is
                                only by a daily discipline that one can .avoid their use. Although we may not accord any
                                very great degree of spirituality to King David or to many of his psalms, yet even here
                                we may learn a lesson of which we need not be ashamed. He says,�"Because thy loving
                                kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee." It is for this same reason,
                                for this gentle,,loving kindness that our conversation should be concerning the new
                                heavens and the new earth wherein the spirit of righteousness and peace should ever
                                dwell.</p></div3><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p"> write the articles that are intended for publication on sheets of NOTE SIZE, 5x8 inches;

                                beautiful summer has passed, although the harvest is not ended; and yet how brief seems
                                the period since the sowing and planting time. Really "Time flies" and we fly with it,
                                hardly having an opportunity to secure the precious moments, ere they elude our grasp.
                                Surely "Now is the acceptable time" should be the motto of each who would make life
                                worth the living. Our blessings the season past have been manifold. The sowing and
                                reaping of temporal blessings, have been sure, while others of our dear friends near by
                                have suffered the loss of crops by the devastations of wind and hail. Our garden yields
                                productively, by faithful care. We had two-fifths of a mile of pears, as much by
                                measurement of raspberries and blackberries, with an occasional specimen of the
                                dewberry, a running blackberry, the average size of which is an inch and a half long,
                                and three inches in circumference. To these are added all the nutritious vegetables,
                                indigenous to our climate. Yet amid all these blessings, we are puzzled by a problem
                                which we wonder if any of our sister Societies have solved. When we add healthful food,
                                regular meals, and temperate habits, the sum or amount is perfect digestion,
                                consequently good health. But when we subtract therefrom�as we are obliged to�imperfect
                                mastication caused by rapid eating, the remainder is sure to be indigestion, with its
                                attendant ill-omened figures; and to econcile these antagonisms, is as impossible as it
                                is for the defaulting cashier to meet the demands of his bank, when he has subtracted
                                the funds placed in his charge, for his own selfish use. "Bolted" food is wasted food,
                                since it is not what we eat but what we digest that makes us strong. It is said that
                                those who properly masticate their food, never eat too much. Under these considerations
                                economy would balance the scales, and add health, strength, and virtue which would far

                                pleasure the very excellent and thoughtful editorial of the Sept. Manifesto. The opening
                                sentence of which is the key to our thoughts at this writing. The love and the peace
                                that flows from the spiritual union of Brethren and Sisters, brought together by the
                                love of purity is more precious, saving, and uplifting than any other gift under heaven.
                                "Though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and
                                though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains,* and have not charity (or
                                love) I am nothing." We feel the importance of gathering and cultivating this beautiful
                                gift of divine love. Where pure love is, the love of God, the love of the divine in
                                Brother and Sister, there is freedom and confidence. Nothing is more helpful to the

                                brightly and we shall surely increase in love and zeal and devotion. St. Paul, writing
                                to the early churches says;�"Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good
                                works. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but
                                exhorting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching." We feel the
                                force of the admonition in this last quotation and know the consequences of neglect.

                                the testimony of the Elder, of the importance of laboring first, for a spiritual
                                interest in the cause, and if we did the temporal would not lack support. To seek first
                                the kingdom of heaven, and all else would be added. In our experience we have observed
                                that those who are deeply solicitous that the spiritual gift be upheld, are faithful in
                                temporal things. Our weekly Society meetings are seasons of special blessing, in which
                                the gifts of the spirit flow abundantly; and may we always be in a condition to receive
                                their benefits. The old saying that "one extreme follows another," is applicable at
                                present to the weather. It rains "just as easy" and we are getting a superabundance of
                                it, but it is better than a drought. On the 23rd of August, the different Sabbath
                                schools in this vicinity, had a picnic in the Church family's grove. On a liberal
                                estimate, more than a thousand people assembled. As there was to be speaking by
                                different clergymen, and as we were anxious to see from what fountain they drew their
                                inspiration, a small delegation from the North family attended. We were pleasantly
                                disappointed. The remarks made were directed to the practical duties of life, urging the
                                young, as they were the ones soon to hold the destinies of the world in their grasp, to
                                set the standard of their life high; to have a laudable ambition to be known as those
                                who had lived to help lift human society to a higher plane of thought and action. The
                                absence of the dry forms of theological discussion was very marked. When we look around
                                and see the vast estates of Believers and know that thousands are suffering for the mere
                                necessaries of life who could have the benefits of a peaceful home, if they were willing
                                to make the sacrifice needed, the dying words of Captain Lawrence seem to sound in our
                                ears from the immortal shores, "Don't give up the ship." The testimony of eternal truth
                                is at present, as never before "smashing the godless shrines of man," and those who are
                                faithful to the higher life, will yet rejoice with an exceeding great joy. Hamilton

                                beautiful autumn days have come once more with cooler and more bracing air, and we have
                                been eager to get out of the trying heat of the lingering summer into the splendid
                                golden days of September, as its sunny mornings are full of life and good spirits. The
                                heat and drouth of August has been rather unusual in our vicinity, and a change is truly
                                welcome. The harvesting of corn is now going on to fill the new silo which is capable of
                                holding one hundred and fifty tons. The corn is cut by steam power and is quickly
                                performed. The rye is also to be threshed by steam power. The coming week will bring all
                                to a close with this labor saving machinery; one of the improvements of the age in which
                                we are living. The severe high winds of the past week have caused the greater part of
                                the fruit to fall to the ground, which will diminish the apple crop about one half, also

                                with much serving, so before she was aware of it the time for Home Notes had passed.
                                However, a wise Mother in Israel said, that a person good for making excuses was seldom
                                good for anything else, and as I would not be so classed, I will say no more but try to
                                do better next time. Our Notes would have been much as others have written, of the
                                bountiful hay crop, and of the hot, dry weather that was so nice for making hay, but bad
                                for the uncovered grass roots and for the pastures that let the cows come home hungry.
                                The drought continued so long that we are getting but two thirds of a crop of sweet corn
                                and some of our neighbors fare not so well as we. A little more than half the potatoes
                                are dug. We use a Potato Digger which.our Brethren think well of but would like it
                                better could it pick up the potatoes. Two thirds of a crop of potatoes is all we hope
                                for but with carefulness that will suffice. We were made glad by a short call from Elder
                                John Whiteley. Was sorry he could not stop over the Sabbath. Elder John remarked that
                                apples in our section of the country seemed more abundant than in any other locality he
                                had seen. Unless his eyes magnified a little we pity the rest of the country for ours
                                will be a very small harvest. We shall have to do with less pie, which may be good for

                                health has been failing for some time. She was a good Sister and will be greatly missed
                                in our home circle. Her kind heart and willing hands and ministries of good, will long
                                be remembered by all. She has been a member of this Society about thirty-one years.

                                pleased to bestow upon them for a small equivalent. We are this year blest with a fine
                                crop of potatoes superior to those of a number of years past. From one piece of three
                                acres the Brethren harvested 470 bu. and they were large and smooth. A few acres in
                                other places yielded well, and the crops generally are coming in fair. Ada S.

                                Earth, air, sky, and vegetation retain all their loveliness and original beauty. The

                                to be large trees, and the stone walks are worn smooth by the steady march of tireless
                                feet. The dry and warm summer days of 1893 are gone, and the initial days of autumn are
                                here with all the grandeur of roadside and forest scenery. The golden' rod is waving its

                            this.) It looks like a scheme on the part of Divine Wisdom to force our attention to
                            healthier and more economical modes and methods of living. Jesus said, "Man shall not live
                            by bread alone." And for fear some epicure might think meat or some other external
                            ingredient should be added to his diet he goes on to say "but by every word that proceedetb
                            out of the mouth of God." If a good Shaker knows that fleshmeat is dearer 40 to 1, than
                            vegetables, fruits and farinacea, can he be justified in living at such an enormous premium
                            over his brethren and sisters by nature, who inhabit the sweat shops, the streets and the
                            slums of cities and other indigent neighborhoods, hundreds and thousands of whom never know
                            where their next meal is to come from? This immense disparity must be accounted for,
                            arbitrated, and oscillate into equilibrium sooner or later; and in that day Almighty Love
                            and Justice will not be unmindful of those willing to live with less, that others might have
                            more, and inward peace will be their rich harvest. I consider Theology of very little,
                            perhaps no account�(so far in the world's history, worse than nothing) but practical
                            Religion, to me, is of Almighty moment, that is, this article I am now writing. Elder
                            Richard W. Pelham used to say, "Some presume to say that what or how much they devoured was
                            no part of Religion, but if not I should like to know what Religion does consist in.
                            Goldsmith beautifully says,� "Then Pilgrim these thy cares forego, For earth-born cares are
                            wrong; Man wants but little here below, Nor wants that little long." Let us ask ourselves in
                            the spirit of Elder Anstatt in his recent earnest appeal ;�Are we, or are we not holding
                            foremost in our interest and esteem spiritual themes and spiritual travel? If so, and we are
                            really "seeking first the Kingdom of Heaven and its Righteousness" how is it that good
                            sincere persons who come among us are moved to say, "I thought the Shakers were a religious
                            people and that they conversed upon religious topics and abounded in spiritual gifts. But I
                            can hear scarcely anything at all on the subject. So much is said about all manner of
                            temporalities and so very little about spiritual travel and experience. I am surprised
                            beyond measure to find this state of things." This is the language used here by more than
                            one of our new comers. And then I think of the solemn monition of the rapt seer "Be
                            admonished O Jerusalem, lest my spirit depart from thee and thou become desolate ;� a city

                                ordinary parliamentary practices, so arranged as to admit of ready reference while a
                                question is before a meeting and requiring an immediate solution. This can not be said
                                of any other book on parliamentary law. All others seem to have been designed more for
                                study than for use in assembly work. The different phases of this subject (of which
                                every man thinks he knows considerable, and yet very few know more than enough to lead
                                them into blunders) are carefully classified, and in many cases the same point is
                                repeated under different headings, thus furnishing immediately the desired information.
                                By a unique system of easily learned abbreviations the whole subject is brought into a
                                space that can be readily concealed in an ordinary sized hand. To any member of any

those in Audubon's great work, and am
free to say that they are more accurate in
outline as well as more faithfully colored
to nature."
"A careful examination of this beautiful
work has given me much pleasure. In
deed, it is a great gift to those who love
the study of Ornithology."
