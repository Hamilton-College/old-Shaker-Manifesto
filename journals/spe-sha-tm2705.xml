                            ARRANGEMENT.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, Henry C." TEIform="persName"/> By Henry C. Blinn,</byline><p TEIform="p"> NOW that we have made extended remarks on the religious side of Shakerism, a few items in
                            regard to their social order may not be out of place. We readily admit that the Shaker
                            Community is a peculiar organization, and that the people to a certain extent have chosen to
                            keep themselves separate from the general order of society. This is in accordance with their
                            views, and seems perfectly consistent, as well as in harmony with their religious
                            experience, as it affords advanced privileges in all that pertains to their religious and
                            secular life, and yet it has not a shadow of unpleasant seclusion or dislike to mankind. It
                            may also be very natural for those who are not fully acquainted with the Community to wonder
                            how the Shakers live,�what food they eat; how they manage their domestic affairs ; and in
                            fact, whether they do live like other people. A Shaker family may contain ten, twenty or an
                            hundred persons, and by their system of Christian fellowship maintain a united interest in
                            the peace and prosperity of each other and work industriously for the temporal support of
                            the whole family. By adopting this system of religious belief, and organizing a home so
                            distinct from the homes of Christians generally, it has at times aroused those of an
                            inquisitive mind ; and while wondering, they have supposed many things, guessed many things,
                            and then asserted many things MAY, 1897. <pb n="66" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> that never existed only in
                            their own fertile imaginations. This wondering becomes contagious and hence our willingness
                            to illustrate the social side of the many little affairs of community life. The Shakers have
                            consecrated to God all their time, with all that they have or may have in possession. Their
                            lives are then given for the good of humanity, agreeably to the testimony of Jesus, the
                            Christ, as found in the New Testament. Some have gone so far as to assert that the Shakers
                            neither read nor believe in the Bible. A more^ correct statement would be made by
                            saying,�But few of any class of Christians can be found who have given closer attention to
                            the reading of the whole Bible, or encouraged the stiMy of it more fully, among those of all
                            ages, than have the Shakers. The war of words that has arisen over the plenary inspiration
                            of the I'ook, is of about as much value as the chaff that is blown away by the wind.
                            Christian pugilists and active infidels are readily found on every corner who enjoy the
                            opportunity of giving vent to their pent-up zeal. Neither party cares a straw whether
                            Saturday or Sunday is observed as a day of rest, but make it more of a matter of "might over
                            right." The Shakers believe that the Bible is the best inspirational record of the doings of
                            God's peculiar people in all ages of the world. That it contains wonderful revelations
                            through dreams, visions and trance inspiration, and abounds in prophetic knowledge. To study
                            the Bible that we may walk more in harmony with God's law for the best good of humanity, is
                            of much more consequence than to champion the Book because of sectarian influence. It is
                            quite common to be askt,�"How do you settle difficulties that arise between individual
                            members of your Society ? " In a Christian Community the members must be governed by the
                            spirit of Christ. The contract which has been signed by those entering the Society, and the
                            Rules and Regulations of the Order, which are for the same purpose as the by-laws of other
                            societies determine quite clearly the course that must be taken by each member toward every
                            other member. To injure another person by word or report or by deed produces disunion, and
                            the trespass must be corrected by confession or acknowledgement. The correct government of
                            the mind is an essential Christian discipline, and to be able to maintain a gospel relation,
                            a good union and fellowship must be sustained. No member has a right to trespass upon the
                            privileges of another, and if this is done, either carelessly or willfully, an apology must
                            be made, or it should be made a subject of confession. As there are some sixty or more
                            Shaker families in the United States, and as these families are in a liberal degree quite
                            independent of each other in their domestic arrangements, it would be about as difficult to
                            write concerning them as it would be to write of so many individual families in any village.
                            The directors of these Communities generally designate the time for rising in the morning
                            and of retiring to rest at night, and yet this may be so <pb n="67" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> varied in many
                            ways, for the aged, for the infirm, for those deprived by special cares, and for the little
                            children, that it can not by any means become a fixt rule. The custom of rising and of
                            retiring becomes so much a matter of habit that "Poor Richard's" advice is readily
                            accepted,�"Early to bed and early to rise." A class of people who retire at midnight or even
                            later must also rise late if they are to obtain sufficient rest. The hour for breakfast,
                            dinner and supper are determined by each family as may best suit themselves through the
                            different seasons of the year. In the preparation of food for the table no special rule can
                            be carried out unless all should agree to a certain kind of diet. In the several villages
                            may be found a variety of classes, and some of these like good Bible students follow the
                            counsel of St. Paul;�"Whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience
                            sake." Others having entered the ranks of the Reformers anticipate a brighter future for
                            both soul and body. Swine's flesh is not eaten in any Shaker family, and indeed, no
                            consistent Bible Christian would make use of it. Eating and drinking have become largely a
                            matter of taste, and "every man must be fully persuaded in his own mind" what is conducive
                            to health :uid happiness. Coffee of many varieties and tea of many shades are used in the
                            several Societies, but I have never heard of a Shaker who reacht the half dozen cups that
                            Carlyle is said to have taken. In connection with eating and drinking, so. essential to the
                            health, comes the general care of the body. This is one of the great blessings of God. The
                            air we breathe ; the food we eat; the garments we wear and the rigid cleanliness we
                            maintain, should all be intelligently reduced to practical usefulness. Every family of
                            Shakers keeps a herd of cows and manufactures more or less butter either for use at home or
                            for the market. Since the introduction of the silo and the raising of ensilage, the farmers
                            have been able to increase the number of animals kept during the winter season and since the
                            introduction of the separator, several families have availed themselves of this wonderful
                            machine. The Ferguson and the Cooley creamers are also in use, and some still retain the
                            pans and the accompanying rack. Carlton, in his journey around the world, found the boys and
                            girls in every country, just the same as those that he had left in his own home. They can no
                            more avoid running and jumping and sliding, and laughing than they can avoid breathing, and
                            it is well that it is so. The children of a Shaker Village can not be other than children.
                            God bless them and their active, welldisciplined and joyous life. No system of religion will
                            ever be able to drive out the fun that bubbles up as naturally in childhood, as the water
                            from the spring. Age will bring the burdens of a more mature manhood and womanhood and then
                            the duty to God and the responsibilities before man will fill the mind and bring burden and
                            care. Some who have written about the Shakers must have been somewhat dis- <pb n="68" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> ordered, as their articles have been so sadly distorted, or as Samanlha says,
                            "they must be meaner than pusley." The Shakers are very much like the inhabitants of the
                            section of country where they reside. Their general cultivation and customs, habits and
                            manners if better in any degree, must be made so by conformity to the mission of Jesus, the
                            Christ. To read the third chapter of James occasionally will have a very salutary effect
                            upon the mind for reading or speaking. I think it would be the exception to find a Shaker
                            family that was not well supplied with reading matter, either in books or papers, or that
                            did not understand the general topics of the day. In some families, even the children in
                            common with others, have the active events of the day read to them from a daily paper, while
                            they have ample opportunity to acquaint themselves with other forms of literature, if they
                            so choose.

TEIform="persName"/> By Aurelia G. Mace.</byline><p TEIform="p"> "The Lord is in His holy temple ; let all the earth keep silence before him." "His
                            foundation is in the holy mountains." THEREFORE, "my heart is inditing a good matter." It is
                            of the "Mount Lebanon Cedar Boughs." A book the literature of which is of the highest type;
                            gems of poetic genius, written by the Queen's daughters <pb n="69" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> whose clothing
                            is of wrought gold. By them it is dedicated not only to the household of faith, but to all
                            souls in the wide, wide world. They are boughs from the Cedars of Lebanon. The trees are
                            still there, waving in grandeur and beauty. They are poems sent forth to enlighten and
                            educate and to make manifest the intellectual power that has been attained in the spiritual,
                            communistic life. Under no other condition can a door be opened for such a pure and refined
                            education as that gained in the home that has been prepared, whose foundation is in the holy
                            mountain. Here in this favored retreat, minds have been disciplined until sordid desires
                            have been subdued, selfishness destroyed and the animal nature overcome. From this altitude
                            they look upon the children of men, ever ready to lend a helping hand to draw them up to the
                            higher and purer life. It is to this cause they give their strength from day to day. But as
                            they give they renew their strength from the overflowing fountain of God's love. They walk
                            and do not faint,�they run and do not weary. Here also is found that mine of intellectual
                            wealth from which these Cedar Boughs have emanated. We read one poem,�it is beautiful and we
                            want to call your attention to it. We read another,�it is equally good; and so from the
                            beginning to the end of the book. The Mother in the Diety is here made manifest. The Mother
                            in the New Creation here stands in her place. The virgins that follow her are brought unto
                            the King in raiment of needle-work. With gladness and rejoicing they come, for grace is
                            poured into their lips. They ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness and
                            righteousness. Thus the Cedars of Lebanon wave in majesty, distilling dew and sending forth
                            'Boughs' for the healing of the Nations. The Daughters of Zion have arisen to thresh and to

                            founder of our Order. To the faithful observance of this exhortation by her loyal followers,
                            our Church owes its successful establishment, its maintenance and its power. A practical
                            application to the daily life of the principles embodied in these two simple sentences, has
                            proved to us that one is not without the other in securing satisfactory results. Perchance
                            some might claim that the first requisite of material success is <pb n="70" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> in
                            putting "hands at work" without being supplemented with "heart toward God;" but would not
                            the elements of selfishness bear sway in this way? With the heart fixt upon God and
                            sustained by godly principles what can not a Christian or a body of Christians achieve ?
                            During the lapse of a hundred years has the Shaker Church stood successfully upon this
                            combined temporal and spiritual platform when looking to God for direction and sustaining
                            power. Called, as we have been, to share in the communal blessings with which a kind
                            Providence has so signally favored us, it becomes us to offer our best gifts in deepest
                            gratitude. To those who leave the order of generation, is granted the privilege of becoming
                            the children of the Resurrection, and according to their several abilities such are
                            responsible that every consecration be made in view of the best improvement of time,
                            physically, mentally and spiritually considered, and thus enhance in a three fold measure
                            the welfaie of our home as well as the comfort of its devoted members. Without a
                            conscientious regard for the performance of every duty, personal and selfish interest would
                            be inclined to rule and the higher spiritual law of communistic principles be lost to view.
                            In the t.ime of the Apostolic church St. Paul commanded "that if any would not work neither
                            should he eat." He further states, "We hear that there are some which walk among you
                            disorderly, working not at all, but are busy-bodies; now them that are such we command and
                            exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work and eat their own bread." Who
                            is there with much experience in life that has not realized the train of mischief and even
                            crime which follows in the wake of the idle and thoughtless individual unemployed with hand
                            or heart in some honest, and consequently worthy occupation. The question often arises,�Are
                            there not some of the present day who might profit by St. Paul's advice? That there is a
                            diversity of gifts in every church is very true, and every one who improves these various
                            talents for the good of the whole is personally benefited and blest to share the
                            hundred-fold advantages of a Christian, communal home. East Canterbury, N.

                            birth of Mother Ann Lee. To a humble home, in England, she came, and tho her parentage, was
                            the most common and lowly we know her life work has been no common mission. Many incidents
                            may be compared with the life of Jesus. Her lowly birth,�was he not cradled in a manger? Her
                            religious fervor and conviction, both for her own soul, and for humanity,�and greatest of
                            all the freedom which she brought <pb n="71" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> to woman. Whether it is recognized as
                            a truth or not, by the world at the present day, the foundation stone of the great "Woman's
                            Rights Movement," which agitates the minds of so many, was laid in the gospel work of Mother
                            Ann Lee. It began in America, more than one hundred years ago. At the age of thirty-four,
                            Mother Ann was recognized as standing at the head of our Church. Her Ministry was wrought
                            out through the deepest tribulation ; and through mental and physical suffering she obtained
                            the just title of "Mother." Indeed the mother spirit was ever manifest with her. Atone time
                            she said, "I only chasten you that I may bring your souls nearer to my soul." No reasoning
                            mind can doubt that her ministrations were from God. Never has a woman been ordained for so
                            divine a mission. Many have come like wolves in sheep's clothing, declaring themselves to.be
                            the Christ, but inevitably their purpose has been traced to some selfish design. Not so, our
                            Mother; as the years have rolled by, her name has grown brighter and more exalted. Let us
                            speak and live in honor to her name, as she taught that "Those who voluntarily take up their
                            crosses in this world, and faithfully endure to the end, will be bright and more glorious
                            than will other souls, they will be kings and priests unto God." With this beautiful life
                            before us, we can but exclaim;� "O my Mother, my blessed Mother, Her name to me is dear,
                            I'll praise her name, I'll spread her fame And kings and priests shall hear. Enfield, N.

                            the morning dawn? An editorial on the labor question in a metropolitan journal commenting on
                            the fact of there being over one hundred thousand idle men in that city who were looking for
                            work; willing to do whatever they could to earn an honest dollar to support those dependent
                            upon them asks, "is there not something wrong in our civilization when it is possible for
                            such conditions to exist?" and questions "where is the remedy?" It is not difficult to see
                            that something is wrong for like a ghostly shadow it haunts human society by day and is in
                            their visions at night. But the remedy! Ah! like a mathematical problem it is easy enough
                            after the solu- <pb n="72" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> tion, but at present the bare suggestion of starting a
                            movement winch would be expected to change existing conditions is sufficient to brand the
                            originator with the epithet "anarchist,�enemy of society,�let us crucify him." Selfishness
                            is the foundation of this condition. We quote from an agricultural journal. "The prospects
                            for the American farmer are brightening." How? "Failure of crops in Europe and famine in
                            India." There must be something wrong when Christianity for two thousand years have been
                            seeking to incorporate the Divine principle of the brotherhood of man into the life of the
                            races that claim to represent that faith ; and they rejoice in the affliction of their
                            fellow-beings if it replenishes their own coffers. By a false interpretation of that
                            doctrine it has been made to represent and sanction a system of life that is at variance
                            with its precepts. This arises from the undevelopt state of the soul; but as it advances and
                            comes to a more perfect understanding of its true destiny and realizes that the law of
                            reaction is such that if one portion of the human family suffers the rest through sympathy
                            must also suffer no thought but the desire to help those in need will urge them to action.
                            Whittier has truly voiced the sentiment of every one who believes in human progress,�"We
                            only know that God is just and every wrong shall die." Fear oppresses society with the
                            thought of the conditions that may possibly exist in the ti'ansition from the present social
                            order to the new, and it acts as a barrier to prevent the inauguration of a reform movement.
                            That fear should be groundless, for with an honest desire to remove the conditions now
                            existing would come the knowledge by which it could best be accomplisht. The presentation of
                            ideas to those who can not accept them and intelligently realize their obligations is
                            casting pearls whera they will be trodden under foot. President Lincoln when urged to issue
                            his emancipation proclamation said, "not yet, the people do not understand and will not
                            accept it at present." Those who have received that spiritual unfolding which places them in
                            the vanguard as the true leaders of the people ; while realizing the necessity of
                            educational labors are cautious to know that the soil is prepared before the seed is sown.
                            The adage to "strike when the iron is hot," is applicable to the present. When conditions
                            are properly adjusted and the soul has been enlightened to that degree that it can
                            understand advanced truths, then will the light break upon the world. The unification of
                            thought in religion and politics that is actively engaging the attention of advanced
                            thinkers, while it may not be possible on the lines they have drawn, to remove the barriers
                            which produce the political distinctions of the world, yet unity can and will be accomplisht
                            and the comprehension of the divine ideal toward which human life is traveling will be
                            realized; but in the details there will be harmony in diversity. Observed from different
                            positions the goal appears to each school of thought on the direct line of their vision, all
                            others varying in different degrees from that; but as they <pb n="73" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> advance,
                            the diverging lines become less and all will reach the same goal. The growing interest in
                            arbitration for settling international difficulties is proof that one more ray of light has
                            penetrated the darkness and is announcing that day "when the war drum throbs no longer, and
                            the battle flags aie furled." The terrific forces that the human mind is developing to carry
                            on offensive and defensive warfare may be a factor in the accomplishment of this result.
                            Racial distinctions which are produced by climatic conditions will remain, a permanent
                            factor ; but those barriers which are the product of man's inability lo grasp the truth of
                            the brotherhood of man will, through divine evolution be removed as he grows to a more
                            perfect understanding of the higher law. Shakers, N.

                            "New Light" doctriu &gt; of the then famous George Whitefield. Ke was a most powerful preacher,
                            and his influence pervaded cities, towns and villages in the Northern and Southern States,
                            from 1740 to 1770. He visited England, his native country, several times, and finisht his
                            earthly course at Newburyport, Mass., Sept. 1770. It appears that Shadrach Ireland became a
                            convert to Whitefield's doctrine and entered upon the service of spreading the doctrine with
                            increasing light, in and about Boston, which gave displeasure lo the different orders of
                            religionists of the day, in that vicinity. His denunciation of the dead state of religion
                            among the Orthodox, could not be endured by them ; hence they were aroused and went legally
                            to work to have him arrested, alleging that he had blasphemed God and that his tongue should
                            be bored with a hot iron. Being apprised of their design he fled to Harvard, where some of
                            his converts lived, who gladly received and secretly entertained him. It seems that his
                            opposers had some pretext for the course th^y had taken as he said he had been called of the
                            Lord to forsake his wife and family and join himself in spirit to another woman, professing
                            at the same time to live a pure life. Shadrach, finding it unsale to return to his former
                            place of residence, continued to find protection with his friends who lived in Harvard,
                            which at that time was a thinly inhabited part of the town. It seems he had other disciples
                            in more distant localities, even to the distance of fifty miles. His people gave evidence of
                            their love and respect for him, as it appears they soon learned his place of retreat, and
                            united in building him a "house. A wilderness spot was sought out and a building erected by
                            a united gift, <pb n="74" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> six furlongs from the house of Isaac Willard. This
                            house was large for that day and had a square roof. It was called the Square House and was
                            built in 1769. The timber for the frame was cut on the farm and the work performed under
                            Shadrach's directions. Some of it was done by his own hands, as he was by trade a carver and
                            joiner. Here the standard was erected and Shadrach's people gathered to hold meetings.
                            Samuel Cooper and his family moved into the house with Shadrach. His spiritual companion
                            remained in seclusion till his decease,, a term of ten or eleven years. None but Shadrach's
                            followers knew that he resided in the town. The Northwest chamber was his workshop. In this
                            room was a bell, and the cord extended from it to the kitchen, so that when strangers
                            entered the house he could be notified to keep silent. He also had a very contracted
                            staircase, extending from the cellar to the lookout that was built upon the roof. This
                            staircase went up by the west side of the chimney so that in case of danger he could flee to
                            the lookout and see who was on the premises. His followers often visited him for instruction
                            and those of his disciples who were of the most moral and virtuous class bore the cross with
                            him. At this time it was evident he was clothed with the true spirit that he might prepare a
                            people for the work of final salvation which he had already commenced. Mother Ann Lee saw
                            this place and people in vision before she left her own country, and then believed she would
                            be led to the spot in God's own time, which was fulfilled in 1781, but not until after the
                            decease of Shadrach Ireland. Altho he lost his rectitude, some of his disciples remained
                            true and were ready to embrace the testimony of Mother Ann and the Elders, when it was
                            opened to them. Shadrach testified that his body would never die : and this belief was
                            shared by his followers, but it appears he was mistaken, for some time in the year 1779 or
                            1780, he left the mortal form something in the following manner. On the night of this event
                            he walkt the floor in great distress of mind and groaning deeply, said;�"I feel the wrath of
                            God." In the course of the night, Abigail Lowgy called a Sister to bring a light, which she
                            did with haste, but when the Sisters arrived his spirit had departed. Shadrach had said,�"If
                            I should die, I shall rise again on the third or ninth day." Accordingly, at a suitable time
                            for interment some of his followers prepared a tomb in the cellar of the house, in which
                            they placed the remains. This place was brickt up and a board placed over the top. In this
                            the body remained until it became offensive, when it was removed. It was taken by Abijah

                            Several hills of corn were removed and a grave was made. After the burial, the corn was
                            replaced to prevent all knowledge of the interment. This remained a secret for some time.

                            reunion of Church and State would prove disastrous to our national and individual liberties
                            and rights, because it would inevitably give control to trie strongest religious party,
                            which in our nation, is the Roman Catholic,�the best organized and most powerful religious
                            association of which history gives record. The religious sentiment and the love of power,
                            are the two strongest factors in human nature. No matter what the beliefs or enlightenment
                            of a sect or body of people, there would always be danger in making it possible for these
                            two factors to combine and serve each other. If Protestants were as powerful a body as the
                            Catholics, their denomination in the affairs of State would be equally objectionable. In
                            either case the union of civil with ecclesiastical power would mean the loss of free speech
                            and free press ;�the warping and narrowing of all educational efforts, public and private,
                            to the standard of creed-bound minds;�the conversion of all thoughtful people who have not
                            the courage to endure physical torture into hypocrites and slaves, for a legal creed, must
                            in the nature of things create these. Its tendencies are to stupify the conscience, and
                            stultify all the diviner qualities in humanity;�to wither genius and paralyze every
                            progressive movement. In short no influences are so powerful, no tyranny so oppressive and
                            destructive to the highest interests of the race, as supposed religion backt by unlimited
                            political power. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                novelties to be equally short lived. Even human compacts and organizations are subject
                                to birth and dissolution. Religion has its ebb and flow. Progression is the ultimatum of
                                the human race in all things essential to its proper development in intellectuality,
                                morality and spirituality. The ideas of one hundred years ago will not supply the
                                necessary aliment for the present time. People are not content to travel or live in the
                                old-fashioned way. They must be propelled by steam or electricity on land and water.
                                Their living must be of a superior grade than satisfied our ancestors. Business must be
                                done by telegraph and telephone, seemingly, the world over. Shorthand displaces the old
                                and slow chirographj. The go-ahead spirit is full of invention and push. Once upon a
                                time a man of eminence advised young men to go West; now they are advised to go South.
                                Some of both sexes are acting on the latter advice, and are going South. The Shakers
                                have imbibed the spirit and have gone to the peninsula of Florida and according to their
                                report are doing well. Like all new enterprises, one class advocates the undertaking,
                                and another class objects to it, chiefly the class who have never been there. Those of
                                our people who have been to the location speak in glowing terms of it. Sister Elizabeth
                                Sears, Mar., 29, in company with Brother Benj. Gates, started by railroad, for Olive
                                Branch, Fla. I am an advocate for Florida, and if the way would open I should soon be
                                there. I am far from pressing any one to go there that does not wish to; neither would I
                                deter any one from locating there who desired to, when proper preparations were made to
                                receive him. Those who prefer the cold northern snow and frost to the sunny South, by
                                all means let them enjoy it to their heart's content. Calvin O. Reed. <pb n="77" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> North Family. April, 1897. To the majority of Nature's worshipers spring
                                offers the most beautiful and varied themes for admiration. Now that the opening
                                promises of the year are before us we take the same delight in our surroundings as the
                                seasons come and go and exclaim, "Beautiful for situation" is Mt. Lebanon! her hills are
                                crowned with majesty, her valleys rich with beauty and blessedness. Our Zion is like
                                unto Jerusalem of old when her people awaited with anxious hearts the coming of the
                                Savior. And so we wait, hoping through faith love and good works to make ourselves
                                worthy of the day that is before us. The times are according to the prophecies,
                                therefore we should be ready to perform our labor willingly, trusting to the Hand that
                                hath led us thus far, to deliver us. The work of the season is being hurried by devoted
                                hands and we are glad to write that our Brethren, as they have for many years past, will
                                do with less and less hired help. The hireling system is a menace to every grade of
                                society, and especially is it so with those who have a high understanding of the law of
                                love and truth. Through the consideration of our Brethren we have found a long and
                                welcome releasement from the care of hn-ed men and now await the time when all our lands
                                shall be tilled by conseci'ated hands and none other. We are contemplating re-flooring
                                and wainscoting our large dining-hall which has become much dilapidated through use and
                                old age. Brethren and Sisters each furnishing half of the necessary funds. When it is
                                finisht we would like to invite all the members of the household of Faith to a union
                                feast,�but must not hope for the impossible. On the first day of April the last
                                inhabitants of the Canaan family bade farewell to their old home, made sacred to many by
                                memories of a long life of devotion. We trust that in the fertile valley of the
                                Connecticut they will take up the threads of experience and find new life and love in
                                their accepted home, where some of the worthiest of our forefathers and mothers lived,
                                suffered and died. Our united prayers for every good gift have followed them and shall
                                continue. May peace rest on our banners, and prosperity attend the labor of our hearts
                                and hands, is the wish of each for each, extended through the hand of the writer. Cora

                                announcement that spring has come. For the last month the greenhouses and hotbeds have
                                been brought into requisition for starting early vegetable plants. The report of George
                                H. Baxter on the anniversary of Washington's birthday was interesting. The observance of
                                those days which remind us of the lives and deeds of the great and good who have honored
                                history's pages is beneficial; for "lwes of great men oft remind us we can make our
                                lives sublime." It is a beautiful coincidence that the two most prominent names in
                                American history have tl.eir natal clay in the same month. Washington and Lincoln are
                                associated as the founders of the hope of the world, and the liberator from the thraldom
                                of the dark ages. It is pleasant to share in the benefits tliat have come from the
                                labors of such souls, but also to be willing to suffer that the truth may prevail is
                                another question. Wherever the Divine Spirit may lead, may we be willing to give all we
                                have to God and his blessed cause. That there is an indwelling spiritual force able so
                                far to triumph over the physical as to heal its infirmities is well known to those who
                                have been privileged to enter that spiritual temple and partake of the fruit of the tree
                                of life. Why it does not at all times come as a healing power we can not answer but the
                                many manifestations of that gift which have been record- <pb n="78" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> ed in
                                history and revealed in our own Church prove its reliableness. That there will be a

                                elements of the universe, affected by the magnetic current of others. The governing
                                power of each human world should be Truth, and its resources of good should be dealt out
                                by the hand of Consistency. In taking a retrospective view of the world within, we see
                                intricate boundary lines separating the good from the evil. We recognize streams of love
                                which refresh whomsoever they feed or forces so soiled with the mud of passion, that
                                pollution is the natural outgrowth. Beautiful with mental flowers of holy thoughts that
                                refine life or darkened with poisonous germs of evil. These elements combined with ore
                                of nature, are the portable merchandise we give to each other in our daily intercourse.
                                It is the Christian's duty to so rid himself of evil that he gives to his fellow-beings
                                only the purifying fruits of truth and justice. To do this a knowledge of human nature
                                must be acquired and society's best interest be at heart. "For the wrong that needs
                                resistance, For the cause that needs assistance, For the future in the distance, For the
                                good that we can do." We have had the pleasure of entertaining Sister Martha Wetherell
                                of East Canterbury, for a few days in March. We hope that more of such pleasant
                                visitations will transpire during the year. Maple harvesting is in full operation and
                                present prospects bespeak a good yield. We hail with joy the pleasant chirpings of the
                                robin redbreast as his cheery song floats out upon the morning air. Altho the cold
                                season has not been unusually severe and general health has prevailed in our Society,
                                still we are ready to sing,�"Winter, adieu, your time is through." George H.

                                the time of our last writing, snowstorms and snow-drifts were the order of the day. Now,
                                the snow-storms have given place to April showers, the grass is springing up in all
                                favored places, the birds are singing, and really it is like stepping into a new world.
                                The good Book says, "First that which is natural, and afterwards that which is
                                spiritual," and the natural is sure to be on hand. The changes that take place in our
                                lives are, no doubt, as wonderful as are those in nature, and then being so closely
                                conjoined to them that many times they run along on parallel lines. New thoughts, new
                                aspirations and new revelations are constantly unfolding to those who are looking toward
                                a better order of life, in anything that may elevate the standard of humanity. No useful
                                life can run wholly on one line. St. Paul says,�the body, soul and spirit; each <pb n="79" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> must have its special care under the laws which come from God. On
                                this subject it does no harm to take thought. While we say that with the spring comes
                                the return of the little birds, we must not forget the little chattering English
                                sparrows, that have maintained the most friendly relations all winter. Up to date, we
                                have not seen cause to wish them out of mind or even out of sight. Their song is not as
                                melodious as some birds, and yet it may b^ an improvement on the crow and possibly on
                                that of the blue jay. Certainly it can do no harm to stimulate the mind a little more in
                                favor of lovingkindness toward all useful birds and beasts. The maple sugar makers have
                                been happy this spring, as their sweet harvest has been more abundant than what had been
                                anticipated. Henry C.

                                tie Held of oats, another of potatoes, another of grass and some raised patches of
                                cabbages or turnips. These crops were grown mostly on the thin soiled, stony hillsides.
                                If a man took a field in the meadow below, his neighbors thought he was too well off,
                                and accused him of an inclination to put on airs and ape the aristocracy. Besides all

                                several sheep and a few hens. In some cases they owned a pony or a goat, or a flock of
                                geese. There were also two half-grown pigs that frequented the village lanes. They were
                                sharp-nosed, long-legged creatures, nimble of foot, and apparently capable in their
                                wanderings of picking up their own living. When at home they lived in their master's
                                house which had but a singl-j room and the pig-pen was in cue corner. Aside from the
