Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 6. If the same visible
                            consequences have attended this kind of light first and last, the different manifestations
                            of it must be established or condemned together. But to obviate the question more
                            particularly, it will be proper to observe, that divine light is first received by faith. We
                            must first believe the report concerning things invisible, before we can see the object face
                            to face and actually possess it; and the firm belief of a thing will produce great effects
                            both on the mind and body. Whom having not seen, ye love, in whom believing, though now ye
                            see him not, yet rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. This unspeakable joy was
                            merely the fruit of faith in those who had to receive the end of their faith, even the
                            salvation of the soul. If those called New-Lights did testify that they were dead to the
                            world, and risen with Christ above all sin, temptation, pain and suffering, were full of
                            glory and perfectly blessed with the fulness of God, united in heart, and beyond the
                            possibility of a separation, they only meant that this was their situation by faith. They
                            had full faith that such a state was attainable, and were swallowed up in the delightful
                            contemplation of it, as though they were actually in it. That it was not their real
                            situation, was evident from their repeated complaints of remaining darkness, and their
                            prayers for returning light. If it is said that upon this principle, all their exercises
                            were only the workings of imagination: I answer, that until a thing is brought present to
                            the senses, the brightest knowledge we can have of it is a bright and clear imagination, by
                            means of a shadow or image of the thing. But we must distinguish between a vain imagination
                            and that which is properly founded. If we form an imagination of a thing that has no
                            existence, that imagination is vain; but it is not so, when the image of a thing is drawn
                            upon the mind which has actual existence. What knowledge had the Jews of the kingdom of
                            Christ while under the<pb n="122" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> ceremonial law, beyond the effect of lively
                            images? The law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very substance of the
                            things, could never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make
                            the comers thereunto perfect, for would they not then have ceased to be offered? Observe,
                            their imaginations were not vain, they were shadows of good things, of real substances,
                            although they were yet to come, and absolutely necessary to come in order to their
                            perfection. The cases are perfectly similar, for if the New-Lights had found real perfection
                            by the aforementioned exercises, would not these exercises have ceased ? The same persons
                            would fall again and again, and rise with the same transfigured countenance, and testify
                            that they felt Christ in them, and were full of glory as before, and again cry out for
                            Christ to come and pardon and save them from their sins ; so that at every meeting the same
                            sacrifices were continually offered, which was a plain evidence that their affections were
                            raised by an influential faith, a confident expectation of things hoped for, and the
                            evidence of things not seen. If any should build upon their faith and deceive themselves
                            with the shadow, and think it was the substance, they must blame themselves, for common
                            sense is capable of making the distinction. Obj. 4. But if it was the true light of the
                            spirit they were in, must not that light have secured them from any such mistake ? Ans. Why
                            did not the light on mount Tabor show the three disciples that what they saw was only a
                            vision, and that Jesus was not yet glorified ? Why were all the disciples so mistaken about
                            the kingdom of Christ, both before and after their master was crucified? Why did they expect
                            it to come writh observation, and immediately appear? Why were they so mistaken as to think
                            that John would never die ? The light of God was never sent to those who were under no
                            mistakes, but to such as were immersed in errors and mistakes, and willing to see and have
                            their mistakes corrected. The first work of God is to discover errors and mistakes and have
                            them put out of the way, and this must needs be done, before anything substantial and
                            permanent can be built up. Hence, the work among the NewLights was intended to tear down and
                            remove the rubbish of old systems, and therefore, the subjects of it, had practically and
                            experimentally, to handle and prove the corrupt materials of the whole fabric. To be elected
                            and singled out as the distinguished objects of irresistible grace, carried through even to
                            the resurrection, and after being raised in glory, soul and body reunited, openly
                            acknowledged and acquitted as dear children of God and made perfectly blessed, as they had
                            supposed; yet after all, they found they were in their sins, "exposed to all the miseries in
                            this life, to death itself, and to the pains of hell forever." Consequently, the whole
                            building must be one grand mistake throughout, and therefore in obedience to that light, by
                            which they discovered the danger of the old building, they determined to forsake it, or roll
                            it away piece by piece, until the<pb n="123" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> way was prepared for a better
                            foundation. The disciples and followers of Jesus had his promise that they should receive
                            the Holy Spirit, who would abide with them forever ; that he and the Father would come and
                            make, their abode with them. Until the promise was fulfilled their old Pharisaical errors
                            remained, and they were liable to pervert and abuse all the new light they received, by
                            mixing it with their vain superstitions and traditions of men. The greater part gloried that
                            such a Savior was raised to Israel, but if they had not been mistaken they would rather have
                            gloried in such a breaker being raised to Israel. The disciples of Jesus were much more
                            mistaken at first than his avowed enemies, for the latter evidently saw that he would be the
                            occasion of taking away their place and nation, unless he could be defeated by superior
                            power; whereas the former imagined that his whole design was to build them up. In the midst
                            of all their glorying, and the exercise of such spiritual power as they had, they were often
                            warned not to rest in what they had received. No wonder then, if many of the opposers of the
                            late revival, in its first stages, were capable of forming a more correct judgment
                            concerning the visible effects of it, than those who were in it, and of improving upon the
                            admonitions given to the disciples of old in a similar case, to convince the New-Lights that
                            all their mighty gifts did not carry them out of the reach of danger. Not every one that
                            saith Lord, Lord�For many shall say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied

TEIform="persName"/> George M. Wickersham.</byline><p TEIform="p">"While attending the memorial service of Elder Giles B. Avery, Jan. 4, 1891, I felt impressed
                            to ask myself this question,-�How came I to be a Shaker? Why I was so impressed I cannot
                            tell; I hope it will do no harm. In the year 1824, while in the fourteenth year of my age,
                            there was quite an agitation among a large class of people in relation to living a Community
                            life. About this time, Robert Owen, the great philanthropist from Lanark, Scotland, came to
                            Philadelphia on a lecturing tour, and advanced the principles and advantages of a life in
                            Community. My father, at that time, was much interested with his theory, and I wras highly
                            pleased while attending his lectures. I thought I could see more happiness in a Community,
                            than in the common way of living. The first time that I heard the name Shaker mentioned, was
                            in one of his lectures. Robert Owen gave an account of a visit to Union Village, Ohio, where
                            he spent three days. He was much pleased with some things that he saw among the people, and
                            thought if the Shakers could live in Community, and in peace and harmony, so long as they
                            had, he could see no reason why the society<pb n="124" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> that he was trying to build
                            up in the state of Indiana, should not succeed and hold together, in like manner. He
                            exhibited a model, showing his plan in the form of a square and enlarged for a village or
                            town, to be built as the society increased. The arrangements were very complete ; the model
                            could be taken apart, and all the interior rooms and different apartments presented to view.
                            The cooking and laundry establishments were placed in the center, and were designed to
                            accommodate the whole square. Steam was to be used for washing and cooking, which was quite
                            a novel idea in those days. But all do not see alike : some thought they saw room for
                            improvement, and proposed starting a society nearer home, and making all the improvements
                            that their wisdom could devise. They looked for a place upon which to locate and finally
                            concluded to settle at Valley Forge, the noted place which General Washington chose for his
                            winter quarters, in the time of the revolutionary war. The price agreed upon for the estate
                            was sixty-five thousand dollars. My father was one of the first to move his family into the
                            place, and was the last to move away. The number of members belonging to the society was
                            about three hundred. They did not all move to the new settlement but intended to do so as
                            soon as buildings could be prepared. But as a house built upon sand has a poor foundation,
                            so it was with the Valley Forge community. The fall of that society, however, turned to the
                            upbuilding of Lebanon in some degree. Abel Knight, a prominent member of our Community, saw
                            a letter written by one of the western Shakers to a Quaker preacher by the name of Mott, of
                            New York, and after hearing of the Shakers, Abel could find no rest until he had made a
                            visit to Watervliet, N. Y., and another to New Lebanon the following summer. When he
                            returned he brought some of the � publications of the Believers, "Christ's Second Appearing"
                            and "Millennial Church." But to return. I lived at Valley Forge about one year, and worked
                            in the machine shop most of the time. My father concluded to start again in his former
                            business, which was wireworking. He took me to the city, where I boarded nearly a year and
                            looked after the business in the shop when he was absent. About the latter part of October,
                            my father moved his family from Valley Forge to the city again, and I went home to live with
                            my mother, brothers and sister. By this time, my father, being intimately acquainted with
                            Abel Knight, had received from him some knowledge of the Shakers, and obtained some books.
                            In the evenings he got the family together and read to us from "Christ's Second Appearing,"
                            or the "Millennial Church." I was interested on account of Community life, and I often felt
                            sorry that our Community had proved a failure. One day, in conversation with my father, I
                            said to him I wished he would let me go to Indiana and see Robert Owen's community. He
                            replied, "They are breaking up ; they are scattering ; it would be useless to go." I had
                            heard my father tell much about the<pb n="125" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Society at Economy in the western
                            part of Pennsylvania, founded by George Rapp. I had passed through the place myself when
                            about ten years of age, had seen their large buildings and pleasant location; and I asked
                            him to let me go and see them. He said, "They are all Germans. Their society does not
                            increase in numbers and will not be what you are expecting." I concluded that I would have
                            to stay where I was. When about sixteen years of age, while in conversation, I told father
                            that I thought I was about old enough to learn a trade. "What trade would you like to
                            learn?" he enquired. I replied, to be a carpenter or machinist. After further conversation,
                            he thought working among machinery would be most agreeable to me, and if I could find a
                            place that would suit me, he would make no objection. Then I turned my attention to the
                            finding of a place such as I had desired. By inquiry I found a situation within a few days
                            which I thought would suit me to perfection. In the establishment of my choice, they
                            manufactured from the heaviest engines to the lightest running machinery; and I felt that my
                            chance for a start in business was about complete. I informed my father of my success and
                            asked him if he would go with me and see the proprietor and make a contract of
                            apprenticeship. He proposed going the next forenoon ; and we went accordingly, to see the
                            head of the firm. As there were no street cars in those days, we walked about two miles and
                            found to my disappointment that the proprietor was not in. The foreman, when informed of our
                            object, was very obliging, showed us through the establishment and informed us that if we
                            would call in the afternoon at two o'clock, we would find the proprietor in his office, as
                            he would inform him of our business. After dinner we started again on our two mile walk. As
                            we drew near the place, my father seemed to slacken his pace ; while I was in a hurry to
                            reach our destination. When we were within a few yards of the office he stopped and observed
                            "I have another thing in view. Before you are bound and cannot get away, if you wish to go
                            to Lebanon and see the Shakers, you may go. If you only make a visit and return, or if you
                            wish to stay until spring, do so. If you would like to make it a permanent home you may; but
                            you must get the consent of your mother if you conclude to stay when you get there." I
                            replied, I should like to go and see the Shakers, but I have not mentioned it to you because
                            I received so little encouragement when I wished to go and see Owen and Rapp's societies.
                            The evening was spent in visiting a Shaker brother who was in the city, and expected to stay
                            but one day. He was the first Shaker that I ever saw. I intended to go home with him if I
                            could get ready, but had not yet obtained the consent of my mother. From her I received a
                            positive denial; it was "you shall not go." She had just returned from an experiment which
                            had proved a failure, and was satisfied that a community could not hold together. I could
                            not blame her feeling as she did, neither was I dis-<pb n="126" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> couraged. The next
                            morning I began pleading for her consent to go to Lebanon. I did not leave the house all day
                            but kept on pleading till about four o'clock in the afternoon when she gave her consent. It
                            was too late to leave the next morning which was Wednesday. In course of the day I learned
                            there was a man in town by the name of John Shaw, who wished to settle some business and go
                            to Lebanon. He would be ready to take the boat on Saturday at noon, and we might be company
                            for each other. At the appointed time Abel and my father accompanied me to the boat to
                            introduce me to John and see us safely off. Here disappointment again awaited me; John did
                            not make his appearance. Then I was asked "Will you wait till another opportunity presents?"
                            I replied, I have had such a time getting away from mother, that 1 prefer to go alone. I
                            think there will be no trouble in finding the way. In those days we could not go from
                            Philadelphia to New York in two hours as we can at the present time. We left at noon, and
                            arrived in New York about one o'clock the next day. The fog was so thick in the bay that we
                            could not see the length of the boat until nearly noon. They rang the boat-bell every few
                            minutes and finally we heard a bell ringing to the left of us. Our pilot steered toward it,
                            and it proved to be a steamboat which had struck on a rock the night before and lay with its
                            deck about one third under water. We took a number of persons from the wreck, but some chose
                            to remain. When we landed in New York I was surprised to see the same Shaker I had seen a
                            few days before, expecting to meet John Shaw and myself; he had business in the city for
                            three or four days longer and I told him I would remain there till he left for home, as it
                            was my first visit and I wanted to see the city. I went to the same hotel where he was
                            stopping and traced out a route, on a map of the city, which I thought would fill up my time
                            in the forenoon to explore, and another for the afternoon, and so employed myself for three
                            days. We then took the night boat for Hudson, where we found a team which brought us out to
                            Lebanon. We arrived at the North Family about seven o'clock in the evening and had a short
                            visit in the Deaconesses' room with some who came from Philadelphia. I there saw a sight I
                            never beheld before. Some of the Sisters sat smoking pipes with stems sixteen or eighteen
                            inches long, and the room was so filled with smoke that everything looked blue. I suppose it
                            appeared stranger, because I had never before seen but one woman smoke a pipe, and that was
                            not more than three inches long. Thanks that its day has passed away to return no more. It
                            was Thanksgiving day. (l&gt;ec. 12.) After our visit we went to the i I 111 Family and
                            stayed.over night. I slept so soundly that I did not awake till some one came to me and said
                            that breakfast was over long ago. They gave me breakfast however, and I returned to the
                            North Family and remained there twenty-five years. The kindred feeling and sympathy which
                            existed between the members of the Val-<pb n="127" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> ley Forge community, was with
                            many, more than an outside show, or an internal selfish personality; it was a religious
                            feeling' that seemed to bind them together. When a few of them found something better than
                            they possessed, they wanted those with whom they had been united to come and share with
                            them. Owing to this mutual interest, there were nearly fifty in this Society at one time who
                            were gathered through the influence of one member acting upon another, and the Elders
                            working with that influence at the right time. Eight of that number are now living in the
                            Society after a period of sixty-three yea'rs, and within a short time the following have
                            passed to the Spirit land: Elizabeth Justice, Jane D. Knight, Ann Busby^ Sarah Woodrow,
                            William Justice, John Shaw and Clawson Middleton. Through the influence of Elder Richard
                            Bushnell and others, I was persuaded that a community cannot exist merely by holding their
                            land and property in joint interest, while in all other respects the associative members
                            live according to the ways and customs practiced in the common course of the world ; but all
                            must come together and live as brothers and sisters of one family, and consider the
                            happiness of others equal with their own. I had no faith in the confession of sin as it was
                            practiced in the world. The custom was, to go to some private place and tell God that they
                            were great sinners, and they hoped he would forgive them; but they never mentioned one crime
                            they had committed, for they supposed he knew their sin already. As this brought no power
                            over sinful desires, nor stopped the sinner's career in sin, I saw no good sense in it. When
                            I understood that the object of confession was to bring the state and condition of our life
                            to judgment through a living witness and to expose the wrongs and follies of human nature as
                            they exist in us, to the light of truth, by an honest confession before those whom we
                            believe have more wisdom and knowledge, or are nearer the fountain of goodness than
                            ourselves, and are able to teach and advise us how to shun the snares and temptations to
                            which we are exposed, I was satisfied and made up my mind to be a Shaker. Have set out many
                            times since. Notwithstanding the many crosses and trials I have encountered, I have never
                            had the first thought of turn ing. back to find comfort and satisfaction in the ways I had
                            forsaken. By carefully maintaining my union and confidence with those who have been
                            appointed to officiate as Elders over the spiritual interests of our family, I have been
                            abundantly protected from the sins of the world and have also secured the union and blessing
                            of my gospel Brethren and Sisters. In this I have learned the important lesson, that
                            "Obedience is better than sacrifice." It was during the days of the great outpouring of
                            spiritual manifestations that an impression came over me which I could not resist. I sought
                            an interview with Elder Richard Bushnell, who at that time was senior Elder of the North
                            Family, and solicited of him the privilege to open my whole life, before I came among
                            Believers and<pb n="128" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> since. A corresponding ministration had occupied the
                            mind of good Elder Richard, and he remarked, "I have solicited the same privilege of the
                            Ministry, and after that is granted I will walk in prayer with you." Perhaps it may not be
                            especially interesting to all who may read my simple story to know how this gift influenced
                            my mind. After retiring to rest for the night, I soon found sleep had departed from me and
                            my mind was actively engaged in meditating on my past life that no transgression nor
                            deviation from the light of truth in my soul might escape my careful correction. Now to
                            return to my younger days. After living here about two years and a half, Abel Knight had
                            business which called him to Philadelphia. The Elders proposed for me to go with him to be
                            gone two or three weeks, and I accepted the offer. When we returned home to Lebanon, we
                            found that there were sixteen of us instead of two. My mother had changed her opinion, and
                            felt differently about the Shakers. She said she felt better satisfied with my being with
                            the Shakers, than she did with the situation of any of the rest of her children and used no
                            influence to persuade me to remain with her. But my grandmother wished me to remain with
                            them and not go back to the Shakers, and as an inducement proposed to set me up with a good
                            shop and a full set of tools. She also proposed for me to start by erecting a building for
                            her, which she contemplated having put up for a dwelling. I was in my twenty-first year, and
                            no doubt it would have been a great temptation, had not my mind been settled to spend my
                            days among Believers. As it was, it had not the least effect upon me. I thanked her for her
                            kind feelings toward me, and told her that I had made my choice for life and must return
                            home. And this is "HOW I CAME TO BE A SHAKER." Those who were gathered through the influence
                            of the Valley Forge community and have passed to the Spirit land are :� John Dodgson, James

                            may be all I shall do, yet I may do more. "Love is God," and is found in everything He has
                            created, though it may not be apparent in many substances at first sight, not even in the
                            most perfect of his handiwork, the noble creature man. Is there anything lovely to the touch
                            or taste of the chestnut, the walnut or the butternut, as they hang on their native stem?
                            But take off the husk and crack the shell, and you will find something in them all that you
                            like, if your taste is like mine. The most disgusting external of the human family has
                            something lovely stowTed away in the secret recesses of the soul, that will be apparent when
                            the shell is opened, though it may be but small in some. This love, or particle of God, is
                            like pent-up water, and needs to have the barrier removed, when it will flow to its likeness
                            and its level; to and from you and all others. The obstruction may be in you,.or it may be
                            in the object of your dislike, but when it is taken away, love to love, or God to God will
                            hasten and mingle, as two or more bodies of water become one wThen all hindrances are taken
                            away. Just look into the flower garden when it is first seeded, and what is there to regale
                            the senses? But wait for the beautiful flowers to show themselves, and what delight meets
                            the eye as well as the nasal organs. See the huge masses of granite, of marble, of iron ore,
                            the trees of the forest, and nature both animate and inanimate, and contemplate the beauties
                            which may be brought to view by the artist and those who devote themselves to the training
                            of beasts, birds and all animated nature. When you see a human form, remember there is a
                            germ of loveliness sheltered somewhere in that casket, and do what you can to break the
                            shell; not the outward form, but the veil of ignorance, superstition, skepticism, unbelief,
                            or whatever may compose the barrier; and if then you find it too early and the nut has not
                            ripened give time to have all things accomplished ; but rest assured that God, or love, is
                            there and will one day spread out its flowTers so as to tingle the organs of sensation
                            delightfully. You have many enemies to fight: this is nothing out of the common course ;
                            every one has just the same in proportion to his strength. When the Israelites were in the
                            wilderness, they lived on manna, and those who gathered much, had nothing over, and those
                            who gathered little had no lack, for all gathered what they were able ;<pb n="130" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> and it is the same, with us. We all have strength equal to our day ; this you see carried
                            out in the present day, where the weak and feeble among us are provided for as well as the
                            strong. You say we are ignorant of what passes in the minds of others : true, but the time
                            is coming when our thoughts will take form, and we shall be transparent, and then we can
                            read each other without the intervention of words. You are correct in your conclusions
                            respecting traditions and false systems, your warfare should be against them and all
                            erroneous theories, instead of those who are so unfortunate as to be cumbered with them, for
                            God hates sin, but loves the sinner. It is so difficult for me to read a letter, that it is
                            impossible for me to trace out the items one by one, as I have to get some one to read, and
                            then before I can collect ideas and put them on paper, I lose the subject, unless it is very
                            prominent, so you will have to wait until we meet, for small matters, for I cannot make them
                            out on paper. Prayer. The spirit of prayer is the portion of God within the mind, and in
                            proportion to the degree which we possess, so shall we feel as God feels in regard to his
                            purposes, which feeling produces the prayer of faith, and we believe such and such purposes
                            will be fulfilled and often have intense anxiety that they may be, and this being the
                            feeling of God we co-operate with Him in consummating his and our purposes. God could, and
                            would accomplish his purposes; but if we are one with Him, we cannot help feeling to unite
                            with Him, and as He is the stronger part of himself, we lean upon and trust in Him. The love
                            of God is of the same quality with the love of the Christian, for his love is shed abroad in
                            our hearts, though we know that the great fountain which supplies all the millions of
                            smaller streams, must exceed those streams, or it would soon be exhausted ; and the streams
                            are liable to become fouled by passing through dirty pipes, but the pure love is the same in
                            all.

God desires in each
                            man truth. The heart is to be the seat of truth, and all conditions are to be the essence of
                            truth. The spirit is to manifest the truth, and the words and actions are to illustrate
                            truth. The entire man is to be the very impersonation of truth. His moral integrity is to be
                            as solid and firm as the rocks. He is to follow after righteousness ; not from feeling, not
                            from a social influence, not from the hope of a temporal gain, nor even of eternal gain, but
                            from principle ; from a true consciousness that it is like God: pleasing to God, and for the
                            good of self and the good of the world. Inward truth stands opposed to inward falsity. The
                            former makes a good character, while the latter is sure to make a bad one. It matters not,
                            what is the reputation of a man, nor<pb n="131" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> his honors ; his manners, nor
                            Iioav winning his wa}Ts, nor however charming his conversation, if his inmost soul is not
                            wedded to the eternal principle of right, and every fiber of his moral nature saturated with
                            devotion to the truth. Inward truth is the very beginning of holiness. It is the heart right
                            in the sight of God, as it is cleanness to the soul and soundness of moral vitality, it is
                            wholeness of spiritual health, it is truth, appropriated, experienced, lived. Truth must be
                            ever accepted as the one great requisite to moral power. God cannot accept a false heart. He
                            may overrule the work of a hypocrite to the good of others but he cannot make hypocrisy,
                            holiness, nor falsehood, truth. Everything about inward falsity is weak, and weakening it
                            tends to dissolution and death. The truth is life. Crushed to earth it will rise again, but
                            falsehood is death. Expose the victim of it and he will wither like a plant plucked up by
                            the roots. Truth enthroned is a kingdom of righteousness that can never be shaken, and that
                            opens toward heaven. Falsehood crowned, is an empire of darkness that trembles every moment
                            on the verge of perdition. Christ is the truth and all who wish to come to the truth must
                            first come to Christ, and if we are of the truth then we are of Christ. If not inwardly true
                            we are not of Christ, and our hope of heaven will become as castles in the air. Get right,
                            be right, know the truth, be the truth. Have every thought, impulse, desire, motive and
                            decision conform to the law of truth.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Simplicity" TEIform="index"/> SIMPLICITY.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Allen, Catherine" TEIform="persName"/> Catherine Allen.</byline><p TEIform="p">Simplicity is the companion of truthfulness; it is undesigning, free from all cunning and

                            </head><p TEIform="p">This month we publish, among other good things, a very interesting communication, "How I
                                came to be a Shaker," from one of the Brethren who has had a long experience in the
                                Community. A life devoted to the cause of Christ has blessed him with knowledge of
                                intrinsic value, which the world could not give, neither can the world take it away.
                                When the heart responds to the inspiration that has been awakened by present needs and
                                carefully and pleasantly traces the pathway over which it has been guided, it may be
                                through this medium that we shall find the fulfillment of the divine word,�Let thy light
                                so shine, that others may be led to glorify God. While it is a matter of interest to
                                learn of the pilgrimage of those who have been called into a higher life, to accept the
                                cross of Christ and to become as children of God, there are many reasons to believe that
                                it will redound to profit in those who read "with the spirit and with the
                                understanding." The life of the Christ is being placed before all people, and an
                                invitation is extended for them to receive it into honest hearts and be made able to
                                grow up in "the nurture and admonition of the Lord." There is also a strong, counter
                                influence outflowing from low and disreputable sources which lead into darkness and on
                                to death. To be able to accept the one as the precious gift of God, as the waters that
                                are welling up unto everlasting life, and to close the avenues of the mind to the other,
                                is a victory in which there is much reason for rejoicing. When Jesus extends the
                                invitation for others to come and share with him in the blessings of the new kingdom of
                                God, it is to those who are weary of walking in paths that do not afford rest to the
                                soul; those who are in sorrow, and over-taxed with the selfish relations of this world :
                                to those who are sick and in need of a physician, and indeed to all who would- wish to
                                change from their present position to one higher and<pb n="133" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> "Nearer, my
                                God, to Thee." The voice reaches a James, a John, a Matthew, a Peter and many others
                                while they are busily engaged in their personal interests and in building up the
                                kingdoms of this world. They listen, accept and are baptized into the life-element of
                                the new spiritual work and then, in turn, they begin the work of evangelization. How
                                differently must have been the ministration of John from that of Peter, or the
                                ministration of James from that of Matthew, as they passed from house to house with
                                their simple story of being in the world and yet not of the world ; of being raised from
                                the dead and yet never having passed from life. Their mission was to save souls for the
                                happiness and prosperity of humanity and the success of that mission, must be found in
                                the records on high. Called by the same spirit of God to give our lives, a free-will
                                offering for the peace and happiness of humanity, we must fulfill our sacred mission to
                                the extent of our ability or be counted as unprofitable servants in the kingdom of our
                                God. How much more commendable it would be for the Christian, and no less for all by
                                whom he may be surrounded, that he should talk and write of God's call to his soul, of
                                his resurrection into life and his growing interest in the coming of Christ's Kingdom
                                among men, than it is for him to profess the acceptance of Christ while he still lives
                                in the old inheritance and talks and writes of the carnal relations by which he was
                                surrounded. Better think more and write more of our mission to humanity even though it
                                may never grace the columns of a publication. Keep it, re-read it and re-write it and
                                hold it for the inspection of our guardian angels and for those with whom we may
                            reside.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Elder Henry:--Some remarks in our morning service..." TEIform="index"/>

                            to insert a few from Br. William Briggs, which we are sure will be appreciated by gospel
                            friends abroad, as much as is the good brother at home by those who know him best. "We have
                            just been singing the words,� 'O glorious, glorious foundation! Most safely I'm building
                            thereon.' but I question if seven-eighths of the number who have joined in singing these
                            words, really comprehend their true meaning. In laying the foundation of any material
                            structure we dig deep into the earth and lay stone by stone, most carefully placing the
                            cement between each for security and if such foundation be laid sufficiently deep, the frost
                            cannot displace it, the rain harm nor the wind overthrow it, so securely is the work done.
                            It certainly requires no less pains to lay the foundation of a spiritual character. I have
                            found it<pb n="134" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> necessary to dig deep into the soil of a natural heart and to
                            remove therefrom, by an honest confession, all unprofitable elements, the evil motives and
                            false imaginations which are so prone to rule therein. These duties having been well
                            performed we may now lay stone by stone or principle by principle, a foundation upon which a
                            true spiritual character can rest securely. I have learned not to place my trust in an "arm
                            of flesh." My confidence is in (Jod, that through obedience to his Order and an honest
                            confession of all sin, in humility of spirit, L shall find the needed strength to mret all
                            trials and be able to possess as m}7 treasure, the graces and gifts of the spirit, and thus
                            is my foundation laid in the principles of the Gospel; in other words, I am, in this way,
                            building safely upon this glorious foundation as referred to in the piece sung. I do not
                            count our success as Believers, by the numbers we are able to present, neither am I
                            discouraged by human failures. Many persons come to our Community for the loaves and fishes
                            ; but I hope it may occur in my day, that there may be men gathered to us, who will be
                            willing to confess their sins and take up their crosses. I am thankful for the experience I
                            have had in this way from early childhood, it is more to me than all else. It places my
                            confidence in a Source which never fails." We are surrounded on every side by hard and
                            tangible realities. Every day of life brings its own task; each task is an opportunity; and
                            when fulfilled, may be a step towards a higher life.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="P., M." TEIform="persName"/>M.

                                Lebanon. Thank you for the advanced copy of the Manifesto. It is like the month (May)
                                bright and betokens good things for the future. You truthfully remark that mankind are
                                going up and not down. They are moving toward God the Father of light and the dispenser
                                of all good gifts. A few more steps in this direction will lead them to acknowledge a
                                heavenly Mother, and when she is found the wheels of progress, as Sister Emily Ofl'ord
                                says in her excellent article, will roll more rapidly. The fire that was kindled in the
                                first appearing of Christ, has been and is beingrekindled by her testimony. Believers
                                should fan the flames and increase the fire by throwing into it those things which the
                                spirit of God does not approve. The accumulated brush from orchards put on the asparagus
                                bed was burned four days earlier than last year. By the help of a quart or two of
                                kerosine it burned with rapidity. Is it not so with individuals? When prepared and
                                willing to be helped, they are readily touched by the gospel fire and find enough to
                                consume, as we by searching find the moth and the miller, the rubbish and dirt where we
                                least expect it, upon cleaning our houses. "Our God is a consuming fire." She will not
                                only clean out every vestige as small as a breast pin or a finger ring, that savors of a
                                worldly life, but the very spirit that would keep that life alive. Not only sins
                                committed, but the nature of sin that we all possess is embraced in the testimony of
                                Mother, and whoever accepts this must part with their dearest idols. The idol may be a
                                father, mother, son or daughter, husband or wife, selfish prop-<pb n="135" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>
                                erty�or some bad habit like smoking or chewing tobacco, it must eventually be consumed
                                by the fire of truth. And happy and glorified is that soul "who spares no idol, great or
                                small." Our good father, Elder Frederic, is still a prisoner. The wound is healing
                                nicely. In mind lie is as active as ever, always reading or writing when not conversing
                                or sleeping. We have finished house cleaning and have on hand two hundred dozen shirts
                                to make. It would seem that every man and boy should own as much as one, but alas!
                                alas!! Booth's "Darkest England" tells the story and New York city might repeat it.
                                Brethren are preparing gardens, and Sisters have raked the door-yards. Cows were turned
                                out to pasture the 21st of present month, earlier than ever before known. If the readers
                                of the Manifesto are interested in weather reports, there is a lively little paper
                                called "Words and Works," that is printed at St. Louis, Mo., foretelling the state of
                                the weather; and by it, we learn that frost and snow will give us one more call in May
                                ere winter takes its final departure. In the meanwhile the grass will grow and flowers
                                bloom, and seed-time and harvest will not fail, no more than can the love of the Gospel
                                fail. O, there's a love that can never die, 'Tis pure as the heavens, warm as the sun in
                                the noonday sky. It giveth life, health and endless joy, And liftcth souls from earth. O
                                come ye needy, share this love, It is of heavenly birth. A. W.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Enfield, Connecticut" TEIform="index"/> Enfield, Conn.</head><p TEIform="p">May 8, 1891. With abundant reason for thankfulness for the blessings which surround us on
                                every hand we are progressing heavenward. The scenery is delightful at the present time,
                                trees in full bloom on every side, and although two severe frosts have visited our
                                section of the Connecticut valley the past week, we do not despair of having some
                                cherries and pears, but peaches will probably be a failuie. The work of potato planting
                                has been very much assisted by the new Planter, which works well, and is a success. Oats
                                are in and stocked down some ten days ago. Grass is looking well, and with a little rain
                                now will be of great value to vegetation. The apple trees are coming forward, and hopes
                                are entertained of a good yield. Our new Lawn Mower is highly prized in keeping the
                                grass in good order around the dwellings. To beautify home within and without, is the
                                duty of all Christians, therefore we would improve each and every opportunity to cleanse
                                the sanctuary, that we may make those around us cheerful and happy, and also have a
                                greeting ready for any who may come to seek for truth. M. Witham.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Harvard, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Harvard, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p">April 26, 1891. Deab Editok :�On the 15th of April we were again summoned to the bedside
                                of one of our dear mothers, to see her spirit take its flight for the heavenly spheres.
                                It was a joyful parting; there was not a tear of sorrow shed, for she died as she had
                                lived a sunbeam of cheer and strength to all around her. All through her sickness she
                                manifested the spirit of gratitude and love to those who were attending to her little
                                wants. A gleam of cheer and sunshine was always on her countenance, and after receiving
                                the little kindnesses which so many bestowed, she would always look up with a smile of
                                thankfulness. Thus did our dear mother pass on to the higher stage of existence. She
                                left the primary for the higher grade where all the faculties can be brought into use
                                and develop what they cannot here, a full, perfect womanhood. The funeral of our Sister
                                was attended on Sunday the 19th. Quite a company of her friends were present to give in
                                their tribute of respect. A wise Quaker wrote, says George J. Holyoke, "I expect to pass
                                through this world but once. If therefore, there be<pb n="136" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> any kindness I
                                can show, or any good thing I can do to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not
                                defer nor neglect it for I shall not pass this way again (in the body.) Let this be my
                                epitaph. What I spent I had. What I saved I left behind. What I gave away I took with
                                me." Never have our doctrinal positions needed more helpers. Never before opportunities
                                so ample and gi*and, with hopes so inspiring and glorious, ever and steadily pointing to
                                an early revelation of the spirit of Christ in the true principles. Never, Heaven
                                helping us, shall its dearly purchased banner of virgin purity and consecration be
                                lowered by our consent. Around its standard, m;ule sacred by the heroic devotion of tLc
                                living advocates of truth, let us battle on, hand in hand, heart to heart. Young
                                Brethren and Sisters, we will stand by the noble principles of redemption to mankind,
                                and by its living inspirations, and our Zion shall become as a beautiful tree. If there
                                is inspiration in anything under the sun, should it not be in living in holiness, and
                                redeeming our time? Like the spring that is opening upon us, why not look upward and
                                draw down a new inspiration of spiritual life and strength. Two weeks since our dear
                                editor sent a request to me to help him do a little missionary work by sending out some
                                of our religious publications, and so spread a further knowledge of our faith. This
                                invitation I can readily accept. Brethren and Sisters, can we not do a little in this
                                line to help those who are doing so much? Let our dear editor see by the next month's
                                issue that he is not alone in his noble work. Farming has commenced, though the spring
                                seems quite backward. A few potatoes, peas, onions and beets have been planted. A. D.

H.</head><p TEIform="p">May 16, 1891. Time, like everything which belongs to time is marching rapidly along.
                                Already the first quarter of the new year has passed into history, and has carried us
                                from the severities of a winter climate to the inspiring influences of spring. New life
                                has awakened the trees and plants and meadows, and they are budding and blossoming with
                                a beauty that gives inspiration to every heart. God's beautiful gifts can never grow
                                old. With spring comes the seed-time and through the careful management of this, the
                                anticipation of a plentiful harvest. The gardeners are closely noticing every indication
                                of the germinating of choice plants, as their summer hope of happiness depends to a
                                certain extent on the growth of the indispensable asparagus, and then of the nice, early
                                potatoes, as well as the corn, beans and peas. How hard and yet how interestedly we work
                                to obtain a little food to assist in sustaining life. Our cherry and plum trees are now
                                in full bloom. A good share of the cherries will be claimed by the red-breasted Kobin
                                family, as compensation for their early, morning songs, while the plums will probably be
                                appropriated to the uses of the curculio. Some persons advocate the planting of so many
                                trees as to exhaust the labors of the insects and then have a supply of perfect fruit
                                for table use. Many of our plum and cherry trees have been ruined by the black knot, and
                                we fail to find a remedy to prevent this wholesale destruction. The introduction of an
                                earthquake since our last, enters into the list of variations. It succeeded quite well
                                in giving us a shock, and frightening us with an in or tm-earthly sound. Some through
                                fright ran out of the houses, but finding themselves unharmed they soon returned to
                                their dwellings and to their duties. On the 30th of last month Eldress Rosetta Cumings
                                and Sr. Katie West from Enfield, N. H., made us a visit of one day, and on the *7th
                                inst. Br. Wm. Wilson from the same Society, also called to see us for a few hours. All
                                as gospel friends were made welcome to the blessings of our consecrated home. *<pb n="137" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> Weather Record, for April, 1891. Highest Temp, during the mo. 73.

                                which empty minds resort as something safe to converse upon, when "all but that has
                                fled," yet it has grown to be so erratic, it is really worthy of mention. We had our May
                                weather in April, lovely warm days, but within a week have had thermometer below
                                freezing; plants that had braved the winter months in the south windows of the dining
                                hall, were transplanted into open air beds, just in time to be frost-bitten and die at
                                last. Eight here I think Br. Daniel Orcutt, who has blessed the young people with so
                                many words of wisdom, would moralize in this wise. "Haste makes waste," concerning
                                things terrestrial or otherwise, and none could gainsay it; yet if we learn from our
                                mistakes (and the wise always do) just as effectually as by any other means, we shall
                                never spend precious time in regrets. "Groweth the morning from pray to gold, Up my
                                heart and greet the sun! Yesterday's cares are a tale that is told; Yesterday's tasks
                                are a work that is done. Buried beneath the billows of sleep Yesterday's toils are as if
                                they were not. Lay them low in the soundless deep, Resolve that the future with wisdom
                                be fraught." The earthquake that we learn was distinctly felt at Canterbury, we did not
                                realize at all. We wisli it might portend more than the disturbance of natural elements
                                to us all. Should like to learn from a reliable source, some Society nearer the scene of
                                action than we are, if the current newspaper story of a religious awakening in Indiana,

                                quantities to yield the increase; and yet with all our apprehensions, "We love to think
                                that God appoints Our portion day by day; Events of life are in his hand, And we can

                                from in the days of long ago. We have no remembrance of how they conducted their house
                                cleaning, but we do not believe they hunted bugs in their rugs or were ever bothered
                                with such an unmitigated nuisance as the modern carpet beetle. We have tried every
                                ordinary and extraordinary remedy as a means for destroying them but they live and
                                continue to live growing more and more numerous each year. The cold wave and snow storm
                                that swept by here last week failed to injure the fruit buds as many predicted it would.
                                The pear, cherry and pe*ach trees are weighted with their blossoms of sweetness.
                                Honey-bees and bumble-bees Find refuge in the trees, They live and thrive and grow and
                                hive, In spite of snow or breeze. Hay pressing and shipping continues the same as before
                                adding a mite to the needed funds, that go to make up the great sum of earthly wants.

"Time is eternity, fraught with all eternity can give." Thus sings the poet.
                                Well here we are, at the first day of May. "We are all in good health. Our late potatoes
                                were planted yesterday. The day before was the solemn anniversary of our South Family
                                fire, when a whole family was broken up and in one day divided among the remaining
                                families. Such orcurrences, if they can do any good, may remind us that "we have no
                                abiding city here, but seek one whose master and builder is God." Amen! God's will be
                                done. Every tree in our apple orchard is in full bloom. Oats all in. Heavy breadth. A
                                sister probationer joins the Church today. We are putting up a few medicines for those
                                who think they must have them, but Union Village fights shy of all medical drugs. We
                                have replanted our young orchards of apple, pear, peach, plum, cherry and quince. They
                                stood the long drouth last summer quite well. But we nursed them very carefully by
                                watering and fertilizing, else many more would have perished than did. Our North Union
                                suit was decided in our favor. Elder Joseph is at Cleveland watching the case. I fear
                                another drouth is on, like last year; hut if we will persist in cutting away all the
                                green forests, we must look for drouths and cyclones. I hope the Government will soon
                                pass a Code of Forestry Laws, and make the same sufficiently stringent and compulsory to
                                secure our land from utter destruction. Pastures hecoming abundant and milk and butter
                                increasing accordingly. School will close about the first of June, proximo. We are
                                making calculations for a thorough renovation of our street fences and have made several
                                miles of farm fencing during 1Jie past year. La Grippe left a number of negatives here
                                both among ourselves and our tenants, but we didn't allow him to finish any of his
                                pictures and now he is gone, we hope never to return. We commence planting corn to-day.
                                We used to commence planting about the 21st of April. Kind regards, O. C.

                                which makes us feel anxious to put the seed into the ground as fast as possible. Our
                                grain is sowed, potatoes planted and we are ready for corn planting. We are having a
                                beautiful spring, just now. It seems to me that the blossoms on the cherry, plum and
                                pear trees never looked so lovely as at this time, and a promise of a bountiful yield of
                                all kinds of fruit this season. We have been much favored through the winter just

                            there be no blots on the page. You cannot go back on your past lives to repair aught that
                            was amiss. You can best evince your regret for past errors by resolutely striving to avoid
                            them in future. The present is yours, wisely improve it. Think what you should do, and
                            strive to do it. Make each day a useful day. A wasted day in your lives should be regretted.
                            There is always an effort to make, if the heavenly prize you would take. Work and win it. Be
                            strong in faith and deed, ere long you will succeed. It is every-day work living to God.
                            Begin now. Battle for the right and be right yourselves. It hardens the heart to live in
                            sin. Spare your sins and spoil your happiness. Don't yield to sin. Make and keep good vows,
                            let them call forth daily practical effort. Good eilorts will gain reward. Let virtue be
                            your guiding star. Pure thoughts and deeds are of untold value and thousands disregard their
                            worth. If you are pure in heart, others breathing your spiritual atmosphere become nobler
                            and purer. Whether you intend it or not, you are always either helping or hurting others by
                            your unconscious influence. You can never say, "Though I do not help, neither will I
                            hinder," for you are ahvays doing one or the other.. Let your example be for good and not
                            for evil. Be watchful and prayerful and avoid grief<pb n="140" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> and trouble.
                            Commit yourselves to God for instruction and guidance. "In Wisdom's way there is joy and
                            delight." Walk therein. Make your heaven here. It is heaven all the way to heaven. Be modest
                            and unassuming. Walk in the light, in the truth persevere, This will insure you a Happy New

                                good time laden with articles most excellent; not a fault to find. We have had very
                                little rain, and we farmers would be inclined to complain, but for the nice time we have
                                had getting in crops. We have some twenty acres of rye, seven of wheat (which is badly
                                winter killed;) some forty acres of oats, and are now planting corn, about sixteen
                                acres, mostly for the silo. One very noticeable improvement on the public highway has
                                been made between the Church and Center families; the ditch has been cleared and the
                                road rounded up nicely. Let the good work go on till perfection is reached from north to
                                south; till the rocks and stones, brush heaps and ash heaps, brambles and briers are all
                                removed to their proper places, and we have a highway, and all our by-ways indicate
                                holiness unto the Lord. Elder Frederick has so far recovered that he comes to the family
                                table, and has moved up to his own room. Orchards are nearly in full bloom, and promise
                                an abundant harvest. We are very much pleased to learn that six Sisters from Enfield,
                                N. H., are going to make our and other Societies a visit this summer. Let the

                                unselfish serving, which brings to us every month a feast of good things�a feast that
                                never cloys nor brings sluggishness to body or mind,, but always has a contrary effect,
                                and is very moreish. Spring is here in her vestal robes. Though not complete, she is
                                decked with abundance of cherry and pear blossoms, and apple blossoms just peeping
                                forth, promise a prolonging of the gay show, and foretoken a plenteous harvest, when the
                                round of the seasons have completed their work. Farm crops are all planted and gardening
                                is well under way. Peas are up but we need rain. The first asparagus was cut about the
                                second of May. Cattle were turned out to pasture in the latter part of April, but an
                                observant brother remarked that they had to stand and wait for the grass to grow. Roads
                                have been mended. As we travelled about, for a month past, the semiyearly rout of dirt
                                and furniture, proved the interest of our Sisters in promoting cleanliness, one of the
                                signs of true civilization. Cheeriest blessings, manifold, ever attend their patient
                                labors. The meeting house seems customarily the last place to be visited with the
                                purging and ablution, which is regarded as preliminary to the season's meetings. If it
                                were only done earlier, what pleasant seasons we might have, that now slip by, without
                                reaching unto our best, in one way, but perhaps in another we do. Let us� "Live to some

Dear Editor:�Since our last communication to you, sickness has invaded our
                                home, and for a time the illness threatened to become epidemic. However, it soon grew
                                beautifully less, and as all who were ailing are convalescing, nothing alarming is
                                apprehended. The disease seemed to be closely allied to La Grippe, though it took a
                                different form. Elder Louis was seriously ill for several days, and the doctor
                                pronounced it a case of Grippe complicated with other difficulties. At this date he is
                                slowly recovering. The recent cold wave passed over our section of country, but owing to
                                the backwardness of the season, it is thought the fruit buds were but slightly injured.
                                Weather is now warm and pleasant, but rain is needed for vegetation. Nature is most

On the night of the 5th inst. quite a heavy frost fell, doing considerable
                                damage in this section of country. Cherries and raspberries were greatly injured.
                                Fortunately our gardeners prepared for Jack Frost, and had most, if not all early
                                vegetables covered. Spring finally began to assert her right, and from the rapid
                                advancement of vegetation we knew at last that, "Spring had come bright and fair, With
                                flowers blooming everywhere." On the 8th inst. we had a swarm of bees. Our trustee, Br.

                                realized. Strawberry season is close at hand. The West Family are taking the lead with
                                the early variety. The 10th inst. a dear Sister of said family brought the writer a
                                saucer of fine, large berries, which were highly appreciated. This is one of the kind
                                acts that will never fade away. House cleaning is proceeding rapidly and smoothly under

There is a beautiful economy in all God's
                                works. There is no real waste anywhere. If God saves every atom of material in carrying
                                out His works, surely it becomes us to be thoughtful of the use we make of that which is
                                entrusted to us. A good steward is ready to give an itemized statement of all that is
                                entrusted to him, and no less will be expected of us. "A true account must yet be
                                given." If we could but realize more fully that the blessings we enjoy are only ours in
                                trust, we should be more prudent of them. There are comforts and blessings multiplied
                                continually, if only we will be thankful and rightly improve them. It is often the very
                                lavishness with which our blessings are showered down which renders the human heart
                                insensible to its many comforts. There is frequently more thoughtlessness involved in
                                the lack of appreciation. Whatever fragments can be made useful are worth saving, and we
                                are wise indeed when we gather them up and make the most oi them. 3744 spaces of cream
                                were sold in April. A space is nineteen sixtieths of an inch. Strawberry plants are
                                quite promising. A fair crop of peaches may be expected for home use. Our Hubbard
                                squashes will probably last till June! Growing chicks need animal food to build up a
                                strong frame of muscle and bone, and the more exercise they get Use more of this food
                                they will find. They should be allowed to range the fields where insects and worms
                                abound. Whole wheat for chicks is better than all soft food. Hens should have plenty of
                                bulky food. Grain alone is too concentrated. D.

                            Phoebe J. B. Wait, in The Ladies'' Home Journal, I have known of but few failures. On the
                            contrary, I know of many who have achieved fortunes, and who are enjoying a lucrative
                            practice. Prejudice? Yes, there is prejudice against them. But it is the same prejudice that
                            does not allow women to have political suffrage; the same that objects to women being
                            anything but housekeepers or butterflies. There is no foundation for it whatever, and it
                            will pass away in time. I h'nd that foreigners, Germans especially, who have been accustomed
                            to niidwives in their own country, take most kindly to female practitioners. It is the
                            American people that stick to the old exploded theory of woman's inability to own and manage
                            property, to buy and sell, or to follow a learned profession. During the last
                            quarter-century thirty-eight medical colleges have been opened to women, and seven others',
                            are exclusively for women. In the West they are more liberal than in the East. There are
                            to-day upwards of three thousand women practitioners, where, twenty-five years ago there
                            were but a score! It is argued that women dislike the sight of blood. Of course they do. So
                            do men. When I commenced the study of medicine I was fully convinced that women would not
                            make good surgeons. But a long experience has reversed that conviction. Many of them
                            undoubtedly possess the nerve to perform any surgical operation. They do their work in a
                            masterly manner, and without flinching. The theory that woman's nervous temperament and
                            sympathetic nature militates against her in this connection, is absolutely false.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>Deaths.</head><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Gooden, Susannah M."

Better still, we will deliver the set complete on small easy payments, to suit the

disappoint. Why waste time, money and patience on
others, when you can buy the BEST at same price ?
Make no mistake this year ; send 10 cents for Vick'S
Floral Gttide, deduct the 10 cents from first order,
and it costs nothing. It is better than eyer ; ioo large
pages, colored plates, grand novelties worthy of
cultivation.    Cash prizes $1000 and $200.                 ,.
