" Penny wise and Pound

it economy to use cheap ro in and soda soaps, or washing powders of any kind, instead of the good old Dobbins'
Electric Soap; i< r sale by all
grocers since 1869, and used
during all that time by millions of intelligent economical
women who know its merits,
and therefore use it. All
who use itpraise it as the best,
cheapest, and most economical soap made, but if you will
try it, even just once, it will
tell a much stronger tale of
its merits itself. Ask your

An Interesting Account of the
                                    People, Their Society, Homes, and Modes of Life. On Friday, Oct. 27th and on Sunday
                                    thi! Shirley and Harvard Shaker Communities observed the 100th anniversary of their
                                    Societies' foundation. What was also more interesting, the anniversary exercises
                                    were held in the old meeting-house which was dedicated to tluj uses ot the Society
                                    one hundred years ago, after much effort on the part of the Shakers, trials,
                                    troubles and persecutions from those who oppose 1 them. TLie anniversary exercises
                                    commenced with singing; Elder Whiteley announcing for the occasion their hymn, "The
                                    Hour of Devotion." The usual services of the Society were interspersed with hymns,
                                    recitations and addresses particularly appropriate to the occasion, and at the
                                    conclusion, Elder John Whiteley made an address of welcome. The members of the
                                    Community at Harvard were present and remained to the collation served at the
                                    conclusion of the exercises, and departed for home just before sundown. Elder John
                                    Whiteley referred to the early experiences of the founders of the faith, the
                                    sufferings and privations they endured and the persecutions they suffered, and
                                    compared their lot with that of their predecessors. He spoke of the trials of Mother
                                    Ann, the joy and pride the original Shakers felt when they moved into the new
                                    meeting-house they now stood in and loved so well, and urged all to stand fast in
                                    the faith and live the principles of their belief in their daily lives. BRIEF
                                    HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT. The Societies at Shirley and Harvard and, indeed, all those
                                    formed in this country, grew out of the exertions of Mother Ann Lee who (a history
                                    of the movement says) was the very foundation of Shakerism in this country. Ann Lee
                                    was born in Manchester, England, in 1735, of humble parents. At an early age she
                                    showed strong and remarkable religious tendencies and had very pronounced opinions
                                    upon the subject of matrimony. In 1758 she joined the Shakers, then a growing body
                                    in England, introduced there from France, and from the very outset became a
                                    conspicuous figure, in DECEMBER<pb n="274" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 274 THE MANIFESTO. f..ct, the
                                    head and shoulders of the movement she had joined. In 1774, in company with a few
                                    faithful followers, she sailed for this country, and from that time Shakerism in
                                    England receded and finally disappeared, while here it spread, fostered in a great
                                    measure by this remarkable woman. The community Settled in New York, but in 1776 one
                                    of the number, who Avas a man of some wealth, purchased land in what was then a
                                    wilderness and here the little band located, grew and prospered. Their zeal and
                                    enthusiasm was surprising and they frequently clashed with others differing with
                                    them. In the summer of 1792, some time after Mother Ann Lee had made a tour through
                                    this section, the heads of seven families in Shirley, twelve in Lancaster and one in
                                    Harvard, all professing faith in the new belief that remarkable woman taught,
                                    consulted together for the purpose of considering the expediency of building a
                                    public house of worship. The time for such action seemed to be ripe, and,
                                    accordingly they sent to New Lebanon, N. Y., to Father Meacham for his counsel and
                                    consent to build a meeting-house and organize a community. Father Meacham looked
                                    favorably upon their petition and sent back a covenant such as the community at New
                                    Lebanon had adopted. This set forth that the new meeting-house should be built by
                                    free contributions and none were to give who could not do so without incurring any
                                    debt, none were to give more than they were able to spare, that the house must be
                                    for joint religious and not common use so that none could acquire a sole right of
                                    government for what they had done and that the property be changed from private to
                                    public and from common to sacred uses. This covenant was adopted by the Shirley body
                                    and the work of getting together the timbers for the meetinghouse at once commenced.
                                    Work of construction on the frame began in August and on the night of Oct. 31, 1792,
                                    so as not to arouse the settlers who opposed and persecuted them, the frame was
                                    raised. Little more was done until the following spring when work was resumed and
                                    the building completed. The first service in the new meeting-house was held Oct. 27,
                                    1793, and was the occasion of much rejoicing by the little band of Believers. The
                                    usual wide difference in the amounts contributed is noticeable on the records, which
                                    have been remarkably well kept and preserved. Samuel Whittemore gave $333.33, Samuel
                                    Whitney $18, Aaron Lyon $20, all in cash; Moses Hay ward gavj a yoke of oxen worth
                                    $45 ; Priscilla, Elizabeth and Grace Phillips gave cattle valued at $83.78; Molly
                                    Worcester contributed $3 to the cause, and 90 cents, the widow's mite of Mary
                                    Buttrick, is recorded as faithfully and in as bold, round hand writing as the five
                                    figure gift of Whittemore. Most of the early Shakers had property, and although the
                                    community was small, it was soon in possession of a large acreage of land. Previous
                                    to the establishment of the regular community the Believers had resided with their
                                    families and conducted their af-<pb n="275" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 275 fairs
                                    independently instead of in com-'. nion. The ministrations of Mother Ann, her visits
                                    and attacks upon the sins and follies of the times, aroused their opponents into
                                    acts of violence, but the strange new faith spread rapidly in New England. About
                                    1780 the new and peculiar faith was gaining quite a foothold in Shirley and the
                                    people opposed to it were becoming alarmed at the spread. In 1783 the persecutors
                                    rose against the Shakers and would have killed Mother Ann had the faithful not hid
                                    her in a closet in the house of a Shaker. The house still stands and is a part of
                                    the buildings owned by the community. John Whiteley, the present presiding Elder and
                                    Trustee of the communities of Shirley and Ayer, has held the position of presiding
                                    Elder since Nov. 27, 1871, and the trusteeship since January, 1884. He is nearly
                                    seventy-five years old, but is strong and vigorous and able to conduct the affairs
                                    of the Society for several years to come. He is beloved by all his community as a
                                    devout Christian and the soul of integrity and honor. He was born in Huddersfield,
                                    England, and came to America in the summer of 1842. He first located at Newburgh, N.
                                    Y., but in 1843 took up a government section of eighty acres of land in Illinois,
                                    near the town of Elgin. During his four years' residence there he followed his
                                    trade, wool sorter, in Dayton and Elgin, but the fever and ague affected him so
                                    badly that to save his life the doctors ordered him to return East. He returned,
                                    made his home in Lowell and obtained employment in the wool room of the Middlesex
                                    company but, after a year there, moved to Audover and commenced work in the
                                    Ballardvale wool room. One day soon after he commenced work conversation turned upon
                                    religious subjects, all the men freely expressing their views. Finally Mi. Whiteley
                                    gave his ideas and a fellowworker exclaimed: "Whiteley, you ought to go to the
                                    Shakers." On being asked why, he said "Because you talk like a Shaker." This man had
                                    visited the community at Enfield, bringing back some of their literature which he
                                    offered to loan to Mr. Whiteley, an offer gladly accepted. After carefully reading
                                    the work and studying its doctrines he discussed the subject with his partner in
                                    life. After due deliberation, they determined to visit Shirley and look into the
                                    mode of living of this people. In March, 1849, Mr. and Mrs. Whiteley moved to
                                    Shirley and joined the South family, where they lived four years. Mr. Whiteley was
                                    then appointed Elder and Trustee of the North family and held the position until he
                                    was called as presiding Elder of the joint communities of Harvard and Shirley.
                                    Father Eleazer Rand was the first presiding Elder and held the position from
                                    February, 1791, to November, 1808. He was succeeded by Elder John Warner, who held
                                    office to June, 1828. Grove B. Blanchard then held the office until his health
                                    failed and Elder John Whiteley was called to take his place, Nov. 27, 1871. When the
                                    church was organized in 1791, Nathan Willard was appointed<pb n="276" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 276
                                    THE MANIFESTO. Trustee. In July, 1832, he died and was succeeded by Jonas Nutting,
                                    who held the position to October, 1867. Leander A. Persons succeeded him and in
                                    January, 1884, Elder John Whiteley was called to succeed him. Not far from the
                                    homestead may be seen a little cemetery where the leaders of the movement sleep the
                                    long sleep. The resting places of the early members are marked by rude stones and
                                    brief inscriptions, some having only initials on the stone. Of late the stones have
                                    a more modern touch, but are still plain and neat, becoming the character of the
                                    Society. Here rest some of those who gave the first subscriptions towards founding
                                    the Society and in another little plot rest the others. The daily routine of the
                                    community is seldom varied. They rise at the same hour, each performs his or her
                                    allotted task, or doing necessary and reasonable work according to his abilities and
                                    qualifications. Their food is plain and well cooked and is served at reasonable
                                    hours. All are expected to retire at 9 p.m. Sundays differ little from other days
                                    except that there is a cessation of labors and the addition of devotional exercises.

                            :�David Darrow, Daniel Moseley and Solomon King. With this able re-inforcement, a. greater
                            work was accomplished, and the testimony of truth spread with w nderful rapidity among those
                            who were religiously inclined. In the month of December, the Believers had another
                            experience with some lawless characters, who surrounded the house when a meeting was being
                            held. The mob did some screaming and tooting and then finished their work by breaking the
                            glass in several of the windows. The missionaries at this time, had so far progressed, that
                            they held in thvir ranks, several of the most able ministers of the revival. John Dunlavy,
                            Richard Me Nemar and Matthew Houston were ordained Ministers of the Presbyterian church, and
                            Iy their wellordered lives had maintained a powerful influence over the minds of the people.
                            On the 15th of July, 1806, Elders Issachar Bates, Benjamin S. Youngs with Richard Me Nemar,
                            again visited Kentucky. It Avas a disagreeable journey on account of the cold weather, and
                            some four inches of snow on the ground. On the 22nd, they attended a meeting, but they
                            represent it as a Babel of confusion. A large company of rude characters were present,
                            evidently to make disturbance. Although the meeting continued some four hours, the Brethren
                                found<pb n="277" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 277 no opportunity to eueak, as the confusion
                            of singing and dancing aud speaking by these disturbers of the meeting was so great that the
                            Brethren thought it prudent to remain quiet. On the 23rd of February, 1806, the Brethren
                            attended a meeting at Paint Lick, where some three-hundred people had gathered. The service
                            was held at intervals throughout the day and then through most of the night. People of all
                            religious persuasions living n this part of the country, were in attendance and took part in
                            the services. An assembly of a thousand persons met on the 8th of June, and were addressed
                            by Elder Benjamin S. Youngs. He spoke for an hour and a half. Some disturbance was
                            attempted, but for so vast a multitude, the people behaved very well. It was in this meeting
                            that the first colored man accepted the faith. He was a slave of a man by the name of
                            Fisher. Elder Issachar Bates writes,�After we had gathered a goodly number of souls in Ohio
                            and northern Kentucky, several of us went into Kentucky, Logan Co., and gathered some
                            twentythree lovely souls of adult age. Two of the Brethren had occasion to go- to Long Lick
                            to obtain a load of salt. Following the custom of the Believers, they knelt by the side of
                            the table, before and after eating. The hostess seeing this new feature was anxious to know
                            about these two men, and accordingly asked,� Are you Quakers? Nay. What are you? We are
                            Shakers. From this little instance, the whole family were converted to the faith. These
                            missionaries were obliged to accommodate themselves to their surroundings, as best they
                            could. Their meetings were sometimes held in the woods, and the speaker was obliged to stand
                            on a log while preaching, that his voice might be heard distinctly. At other times they held
                            their meetings in the house of some friend, or in a school-house or even in the drive way of
                            a barn. The word of God must be delivered and these messengers soon found it to be a duty to
                            hold their meetings where they could find a company ready to receive it. [Elder Benjamin
                            relates the following of himself as a miraculous preservation or a special Providence, in
                            being protected from abuse at the hands of three sons of Belial. Ed.] Benj.�I left Matthew
                            Houston's home and rode nine miles to the dwelling of Francis Sasseen. When near Lancester,
                            I met three men on horseback. After passing me a few steps, they ordered me to stop. One of
                            the company then said to me,� Ihree.�Where are you going? Benj.�Toward Danville. Three.�What
                            are you going to do there ? Benj.�Why? Three.�Because we do not suffer such fellows as you
                            are to travel through our country. No Quaker has a right to pass through these parts.
                            Benj.�I am not a Quaker. Three.�You look like one by your dress. Benj.�It seems strange that

                            should so insult a man, peaceably traveling on the road. They then rode nearer to me and
                            with an oath demanded,� Three.�What is your profession? Benj.�My profession is to treat
                            people civilly. They repeated the question and received the same answer. Three.�Do you know
                            Matthew Houston ? Benj.�I do, very well. Three.�Are you one of the same profession ? Benj.�I
                            am. Three.�Is he not a Quaker? Benj.�Nay. Three.�He is not ? Benj.�Nay, not a Quaker.
                            Three.�Is not this like the Quakers, to say Yea and Nay ? Benj.�It is not. Ihree.�What do
                            the Quakers say? Benj.�They say Yes and No. At this they laughed and began to make mockery
                            with their speech. TJiree.�Is your name little Benjamin? Benj.�My name is Benjamin.
                            Three.�This, then is the great Benjamin of whom there is so much talk, who goes about to
                            seduce the people, accumulating property and making disturbance among peaceable people. If
                            you live as you say you do, why do you commit fornication? Benj.�I know of no such thing as
                            you testify. Three.�We have no doubt of it. We have it from respectable witnesses.
                            Benj.�That is immaterial so long as I can look you all in the face with a clear conscience.
                            Three.�We do not believe you. Benj.�1 have not said that 1 am without temptation. "The
                            disciple is not above his Lord." I was kept under this ordeal till near dark. Perceiving
                            myself in wicked hands, and in danger of my life, I turned my horse to get awny, but one of
                            the men rode close to my bide and caught hold of me. Another rode to the opposite side and
                            took me by the arm, while the third pulled off my hat. Being held in this position, I
                            entreated them earnestly to let me go, but th-y would not. Three.�You had better keep quiet,
                            as we have for a long time intended to whip you, and if we should take off your head, it
                            would not be a sin. Benj.�They then began to swear at me. Three.�Will you promise that you
                            will not come into this part of the country again? Benj.�I have no present intention of
                            coming again, but could not tell about it, as I wish to do my duty. I expect now to go to
                            Danville and then to Ohio, and may go on to New Lebanon, but what I shall do, I can not
                            tell. Three.�If you will not promise, we will take the flesh from your bones. Benj.�It is
                            against my conscience to so promise, and I can not do it.- I am in your hands. Do with me as
                            you will, but I can not bind my conscience with any such promise. They then ordered me to
                            dismount, and repeated the above a second time, and then apparently made a move to pull me
                            from my horse, when to my great joy they heard the sound of a trumpet. This alarmed them and
                            starting for their horses they said,�Let us<pb n="279" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 279 be
                            going. Soon the noise ceased and they were encouraged in their design, as no one came in
                            sight. Three.�You have intended never to come into these parts again, and if we ever catch
                            you here, take our word for it, we will take the flesh off your bones. Benj.�I have no
                            intention one way or the other. I do not know but that I may return in ten days, but I have
                            no intention. They then took my hat and threw it into the woods and rode away. After leaving
                            them, i went on to Lancaster. I had passed through a very distressing scene but by the
                            Providence of God, I had found a way of deliverance.

                            yet met, might take an interest in my expressions of pleasure and satisfaction in reference
                            to a recent visit I enjoyed with kind Gospel friends at Mt. Beautiful, as I term our lovely
                            home at Mt. Lebanon. I had quite a tedious journey from Ballston, being obliged to wait at
                            the stations for connecting trains. I arrived at New Lebanon depot at seven o'clock p. m.
                            just as the dusky shadows were creeping over hill and valley, and there I met a kind Brother
                            in waiting with a comfortable carriage, to convey me up the rather rugged hill that leads to
                            the quiet, home-like village that nestles on the hill-side just west of the Massachusetts
                            line. It is a lovely, picturesque spot which always seems like an oasis in my memory, partly
                            because of hallowed associations; it is the spiritual home of my soul's deep love and tender
                            affection, from whence I receive strength, comfort and consolation.<pb n="280" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>
                            280 THE MANIFESTO. On my arrival, I met several of the dear Sisters who gave me a kind
                            welcome and a loving greeting. I received the generous hospitality accorded to friends and
                            strangers, and soon found myself engaged in agreeable conversation, with many to whom I am
                            devotedly attached. After a comfortable night's rest, I was awakened by the five o'clock
                            signal, and was soon aware that busy hands and feet were actively engaged in the performance
                            of daily duties. Breakfast was promptly served at six o'clock. With free hearts and happy
                            expression of countenance, all moved contentedly to their various employments, with
                            unselfish devotion to each other's welfare that impresses one with a feeling that here is
                            exemplified the true Christian brotherhood and sisterhood. I see here the results of
                            co-operative labor on the basis of the Altruistic life. One would have to travel far to find
                            such beautiful homes. I was interested in walking over the premises ; cleanliness and order
                            prevailed everywhere. I admired the neatly laid out flower beds in the centre of the
                            door-yard, which were bright and attractive with fresh bloom and beauty. These belong to the
                            young Sisters, who care for them, aside from doing the sale work,�shirt making. I wish every
                            shop girl had some such agreeable and elevating employment aside from daily moil and toil.
                            There would be less dissipation in frivolous pleasure and a higher standard of morals. I
                            find a high-toned, ethical and spiritual culture here. Their thoughts do not centre on
                            fashion, folly, society gossip and conventionalities. There is an air of moral wholesomencss
                            to breathe, and a spiritual aspiration which is uplifting to the soul who is weary of the
                            hollow mockeries of the world. It seems to be a season of temporal blessing, a good return
                            for the husbandman's honest toil, and now these industrious people are gathering the fruits
                            of the season, securing the winter's supply of fruits and vegetables. They tell me they have
                            had many intelligent inquirers this season; they are glad to tender to all who seek the
                            higher life and light, the truth and knowledge that is embodied in their religious system.
                            True Christianity finds here its genuine expression, broadening the minds and hearts of all
                            in intelligent and consecrated service. With spiritual growth in each individual, comes
                            contentment and peace of mind, and a unity of heart and purpose ; also a kind forbearance
                            and consideration of the feelings of others. I had the pleasure of visiting the Church
                            family, in company with Eldress Anna White, and was pleased to meet once more our venerated
                            and beloved Eldress, Eliza Ann Taylor, wl'ose refined and beautiful spirit shines through
                            her countenance. Her wise and encouraging words impress one with a feeling that they have
                            received a benediction through contact with such a Christly presence. Eldress Dorothy and
                            Sister Amelia, showed me great kindness. I was conducted through their large dwelling, saw a
                            choice collection of plants, among them, was a night-blooming Cereus<pb n="281" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>

                            the next morning. It was as lovely and fragrant as the spirits of those who kindly presented
                            it. I had a visit with several of the precious Sisters, and also with the little girls,
                            twelve in number, under Sister Amelia's care. They entertained us with singing and
                            recitation. The children receive a thorough, industrial education, along with other studies,
                            which require even more patience on the part of instructors, than the usual routine in the
                            school-room. The excellent moral training of the young people is invaluable, as laying the
                            foundation of upright and reliable characters. I was much pleased to notice the courteous
                            behavior and gentle manners of the young Brothers and Sisters, and take pleasure in
                            mentioning it to friends outside. I was much interested in those who have lately come to
                            make their home at the North family. I saw several new faces, and met in pleasant
                            conversation with some who had come since my visit a year ago. I had a beneficial visit with
                            Brother Walter Shepherd and his company of six boys, who were congregated in their large,
                            airy room at the top of the dwelling. I particularly noticed that they accorded respectful
                            attention to an interesting account of Br. Walter's early experience. The young Sisters
                            presented me with a book of beautiful pressed ferns, grasses and flowers; each leaf had an
                            original design and a verse accompanying it. They tenderly inlaid one page in loving memory
                            of their deceased companion, Ada Wayne, whose face I missed from the youthful group. I
                            greatly appreciated this loving token of kindly regard. I was privileged to attend the
                            Sabbath morning services. A number of strangers were admitted; all seemed reverently
                            impressed with the worship. I was the humble recipient of a benediction of love and
                            blessing, from the Ministry, Elders, Brethren and Sisters. My heart was too full of feeling
                            to respond; but I felt grateful for all the good bestowed, and I am blest in the renewed
                            strength of the divine life which is my support every day. ~ On Monday morning, I took my
                            leave of spiritual kindred and was assured of continued remembrance and sisterly
                            companionship, which for several years past, has been inexpressibly dear to me. With the
                            opening lines of Sister Rachel MacDonald's verses, I will close my lengthy letter. "God
                            bless the Mount of Lebanon We say with one accord, Though mountains high divide us, We are
                            one in the Lord."

                            xxxiii., 20. '�'�Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."�Matt, v., 8. The
                            first text forms part of the answer to the request of Moses that the Lord's presence should
                            go with him and the people, and that the Lord would show him his glory. The Lord promised
                            his presence and verified it in that wonderful manifestation which appeared in the pillar of
                            cloud by day and of fire by night to guide the children of Israel, also in many other marked
                            evidences of supernatural power, revealing his mercy and goodness, and desire to grant the
                            request of Moses as far as possible, but at the same time assuring him that he "could not
                            see his face and live." So the Lord spake to Moses saying: ' c While my glory passeth by I
                            will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand." Considering the
                            nature of those spiritual forces that were then being manifested in material form, we
                            conclude that this ' 'glory of the face of the Lord" had reference to a special
                            manifestation of that mediating spirit to whom Moses was then trustfully looking, and which
                            on that occasion had gathered to himself a concentration of those forces too intense to
                            behold with unveiled mortal vision. It was probably of an electrical nature, or other
                            elements that would consume, for, previous to this, in the same chapter it is stated that
                            the "Lord spake unto Moses face to face," and in another place that:�uGod spake unto Moses
                            from the burning bush," and warned him not to come too near. In these instances we would
                            understand that their Lord was a ministering spirit of great intluence, and possessed of
                            wonderful power in manipulating those superhuman forces, which are frequently called
                            miracles. Moses evidently possessed unusual power as a medium, and thus for the preservation
                            and guidance of the Hebrews occurred some of the most remarkable exhibitions of spirit
                            power, of which history bears record. In the above text;�"No man shall see me and live," it
                            seems conclusive that the physical man was referred to. All the teaching and manifestations
                            of that dispensation were of a material nature, concerning the necessities and higher
                            development of the natural man and woman. The Israelites were pre-eminently a figurative
                            people, and like all their types and shadows, this passage has a spiritual significance
                            which perfectly harmonizes with the beatitude ; "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
                            shall see God." We must crucify the carnal life, die to our lower self, then in our inmost
                            thought and feeling we can attain that divine purity in whose light we can see God and abide
                            in his glorious presence. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our character is but the stamp..." TEIform="index"/>Our character is but the stamp...

It is often much less the particular instance
                                    which is obnoxious to us than the proof it carries with it of the general tenor and
                                    disposition of the mind from which it sprang. And true as this is in other lives it
                                    is peculiarly true in the matter of one's readiness to take offence. There is
                                    perhaps nothing that shows the true measure of a person's character more than his
                                    sensitiveness to supposed slights. By this he betrays the qualities of his mind and
                                    heart, and his measure of absorption in himself. That is: the more he is
                                    self-absorbed, the more he is filled with ideas of his own importance, wisdom and
                                    worth, the more his vision is narrowed by the contracted horizon of self, the more
                                    apt he will be to take offence, to interpret that which is said and done by those
                                    about him, as having a direct reference to himself, especially if it be of an
                                    unpleasant nature. And on the other hand, the more comprehensive is a man's mind,
                                    the more he is occupied with the subjects that expand and increase, as the gaze
                                    sweeps the grand circle of life, within which, his own person is but a point in
                                    space the less is the possibility of his being easily effronted. Self presents too
                                    small a surface to be hit by every random dart. It is too unimportant a subject to
                                    demand serious attention even when it happens to be hit. There are too many more
                                    important things to be thought of by others, to admit of your often being their
                                    center of interest or an object of comment. It is not only charity therefore, but
                                    wisdom also, to think no evil and to be not easily provoked.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>�Selected.</bibl></cit></p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anonymous" TEIform="persName"/>Anonymous.</byline></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>HOME NOTES.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Watervliet, Ohio" TEIform="index"/>Watervliet, Ohio.</head><p TEIform="p">Nov. 1893. Heke we are again in Home Notes trying to do all we can to help the good cause
                                along. We are just getting the corn crop gathered. Corn yields about forty bushels to
                                the acre. It is hardly a full crop, but we must be satisfied with small things, for we
                                know that God will take care of his chosen people. Sister Susan Chase was with Us on the

                                Let us go on and progress in the good work, keep up our Zion home and do our duty in all

                                demand our special attention and proffer an inspiration for more loving care of our
                                physical, moral and spiritual interests, in the brotherhood of man, there may be, also,
                                a few things claiming a still more direct consideration, as they may be absolutely
                                necessary for our present prosperity. Possibly some of these near and dear
                                accompaniments may be quietly laid aside without doing violence to the saints of the
                                past or even retarding the march of those who are now moving toward the "Holy City." The
                                good apostle Paul did not hesitate to make reference to forms once valuable, but now of
                                less value, as he passes on to that which is of more vital interest. A speculative
                                theology may awaken a pleasurable interest in some persons, and afford them all the
                                satisfaction that their minds may demand, and to this class a visionary heaven far
                                beyond the most distant stars, is of more consequence than is the heavenly state which
                                we should enjoy and which Jesus has said should be present with us on the earth. An
                                ideal class of human beings, having wings like eagles, may be of entrancing interest to
                                the mind of some, while the sons and daughters of God upon the earth are carelessly
                                passed as we walk on the outer edge of the King's highway. A close relationship with God
                                will help us wonderfully in entering that heavenly kingdom, where the will of man comes
                                in pleasant harmony with the will of the Father. The first sermon in the New Testament,
                                will in its simplicity help us to lay a foundation for action, and if carefully
                                impressed upon the mind, can not fail to lead to paths of righteousness and peace. The
                                cry of the Baptist,�"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,"
                                comprehends in its fullness the whole work of the regenerate man. It is the Lord's path,
                                and the path in TERMS.<pb n="285" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 285 which the Lord will
                                walk, and as it is a straight path, man cannot otherwise than walk correctly while in
                                it. Hence, Jesus subsequently said to his disciples, "Strait is the gate that leadeth
                                unto life, and few there be that find it." It was Father James Whittaker who expressed
                                this beautiful thought, "God's way is as straight as straightness and as pure as the
                                heavens." Those who enter into the Lord's strait path can not fall very far into
                                unrighteousness without being assured of the fact. Darkness will be sure to overtake
                                them. As encouragement to the disciples, Jesus was led to say, "I am the light," and
                                indeed, he was the light of the Lord's path, in which the sons of God must walk, if they
                                would find eternal life. Of what consequence is a life on the earth, unless it shares
                                the blessing of God's light, and is made able to lead others into the same beautiful
                                path of light. The man who assists in making the Lord's path straight, is at the same
                                time making his own path straight, and that very effort forces him "to live soberly,
                                righteously, and godly in this present world." What a responsibility this imposes upon
                                the mind, and what an invaluable treasure it proffers to the willing soul. To live
                                righteously and to live godly or like God, is living as we think God would like to have
                                us live. Is it any wonder that Col. Ingersoll holds up the Christian in burlesque before
                                the world, when the world-wise Christian is so unlike the representative of God which
                                was given by Jesus the Christ. To live righteously, certainly, is to live according to
                                the best light which has entered our souls, and in failing to do this we establish the
                                fact before the children of this world, as well as before those who profess to walk in
                                the light, that we are among those who know the Teacher's mind and neglect to do it.
                                There is nothing connected with the term righteousness, that need embarrass the most
                                simple mind, and those who are anxious to do right so far as God has given them
                                understanding, are under the divine protection, and being led by the spirit of God can
                                not otherwise than become the sons and daughters of God. Religion, with this gift to do
                                right because it is right, is the all in all to the honest heart, but religion with a
                                flourish of antiquated dogmas that are of the dead past, is of the least value for any
                                present or future good.</p></div3><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p">f^^ write the articles that are intended for publication on sheets of NOTE SIZE, 5x8

                                not the close of the year, still it seems that "finis" is written on every thing about
                                us, and we are preparing to take up new duties, and look upon new scenes. Every one is
                                busy to secure the fruits of summer toil, and put things in order ere the very severe
                                winter, that birds, frogs, squirrels, nuts, and even corn-husks prognosticate. If the
                                signs given by instinct prove true in this case, why can we not hereafter, link instinct
                                to reason, and be weather-wise in season. Brother Walter was just a month too soon in
                                closing our Society meetings. We have continued up to date, and if our large meeting
                                house could be made comfortable for winter gatherings, our interest would still lead us
                                there, since we have no other meeting room large enough to accommodate the six families
                                of our village. We compare with interest each month the weather reports of New Hampshire
                                and New York, and if we had the reports from our south-western Societies, it would still
                                add to the interest, to note the difference. During September we find our thermometer
                                varied 44 degrees, while in New Hampshire it was only 33 degrees. New York had ten

                                but find we can not. So think we must come out just as we entered, at the same time
                                showing we have not by any means been standing still. We are all quite well considering
                                our ages, which range from ten years up to ninety-seven. All summer we have had
                                beautiful Sundays; not once have we tented on the Old Camp Ground, but have marched on
                                and off toward the Promised Land. Some not of our Order, have attended with us, quite a
                                number of our good friends, such as Mrs. Dr. Newton and Mrs. Talcot from Pittsfield, and
                                John Duss, Trustee of the Economist Society, and many others, who know the value of even
                                a few righteous souls. We appreciate the good Brother, John Scovel, who came here to
                                live from Canaan. He is very helpful, as good carpenters can be. October has passed away
                                beautifully, and November stepped in the same, finding every thing nicely stored away
                                for the cold winter we expect and will surely get. We did well and did reap the
                                blessing. We have dug over fifteen hundred bushels of good sized potatoes, the largest
                                weighing twenty-six ounces. Last year, our good dairy sister marked out three thousand
                                lbs. of butter, not quite that amount this year. Elder William and his trusty helpers,
                                have put down nine hundred feet of water-pipe, to supply the stock with water this

                                that there is a spiritual harvest to which we can now concentrate and consecrate our

                                timely. It is a call to duty that should be heeded by every one that has the interest of
                                the cause at heart. Our Beloved Ministry came on the 21st ult. to their Valley home
                                laden with the gifts of the Spirit for their children. O ye weak kneed and trembling
                                ones, do ye not hear the sound of the "Conquering Legions" as they are marching to the
                                support of those loyal souls who have held and are still holding the fort against the
                                powers of darkness? If not, quicken your spiritual perceptions and you will realize that
                                like an "Army with Banners" they are marching on. On the 17th of Oct. we had our first
                                heavy frost that destroyed tender vegetation. The month has been very pleasant. It has
                                been one of the old-fashioned Indian summers. An ancient work of some 600 pages on
                                "Gardening and Greenhouse Management," published in Dublin, Ireland, in 1784 has lately
                                come into our possession. It formerly belonged to Br. Proctor Sampson. It is interesting
                                to review and compare it with modern works on the same subject. While reading in the
                                Nov. Manifesto the beautiful tributes to the memory of those dear Mothers who have
                                passed away, we thought of the counsel of Mother Ann, to live as if we expected to live
                                a thousand years and as if we were to die to-morrow. We want to whisper courage to our
                                own souls and to our comrades and when called to walk in tribulation may it be that
                                which worketh a spiritual cleansing of the soul. The invitation to our Beloved Editor

                                viewed Mt. Zion but are standing thereon. Our trio of Elders are interested in
                                maintaining the testimony, and it is ministered to the dividing asunder of flesh and

"He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much." These
                                are the words of our Savior, and how true do we find them. To deviate from faithfulness
                                even in a small degree, will harden the heart and lead to greater departures from right.
                                Faithful in small things. We should live by the principle that "whatever is worth doing
                                at all, is worth doing well." Only those who have done well, can expect the "well done."
                                Without faithfulness there is no promise of reward. Let us resolve that what was well
                                done, shall be better done. Let us tell others how they may shun the pitfalls of sin and
                                we shall show them the sincerity of our friendship and love for pure principles.
                                Superior choice may we display by shunning that which is sinful. We can not look into
                                the future; let us improve the present. Now is our time, do not let us miss it. ***** It
                                is not profitable to keep too many fowls in contracted quarters, without any opportunity
                                for exercise. A teaspoonful of sulphur once a week, given in their soft food, will be
                                beneficial as a stomach regulator. Ginger in poultry food is recommended as a tonic.
                                Oatmeal is the best food for chicks for the first month, regardless of cost. Opinions
                                vary as to what food is best for poultry. It is rare for two poultry keepers to agree
                                exactly as to what articles are the best for egg production. Some people use various
                                kinds of soft foods; others use grain almost entirely. The best feed undoubtedly, is
                                that which runs to neither extreme. Soft food entirely is apt to produce bad results,
                                while all hard food is inclined to diminish egg production. Variety in poultry food "is
                                the spice of life." Brown Leghorns lead all others as layers. Daniel Orcutt.</p></div3><div3 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Those are the best Christians..." TEIform="index"/>

                                thanks to all who kindly aided in our Commemoration. It is so very unusual for any one,
                                outside the limit of their immediate local home, to spend time or means for meetings, or

                                18th. What countless visions appear as the mind lingers lovingly upon the works of the
                                noble pioneers of our several homes; what indomitable courage manifested, what victories
                                achieved, despite surrounding difficulties, which to-day seem to many among us like
                                insurmountable barriers; but those gallant souls "in sacred pledge of human fellowship,"
                                toiled bravely on; with "no surrender" as their motto, they triumphantly sang the "songs
                                of the gospel of humanity;" and by their faithful consecrations is entailed to us a most
                                valuable legacy, and it remains for us to keep untarnished past history and nobly live
                                in the present. As true as obscene art is the product of a sensual mind, so true it is
                                that all goodness is the fruit of a consecrated life to God; for it is impossible for an
                                individual to raise his life high in merit without a corresponding elevation of mind;
                                and all religious societies prove their worth, not by creeds, but by beneficial fruits
                                to humanity, by demonstrating those attributes that characterized the life of Jesus, the
                                Christ. Doubly valuable was our Commemorative Service made by the presence of kindred
                                souls from Mt. Lebanon, Harvard and Canterbury. It was also pleasant to have with us our
                                friends and neighbors belonging to other churches. May the day never dawn when our doors
                                will be closed to those not of our faith and Order of life. We can but hope that our
                                Centennial exercises will not only bind us closer in the circle of co-operative interest
                                and fraternal love, but that Zion may ever be ready to manifest her God-given gifts, and
                                sow broadcast the seeds of truth, peace, and purity. George H.

                                it as much as we do now, so prone is human nature to forget to be thankful for common
                                blessings. No frost to injure the tenderest plant till the 17th. of Oct., and yet we

The good old patriarch Job says, "Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly
                                upward." Even if that is so I am sorry he said it, for it opens such a wide door of
                                excuse, (almost license) to the fault-finding pessimist. It is indeed, almost enough to
                                sadden the countenance of the sunshiny optimist. O that the voice of the faultfinder and
                                complainer were silenced forever. He is brother to those poor old negations, gossip and
                                slander. Every word uttered in finding fault with another, is instantly photographed
                                upon the astral medium, and conveyed with the swiftness and ruin of a poisoned arrow to
                                the party aimed at, whether such party be conscious of it at the time or not. It will
                                sooner or later most surely work its fatal effect. Always does,�no exception to this
                                law. I am resolved to ignore the negative, discouraging side of existence and cultivate
                                the positive side which brings so much righteousness, peace and joy of the Holy Spirit
                                into our lives. "From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Therefore if we
                                have sunshine in our hearts, and talk sunshine it will have healing in its beams, both
                                for sickness and sorrow. But if we are lorever having clouds and invidious criticisms of
                                others in our hearts, we shall talk these and nothing else. Now I know these things are
                                true from experience. Then the Bible affirms it, and when I quote the Bible I feel as
                                safe as the little girl, who, when disputing a point with another little girl said, '"I
                                know it's so for mother says so and what mother says, is so, if it aint so." The Bible
                                says "A merry (optimistic) heart doeth good like a medicine, but a broken spirit drieth
                                the bones." Now for any thing to be like a medicine it must cure sickness and restore
                                health and comfort. Here is an equal chance for us all to turn doctors and healers,
                                instead of being "troublers in Israel." What a glorious change! Union Village is
                                enjoying good health and excellent weather. If you could see all that Elder Joseph has
                                done for the convenience, comfort, and artistic beauty of our premises you would be
                                surprised if not confounded. "And generations yet to come Will bless the memory of his
                                name Yea, enter in and fill the home, And be partakers of the same." as we fondly hope.
                                But it will not pay them to come in with the sublime idea of subjecting the hells and
                                setting Heaven Order among Believers. No man since the fall need consider himself
                                sufficient for this; but let him come as a learner and disciple and he will find that we
                                can do him good and make him happy. Our beets, which, for the last two years were
                                eighteen hundred bushels, this year were only five hundred owing to the protracted
                                drouth. Our potatoes and also all fruits were nearly a total failure; but "Although the
                                fig tree shall not blossom, yet we will rejoice, yea we will joy in the God of our

                                Brethren, Elder Henry B. Bear and Elder Stephen Ball came from White Water on a visit to
                                Union Village for a few days. Every one was glad to see them. We had a blessed time in
                                our morning Society meeting and again on Monday evening when we entertained them with
                                singing, and toward the close sang and played the beautiful Farewell Hymn in "Shaker
                                Music." I never enjoyed a visit more than I did with these two veteran saints. They
                                expressed themselves much comforted with their visit and departed on Wed. morning for
                                their home. A few weeks previous Eldress Ellen- - - - -Br. Thomas Mann and Sister Grace

"There is a good time coming and it will soon be with us." These were the
                                words of a seer, spoken in our religious service, who with spirit sight looked through
                                the mist into the future, for the prosperity of our Zion home. Let the weak take courage
                                and let the strong rejoice. God, our Heavenly Father has us in his keeping and He will
                                give the increase if we faithfully do our work. Of late being privileged to visit our
                                Gospel relation in Canterbury and Enfield, we found the spirit alive to the ministering
                                of our Gospel testimony. Not only by words of peace and love to one another, but a
                                desire to see it on its mission, as a power to do good among the children of men. Would
                                it not be well for us to give a little more attention to this work, "Where there is a
                                will there is a way." How did our Mother and the Elders do when their little company
                                consisted of only twelve witnesses? They made it their first business to herald the good
                                news of free salvation. God gave them this mission. God gives us the same mission when
                                he says, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
                                glorify your Father which is in heaven." "God helps those who help themselves" and all
                                that we may do in his name, will never go unrewarded. Let us "put on the whole armor of
                                God" and make no compromise with the sins of the world. Among all our friends we felt an
                                earnestness for the prosperity of the Gospel testimony, and it awakened a response in
                                our own minds. Let us not delay to do the work, which God would have us to do. Our
                                faithfulness in this all important work, will not go unrewarded. Saturday the 5th, we

It hardly seems possible that the closing month of the year is so near at hand
                                and that Thanksgiving and Christmas will have come and gone, ere we again write notes
                                for our Manifesto. At this early date, we send Christmas greetings to all our Brethren

                                written by our good friend, C. E. Robinson, and published by our beloved Elder Henry is
                                highly appreciated by the people of Maine. Elder John Vance was in Portland lately, and
                                met Ex-Gov. Robie, who said to him,� "I thank you for the book you so kindly sent me. It
                                is beautifully composed and put together. It is an honor to your people. I took it to

                                take a retrospective view of the doings of the past in the light of experience.
                                Experience should be as a reflector, throwing light into the future. It is such an easy
                                thing to remember afterwards, that the light of experience is overshadowed by the
                                effervescing present. Thus it is that we are ever learning, but never coming to a
                                knowledge of just what we ought to do. The World's Columbian Exposition has passed away
                                and the Shakers were not represented. By and by, we shall probably realize the gone by
                                opportunity. True, in a feeble way, we made an effort to get a representation; wrote and
                                received many letters. There is no doubt, if we had personally appeared, we should have
                                been recognized. In the last letter received, we were told if we would have a brief
                                paper prepared, he, John Henry Barrows, would try and have it read. The paper was
                                prepared and sent on, and we have since learned, that it was announced on the bulletin
                                board to be read. In the past year, we have received nearly one hundred letters of
                                inquiry, all of which have had tracts, pamphlets and books sent to them. These letters
                                are from many states, and foreign lands. It may be we shall gather bread after many
                                days, but must abide the Lord'sown time. Of fruits, grains and vegetables, we are blest
                                with an abundance. Our Thanksgiving table, laden to over-flowing without marring the
                                visage of the angel within us by the slaughtering of the innocents, will give evidence
                                of our thankfulness and appreciation of the goodness of God. Christmas will usher in a
                                deeper baptism of the Holy Spirit, increasing our love for purity and peace, and the New
                                Year will open with new courage and fervent zeal to make 1894, the harbinger of the
                                increase of the gospel. To all, far and near, in our Zion home, we say peace and

                                seem to appreciate their Zion home, and through her precept and example, help to make it
                                a model of neatness. Notwithstanding the visitation of wind, hail and drouth, the garden
                                yielded bountiful crops. On one fourth acre of land one-hundred and twenty-five bushels
                                of onions were raised, and such onions! It makes the tears start just to look at them.
                                Had also an abundant supply of cauliflower, salsify and numerous other vegetables, which
                                are fast crowding animal food from the dining table. Tea and coffee are also being
                                superseded by fresh milk and pure, cold water. From a herd of eleven cows, they have
                                made, in the past season, one thousand five-hundred pounds of butter, besides supplying
                                several daily customers with milk. Julia L.

                            which a gentleman can be sure of keeping his sacred honor free from specks except by plain,
                            ordinary, decent behavior, and respect for the rights of other people, says a writer in
                            Scribner"1 s. If he does wrong he can not fight his way right. He simply has to repent and
                            apologize, or take his punishment quietly, according to the rules of the game. If he was
                            injured, and the law can not help him, the best way for him is just to grin and bear it, and
                            let time wreak its own revenges. To be sure, if the injury is desperate, and he resents it
                            in hot blood, the law may excuse him; but society has come to a point of sophistication
                            where it is able to recognize that the man who endures is usually a stronger and a nobler
                            creature than the man who gives reins to his temper. The notion that one's "honor" can be
                            damaged by the action of another person is pretty generally obsolete. Brag is not so good a
                            dog as he was. Bluff will not go so far. The code that regu lates in these days the manners
                            of the highest and most influential type of American gentlemen is actually to be found in
                            the New Testament.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>Deaths.</head><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Simpson, Sally" TEIform="index"/>Sally Simpson

                            </head><p TEIform="p">"A TRUE SON of LIBERTY" is the title of number seven of the Waldorf Series. It is from
                                the pen of F. P. Williams, and published by Saalfield and .Fitch, Now York. The son of
                                Liberty is the pastor of the Union Tabernacle, and through the advantages of his
                                advanced thought he is led to attack the preconceived ideas of the church of Bellicose.
                                He illustrates his views in accordance with reason rather than by tradition. The
                                position occupied by the pastor was the only one that could be taken as worthy of a
                                place in the light of the present day, while his churchmembers, in their narrowness and
                                bigotry, demanded that he should cling to the language of the dead past. It taxes our
                                patience to remain in the company of these dullards. "That man's mind is a queer
                                jumble," said the postmaster, as the pastor walked away. What does he mean by mixing up
                                liberty with religion in the way he does? Seems as though I should never be able to
                                straighten out my ideas again. He'd better make out some sort of a new-fangled,
                                political Bible, and preach from that. Ours does not appear to suit his mind." We follow
                                this "Son of Liberty" with a deep and loving interest, as every page of the little book
                                develops more and more of the Christian character, till by the hands of religious
                                persecutors, he is nearly deprived of his life.
