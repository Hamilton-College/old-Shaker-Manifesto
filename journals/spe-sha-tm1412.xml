SHAKER VILLAGE, N. H.
1884.THE MANIFESTO.
ItfPOKMATION FOE INQUIEEKS.
For the better understanding of those who
wish to know of the rules and regulations of
our religious home, we have prepared the following brief summary. Further information
may be obtained by addressing any member
of the order.
1.  The form of government in the Society is adapted to the different orders of
which it is composed : its powers and authorities growing out of the mutual faith.
love and confidence of the members.
2.  No one is excluded from the privilege of becoming a member on  account
of poverty ; nor will   they be accepted
because of wealth.
3.  Plain and explicit facts will belaid
before the  investigator.    To   become a
member, is a voluntary concession of the
individual.
4.   Those who accept the privilege to
reside with us, as well as those who visit the Society as inquirers, are expected
to regard the rules of the family where
they are entertained.
5.  By the  principles   of this Society,
no believing husband or wife is allowed
to separate from an unbelieving partner,
except by mutual or legal agreement.
6.  Parents that become members are
not required to give up their children:
but they will be requested to see that the
children   keep   the   rules of the family.
Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by
the request or consent of those who have
the lawful right over them.
7.  No corporal punishment is approved  in   the  government of the  Society,
nor any external violence exercised on
any rational person.
8.  It is expected that the children admitted into the Society, will receive an
education suitable for the general management of business.
9.  Probationary members may retain
the lawful ownership of their property,
but the interest accruing therefrom will
be devoted to the benefit of the Society,
until by their own free will, and the consent of the   Trustees, they shall consecrate said property to the support of the
family where they reside.
10.  The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to the time of their membership.
11.  Those who dispose of their property   to   relations   in  the worldly order,
should remain with those relations.
12.  A person   wishing to   become  a
member of the Society,  must rectify all
his wrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims.
13.  Those  who   ask for admission to
our Home  are   supposed to be in search
of more truth   and light,   hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church,
is  the confession   of sin to   God,   in the
presence of a witness.
14.  Those who have dedicated their
property, and afterward withdraw from
the   Society,�according to the law  of
justice amf equity, there can be no ground
for retraction.
15.  To live   as  Brethren and Sisters
in the gospel of Christ, we can hold no
private correspondence.    All communications sent   from or received into   the
family,  whether printed or written, will
be subject to the examination and advice
of the Elders of the family.
16.  The leading authority of the Society is vested in a Ministry, consisting
of two Brothers and two Sisters.  Elders
and Trustees are also appointed.    These
orders constitute the gen �al government,
of the Society, in all of its branches.THE MANIFESTO.

                            DECLARING THE LAW WHICH CREATES AND SUSTAINS A COMMUNITY HAVING GOODS IN COMMON.</head><p TEIform="p"> The second phase, is .manifested in countries called free; said countries bringing forth
                            millionaires, paupers and criminals. The land�the prime element of existence, being in the
                            hands of a few ; the masses are compelled to submit to the outrage of having no land, and of
                            being servants to those who have. Forced to pay interest on enormous debts which they never
                            contracted, and to support governments instituted to oppress them, and priesthoods for which
                            they have no reverence. The organic law of the Divine order of human society, is love to God
                            supremely, and neighbor more than self� "in honor preferring one another." "Let the greatest
                            be the servant." This order was represented by the Pentecostal Church ; and is now by the
                            people called " Shakers. " With them there is neither millionaire, pauper nor penitentiary ;
                            slave nor dependent and where he who is the greatest is the most of a servant. The mission
                            of Moses was to establish the just order. And to effect that he required that the
                            propensities (which all have in common with the lower animals) should be subject to the
                            following laws. The dietetic, the procreative, the agrarian, the agricultural, the moral,
                            the financial and the Sabbatical�of days, rest to the body. Sabbath of years�rest to the
                            land and a cancelling of debts; and every fiftieth year, all who had lost their land took
                            possession of it again. These laws Avere more sweeping in their practical operation | than
                            most are aware of.<pb n="266" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> ? The nations and civilizations of antiquity fell in
                            consequence of the unrestrained action of the propensities. Modern civilizations are taking
                            the same course. It is righteousness alone that exalteth and giveth permanency to nations.
                            The mission of Jesus was to begin on earth the Divine order in human society, as was
                            manifested in the Pentecostal Church, and now in that of the Shakers. The Divine faculties
                            were and are called into action, and the propensities excluded. The results were, and are, a
                            virgin life and a community of all good things. If communities, having goods in common,
                            based on the total exclusion of^ the action of the propensities, exists in our day, the
                            cause must be referred to the divine element in man being quickened. Having classified
                            society according to the organic law of each, and defined the phases thereof, I will now
                            proceed to analyze society, and again inquire, First, what are the primary atoms of human
                            society? Man and woman are the primary atoms of human society. Second, what are the forces
                            of these atoms as regards the formation of society? Their most potent inherent force is an
                            affinity to unite and form matrimonial relationships. This force may be called the animal
                            force, for all animals in common with man are its subjects. They all marry as does man.
                            Third, the above force is the objective, but what are the inhering forces oj each atom? The
                            inhering forces in each are dual, one is represented by animal emotions, the other by divine
                            emotions�benevolence, goodness. There is also a neutral force, the intellect, it is not
                            emotional ; it is a servant to either force. These forces are the magazines of human power.
                            Fourth, what are the products of the action of the objective force ? The product of the
                            action of these atoms is the Adamic community, consisting of father, mother, and their
                            children. When the offi-hoots have matured, they fly off to fulfill their destiny, as their
                            parents have done. Here we find, first, a force to form a community ; second, a force to
                            disintegrate the same. And again, a third force, repelling any coalescence with every other
                            such community. Hence family distinctiveness. Having arrived at a knowledge of the forces
                            which create the family relationship, limit its extent and maintain its distiuctiveness, we
                            become possessed of a base of operations, to weigh and measure what they are able to do, and
                            what they are not able to effect. The forces of the physical world are, to some extent,
                            controlled and modified Yy man, but he cannot change them essentially ; whatever form they
                            may assume under his hand, they continue to bear a strict relation to their primary forces.
                            So man or woman, on the Adamic plane or sphere, can be trained, till a great change in the
                            common acceptation of th* term has taken place. But, on examination, they are essentially
                            the same, and bear a strict and true relation to the above forces, and to the sphere
                            thereof. And any attempts of the subjects of said sphere, to raise themselves out of, and
                            beyond the power of the forces thereof, by the aid of said forces, must prove a nullity.
                            Hence the formation of communities, embracing a number of families, recognizing the forces
                            alluded to, have all died out, or<pb n="267" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>merely linger along. And so long as
                            the primal forces remain intact, the same results will attend any attempt to establish
                            communities having goods in common. First, because families do not coalesce. Second,
                            communities having goods in common, do not admit of a plurality of centers of affection. And
                            third, utterly reject the distinctive element. Therefore, Adamic families are incapable of
                            forming communities having goods in common, being under the power of the forces of animal
                            emotional life, represented by the propensities. Said forces and propensities being
                            incapable of manifesting divine emotional life�incapable of forming a universal brotherhood,
                            having one center of affection�God. Seeing that there is not a kingdom recognized on earth,
                            where the Divine emotional force predominates, and has taken the mental force and subdued
                            the animal in man and brought forth an order of society, with law, order, and a civilization
                            corresponding thereto, perhaps we may find a single individual who may have focalized in
                            himself such a kingdom. On looking over the past, we find one individual who states "That
                            his kingdom is not of this world, and that his subjects will not fight. " Here are
                            encouraging indications. ' But what are the forces by which this Nazarene purposeth to
                            create and vitalize his kingdom? He says, " Call no man on earth father. " Here he abrogates
                            the order of the earthly father�the husband, and of course the wife�the mother. Indeed, as
                            far as his kingdom is concerned, the whole procreative order. And the reason is, " For one
                            is your father, even He who is in Heaven "�one center of affection�God. And in his own life,
                            Jesus on this point, gave a practical example (see New Testament) and eaii'l, " Those who do
                            the will of my Father who is in Heaven, the same (all humanity in that state) is my mother,
                            sister^ and brother." Here is a new relationship. His Father is in Heaven�in a heavenly
                            sphere ; and those who do the will of his Father�whose every word and act are in harmony
                            with the Father^ are also of that sphere, whether they be in a mortal body or not. Here we
                            find that love to God is the vitalizing element, or creative force of Christ's kingdom. And
                            love to those brought forth by that force, brings forth a universal brotherhood�the Divine
                            order of human society. Such a kingdom will not be of the world, neither will its government
                            stand in physical power, nor operate by force after the manner of the kingdoms of the animal
                            man. The germ of the Adamic family is very limited in its unfolding^. The germ�love to God,
                            in its unfoldings embraces all humanity. And the voice of that unfolding, is ever, u
                            Whosoever will let him come" and inherit the Divine life and the true and good flowing
                            therefrom. Where the life and love of God is shed abroad in human spirits, there is no need
                            to manufacture a community having goods in common ; it springs up of itself, and is the
                            result of the internal forces of divine relationships. Here we find focalized in Christ,
                            first, a force to create a universal brotherhood; second, a force to destroy-the organiz'ng
                            affinities of the Adamic relationships. Wherever two or three are gathered together in the
                            power of these superior forces, there will be law and government, and an ultimate civili-<pb n="268" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>nation that eye hath not seen nor ear Beard, neither hath it entered
                            the heart of the Adamic man to conceive of. In conclusion, the Divine�the Shaker Order of
                            human society, and the Adamic, will run parallel through the ages. The latter is the
                            boyhood, the former the true manhood of the race. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            deceptive and misleading to the uncritical mind, than absolute falsehood. Because the moiety
                            of trutli they contain, like the stamp on counterfeit coin, enables them to pass
                            unchallenged where unmixed falsehood would be rejected. The saying that " a sect looks back
                            to its founders, while a church looks forward, " is an example of this kind. For while,this
                            is true as matter of fact, the implied inference, that one is the exclusive mark of a sect,
                            and the other of a church, is untrue. In the ordinary application of these terms among
                            people professing Christianity, each sect is a church, and a church may be a sect. Even if
                            it were not so, sects adopting the Christian name, though chiefly stationary, do look
                            forward, and a true church, if it remain true, must look to its founders, and bear them
                            often in mind, for no one can be a member, who is not actuated by the spirit of its
                            founders. Hence the aforesaid saying has no value as a test of truth. We read in " Tests of
                            Divine Inspiration " p. 21. Every dispensation of the work of God, commenced in divine
                            revelation, by which its foundations were laid. To support and perfect the work of each
                            dispensation, a continued revelation was also indispensable. And whenever the gifts of the
                            Divine Spirit ceased, a " falling away, " from foundation principles, among the professors
                            of that order, was the inevitable result. " Where there is no vision, the people perish."
                            Prov. But although a continued revelation was always necessary, by which to know the present
                            will of God (to the living,) yet an all important principle has ever been paramount to all
                            others, in every age of the world. And that is, an unerring rule, by which to judge,
                            distinguish and know divinely inspired revelations from those which are spurious, and false.
                            Page, 23. "� The rudimental laws of each dispensation, were the rules ( r tests by which to
                            judge all spiritual com-<pb n="269" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>mnnicatious" given in their respective eras. An
                            unerring test being an acknowledged necessity in a church which is continually advancing
                            into the ever increasing light of truth, where can we find it more surely than in the lives
                            and testimony of its founders and perpetuators ? A pure stream never came from a corrupt
                            fountain, neither a pure stock from hybrid seed. The first, universally recognized criterion
                            of truth, is its perfect oneness, from whence arises harmony, consistency and agreement.
                            This fact lies at the basis of all true reason, and sound understanding. The gospel itself
                            must agree with certain concepts of truth in tbe mind to which it is addressed, or it will
                            not be received. It was the work of Moses and the prophets, and of Christ in his first
                            appearing, to form a foundation in the human mind for a class of concepts that do not spring
                            up spontaneously, nor originate in natural causes, but in revelation, and are communicated
                            from mind to mind by spirit intelligence, or the holy spirit of Divine wisdom, whether by
                            the agency of spirits in the body or spirits out of the body. It is the work of Christ's
                            second appearing to build upon and increase those concepts. Hence we cannot ignore the past
                            altogether, without severing the trunk from the roots which nourish and keep it alive,
                            without ignoring the wisdom, strength, and growth of the past, so far as that was growth in
                            light and right, it forms the basis of present attainments. May those who view the past, as
                            a limit to all increase, or as sanctioning acknowledged error, reject with discrimination
                            lest their lijrht become extinguished. Increase, on a true foundation, will not conflict
                            with, but confirm and strengthen the foundation. Sect, from Latin seco, to cut oft', to
                            separate, means a party, or division^ whether in philosqphy or religion. It therefore
                            implies a plurality of bodies or parties in religion, etc., separated from each other by
                            conflicting opinions and usages, but classified under one name. Hence the so called
                            Christian sects, Jewish sects, Mohammedan sect*, are so many independent heads or parties,
                            professedly Christian, Jewish, or Mohammedan, divided in particulars, but ^agreeing m some
                            generalities. The church or congregation of Christ, is his visible body, which, as it is
                            raised up and sustained by Divine Power and Wisdom, can never have but one head, and is
                            therefore indivisible. As it embraces all the interests of man in his redeemed and complete
                            state, including aH truth necessary to raise, endow, and perfect mankind iu that state, it
                            is not, and never can be a sect. For as the Apostle declares, Eph. i., 10. It is the Divine
                            purpose in the fullness of times5 to gather all things into one Christ, both the things in
                            heaven and the things on earth, it must draw all that is salvable from every sect, being as
                            superior to all sects, as the heavens are superior to earth. Some twelve years ago, E. Amos
                            Parkhurst, queried in himself. What is the body of Christ? There opened to his view, a great
                            multitude of Shakers, disciples, perhaps a million of them together, and all were actuated
                            and moved' by the-one spirit of Christ. That was the body of Christ. Well, how do they get
                            this one spirit? How does it operate? It seemed to operate through ttie<pb n="270" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> nerve fluid, or nerve spirit, so that what one knows, they all know. Again, electricity
                            was presented as another medium of operation, for the influence proceeding from the fountain
                            head, which must be an individual intelligence of course. This spirit began to be manifested
                            in Jesus Christ, and can never come only through him. The work has been increasing since,
                            and when it is perfected, such will be the body of Christ. " For though it is one body, it
                            hath many members. " This view was not to represent what is now, but what is to be when the
                            church is perfected. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. </p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear madam; I received your paper..." TEIform="index"/>Dear madam; I received your paper...

                            their systems of religion�the Shakers, the Quakers, and some others. I respect those people
                            more than their opinions. We live in a free country (at least we flatter ourselves so) and
                            none should be ostracised or persecuted on account of their religious opinions. As a general
                            rule the most numerous and dominant sect in religion try to convert the others, and if
                            unsuccessful, they persecute. I think the Shakers and the Quakers are both free from that
                            intolerant spirit and so I respect them. The late I). M. Bennett and his wife once belonged
                            to the Shakers ; they were both very good people, and great credit is due to those who
                            raised them. I do not concur in Shakerism, nor its apposite Mormonism, nor in monastic
                            celibacy, nor even in the present reckless marriage system and its frequent divorce. but the
                            serious, and almost ominous question comes up, what social relations are best to supersede
                            the present objectionable ones ? That is one of the hardest questions of today, and it calls
                            louder and louder for reply. Suppose all were Shakers. Depopulation would be the result.
                            Suppose all were Mormons. The tangled relations and resultant misery would be greatly
                            increased. Monastic celibacy is but outward show, accompanied by crime and degradation such
                            as few would believe who have not investigated. Our present system most in vogue is full of
                            unhappy marriages, frequent divorce, overpopulation, poverty, crime, lunacy. My own opinions
                            here would not weigh as a leather's weight, and therefore need not even bo glanced at. Be
                            assured of my kind regards, how much soever our opinions may differ. Yours truly,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Emory, F. J." TEIform="persName"/> F. J.

                                    an unusual interest manifested by the " world's people " in the Shakers and their
                                    peculiarly spiritual life. In speaking of this novel to an Elder, he remarked that
                                    Mr. Howells had doubtless written as intelligently about his people as a person
                                    could who had drawn simply from, outside observation. It is evident that the Shakers
                                    think they might be more thoroughly understood ; and certainly any system can be
                                    better appreciated when studied sympathetically, and its purposes can be best known
                                    from its friends. In whatever light Shakerismis viewed, it should be interesting to
                                    all intelligent people as a phase in the spiritual development of mankind. And if we
                                    look beyrnd the surface, we perceive that these people did not leave the world's
                                    selfi.-h joys for a mere whim, but from convictions which sprang from the depths cf
                                    the soul and raised them above the ordinary prejudices of life. Shakerism is
                                    believed by its advocates to be the ultimate or second Christian church, its founder
                                    being Ann Lee, called by the Shakers, Mother Ann Lee, and, in imitation of the early
                                    chunk, they hold all things in common. This Shaker Church was established more than
                                    one hundred years ago, and the basis of their system is "separation from the world,
                                    confession of sin, purity of spirit, aud a united inheritance. " The name " Shakers"
                                    was given them by their persecutors as a term of opprobrium, but was afterwards
                                    adopted by themselves. They are, it is seen, a strictly religious organization, and
                                    they believe that the Spirit of Christ is the same, whether revealed through a man,
                                    a woman, or a child. The gospel taught by Ann Lee is, to their minds, the
                                    manifestation of the Spirit of Christ revealed through one of the daughters of man,
                                    "A deeper work of the Christ Spirit, which was to come without sin unto salvation. "
                                    On hearing, a few weeks ago, a sermon on "Chritdual" bj an able and interesting
                                    Elder,* I was immediately struck by the progressive tendency of his remarks, As
                                    shown by him, wre saw contained, in the position woman holds in the Shaker religion,
                                    an enlarged idea of faith and justice. From the worship they accord to Ann Lee, and
                                    their faith in her "renewed revelation," spiing.s a decided tendency to respect the
                                    higher claims of woman. This extends itself into practical life, and makes them
                                    believers in the highest development of the intellect and soul of woman,
                                    andperceivers of the need of the woman element in politics as in religion, in public
                                    as in private life. Being a comparatively new organization, they have neither the
                                    prejudices nor the infirmities of age, and their eyes are not dazzled by the new

                                    regeneration of mankind by Mother Ann Lee rises the great shadow of progress. There
                                    may be little in the quiet life of the Shakers to furnish material for history, but
                                    to the contemplative mind their life must certainly afford food for thought. In
                                    their devotion to charities, in their renunciation or all personal claim on the
                                    world's riches, and in their life of celibacy will be seen strong aspirations
                                    towards a spiritual existence. These people endeavor to live according to the strict
                                    teachings of Christ and Aim Lee, and their life of devotion and sacrifice would seem
                                    to indicate that they come very much nearer " practicing what they preach" than
                                    humanity has genera'ly succeeded in doing. Visiting their Sunday services, one is
                                    immediately impressed by their earnestness and fervor, so much so that their
                                    peculiar mode of worship, their dance and song, does not intrude upon your notice as
                                    you supposed so unusual a service would. On the contrary, you find yourself
                                    wondering why all worship is not conducted in this manner�such is the harmony of
                                    song, movement, and dress. A picture of a band of Shakers chanting their precious
                                    tunes while marching to the slow, devotional music, and moving their upturned hands
                                    in gentle measure, is one not soon to be forgotten. Notwithstanding their reputation
                                    as ascetics, these people are decidedly social and genial, especially when among
                                    friends or people interested in their work. They are unusually intelligent as
                                    regards the questions of the day, and exceedingly interesting in conversation. But
                                    above all, there is in the society of the more intelligent of these people an
                                    irresistible something�a powerful charm, emanating no doubt from their life of high
                                    resolve, a life where individuality is forgotten in the pursuit of .truth. For this*
                                    reason it is true, that although the Shakers may be seemingly limited in scope,
                                    local in their influence, and small as regards numbers, yet the ideas they have
                                    evoked will be inextinguishable. The seeds they have planted, the truths they have
                                    felt, must pursue and agitate mankind. They have declared in the loftiest way for
                                    the higher claims of woman, and this spirit will assert itself in spite of all
                                    reactions. No man, or school of men, can grasp all truth, but every intermediate
                                    modification supplies some link in the vast chain. The impulse the Shakers have
                                    given to the world is a spiritual impulse, and in it is contained the "prophecy of
                                    better things."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Woman's journal" TEIform="index"/></bibl></cit></p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Zuleika" TEIform="persName"/>Zuleika.</byline></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Aspiration" TEIform="index"/> ASPIRATION.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Reed, Calvin G."

                            human race will become extinct, because a few individuals are called of God to the gospel of
                            Jesus Christ; and realizing as did Paul, that they are numbered with those upon whom the
                            ends of the world have come. What these ends are, James informs us, in the fourth chapter,
                            and first verse. These are making an end of sin by the sacrifice of themselves, holy,
                            acceptable unto God, which, is our [reasonable<pb n="274" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> service. Jesus said, "
                            Behold I make all things new. " If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things
                            have passed away. The old generative order of the first Adam has passed away with a great
                            noise, and the elements in which the natural man delights will melt with fervent heat. The
                            earth and the works therein shall be burned, and anew heaven and a new earth is created
                            wherein dwelleth righteousness. Our God is a consuming fire, a fire that shall try every
                            man's work of what sort it is. Other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is
                            Jesus Christ. If any man build upon this foundation of any other material than after the
                            example of Jesus Christ, it will be a waste of time and labor, and according to the text,
                            must be burned. One of the prophets speaks of a time when the inhabitants of the world will
                            be burned, and but few men left. That does not seem very flattering to those who are so
                            anxious that the earth should be peopled. It may be the time of which the Lord says, "Afire
                            is kindled in mine anger and it shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth,
                            with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.* Possibly the querists
                            might mitigate their fears by giving attention to what Jesus said : '' Strive to enter in at
                            the strait gate, for strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and
                            few there be that find it; wide is the * Hell, the lowest, unhappy state of mankind. Earth
                            with her increase, is the natural generative order of man. Foundations of the mountains, are
                            characters which the world look up to as great and might}' men; lofty in their imaginations,
                            self exalted. gate and broad is the road that leadeth to destruction and many there be which
                            go in thereat. " So many, even, that we do not apprehend any immediate danger that the world
                            will be depopulated, excepting by causes to which we shall refer. We now ask. What will
                            become of the world if it continues to pursue its present licentious course for a few more
                            generations? According to the reports of the press and of eminent physicians there are many
                            of the earth's inhabitants at the present time so degenerated by licentiousness that it
                            would be impossible for them to replenish the earth, their professed belief in the command
                            given to Adam, to the contrary, notwithstanding. Again, we ask. What is to become of the
                            world if the inhabitants continue to. go to war ? The last war of this republic which some
                            call civil, but which we call very uncivil, sacrificed a million of lives, and now we have
                            word from Kgypt of many thousands of her subjects having been slain in the war with the
                            false prophet. Is all this no cause for alarm lest the world should run out? " From whence
                            comes wars and fightings?" Head what the apostle says on this subject in the fourth chapter

                            hands of cruel persecutors. It really does seem that when a man turns from righteousness,
                            that God does give him over to a reprobate mind to do what at other times he would be
                            ashamed to do. Instead of a man of reason he becomes more like a wild beast, and destroys
                            all he can find in the way. These evil minded persons would come time after time and break
                            the glass in the windows, throw down the fences, cut down the orchards and even set fire to
                            the buildings. Those who may, at this date, make a visit to the peace loving Shakers of
                            Union Village would hardly suppose that they were obliged to purchase their home amidst such
                            cruelties. In 1806 Benjamin, Issachar and Eichard visited Kentucky and held meetings in the
                            several places where the Believers lived, and were blessed by additional numbers being ready
                            to accept the word of faith. In June 1806 Peter Pease, Samuel Turner, Constant Mosely,
                            Eldress Ruth Farrington, Lucy Smith, Molly Goodrich, Ruth Darrow, Martha Sanford and
                            Prudence Farrington were sent from the Society at New Lebanon to assist the western
                            Believers. The missionary work still continued an.l Issachar enjoyed his new home but a few
                            weeks at a time. With Eichard or Malcham, or Matthew or at times with all of them he would
                            leave home for two and three months, and hold meetings in many parts of 'Ohio, Kentucky,
                            Indiana and Illinois. The work of evangelizing continued very active till 1811 and the
                            societies of Ohio and Kentucky were formed into a covenantal order. While in Indiana
                            Issachar called to see Gov. Harrison, and to inform him that the Believers had been
                            preaching their faith in Busro, " and we want, " said Issachar, "to know if there are any
                            laws in this territory to protect the people. " "The same law said the Governor that there
                            is in any of the United States. You have a right to preach your faith, and any one has a
                            right to embrace it. So you need not fear, I will protect you. " After this they had no need
                            to fear as the Governor became their friend. On their second visit to Busro they were at the
                            mercy of a mob of twelve men. " They had ropes with which they intended to bind us. The
                            leader stepped forward and said. Come, prepare yourselves to move. Move where? said I. Out
                            of this Country, and we intend to fix you. Well, said 1, have you any precept? Yes, precept
                            enough for you. You must show it. said I. With an oath he commanded us to get on our horses,
                            for, said he, you shall go. Well, said I, we shall not go with a mob. Another of the gang
                            ther. spoke. If you don't go and get your horses, I will get them, for you shall go, so
                            where are they? In Berry's stable, but if you get them we shall not get on them. Well, then
                            we will put you on. And we shall get off" again Then we will tie you on. But you will have a
                            hard job ot it before you get through. By this time some of the mob were laughing, and said,
                            'Come let us go.' So they started, but looked back, to say, If you ain't gone before
                            Saturday night, you shall go dead or alive. Very well, said I. Saturday was muster day, and
                            we expected some of them would come to our place intoxicated and perhaps trouble us. We
                            informed the Governor of the affair and on Sabbath morning he sent a magistrate and another
                            officer and they prevented any disturbance. " It would seem that Issachar was somewhat
                            skilled in mason work as he helped the Brethren at Pleasant Hill in building some chimneys
                            and in doing other brick work. From 1801 to 1811 Issachar kept an account of the distance he
                            traveled, and although most of these he walked, the sum reached not less than 38.000 miles.
                            On Issachar's return to Union Village, he was asked to go to Busro and again assist the
                            Believers in that place. " It was a long and wearisome journey of not less than 240 miles.
                            For 150 miles of this distance there was not a house nor a cabin to be seen, and for m<pb n="278" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/>it was water, water, water, with no bridges and we were compelled to
                            cross the rivers by wading or swimming. My companion on this trip was good brother John

                            as his guard and protect him from the robbers. We, however, made a safe passage through that
                            wild and wicked world, and were gladly received by our gospel friends. " Issachar relates
                            the incidents of one journey from Union Village to Busro when the party consisted of Elder
                            Benjamin Youngs, Richard McNemar and himself. They left Union Village on the 16th of January
                            180i), with provisions for five days but were compelled to make it hold out for sixteen. In
                            gome of the rivers the ice had already broken up and the banks overflowed so that they were
                            detained much beyond what they had anticipated. This journey was made on foot as Issachar
                            says there was neither track of man nor beast through the forests. They were five days in
                            reaching the Indiana line on account of the floods and floating ice of Laughrey's creek.
                            Each had his staff and knapsack with an extra blanket for use at night. For several days
                            they were obliged to wade through the mud of the marshy flats or river bottoms, while water
                            fell from the clouds without measure. They were, however, men that trusted in the mercy and
                            protection of God and He kindly led them through all dangers in a marvelous manner. They
                            believed in prayer, and fervently and effectually, on their knees, in that wilderness they
                            sought the kind care of an over-ruling Providence. They were obliged to encamp for a few
                            days on the banks of one stream that was not less than six miles in extent, as the ice was
                            too thin to support them. On the third day they ventured on this dangerous passage and were
                            frequently wading in the water where it was not less than three feet deep. They were finally
                            obliged to build a raft in order to make a safe passage across the Mushakitak river_ Near
                            this stream they found a part of a wild turkey that the foxes had killed. This they dressed
                            and smoked and then enjoyed one delicious meal. On reaching White River they found that also
                            filled with floating ice but fortunately obtained a good canoe and a man to assist them in
                            crossing the river. At the house of this friendly guide they were also able to obtain some
                            additional food which they ate in humble thankfulness. Having crossed this river in safety
                            they made a journey of one day and reached a " fork" of the same stream which had also
                            overflowed its banks and was now not less than two at?d one half miles wide. This was the
                            last flooded passage which they must make but their feet were badly swollen, from severe
                            exposure and they were obliged to wade through the snow and ice without shoes. After
                            reaching the dry land once more they obtained some Indian moccasins which afforded them much
                            comfort so that on the remainder of the journey, some thirty miles, they renewed their
                            strength and reached their friends in Busro in a very comfortable condition. (To BE

                                    and of the impossibility of separating them without violence from their vital union
                                    with the moralities, I have all along felt that the plan of excluding religion from
                                    education was inherently a defective one, which could not continue to hold its place
                                    against the assaults of reason and truth. In the past position of the question, it
                                    was best which could be followed, and was defensible as the smallest of several
                                    evils among which society was compelled to choose. As such I still advocate and
                                    defend it; but I think it important that it should be defended and advocated on its
                                    true grounds, and not as in itself proper and desirable. Instead, therefore, of
                                    recommending the separation ot secular from religious instruction, as in themselves
                                    distinct, I would adopt the true grounds, and in answer to the wish of some to make
                                    all education religious, say: Yes, I agree with you entirely that all education must
                                    be based on religion and that the authority of God should be recognized by us all as
                                    the only infallible standard in everything ; but that we may know what we are
                                    talking about, let us understand distinctly what each of us means by religion.
                                    Standing on such a basis, we cannot be shaken by either Jew or Gentile, Calvinist or
                                    LutheranThen comes the discussion, What is religion? A, says it is a code embracing,
                                    suppose, ten principles in all. On examination B, C, and D find that, say, eight of
                                    these refer to practical matters directly influencing conduct and character, and
                                    that they approve of them as true ; but each affirms that the remaining two are
                                    church dogmas, untrue, dangerous to salvation and deserving of all reprobation. For
                                    these B proposes to substitute other two, but is, in his turn, voted wrong by A, C,
                                    and I). The latter two follow with their substitutes, and are each condemned; all,
                                    meanwhile, admitting the eight practical principles to be sound and necessary to
                                    happiness. Here it is plain that if the children of all are to attend the same
                                    school a compromise must take place ; and while all agree to leave out the two
                                    articles, they may cordially unite in teaching the remaining eight, and in
                                    endeavoring to insure their recognition by the pupils as their best guides and as
                                    indispensable links in that religious chain which binds them to their Creator and
                                    imposes upon them the primary duty of seeking to know and do His will in all things.
                                    This done, let the parents and priests teach what they deem truth on the two
                                    disputed points, in addition to the religious principles thus daily and hourly
                                    inculcated and brought into practice among both teachers and pupils. It may be said
                                    that this is what is done already. But there is a difference. At present the line of
                                    separation between religious and secular education is drawn sharply, and in the
                                    school the pupil is not taught that the natural arrangements he studies or sees in
                                    play around him have been devised by Divine Wisdom for his guidance and happiness,
                                    nor are his feelings interested in securing obedience and gratitude to God as a
                                    moral and religious duty in return. The arrangements of nature are taught simply as
                                    "knowledge" coming from nobody, and leading only to worldly advantage, not personal
                                    happiness. Religion again is taught not as the complement of that knowledge, leading
                                    the mind back to God and bearing at every moment on our welfare, but as a something
                                    apart, which does not dovetail with our conduct or duties. In short, the prominent
                                    idea in the minds of both teachers and taught, under the present national system,
                                    is, that secular knowledge and religion are distinct, and have no natural
                                    connection; and hence neither exercise its legitimate influence. But the result will
                                    be different if it be recognized universally that, taught as it ought to be, all the
                                    knowledge conveyed is inherently religious, and calculated, necessarily to bring the
                                    creature and the Creator into more immediate contact, and to develop feelings of
                                    love, admiration, reverence, and submission to the Divine will. Let it be proclaimed
                                    and understood that the inevitable tendency of knowledge is to lead the mind to the
                                    Creator, and that wherever it is taught without this result there is and must be a
                                    defect of method, or a fault in the teacher, which ought instantly to be remedied.
                                    Let it be proclaimed to the four corners of the earth, that education,<pb n="280" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> rightly conducted, is religious in the highest degree, although
                                    embracing none of the tenets peculiar to sects or parties, and that a ;' god" Hess
                                    education" is a contradiction and a moral impossibility. It would be as logical to
                                    speak of a solar light without a sun. Every truth, moral, physical, or religious,
                                    springs from, and leads directly to, God; and no truth can be taught, the legitimate
                                    tendency of which is to turn us away from God Instead, therefore, of giving in to
                                    the op~ ponents of national education, and admitting a real separation between
                                    secular and religious knowledge, I would proclaim it as the highest recommendation
                                    of secular knowledge that it is inherently religious, and tha* the opponents are
                                    inflicting an enormous evii on society by preventing philosophers and teachers from
                                    studying and expounding its religious bearings. If this were done it would lay the
                                    odium at the right door, and show that the sticklers for exclusive churcheducation
                                    are the real authors of "a gigantic scheme of godless education, " in attaching such
                                    importance to their own peculiar tenets on certain abstract points ; that rather
                                    than yield the right of conscience to others, they are willing to consign society at
                                    large to an absolute ignorance of the ways of God as exhibited in the world in which
                                    He has placed them, and to all the misery, temporal or eternal, certain to result
                                    from that ignorance. It must be admitted that, as at present taught, much of our
                                    knowledge is not religious : but this is an unnatural and avoidable, not a necessary
                                    evil, and it has arisen, in a great measure, from the denunciations of the party
                                    opposed to the diffusion of education. By stigmatizing as infidel and godless
                                    whatever knowledge was not conjoined with their own peculiar creed, they deterred
                                    men from touching upon or following out the religious aspects of knowledge ; and if
                                    they be allowed to maintain longer the wall of separation they have erected, the
                                    result will continue to be the same as in times past. The only way to meet them is
                                    to turn the tables and denounce them as the obstructors and enemies of religious
                                    education, because they refuse to allow any exposition of the Divine wisdom and
                                    arrangements and will which does not also assume the equal infallibility and
                                    importance of their interpretation of His written wisdom and ways. This is a tyranny
                                    to which human reason can not continue to submit, and the sooner they are put on the
                                    defensive the better. Science is, in its very essence, so inherently religious, and
                                    leads back so directly to God at every step, and to Mis will as the rule of our
                                    happiness, that nothing would be easier or more delightful or more practically
                                    improving to human character and conduct than to exhibit even its minutest details
                                    as the emanations of the Divine wisdom, and their indications as those of the Divine
                                    will for our guidance. In a well-conducted school-room or college-hall, the
                                    religious sentiments might be nourished with the choicest food para pass'u with
                                    every advance in intellectual knowledge. The constant practice of exhibiting the
                                    Deity in every arrangement would cultivate habitually that devotional reverence and
                                    obedience to His will which are now inculcated only at stated times, and apart from
                                    everything naturally calcxilated to excite them. So far from education or knowledge
                                    proving hostile to the growth of religion in the minds of the young, they would in
                                    truth constitute its most solid foundntion, and best prepare the soil for the �eed
                                    to be afterward sown by the parent and priest, who would then receive from school a
                                    really religious child fashioned to their hands, instead of being, as now, presented
                                    only with the stony soil and the rebellious heart. The practical inference from all
                                    this is, that while we continue to advocate the exclusion of sectarianism of every
                                    hue from our educational institutions, we are so far from wishing to exclude
                                    religion itself, that our chief desire is to see all education rendered much more
                                    religious than it has ever been or ever can be under the present system. To make
                                    religion bear its proper fruit, it must become apart and parcel of every-day life.
                                    It must, in fact, be mixed up with all we think, feel, and do; and if science were
                                    taught as it ought to be, it would be felt to lead to this, not only without effort
                                    but necessarily. God is the creator and arranger of all things ; and wherever we
                                    point out a use and pre-arranged design we necessarily point to Him. If we can then
                                    show that the design <pb n="281" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>has a benevolent purpose, and that its
                                    neglect leads to suffering, we thereby necessarily exhibit the loving-kindness of
                                    God and recognize it even in our suffering. If we next point out harmony between
                                    apparently unconnected relations, and show how all bear on one common end, we
                                    necessarily give evidence of a wisdom, omniscience, and power, calculated to
                                    gratify, in the highest degree, our sentiments of wonder, reverence, and admiration.
                                    If we familiarize the mind with the order and laws of God's providenc? and their
                                    beneficent ends as rules for our conduct, the very reverence thereby excited will
                                    prompt to submission�systematic submission because cheerful and confiding�to His
                                    will as our surest trust. Here, then, is the legitimate field for the daily, hourly,
                                    and unremitting exercise of the religious feelings in the ordinary life of man, and
                                    fur the exercise of that true, vivifying, practical religion which sees God in all
                                    things, lives in His presence and delights in fulfilling His will.�From the '�'�Life

                            seed over the fields A very unpleasant time he must have, but the sa:isfac. tion of knowing
                            that it is done probably affords him much pleasure. The grain lies for many months in grave
                            like furrows, beneath the frosty air, the curling mist and weeping skies, or buried in the
                            snows, or bare to every wind. It grows in spite of thunder, rain, of cloud and blast, and
                            beds of snow. Every roaring tempest strengthens it. Anon a kindlier s-eason shines, warmth
                            and light, the Spring's soft signs dispels the frosty air; and the grain in delicate green
                            spring up enchantingly. This brings to the mind the sublimity, grandeur, wisdom and goodness
                            of God; and inspires the soul with reverence and gratitude to the giver of all good. The

                            tempests that soften the grain, must prove the aspirants claim, and every virtuous, worthy
                            endeavor of the heart. In the breath of contempt, the tempest of malignity, the obscurity of
                            hope, lomj delayed; when all around shows desolate, the good deeds we havt done must
                            slumber. Let us patiently toil,�suffer quietly,�be calm, be not in haste, our good deeds
                            shall be made manifest. Though much perplexity and toil is endured before the harvest is

                            religious bodies. All may have qualities well worthy of attention. We have not yet reached
                            the place where we have become so very good that we have no need to change. Indeed, we are
                            "ever changing, ever aiming toward a higher, better life. M Onjy a few centuries in the past
                            and the religious mind of man was exercised very differently from what it is at present. It
                            was then one dominant church, one dominant creed, but as the world moved in civil liberty,
                            so the people moved in religious liberty. Persecution and intolerance gave place'to reason,
                            and man began more fully to have a tender regard for his brother man, and the old creed is
                            made to harmonize with this friendly feeling. Fortunately, the Shaker Church lias never been
                            bound or fettered by a manmade creed and consequently we have no anxiety about an
                            anticipated change of foundational doctrine. Creeds may be serviceable for those churches
                            that are not able to be maintained without them, and yet a church may so far otitgrow its
                            creed, its forms and ceremonies, that they all become to a progressive mind, mere lessons of
                            words. These all belong to the dead past, instead of the living present, when ki those who
                            woi ship God shall worship Him in spirit and in truth ;" and yet a change in a document that
                            boasts of its almost divine authority, is very difficult to make. The Cougrcgationalists,
                            however, are on the march toward a better day, as they find that their old creed " is
                            outworn and does not express the living faith of the present age. " Like sensible men they
                            have rebuilt it to meet the demands of the elmrch as it now is. The step taken by this
                            church may be profitable to others. Old forms, old creeds and old names must give place to
                            those more in harmony with the advanced thought of i he age and more expressive of the real
                            work they are expected to accomplish. The Congregationalists have certainly moved forward,
                            and on this account, the subject becomes interesting for all religionists. To lay aside, so
                            carefully, those doctrinal points, which the first reformers thought to be essential for the
                            salva;ion of the soul, and which had for so many years decided the fate of thousands of poor
                            mortals, is truly wonderful. A heaven that was not obtained through the doctrine of
                            fore-ordination and election would have been a sorry place for those religious battle axes
                            of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Calvin, Luther, Knox and even Edwards might
                            look on with astonishment at the indifference of the present generation, as may many others
                            that have " fought the good fight and kept the faith." The liberal form which has been
                            accepted by the writers of the revision of the New Testament, is like the leaven in the t;
                            measures of meal, " and may have a tendency to influence very extensively the religious
                            thought of all who are interested in this absorbing subject. In this creed of the church the
                            Holy Spirit has taken the place of the Holy Ghost, and this change comes, also, from the
                            leaven of the revision. The mystical doctrine of the Trinity, which no one can
                                TXECEJMUEIt,<pb n="283" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/>comprehend, is touched with so much care that it only
                            Avaits for another advance step when it will wholly fade from sight. We would urge the study
                            of the revision as it is a decided improvement upon the old English version and illustrates
                            many things in a much better light.</p><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p"> Acknowledgement. Through th*e kinduess of our Friend Hamilton Arnot of Patterson, N. J.

                                        and kept applied to old sores or new, cuts, bruises or sprains, is the treatment
                                        now generally adopted in hospitals. I have seen a sprained ankle cured in an

                            refreshment from his hospitable board timidly asked the good man of the house if he would be
                            willing to hire him, his food, clothes and lodging being the stipulated price of his work.
                            His proffered services were accepted for the season, and he was duly initiated into his
                            daily round of labor. To till the fields was his greatest pleasure, but he must go about it
                            in his own peculiar way ; so lie at once procured half a pound of Turnip seed ; and there
                            was a query in the minds of the people as to the method of disposal; he said not a word ;
                            quietly placing the package in his ample pocket, he went his way with a good purpose in
                            view. In the vacant spots over the fields, and between the growing crops, some seeds were
                            planted. When the ripened ears of corn were pluciced, he pulled up the stalks and every
                            little hillock received a liberal supply ; and when the early potatoes were dug and gathered
                            he failed not to scatter the seed where they had grown. So day after day the sowing went
                            faithfully on. Alwa}'s carrying the seed with him, he did not fail to use it at the right
                            time, and in suitable places. If it had been laid on a shelf, or shut up in a chest, out of
                            his sight even for a day, he might have missed some golden opportunity for using it. The
                            seed sprang up and the plants grew apace expanding their roots in die rich mellow soil, and
                            lo ! when the late Autumn days revealed the garnered stores of the wealthladen season, the
                            master found his ample barn floor covered with line turnips, they had cost him nothing, but
                            were the fruit of an old man's patient industry, there was a bountiful supply for himself
                            and neighbors ; he was well pleased, and his aged laborer proved himself worthy of more than
                            his meagre wages. . From this little inc;dent I have learned a lasting lesson. It is, always
                            to carry with me good seed to scatter along the barren ways of life. There is not a day that
                            passes which may not afford abundant opportunity for sowing the same. We meet with desolate
                            hearts, in which every green thing seems withered, drop there the seeds of love and
                            kindness. There are lives blighted by sin, on whose sterile soil, it would seem, no plant of
                            virtue could thrive, stir the underground of feeling, spread the seeds of purity and truth,
                            ask the good angels to water them, and they will not be wholly lost. Speak tender, hopeful,
                            loving and sympathetic words to the weary and care-worn. Give encouragement, strength and
                            wisdom to those who have gone astray from paths of light. 0, there are a thousand ways in
                            which we may do good, if we have only the will to do it. I find that this disposition grows
                            by cultivation, and it creates aworld of happiness for its possessor. Do not let us grow
                            cold, selfish, and cynical; but, let our souls expand with true Christlove, this will meet
                            all human needs. The warm tide of heart-feeling, welling up to the lips in persuasive
                            utterance, is more potent to uplift humanity, tnan all the cold philosophies of the merely
                            intellectual man and woman. So let us bear Avith us the good seed of righteousness and
                            truth, scattering as we go ; and, like the aged husbandman we shall see, if not in time, in
                            our Heavenly Parent's garners, the ripened fruit thereof. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. </p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved eldress Antoinette; I have been reading..." TEIform="index"/>

                            toward that place. In troubled nights of sorrow and repining, When joy and hope seem sunk in
                            dark despair, We still may see, above the shadows shining, The gleaming archway of the
                            bridge of prayer. From that fair height our souls may lean and listen To sounds of music
                            from the farther sh.ore, And through the vapors sometimes dear eyes glistei: Of loved ones
                            who have hastened on before. And angels come'from their celestial city And meet us halfway
                            on the bridge �f prayer; God sends them forth, full of divinest pity, To strengthen us for
                            burdens we must bear. O you, whose feet walk in some shadowed by-way Far from the scenes of
                            pleasure and delight, Still free for you hangs this celestial highway, Where heavenly
                            glories dawn upon the sight. And common paths glow with a grace supernal, And happiness
                            walks hand in hand with care, And faith becomes a knowledge fixed, eternal, For those who
                            often seek the bridge of prayer. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wheeler, Ella" TEIform="persName"/>Ella Wheeler.

                            complained of as having a tendency to make the pupils despise manual labor. "Very few boys,
                            " it says, " enter the mechanical trades when their school course is completed. Many of
                            them, moved by the false idea that labor with the hands is not respectable, go into the
                            already overcrowded professions. Oth ers take up clerkships which lead to nothin better.

                            Behold, this is the law of the house." "The mountain of the Lord's house shall be
                            established in the top oi the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills." By a careful
                            study of the ancient prophecies, we learn that the work of God in the latter day, was to be
                            a work of humiliation when every exalted feeling, or imagination of the human heart, shall
                            be brought low, "and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day." Now that the day has
                            dawned and we are privileged to live in its glorious light, we can more fully understand the
                            meaning of the prophetic language referred to above. Those who have entered the work of
                            humiliation through confession and repentance, by this means are en. abled to ascend "to the
                            top of Mount Zion " the hill of God, where all things are "most holy." All work is done in
                            the spirit and with the understanding that it is for the Lord and his people, and it must be
                            well done, that it may be an honor to the Christian name. Shs,ms or deceptions in any form
                            are not tolerated. "Thou slialt not commit adultery," is a command to be observed in all the
                            relations of life. To mix or adulterate any article for sale, in order to increase the
                            profit, is a violation of the command, and forbidden by the conscience of the upright. Every
                            act, every thought of life must be such as will bear the inspection of" angels. Every wrong
                            or passionate word, defiles the temple of God wherein the spirit dwells, and nothing of this
                            character can abide in the Holy City. Therefore the "Shakers," or " Believers in Christ's
                            Second Appearing" are striving to dwell on the mountain top of God's light and love, by
                            coming into humility's vale and there righting all their wrongs, and then �ceasing from sin,
                            or, in other words, after washing in the waters of judgment and repentance, to " go and sin
                            no more." Not only this, but as no soul can long remain idle, all must labor to clothe
                            themselves with the beautiful graces of the spirit, by deeds of love and kindness to all the
                            needy children of humanity, whether friend or foe. In this way the "limits round" God's
                            mountain are found to be " most holy. " There is no secret lurking place for sin to hide
                            from the light of God in his Anointed witnesses, for there is nothing so hidden but it shall
                            be revealed. Canterbury, N.

                                Co. Price 25 cts. A simple, quiet story, whose character is adequately expressed by the
                                title. Evening Rest is the name given to a little hamlet in the Blue Ridge region of
                                Pennsylvania, remarkable for the beauty of its surroundings and the lovely character of
                                its people. Thither goes a 3Toung man from the East to visit an uncle whom he has never
                                before seen, and Ins experiences during the stay make up the contents of the book. One
                                incident of the story is strongly dramatic in character. A fauiily party, one of the
                                members being the young man referred to, visit a coal mine. While passing through one of
                                the narrow passages the guide fires a pistol to show the effects of the echo. The
                                concussion of the air starts a loose part of the roof overhead and a portion falls in.
                                The little company is shut up in the earth with little chance of ever seeing the light
                                again. They have lights, however, and stumble across some tools, and by dint of many
                                hours hard labor they are at length able to communicate with their iriends outside, who
                                are at last able to rescue them. The author, throughout the story, dwells much upon the
                                sweet and tender influences of home. In Evening Rest he creates an ideal household and
                                community, and strives to show how much they have to do with the formation of character.

                                        test for many years, and have flourished in spite of the scoffs and jeers of the
