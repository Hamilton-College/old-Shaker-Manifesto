In 1880, and later, "Brick" Pomeroy
was,laughed at for projecting a five mile
tunnel in Colorado, to get into the very
bowels of the great mineral deposits in
that state, sixty miles west from Denver ; but now, after driving more than one
mile of tunneling through solid granite
and reaching veins from which gold, silver and lead ore is being brought by the
car load for the enrichment of those who
had the courage and cash to invest, there
is not so much haw-hawing as there was.
The large pamphlet sent to those who ask,
addressing M. M. Pomeroy, President, Pulitzer Building, New York City, is very
interesting reading, telling as it does what
pluck has and is doing for public and private benefit.

Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 7. Concerning the separation
                            of those called Neiv-Lights from the Presbyterian Church. A division must always precede a
                            separation. That division in sentiment which began about the commencement of the present
                            century in the Presbyterian church continually increased until it effected an important
                            separation, which took place in the month of September, 1803, a particular account of which
                            is published in a pamphlet entitled, "An Apology for renouncing the jurisdiction of the
                            Synod of Kentucky." It is an old proverb, that "two cannot walk together unless they be
                            agreed." For nearly three years, the subjects and promoters of the revival continued their
                            outward church membership with those whose constant labor it was to oppose and suppress it.
                            This was a painful situation to both parties : for the New-Light to be chained down in
                            silence, forbidden to pray, exhort or make any noise or uproar in time of meeting, however
                            clearly he saw the danger of the wicked or felt his soul overflowing with the love and
                            goodness of God. No less painful did it feel to the expounder, and those who contented
                            themselves with his learned and ingenious labors, to be interrupted by a sudden shout, and
                            put to silence by the din which commonly followed. Worst of all, to hear that system by
                            which he had all his wealth in this world, and the hope of a favorite interest in a better,
                            set at naught by the general proclamation, "whosoever will, let him come and take of the
                            water of life freely." Thus it continued until the unequivocal and open testimony of several
                            ministers came forth in vindication of the new doctrine and the operations and exercises
                            which attended it, and in pointed opposition to the Presbyterian system. This fur-' nished
                            the desirable occasion of banishing from the standing community, those flaming zealots whom
                            ministerial authority had failed to reduce into subjection. Those who were destined to
                            excommunication on account of their faith<pb n="146" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> and zeal, might not be wholly
                            ^efc without the usual claim of congenial descent from Leo the great, the dissenting
                            ministers voluntarily withdrew from under the jurisdiction of the Presbyterian church, and
                            according to their own history "constituted themselves into a Presbytery." "We, the above
                            named, Robert Marshall, John Dunlavy, Richard M'Nemar, Barton W. Stone and John Thompson,
                            having entered the above protest and withdrawn from under the jurisdiction of the Synod of
                            Kentucky and of the Presbyteries to which we belonged, do now formally unite in a body as a
                            Presbytery of Springfield." The design of these men as they themselves testify in th'eir
                            writings, was not to lay the foundation of any church or distinct party, but as they express
                            it, they considered this "Presbytery providentially formed to cover the truth from the
                            impending storm and check the lawless career of opposition." Nevertheless they proceeded to
                            organize what they called churches, although they considered their existence as only a kind
                            of asylum for those who were cast out, that they might come forth and be there, like David's
                            father and mother with the king of Moab, until they should know what God would do for them.
                            On this occasion, as far as the way was opened for a separation, the subjects of the revival
                            who were sincere in their profession, generally came forth and united with the seceding
                            body, which were distinguished by the name of Schismatics. As this separation was productive
                            of a very important change and placed the subjects of the revival in a different situation
                            from what they had been, as far as it extended, it will be proper to trace the outlines of
                            those newformed churches in their separate capacity, and the first thing to be considered is
                            their manner of constituting. Every house must be builded upon some foundation; all human
                            creeds and confessions had been disannulled or rolled out of the way ; the power and
                            authority of modern clergy, as successive to the apostles was renounced, and the Presbytery
                            of Springfield confessed and denied not that they were as far off the true foundation as the
                            rest. In this predicament they concluded that they would stand the safest and be most
                            retired and unobserved by contending parties, upon this foundation :�the Scriptures. The
                            following minutes, extracted from the records of the Turtle-Creek church, will develop this
                            point more particularly, according to which plan the churches in general, which are called
                            Schismatic, were organized. 1804.�"The session, taking into consideration the propriety of a
                            more close attention to the government and discipline of the church, think it expedient to
                            state to the people at large who have considered themselves under our care, the following
                            observations on that subject." I. "We think it the privilege of the church, mutually to
                            profess their regard to the holy Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice, and the
                            only standard of doctrine and discipline." II. "We think the Eldership ought not to form a
                            separate body distinct<pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> from the church itself, nor go out of doors
                            secretly to transact such business as concerns the body of the people." III. "We think it
                            tends to keep the people in the dark and obstruct a real spirit of communion, to examine and
                            admit members, try causes of scandal, censure, rebuke, reprove or suspend in secret, or to
                            transact privately by the representatives of the people, such or any other business of a
                            public nature." IV. "We think it expedient in order to the due exercise of government and
                            discipline, that all who believe should be together in one place." "We therefore recommend
                            that the church constitute in the place for public worship." "Moreover, that the foregoing
                            observations be publicly read in the congregation, and the voice of the church taken, on the
                            expediency of immediately reducing them to practice." Signed, William Bedel, Malcham Worley,
                            Matthias Spinning, Aaron Tullis, Samuel Sering, Francis Bedel, and Richard M'Nemar.
                            Accordingly, at the close of public worship the above observations were read, and after a
                            brief discussion on the subject, the following propositions were stated to the members of
                            the church. Do we adopt the holy Scriptures as the only rule of faith and practice, the only
                            standard of doctrine and discipline? Do we agree to constitute a church, and in that
                            capacity to transact business? The questions being put, were answered in the affirmative,
                            with uplifted hands, and no dissenting voice. The number were about seventy-four who voted
                            as above, and remaining in the house after the congregation was dismissed, took their seats
                            as members of the church. It was moved that the use of tokens be laid aside. It was also
                            moved and agreed, that the endearing and Scripture appellation of brother and sister be
                            revived among the members. It is to be observed that in those congregations where the
                            members of the new Presbytery resided, the Presbyterian mode of government had been
                            practiced for some time after the separation. Neither did the Presbytery immediately resign
                            their reputed authority, although in everything they introduced some alteration. They
                            considered it their prerogative to license public teachers, or rather to forward those whom
                            they believed were chosen and called of God. The following, written at Springfield, Mar.
                            1804, will serve as a specimen. Forasmuch as our brother, Malcham Worley, has made known to
                            us the exercises of his mind for some time past, expressive of a divine call to labor in
                            word and doctrine, and we being satisfied from a long and intimate acquaintance with him, of
                            his talents, both natural and acquired, being such, as through the grace of God may render
                            him useful; and considering that the way of God is above our ways, it therefore seemeth good
                            to us with one accord to encourage our brother to the work, whereunto we trust the Holy
                            Spirit is calling him. We do hereby recommend him to the churches scattered abroad, to be
                            forwarded in his calling according to the manifestation of the spirit given to him to profit
                            withal. Signed in behalf of the Presbytery. B. W. Stone. Cl'k.<pb n="148" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> It was
                            but a short time before the Presbytery were convicted that their union was formed upon
                            antichristian principles, and under that conviction dissolved. It will be unnecessary to say
                            anything further concerning the government and discipline exercised by them. Their principle
                            object was to set the people at liberty from the contracted folds into which they had been
                            gathered by idol shepherds in the cloudy and dark day. As soon as they constituted a
                            separate body, as above, with the Scriptures unexpounded as their only index, nothing
                            remained for the Presbytery to do in relation to them, but to sit and watch, as Jonah sat in
                            his booth, to see what would become of the city. It now remains to give a more particular
                            account of the churches and people called Schismatics. From their expressions it is
                            difficult to say what their real character was in their own estimation. They speak of
                            themselves as a church, about to constitute a church, but how the first was constituted
                            seemingly was not considered. Again, they speak of the people at large, and the churches at
                            large. If these expressions have any definite signification, they must mean the people at
                            liberty, and the churches at liberty. To be set at large and at liberty means one and the
                            same thing. It follows then, that they considered the people who had been set at large by
                            the preceding work, as now constituting churches at large or at liberty, who should be bound
                            by no form of doctrine or discipline, but stand loose upon the variegated fields of
                            antedeluvianism, patriarchism, Judaism, baptism, Christianity and Gentile-partyism, or
                            whatever else was meted out between the lids of the Bible, either by history, precept,
                            promise or prophecy. Notwithstanding this extensive liberty, it is truly marvelous and
                            astonishing to consider the regular manner in which they proceeded from thing to thing in
                            the investigation of truth. What is still more striking, is the union and harmony which
                            existed among them in those investigations, and the subordination which they manifested in
                            relation to those who were considered the most deeply initiated into the mysteries of the
                            spirit. Taking what is called the New-Light doctrine as the rudiments of divine truth, they
                            proceeded to consider the nature of justification and reconciliation to God. They rejected
                            as a dangerous error, the doctrine of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ,
                            and taught that no one could be justified or accepted of God but he that forsook his sins
                            and became personally righteous; that no one could be pronounced just, upon the principles
                            of truth, who was not so in reality, and therefore when the true God accepteth any as
                            righteous in his sight, it must be such as are so in reality. Reconciliation or atonement is
                            to be at one ; Christ is at one with G od ; we must be at one with Christ. God is
                            unchangeably holy, just and good, and therefore cannot be reconciled or at one with an
                            unholy, unjust and wicked person. Man in his natural state is unjust and unholy, therefore
                            God is not at one with man. Chris<pb n="149" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> the mediator, came into the world to
                            atone us to God, not to reconcile or atone God to us, for if God is reconciled or atoned to
                            man, it must be by becoming unholy and unjust; this cannot be ; the work of reconciliation
                            or atonement is to make man like God, holy, just and good, and for this purpose Christ came
                            into the world. There is wrath and enmity to be taken out of the way ; this never was in
                            God, for God is love, therefore it must be in man, and to remove it out of man, the blood or
                            life of Christ was shed, and to man that blood or life must be applied, and not to the
                            throne of God's justice which is unchangeably holy, just and good. According to the
                            schismatic doctrine, the vicarious sufferings of Jesus Christ in the room and stead of
                            sinners that they might live, was only a cunningly devised fable, destitute of foundation
                            either in common sense and reason or the Scriptures of truth, that proxy sufferings were
                            inadmissible by any just law, either of God or man, as it would be wholly unreasonable and
                            unlawful to hang an honest man in room and stead of a murderer, that the latter might be
                            delivered out of the hands of justice and set at liberty. According to the unchangeable law
                            of God, the soul that sinneth it shall die. From whence it was plainly deduced that there
                            could be no reconciliation or atonement to God, unM the evil spirit, which is prone to evil,
                            and that continually, was overcome and rooted out of God's creature, and as soon as that
                            spirit which is opposed to the law was extinct, sin which is a transgression of the law,
                            ceased 'of course, and the soul which came from God became reconciled and at one with Him.
                            Hence followed the necessity of the sufferings of Christ being commensurate to the atonement
                            and glory that should follow. He set us an example that we should walk in his steps. He
                            suffered in the flesh that we might arm ourselves with the same mind. "It is evident that
                            Christians according to their measure have fellowship in the sufferings of Christ, and are
                            filling up that which is behind his afflictions, in their body." Stone's letters on
                            atonement. Upon this principle it was evident that all who were in Christ suffered with him,
                            that they might be glorified together, witnessed the sufferings of Christ. 1 Pet. v., 1.
                            Eejoiced in his sufferings. (Chr. iv., 13.) That when the glory should be revealed, they
                            might be glad with exceeding joy. The sufferings of Christ abounded in Paul, which were
                            effectual to the Corinthians ; not to exempt them from sufferings, but in their enduring the
                            same sufferings which he also suffered. 2 Cor. i., 5, 6. The greatest depth of the
                            schismatic doctrine lay in the reciprocal union which they supposed must exist between Jesus
                            Christ and his followers, which rendered both the sufferings and glorification identical in
                            each, and left no room for the disciple to suffer in the room and stead of his Lord, any
                            more than for the Lord to suffer in the room and stead of the disciple; and therefore if the
                            sufferings of Christ abounded in the disciples of Jesus, the disciple did not suffer in the
                            room and stead of Christ, but verily Christ suffered in him the<pb n="150" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> same as
                            in his Teacher. They taught that all that were born of Christ and united to him, were true
                            Christians as much as fire produced by fire, is very fire of fire; and as Christ proceeded
                            from the Father, and was true God of the true God, so all that were born of the divine
                            nature of heaven, were perfect in one. It is very evident that the seed of Abraham are all
                            believers. These believers are one, therefore not called seeds but seed. For there is
                            neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female ;
                            for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. Gal. iii., 28. For as the body is one and hath many
                            members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body so also is Christ. 1
                            Cor. xii., 12. Hence by Christ, in this verse, the Apostle means believers who are in
                            Christ. And so I understand Gal. iii., 16. "And to thy seed which is Christ, i. e. to all
                            believers." B. W. Stone. Upon the strength of this article of faith the Schismatics were so
                            abundant in their profession of having Christ in them and being full of God, both the Father
                            and the Son; Not that they held as an established principle that a real hypostatical union
                            existed between them and God, but a hypothetical or supposed union depending on their faith,
                            as all things are possible to him that believeth. The possibility of standing in so near a
                            relation to God, afforded a lively anticipation of it to the mind while in the full exercise
                            of believing, but still left room for the following prayer:� "Come Father, Son and Holy
                            Ghost, And seal me thine abode; Let all I am in Thee be lost; Let all be lost in God." Were
                            an animal capable of believing that it was possible to be lost and swallowed up in man, and
                            be incorporated with the human body and become one with it, the anticipation of such an
                            exalted state might be very pleasing to the mind of that animal; but should he imagine that
                            man would form the union by swallowing him alive he must find himself greatly mistaken in
                            the issue. Now, considering the great disparity between sinful man and God, it need not be
                            thought strange if those who express the above prayer with great fervor, should be as
                            greatly disappointed when the process is entered upon, by which the all-important union is
                            effected. The Schismatics however, considered this union to have taken place first of all in
                            the person of Jesus Christ. Hence, many important questions were agitated concerning this
                            extraordinary person, the end of his mission into the world, the nature of the work which
                            was given him to do, and how that work was to effect us. Upon which different hypotheses
                            were formed according to the proficiency of each in the New-Light and the Schismatic
                        spirit.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sonnet" TEIform="index"/> SONNET.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bowers, Lucy S."

                            am led to serious reflections how any one who has ever been drawn into this fold of Christ,
                            as made manifest by the teachings of Mother Ann, can be led back again into "the weak and
                            beggarly elements of the world." It is evident they are not seeking the higher life which
                            can alone be attained by and through those teachings, of which I am convinced there is
                            nothing superior ; a religion which not only teaches chastity as one of its fundamental
                            truths, but which also requires the practice of every Christian virtue in order to attain to
                            that perfection of life on earth which is within the reach of all who desire to feel the
                            justification of the righteous. Possibly it may be accounted for in this way. There are
                            different degrees of light, even as "one star differeth from another star in glory," and the
                            same amount of faith necessary to establish one in the truth may be wanting, as well as a
                            deficiency of moral courage to live according to the requirements that are essential to the
                            building up of a perfect Christian character. And here comes in the beautiful gift of
                            charity, which is said to cover a multitude of imperfections. Experience teaches that true
                            happiness comes not by indulgence in selfgratification and aggrandizement, but by a daily
                            crucifixion to all the lower elements of our nature. In this labor we feel an inward
                            satisfaction, a knowledge of doing right, and for every victory gained we have our reward,
                            which is that of a justified conscience. I would not thus labor for the sake of reward in a
                            life to come, although we have an assurance that the better our lives are on earth, the
                            better prepared we are to meet whatever is for us in the future. Nay, I would perform life's
                            duties, both temporal and spiritual, in a truly conscientious and consecrated manner. It is
                            my duty, my pleasure so to do, and in no other way can I feel justified on my voyage through
                            this life. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            one more elevating, purifying and redeeming? What was the character it formed in him ? One
                            of strictest integrity and rectitude�one of purest benevolence and self-sacrifice for the
                            welfare of his kind ever known ; fearless in the defence of right; bold as a lion, 3ret
                            meek. A character approved and admired by the best minds of every race and religious
                            persuasion. How did he form this character which is not known to have been surpassed, and
                            rarely if ever equalled by any other recorded in history ? By practicing in daily life, all
                            the truths of his understanding, the highest and noblest conceptions of his soul, stamped
                            thereon by the impress of the Almighty. Because of his determined obedience, even to the
                            sacrifice of every earthly interest, when necessary, and the complete subordination of every
                            appetite and passion to the primary end he received power from the Almighty to overcome all
                            obstacles. This is the pattern we have placed before us, and this is the end we have
                            proposed for ourselves. Do any suppose that our aim is too high, and that Jesus was designed
                            to be an isolated example of unapproachable perfection ? Far from it. He is the first-born
                            of many brethren, and Ann, which means' grace, or a gift, was the first-born of many
                            sisters. Jesus is our Elder Brother, Teacher and Exempler, and Ann is our Elder Sister,
                            Teacher and Exempler likewise. How did they bear witness to the Truth? By living it
                            perfectly, and totally renouncing the service of error. Can any one _ ever bear effectual
                            witness to the Truth of salvation from sin without living as Jesus lived? that is, a
                            spiritual life free from sin and carnal joys? We believe none but such as he can know the
                            truth above its merest rudiments. How can they bear witness, who are traveling in an
                            opposite direction? Jesus testified, "The words which I speak to you, are spirit and life."
                            They came forth from his life and marked a clear line of distinction, between good and evil,
                            and placed it in the heart, which contains by nature a mixture of both, and never could make
                            a clean separation till his testimony drew the line. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="At one time Father William Lee called at the shop..." TEIform="index"/>

                            promises thereto. "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is
                            in the midst of the paradise of God." Rev. ii., 7. "He shall not be hurt of the second
                            death." 11. "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give
                            him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that
                            receiveth it." 17. ' 'And he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I
                            give power over the nations." 26. "And he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels
                            of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father." 27. "And I
                            will give him the morning star." 28. "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
                            raiment; and I will not blot out his name from the book of life." Ill-, 5. "Him that
                            overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God: and he shall go no more out: and I
                            will write upon him the name of my God : and the name of the city of my God, which is new
                            Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new
                            name." 12. ' 'To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I
                            also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." 21. These are the promises the
                            Lord has given to inspire us to overcome. The question may be asked, How can I overcome ? In
                            order for a Christian to become an overcomer, he must "watch and pray lest he enter into
                            temptation," for satan is ever ready to lead us astray unless we are watching. s The more we
                            try to live holy, the greater the trials become, seeking to overthrow us and hinder our
                            progress, but we must not be discouraged if we do not succeed at first, for it is a great
                            warfare between the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil. Satan is an arch deceiver and
                            he will bring things before us sometimes in such a fair way, as to make us think we are all
                            right and hurries us on in his charming way, when by and by we begin to feel a little
                            disturbed in our minds and then comes a sting of conscience, which reminds us that all is
                            not right. It is then that we begin to examine ourselves to see where the trouble is and we
                            find that we have not watched as closely as we should have done, in order to discern between
                            the two spirits, Christ and antichrist, and find that we have listened to the tempter and
                            been led wrong. It is a good experience to know both spirits so that we can discern more
                            fully when the true spirit is manifested. It has always been first a trial, then a blessing
                            ; we have to learn both sides that we may have a thorough knowledge of the work of the
                            spirit which every one does not know, for it is the secret work of God and none but those
                            that fear God and keep his commandments can know it. No person can be an<pb n="154" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> overcomer without the aid of the spirit and power of God. Pschycological power is not
                            powerful enough to do it as I have seen it demonstrated in many instances, by their own
                            confession, "That they knew nothing about the power of God, and only knew mesmerism and
                            Pschycology" and they had been over twenty and even fifty years yet the work was not
                            accomplished. It takes God's almighty power to kill 'or subdue the natural man and make him
                            perfect, like Jesus who said, ' 'Be ye perfect as I am perfect, and holy as I am holy." Then
                            the natural man must be crucified, his lust must be subdued in every sense, in order to
                            become a perfect spiritual man like Christ and to be an overcomer and inherit the promises

                            May, 1891.</dateline><p TEIform="p">My Dear Friend :�Some months have passed since I received your letter announcing the death of
                            Elder Aitken, which was a shock to me, but no calamity to him who had lived on the narrow
                            isthmus between the visible spiritual, and the invisible. It was a mere step from the one to
                            the other, a step I am glad to know he took without pain. You were also kind enough to send
                            me the life of Ann Lee and other literature, historical and explanatory of the Shaker
                            system. For these, I thank you very much, and they must in some degree be my apology for not
                            writing to you sooner. To read them with the care they demand, and think over the incidents
                            in Ann Lee's life and work needs much time, concentration of mind and development of
                            spiritual insight. My life is so occupied that I have needed much space to adequately study
                            the Shaker principles and the order of their solution in the world. Before they can be
                            remotely understood, as it seems to me, one needs to have made some progress in spiritual
                            growth and to have realized that the Christianity of the creeds is merely a crude method of
                            discerning the facts of that transcendent philosophy of the spiritual nature of man and the
                            universe. The churches mistake the husk for the fruit, the shadow for the substance. Faith
                            must be progressive, as the Spirit is ever learning; the churches are solidified into dead
                            dogmas, into stupefying ceremonials, and into rigid doctrines. The materialistic bent of the
                            age is due entirely to this, for the churches have stifled the Spirit, and become wholly
                            corporeal, external and mundane. It was an immense effort for a woman to protest against
                            this tendency in the eighteenth century, and in the midst of our Lancashire laboring
                            population. This I can understand better than some people, for I live not far from
                            Manchester, and am a native of Lancashire and familiar with the ideas of its inhabitants.
                            To-day there are the types of the gross and unspiritual beings who persecuted and mocked Ann
                            Lee so long ago. I am sure she was led of the Spirit to the New World'. Here she would<pb n="155" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> have made no permanent Society. True it is yet, of us, ithat a
                            prophet has no honor in his own country. It was necessary for the Shakers to establish
                            themselves in a region where new spiritualism could take root and grow. That has happened,
                            and I believe the future will see a great development of the Community. You have so many
                            advantages that the world lacks, that your progress appears to be inevitable. You have the
                            calm which controls all things, material, mental and spiritual; the world lives in a state
                            of terrific agitation, and consumes itself for want of repose. You are honest in your
                            dealings; the world is a conspiracy of the fraudulent, and business is mere brigandage. You
                            live healthy lives, producing the necessaries and natural embellishments of the human lot;
                            the world is insane in the research for the superfluous, the meretricious and the
                            artificial. You thrive; the world grows poor in the midst of its illusory riches. Clearly
                            the advantages are all on the side of the Shakers from a mere earthly point of view. But you
                            have other advantages the world know not of, namely the intense conviction of the truth of
                            man's spiritual nature ; that is life, wherever we may be, here in the visible world or
                            beyond,�its absence is death, indeed. I have only been able to read the books you sent me at
                            intervals; They have interested me very much and I shall continue to study them ; for I am
                            convinced that stupendous changes are at work that will revolutionize the lot of mankind
                            here on earth, and in that supreme change, the teachings of Ann Lee and those who continue
                            her teachings will have a great part. It does seem extraordinary that the regeneration of
                            the race shall begin by stopping generation after the physical order, and to the bulk of men
                            and women it is incredible now, but the light of the spirit appears to indicate that such
                            must be. I have had peculiar experiences with regard to the operation of the spirit, and
                            this enables me to study your system with a clearness and a sympathy that few can feel. I am
                            convinced, too, that woman has yet to play a supreme part in directing the spiritual path of
                            man. She has gifts which men know not. As a friend of your cause, will you favor me with
                            further information? Believe me sincerely your friend, and pardon my tardy reply.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Flynt, William Garret" TEIform="persName"/> William Garret Flynt.</byline></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Every soul that bears itself nobly through the individual experience..."

                                To preach the word of God as we understand it...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">To preach the word of God as we understand it, seems to be the larger pai't of our work
                                while making our earthly pilgrimage. As faith comes by hearing, comes by the testimony
                                of the cross, active preachers must be engaged in that spiritual duty which is forever,
                                to establish them upon a sure foundation. In this case it is quite essential that we
                                should understand the word of God correctly, that good may be increased on the earth.
                                Take away the antichristian mystery that has been attached to the life of Christ, and to
                                the revelation of light, and the whole subject may be easily comprehended. God is light!
                                and He is no less the fulness of love and truth. To walk in the light is to walk in God,
                                and this leads one at the same time to walk in love and in the truth. Surrounded by such
                                protective safeguards there can be no fear of stumbling, or being overtaken with
                                darkness. Here, "the foundation of God standeth sure." In manual labor as well as in
                                labor of mind we should do our best, and in this way work for God. He is no respecter of
                                persons. The offer is open to all; to the aged, to the youth, to the educated and to the
                                ignorant. As faith is a gift of God, and as the privilege to accept the principles of
                                godliness is also a gift of God, the acceptance becomes a matter of choice with those
                                who wish to do good and to be good. In everything that leads to God his gifts are
                                manifested, and they make of man a being with reasoning faculties, who must be looking
                                forward and upward, and who must at the same time, find life and light in the element
                                that is above a mere animal existence. Among the first tests of a religious life is the
                                manner in which a man does his work and followins: this is the manner in which he
                                governs his tongue. As faith comes by hearing how very necessary it is that we hear
                                correctly. Our future success may depend largely upon the acceptance of these primary
                                lessons. In this, children and youth may find<pb n="157" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> a place to work as
                                effectually as those of more mature minds. A thought, a word or an act may be the
                                redeeming phase that shall change the course of life into a better way. Every effort to
                                do good in the advancement of the individual or in the better growth of Society is a
                                step in advance, and a degree nearer the millennium of the person or of the Society. It
                                is the development of the higher qualities of the mind that insures happiness, that
                                makes the heavenly state ; while to be ruled by the lower or selfish propensities
                                produces unhappiness and makes our abode on earth a place of torment. Fortunately,
                                however, for the human race, there evidently has been a growing inclination toward a
                                better state of manhood. As gradual as may have been the ascendency there has been no
                                doubt, a vast change for the better. Brute force has given place to reason and at the
                                present time there is a growing interest in the peace, prosperity and happiness of the
                                race. Great sacrifices are made of wealth of time and of personal comfort to ameliorate
                                the condition of the human family, and this fraternal feeling extends even to the care
                                and kindness to the animal kingdom. How extensive is the field of labor that is
                                presented to the faithful servant, and how opportune the time in which to establish an
                                unwaveringfaith in God. A thousand avenues are opened in which to do good. Blessings
                                become more and more abundant and the saving faith is being preached by those who put
                                their hands at work and give their hearts to God. All of this becomes a labor of love,
                                as in giving to God, and to the cause of righteousness we receive more abundantly of all
                                spiritual gifts. It is the preaching of faith. We listen with attention, and with
                                pleasure learn that we have in possession that precious prize, that beautiful gift of
                                God. AYe may now rest upon a foundation that cannot be shaken. Heaven and earth may pass
                                away but tliis gift which comes to us from God can never be destroyed.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Rules for using books" TEIform="index"/> RULES FOR USING BOOKS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">Never hold a book near a fire.

                                prompt and in season. I will. On the 7th. we commenced our Society Meetings and it was a
                                good beginning. I hope every Society will bear in mind, that next year will be our
                                centennial of the gathering of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing into gospel
                                order; without order it would be impossible to maintain our Communal relation. The
                                gathering of the Church into order was a very important event in our history. There was
                                more in it than the carnal mind has any idea of. The establishing of a system under
                                which all nations could gather and live in harmony and peace for a hundred years must
                                have a great deal of divine goodness in it; human skill alone could never accomplish it.
                                The United States are making extensive preparations to celebrate the discovery of
                                America, the home of liberty, or will be when the true earthly order is established
                                therein. Let us have a grand festival in 1892! "Kaise the gospel standard higher, let
                                its banners be unfurled." We are in the usual business of the season; battling with
                                weeds, lice, fleas, bugs and moths and everything with which vegetation is cursed; it is
                                a constant warfare: no time for idleness. The late frosts we have had, did little or no
                                damage in our section. Have tried quite extensively the spraying of our fruit trees with
                                London Purple to kill the curculio &amp;c. At harvest time we hope to gather fruit
                                without worms. A few weeks ago we enjoyed a short visit from Elder Alexander Work of
                                Groveland. He reports that the frost has destroyed all their fruit, of which they had
                                such glowing promise. This is the third year their fruit has been cut off, and not only
                                their fruit but the crops upon which they depend for material subsistence have been
                                destroyed by flood and frost. They really need some practical love administered to them
                                packed well in bbls. �of dried fruit or cases of canned fruit with the freight prepaid;
                                or perhaps what would be better, some well-filled checks sent by mail. Gospel love is
                                like the widow's cruise of oil; it never grows less by pouring on the needy. Bring forth
                                tithes from our stores and pour them into Groveland and prove the blessedness of gospel
                                love. Our Ministry all in usual health start for Watervliet this A. M. ~s In kindest

"Hands at

                                vineyard, and look from any point of observation the view is cheering, and inspires us
                                with courage to persevere in adding new attractions to home and surroundings. Painting
                                has been successfully cai'ried forward about our premises for the past two weeks, fences
                                and buildings receiving their share. The garden has suffered from the long drought, yet
                                water has been supplied to some of the smaller vegetables and kept them growing and at
                                present lettuce, spinach and radishes are ready for use daily. Asparagus is doing well
                                now although backened by the cold winds. Potatoes and peas are looking well considering
                                the drought and severe cold winds that seemed to threaten everything with destruction.
                                The currant worms came in quantities, but they were soon dispatched by a free use of

                                and simple as these words are, if we put them in practice in our daily lives all our
                                hopes of future happiness will be fully realized. The self-denying way is delightful and
                                safe. The broad road may seem pleasant, but let us beware. "There is a way that seemeth
                                right, but the end thereof is death." If we are wise we shall follow virtue's path
                                though the way seem rough and rugged. We shall never regret this constant
                                persevering,�this continual effort in the path of duty, The progress we make may not
                                appear very great, at times, but if it be sure and steady, we shall win the reward. We
                                should not only persevere in that which pertains to our own happiness, but also in our
                                efforts to help others. Freely we have received, let us freely give. The largest
                                sandstone drawn from the Somer's quarry to our station weighed eight tons and four
                                hundred pounds. 4536 spaces of cream were sold in May. A small number of fowls properly
                                cared for will produce more eggs than double the number neglected. Crowding the fowls
                                calls for two much competition, too many struggles for existence, and the weaker ones
                                will be unprofitable. The plan to pursue is to keep as many as may be easily managed and
                                no more. We should not attempt a wholesale business with retail facilities. There is
                                both pleasure and profit in poultry, but also loss where they are mismanaged. D.

Dear Elder Henry:�On the ,16th., we had an unexpected visit from Elder
                                John B. Vance of Alfred, Me. Being in Boston on business and finding he could not get
                                through to his place in time, he concluded to come and stay with us over Sunday, and we
                                found it a very profitable<pb n="160" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> and beneficial visit. In our service he
                                spoke words of wisdom and strength, and dwelt largely in his testimony upon the spirit
                                of Charity. His expressions, many of them were new and therefore interesting. Since
                                having time for reflection, thoughts have passed through my mind, and none with more
                                weight and force than upon this redeeming spirit,�charity. We are here as Brothers and
                                Sisters claiming relationship by obedience to a faith made sacred to us by the fruits we
                                have thus far realized. But all possessing a nature a little stronger for our own ways
                                and wills than for the general good and benefit of the institution. Should we not in
                                judging and giving our opinions, use a little of this spirit, knowing we are not capable
                                of judging another's motives. Many of the faults that come into society germinate in an
                                overtaxed brain and go no farther than the head, while the heart is as true and genuine
                                as the purest gold. The spirit of charity and cheerfulness go hand in hand. A wise
                                author once made the remark, "I never knew a cheerful man to be a bad man." What a
                                glorious element a sunshiny person throws over society. While this melancholy spirit may
                                be sure evidence to some of extraordinary piety, the cheerfulness which I mean to
                                represent is not a momentary mood, but a lasting temper. It has not the noise of mirth,
                                nor the emptiness of levity. It is a serious and abiding joy, resembling the flame of a
                                wax candle, so steady, bright and pure. Forebodings of evil, rob the mind of
                                cheerfulness. Ills that never have happened have mostly made people wretched. Casting a
                                glance ahead we see lions in the way, difficulties which we are sure we can never
                                overcome. Not satisfied with our present troubles we borrow misery from the future.
                                "Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the
                                things of itself." This is what the cheerful man and woman sings through the day, and
                                this gives them the golden promise, "As thy day, so shall thy strength be." Disease may
                                have a tendency to cast a gloom over the spirit. As the body sympathizes with the mind,
                                their union is so intimate and delicate that what affects one affects the other.
                                Therefore, it becomes our duty as Christians, if we have health to study the laws of our
                                being and compel ourselves to labor and to rest; avoid all unnecessary exposure, abstain
                                from all that is injurious, by living prudently and temperately, and by every means try
                                to preserve what is so essential to our spiritual comfort. Count up our mercies instead
                                of our miseries. Try the medicine of cheerfulness. It may not insure you a full
                                recovery, but it will certainly produce a pleasant alleviation. "A merry heart doeth
                                good like medicine, but a broken spirit drieth the bones." A. D.

                                reporting the blossoming of trees and the ripening of fruit, those of us who live in a
                                more northern climate must patiently wait the allotted time for our seasons to roll
                                around before we can enjoy the fruit that grows by our own care. It was not till the
                                18th. of May that the cherry trees were in full bloom, and the passing of another week
                                before the apple trees were arrayed in all their blossoming glory. The farmers and
                                gardeners may have been a little in advance of last year, on the opening of spring, but
                                the continued cold weather has prevented the crops from making a very rapid advance. The
                                wild strawberry plants made a very liberal dis-<pb n="161" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> play of flowers
                                and some one has said that some other one has just found a ripe berry. The plants under
                                cultivation are receiving the much-needed care and in a few days will reward us
                                bountifully for all the labor that has been expended. The currant pest has again made
                                its appearance. After the worms are ready for action they Avant but a few hours in which
                                to destroy the whole crop of currants, and a liberal sprinkling of helebore over all the
                                bushes is, at present, our only remedy. As we are more anxious to save the currants than
                                Ave are to save the worms, a supply of helebore is near at hand to be used as often as
                                may be needed. It is quite too early to know much about the fruit for the coming months
                                and avo can only anticipate the days of a rich harvest. The grass crop is all that one
                                could desire at this date. If and if all things work together for good there may be an
                                abundance of hay and great rejoicing among those who are interested in the keeping of
                                stock. But what of our pastures? They are fast being overrun with trees and bushes, and
                                the surface for grass, where the cattle can feed, is diminishing very rapidly from year
                                to year. The dogs of New Hampshire have for many years prevented the farmers from the
                                keeping of sheep, and the ruin of the pasture lands has been more or less the result. At
                                this eleventh hour the state has aroused from its slumbers and the thousand and one
                                useless members of the canine family are to be kept more carefully at home or incur the
                                penalty of the law. It is better to be aAvakened at the eleventh hour than not at all,
                                but it would have been better for the farming population of N. H. if the much-needed
                                protection had been secured some years sooner.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Alfred, Maine" TEIform="index"/> Alfred, Me.</head><p TEIform="p">June 12, 1891.

                                However I have borrowed one of Beloved Elder John and Avill try to bring our little
                                Society into union. If: I were a poet I would tell you how beautiful is Mother Earth,
                                clothed in her mantle of green, and how joyfully the feathered songsters fill the air
                                Avith musical sounds. But not being a poet I Avill report that the grass is rather thin
                                because of the cold weather through May. The Brethren planted live acres of potatoes in
                                April, earlier than ever before known in this Society. In May, thirteen acres of corn
                                were planted besides beans, cucumbers &amp;c, which the Brethren are now hoeing with
                                the help of one hired man. Fruit trees blossomed out fairly well. We hope the promise
                                thus given may ultimate in AATell grown fruit next Autumn. The green pastures increased

Beloved Elder Henkt:�I was just a little too late for the last Manifesto,
                                so you see I am trying to be more prompt for this month. The planting is done. We
                                purchased a National Keversible Sulkey Plow, and one young man sixteen years old avIio
                                had never turned a furrow before did all of our ploAving except about eight acres, which
                                was done last fall. The Brethren have worked thirty acres of ground this Spring with no
                                help from hired men and they feel greatly rejoiced with their success and the<pb n="162" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> prosperity which has thus far attended their labor. The unsightly fences
                                are being removed and new ones put in their places as fast as possible. The second
                                pasture for the hens has been made, containing about a square acre which will prevent
                                them from destroying garden crops. Meanwhile, the Sisters have not been idle. We are
                                busy with our flower-gardens. Have set out aster and pansy plants Marguerite pinks, and
                                verbenas that were started early under glass. Eoses, geraniums and Carnation pinks were
                                conveyed to the garden in season to receive slight touches from Jack Frost, from which
                                they have bravely recovered. The sweet peas are growing finely. We hope to supply the
                                guests of the Poland Spring Hotels with all the flowers they will want this summer. Our
                                success depends upon the blessings of sunshine and rain which we trust our Heavenly
                                Father will send in the future as He ever has in the past. A. S.

                                duties most varied, Is filling the cup to the brim quite up As the spring months go and
                                are buried. In our last Notes we talked of fruit uninjured by the work of frost out of
                                season. Our report this month is a plain contradiction; all fruits with the exception of
                                raspberries and currants, have met with a fatal blight, it is positive that another
                                fruit famine year will mark the record of the present season. Vegetation is fast
                                becoming withered, for the rain so much needed has not yet appeared; the dust is
                                something fearful, the air is hot and oppressive and more comfort is obtained indoors
                                than out; the cellars are the best resorts for coolness, quiet and moist atmosphere
                                during these days when the mercury is pointing to one hundred degrees in the shade, and
                                rising and rising till the dew begins to fall. About fifteen acres of sweet corn have
                                been planted for drying, if the frost and drought and all other harmful agents are
                                removed from the field we shall witness some busy hours as the harvest days come and go.
                                During the early part of May while workmen were burning brush stray spai'ks were caught
                                up by passing winds and transported to adjacent woods and pastures, burning brush,
                                grass, stumps and nearly forty rods of fencing. With the timely assistance of many hands
                                the fire was extinguished. With disasters we learn anew the lesson of caution in all
                                things. G. D.

                                matters dogmatical and ecclesiastical, than to repeat to each other the words of the Son
                                of Man: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there will I be in the
                                midst,' for the church that is going to satisfy the travail of the heart of Christ, is
                                the one that most truly follows in the footsteps of his most blessed life." We made a
                                note of the above quotation from one of the Reverends, as being to the point; the
                                opening words of counsel cannot but be good for any persuasion to follow, while the
                                closing declaration is certainly an open question for all interested parties to
                                satisfactorily answer individually. What church of all the many denominations claiming

                                just finished reading the bible the one hundredth time, but for what purpose? no one was
                                the wiser; our friend Tolstoi read it a deal less than that with a purpose, and was
                                convinced that Christ never taught creed nor ritual, but a love universal. Evidently,
                                the following to the letter of "his most blessed life" would shake modern society from
                                its foundations, and create a new order of things, and the change unless supernaturally
                                ordained must indeed be gradual for "The mills of God grind slow and sure." But this is

                                of as lovely a lake, as one need wish; no works of art are here displayed not even a

                            manifestations to the human understanding, that obsessions are possible and do take place,
                            more or less according to the developed mental condition or sensitiveness of the medium, is
                            well known. And to it can be accounted many of the strange freaks performed by individuals,
                            that a heartless or cold world condemns as criminal or insane. As the laws that govern the
                            spiritual being are better understood, so will the methods of treating so-called criminals
                            be modified and humanized and brought more fully into accord with the spiritual law, that
                            like attracts like, and those unfortunates will not be punished, but brought under a strong
                            psychological influence, loving and beneficent, demagnetizing and scattering the demoniac
                            forces that had bound the soul, compelling it to act out the malignant designs of the
                            controlling power. Webster defines the word, thus: Obsession. "The state of a person vexed
                            or besieged by an evil spirit." A broader definition would be more acceptable. There are
                            loving and exalted states of mind in which the besieging and controlling powers are pure and
                            exalted souls that are laboring to disengage the medium from the entanglements thrown around
                            it by a lower order of spirit forces. Such are thStrue obsessions to be desired and
                            earnestly sought after by every one who has the<pb n="165" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> best welfare of his
                            fellow beings at heart. It does not, as may be apparent, destroy the free agency of
                            individuals, nor make them less accountable for their acts; for by a certain line of thought
                            are evolved actions, good or bad. And as they are, so according to the law of attraction,
                            spiritual entities are drawn to the individual, corresponding to the mental state of the
                            person to whom they are attracted. . Punishment for crime only tends to increase the desire
                            for criminal acts. The poor unfortunates launched into the world of causes to satisfy the
                            morbid desire and idea that the world wTill be rid of their influence, is false. Entering
                            there with the same tastes and passions that dominated their life here, and released from
                            the environments that contracted them here, their scope is enlarged to pursue their evil
                            course. Coming as obsessing spirits, they are attracted to those in earthlife of similar
                            desires, ofttimes completely controlling their actions, producing at times the various
                            phases of intentional criminals. On those grounds alone, the death penalty stands condemned
                            as only augmenting the evil it is trying to check. Dealing with effects and letting the
                            causes remain that are in constant operation to produce those effects, is not remedial, even
                            temporarily. But that is what our so-called civilization of the nineteenth century is doing.
                            To become polarized to that extent, that, conscious of the indwelling spirit of the good and
                            true, the individual can enter the association of the criminally vicious, even with the
                            desire to influence them to a nobler life, without being more or less influenced by them, is
                            a condition very few have ever attained. That Jesus attained to that condition, is apparent.
                            When he was accused of seeking the companionship of the criminal classes, he replied that he
                            came not to minister to the righteous, but to draw sinners to repentance. Conscious of that
                            exalted atmosphere of purity and truth that enveloped his being, stronger than the malignant
                            forces that surrounded him, he could enter the abodes of degradation, and by the power of
                            that spiritual force that was dominant in his life, inspire them with better aspirations and
                            desires. Only by a deep and earnest soul travail can this be attained. The common lot of
                            mortals is to be more or less influenced by surrounding conditions. Then the importance to
                            have them exalted in sentiment, to enable the soul to unfold the better part. Only thus wall
                            the final emancipation be attained. Sonyea, N.

                                    usually likely to say what they like, whether true or false, and their statements
                                    are often as inaccurate as their acts are unreasonable. If the principle of
                                    lawlessness and disorder possesses the will, it will run through the whole being.
                                    The tongue is the index of the life and the character. Out of the abundance of the
                                    heart the mouth speaketh. By their words men shall be justified, and l)j<pb n="166" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> their words they shall be condemned. He that bridles his tongue can
                                    bridle his whole body. He who cannot rule his temper cannot control his tongue. An
                                    unreasonable will, makes an unruly tongue. The voice of wisdom says: "Make no
                                    friendship with an angry ir.an." The defect in his character is radical, and in the
                                    case of a man who has but one favilt, the fault is generally sufficiently serious to
                                    pervade and vitiate his whole character. If the words are right the will can hardly
                                    be wrong; and if the will is wrong the words will not be right.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="food" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Do not add condiments to food while cooking..."

                                reading it. It is to me spiritual food. Its fearless yet charitable spirit in condemning
                                wrong, and its unqualified appreciation of the right, teaches me to distinguish between
                                right and wrong likewise. From a desire to see mankind disciplined in Christ's gospel so
                                pure and redeeming, I say the Manifesto should be in every home. Its healthy moral and

For
                                instance, headache almost always yields to the simultaneous application of hot water to
                                the feet and back of the neck. A towel folded several times, and dipped in hot water,
                                and quickly wrung out and applied over the toothache or neuralgia, will generally afford
                                prompt relief. A strip of flannel, or napkin folded lengthwise, and dipped in hot water
                                and wrung out, and then applied round the neck of a child that has the croup, will
                                sometimes give relief in ten minutes. Hot water taken freely half an hour before
                                bedtime, is helpful in the case of constipation and has a most soothing effect upon the
                                stomach. A goblet of hot water taken just after rising, before breakfast, has cured
                                thousands of cases of indigestion, and no simple remedy is more widely recommended by

THE  MANIFESTO.
THE MOST PRACTICAL MEN IN HISTORY.
OUil   PURITAN  FOREFATHERS'   HEADS  Vt KKE
IN HEAVEN, BUT THEIR HANDS WERE
ON EARTH.
The Pilgrim Fathers were the most
practical and "present" set of men of
whom I can think in all history, the least
hampered by tradition, the least affected
Ly any weak sentimentalism, the most directly concerned with the duty that lay
nearest, the least self-conscious and theatrical of any men who ever lived an epic.
They attended to business. With heads
in heaven, their feet were solidly upon
earth, and their hands busy with the work
of Leyden and Plymouth. They were
anxious about their souls; but as Lowell
has said again, "Men anxious about their
souls have not been by any means the
least skillful in providing for the wants of
the body"�and these hard-handed men of
Plymouth knew that "they must show a
balance on the right side of the countinghouse ledger as well as in their private accounts with their own souls. The liberty
of praying when andhowthey would, must
be balanced with an ability of paying when
and as they ought." These fathers of
ours solved most perfectly that most difficult problem of bringing fine ideals into
healthy contact and partnership with the
hard, prosaic things of common life.
They were great realists, in the true sense
of that damaged word, not transcendentalists.�From "The Message of Puritanism for this Time," by Edwin D. Mead, in
New England Magazine for June.
Any Article that has outlived 2i'2 years of competition
and imitation, and sells more

merit. Dobbins' Electric feoap

THAT   ARTICLE.         Those   who
use it each week, and their

and strength, and let soap do
the work. All that we can
say as to its merits, pales into
nothingness, before the story
it will tell, itself, of its own
perfect purity and quality, if
you will give it one trial. Ask
your grocer for it, He has it,
or will get it. Try it next
Monday.

The Book Trust Knocked Out,
A CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
Some six months ago we began the publication of our reprint of the famous Encyclopaedia Britannica in 25 Volumes, which
we issued at $1.50 per volume. The price
of the English edition always has been
and still is $8.00 per volume, and the
Scribner edition $5.00 per volume in the
cheapest binding.
That the public appreciate so great a
bargain is shown by the fact that over
half a million volumes of this reprint have
been sold in less than six months.
This elegant new edition we still offer
at the same price, $1.50 per volume. This
is the greatest bargain ever known in books.
Better still, we will deliver the set complete on small easy payments, to suit the
convenience of customers.
Kemember this is not an abridgement,
but the great Edinburgh ninth edition,
reproduced page for page, with important articles on American subjects rewritten to date by eminent American authors,
and new maps, later and better than in
any other edition.
Special Offee.�We claim that our reprint compares favorably with the high
priced editions in every respect, and in
respect to maps, and strength and beauty
of bindings is superior to them. In order
that this claim may be tested by a person
al inspection we make the following proposition: We will furnish volume I. at
60 cts.�& fraction of actual cost�if sent
by express. Add 40 cts. postage if wanted
by mail. Amount paid for Volume I. will
be credited on price of set when ordered.
