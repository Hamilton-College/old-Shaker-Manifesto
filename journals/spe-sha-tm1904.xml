TEIform="persName"/>Giles B. Avery.</byline><p TEIform="p">As our ship's crew were tossed on the billows of life's restless ocean, suffering tho
                            disappointments of conflicting winds and tides, retarded in progress to our destined haven
                            until our stores for life's sustenance and comfort were reduced to a minimum capacity, and
                            our thirst becoming unendurable, while the waters of the dreary ocean waste on which our
                            bark was drifting were brackish and bitter, seeing, in the distance a hopeful craft, we
                            hoisted signals of distress ; she hailed us and inquired the cause of our troubles. We
                            replied, perishing for want of water. A voice replied, "Let down the buckets. You are in the
                            mouth of the Amazon River, the largest stream of fresh water known to the inhabitants of
                            earth; let down the buckets and help yourselves to refreshments." But, though up borne by
                            its waves and resting on its bosom, our ship's crew still inquire "In what latitude, in what
                            longitude, in which hemisphere is this spiritual queen of rivers to be found ? Through what
                            kingdoms does it flow? Where its source? And where, O where, into what ocean does it pour
                            its living, refreshing tide? Seeking its sources we have traversed earth's domains and found
                            them not They are not harbored there, yet earth's inhabitants intuitively and educationally
                            believe in their existence." This notable spiritual river is the philosopher's theme ; the
                            author's throne ; the prophet's haven; the poet's song, and the Christian's amulet. It is
                            the river upon whose waters floats the heavenly argosy; yet, its stream, though broad and
                            long, with current irresistible, is not found on earth! Then, O ye bright
                            angels,�missionaries from wisdom's throne,�ye who know the geography of the heavens, Where
                            is this holy river to be found ? Better than all the waters of " Abana and Pharpar" deeper,
                            clearer and sweeter than the Jordan its waters flow forth to teem with life and sweet
                            perfume the flowers of Paradise, and watering the land oi Promise it develops and matures,
                            under the sunlight of truth, the fruits in the garden of God. A seraph from the haven of
                            bliss now offered to be our pilot. She said, "This river is the waters of soul life,� the
                            love, power and salvation of God�a baptism that fills the heavens with sympathetic harmony
                            and unselfish interest, and makes the society of the souls of the righteous aglow with love
                            to all<pb n="74" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> mankind so true as to seek to lift them to mansions of rapturous
                            joy. It is a power which reproves the world of sin, and slakes the thirst of the sinner for
                            its bitter waters, while it woos and entrances the soul who will drink of its refreshing
                            stream, and strengthen it to direct its course home to God. The flow of this beautiful river
                            is on the broad plains of the spiritual continent of God's mercy and goodness ; its sources
                            are the bowers of the graces that shine forth in the life deeds, the righteousness of the
                            saints, and the ministering angels of heaven who do the will of God." Then we inquired of
                            our heavenly pilot, How may mankind find access to this spiritual Amazon, to drink of its
                            soul inspiring waters, and receive spiritual refreshment and vigor from its sparkling,
                            sacred well-springs, bathe in its limpid flowing stream or sail upon its sweetly rolling
                            waves into the haven of sweet peace and celestial joy ? She replied, "The pathway to its
                            fountain is not a thorny maze of disbelief in the eternal existence of souls ; not through
                            marshes of doubts of the existence of God, nor through tangled vines of queries whether vice
                            shall meet a punishment of sufferings of spirit, or virtue be crowned with soul joy and
                            bliss ; not whether there are shoals of disappointments to our journey's ends ; nor yet
                            through a wilderness of gloom�the erroneous notion that the chaHgei-called death of the
                            physical body is an eternal sleep, during which there is no conscious existence, and
                            eternity is a meaningless blank, a boundless void; not through a wildwood chaparral of hopes
                            of happiness never to be realized even by the good, the true, nor fears of sorrows, the
                            fruits of sin and folly never to have an end, nor through a thicket of hatred, malice and
                            revenge. Ah nay, the pathway leading to this glorious heavenly Amazon is a highway east up
                            by souls, who, turning from sin to righteousness, clear all obstacles to progress from the
                            track and smooth the road by cultivating peace and union. All gates barring the way are
                            lifted or turned from the track by forsaking the sinful pleasures of sense, and weaning the
                            soul from earthly vanities and follies ; giving the senses and aspirations of life to seek
                            spiritual, instead of carnal enjoyments. The scientist pursues his tireless task of
                            observations, experiments and researches into the nature of causes and the history of their
                            effects, for nameless years unabated, undaunted, not discouraged, and is oft rewarded with
                            untold gains of wealth and earthly substance. The philosopher collects and arranges facts,
                            traces the historic record of failure of that system, and success of this, thus learns
                            wisdom and develops vision to see the truth, and strength to heed its instructions. The
                            chemist experiments with untiring investigation to learn the properties of matter, and the
                            relations and correlations of particles and ele-i ments. The mechanic plies his skill with
                            limitless energy, stretches his mind to comprehend the laws of motion and inertia in order
                            to construct some improved plan or machine for aiding human weal. The farmer regards the
                            seasons, and toils on, though sometimes suffering fruitless endeavor and bitter
                            disappointment; and thus life's career advances, and evolves progress, increasing earthly
                            happiness, treasure, and pleasure.<pb n="75" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> In like manner, and with similar
                            persistency let the soul ply its powers of inquiry after the spiritual light, truth, wisdom,
                            power and sxibstance of spiritual life ; let it increasingly travel in a straightforward
                            path of obedience to truth revealed and comprehended, let h tire not in its application of
                            known law s of progress in seeking the Sowings of the river of life, the spiritual Amazon
                            that waters the Paradise of the heavens, and its labors will not be fruitless. With a wand
                            of determined and undaunted resolution let it smite Meribah's rock of promise and a fountain
                            of living waters will gush forth�the sources of the Amazon of heaven,�a river sufficiently
                            deep and broad to float all the Argosies belonging to the merchantmen of Paradise, and so
                            clear, sweet and refreshing that souls may let down into it their buckets and draw therefrom
                            living water sufficient to quench the thirst of all the creation of God. Mt. Lebanon, N.

Credited with
                            being industrious, consequently self-supporting, some suppose this to be the sole object of
                            our association. We do not see,<pb n="76" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> how temporal considerations could hold a
                            people in Farmony. It is vital Christianity that purifies the heart that keeps us together.
                            This was the origin of Shakerism. Over a century ago, a revival in England separated many
                            honest souls from old church dogmas. Among these were the Puritans, Quakers, and a few who
                            aspired to a life of virgin purity, after the order of Jesus and his Disciples. Ann Lee was
                            leader of this little company. Being persecuted they repaired to America in the year 1774.
                            Soon religious revivals sprang up in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York. In
                            each of these States Societies of Shakers were formed which are still in operation. After
                            this, extensive revivals prevailed in Kentucky and Ohio. From these in 1805, gprang five
                            .Societies, two in Kentucky and three in Ohio which still exist. This shows that Shakerism

                            their ruinous habits. From bad to good. When worship is merely ceremonial, satisfied without
                            liviug inspiration, such churches need to awaken, whether it be Shaker or any other. Ma)
                            love purify us, place our feet in virtue's paths, open our vision to fruitful fields, where
                            the spirits are advancing to enjoy the society of each other in innocence. This will satisfy
                            our longings for happiness. May we all be nearing this condition. " Peace on earth good will

                            do his will and obey his teachings, He will bestow all these blessings upon us, and ofttimes
                            when grief casts its dark vail over us, if we will look trustingly to Him in faith He will
                            send the comforter. What comfort and blessing is this faith, this mighty anchor that stays
                            the soul when the waves of emotion would overpower it, if this blessed power did not break
                            forth in its full strength. I feel that good spiri's are ever near, ready to help and

                            The heaviness of the cold winter is slowly passing away, the birds again are returning to
                            cheer us with their songs, and in a short time the earth will be robed in its garme it of

                            my soul could rejoice in wearing ; and I pray to God and good spirits for strength to bear
                            me on and hold me up in my faith. Of myself alone I could do nothing ; but as God has
                            endowed me with faith and understanding, and I feel as far as I have obeyed this light, I
                            have been blest, and am now, in being privileged to enjoy my faith unmolested from the world
                            in the quietness of my gospel home. I shall daily strive to walk uprightly before God and

                            is placed ; The thoughts and motives of my heart By memory's pencil clearly traced. I turn
                            its numbered pages o'er, And retrospectively behold The years of sentient consciousness,
                            That from my life have onward rolled. All shadowed in uncertainty My childhood's winding
                            paths appear, Its joys to sorrows oft were changed, And hope was dimmed by mingled fear. But
                            through those mists of dawning morn, I know an unseen guide was near, A friend whose tender,
                            pitying love My faltering steps directed here. And when I count the fleeting years Borne
                            from my grasp in rapid flight, I pause to mark that season blest, time's pages gleaming

                            faith's unfailing fire Upon the altar of my soul. The love of God had warmed my heart, And
                            given courage for the strife, And taught that through the gates of death We pass to realms
                            of angel life. Increasing hope, and love and peace, Since then my years with joy have

                            [wrought. And while upon the Book of Time, The rolling years new records write, From memory

                            can hope to live eternally, who obtains the power to live not in his perishable self, but in
                            the spiritual elements of the race." The divine principle in man ever struggles for the
                            ascendency. The grossness that clings to his nature is the remnant of his animal heredity.
                            For ages the genus homo has been climbing; slow stages of progress mark his steps onward
                            from brutal instincts, base desires and barbarous deeds, to greater degrees of unfoldment
                            and refinement. The cave-dweller of the past wholly given to selfish animalism, would
                            strangely contrast with the bright soul-orbed philosopher of the present time. Grandly
                            distinctive types of manhood have appeared occasionally down through the centuries, superior
                            in mind and soul to the conditions of environment; as if nature made a mighty effort to
                            reveal the prophecies of the future, aud centered the life aud light of the cosmos in
                            individual suns, as an inspiration and stimulus to lift mankind to higher altitudes of
                            thought aud action. Yet the masses still grovel in low loves and sensuous pleasures,
                            incapable of comprehending the high destiny of the soul, or the true import of endless
                            existence. "Let us eat, drink*and be merry for to-morrow we die" is the language of the yet
                            unenlightened. Instinctive love, having its origin and seat in the basilar region of the
                            brain, sways and controls the natural man and woman ; its emotions are physical and
                            sensuous, and its life was only designed<pb n="78" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> to subserve certain uses and
                            functions on the animal plane of being. Altruistic love resides in the upper coronal region,
                            its impulse and activity are derived from the spiritual nature, and only as the regenerating
                            process goes on in the soul will its influence counteract and hold in check the lower forces
                            that bind and enslave the spirit in the gross realm of materiality. Our nature is ennobled,
                            and our character crystalized in virtue just in proportion as we love our fellow-beings, aud
                            merge our interest and happiness, in the interest and happiness of others. In the lofty
                            regions of altruistic faith we lose sight of our own individuality. Self is annihilated, or
                            absorbed in a life of unselfish devotion. To share with others our gifts, talents, pleasures
                            and delights is supreme bliss, our ever present reward the inflowing peace and consciousness
                            of right doing. This sublime state of attainment is not reached while we cling to the old
                            Adamic, generative nature, whose every thought and act is self-centered egotism. Altruism in
                            its broadest sense, begets love of so exalted a nature, that self is put last in
                            consideration of the benefit and pleasure we may confer on others. It impels us to make
                            sacrifices for the good of the race and for the advancement of righteousness and truth on
                            the earth ; it also inspires us with faith in others and a recognition of virtues and
                            talents that are without the pale of outown personal selfish ambitions. l'If I be lifted up
                            I will draw all men unto me" said the gentle Nazarene. It is this potent psychical power of
                            good, centralized in the pure and noble minded, that shall be effective in uplifting and
                            redeeming the race. If we truly become the offspring of Wisdom and Love, we shall dwell
                            continually in the atmosphere of Universal Benevolence, and our life-influence as far as it
                            extends will be a constant benediction to mankind. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            animal emotions, and an inner, a higher life, represented by the emotions of benevolence,
                            goodness, and aspirations God-ward. 2nd.�Adam and Eve are the type of the animal man ;
                            within their province lies the work of multiplying aud replenishing the earth, subject to
                            law, nevertheless. "The day thou eatest thereof," contrary to law, "�thou shalt surely die ;
                            with shame shalt thou cover thyself. Thy conceptions shall be multiplied, and in sorrow
                            shalt thou bring forth"�a correct delineation of the present condition of the human family.
                            Additional evidence that law has been, and is violated, is found in the many diseases which
                            infect humanity. The Adamic, the old man, can only claim the right to multiply when subject
                            to law. Use, not Lust, is the rule. 3rd.�Jesus Christ was the type of the New, the inner
                            man. k&gt;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." He was not of the world ; his
                            life constituted the resurrection ; he was a celibate ; and all in his life, are as he was.
                            And whenever two or three are gathered<pb n="79" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> together in that life, they will
                            constitute a new order of human society�the resurrection or Christ order ; having property
                            in common, the strong bearing the burdens of the weak, as do the Shakers. "By their works ye
                            shall know them." 4th.�Can the New man marry and be given in marriage, and follow Father
                            Adam, the old man�and still be the new man ? The new man cannot recognize the old man in any
                            of his works, therefore, he must be a celibate. 5th.�-Was Jesus, who took on himself the
                            nature of his brethren whom he came to redeem, a celibate? He was. And were the members of
                            the Pentecostal Church celibates? They were ; and as proof thereof, they had goods in
                            common, and abstained from war. This order of society existed about four hundred years; had
                            they married, there would have been among them a plurality of center^ of affection and of
                            interest, consequently a community of goods could not have been maintained. 6th.�Are the
                            so-called Christians of to-day lineal descendents of the Pente,costal Church? They are not.
                            The lineal descendent of a horse is a horse, having the attributes and manners of a horse.
                            The Christians of to-day are the lineal descendents of the children of this world; they
                            marry, held private property, take advantage of one another, fight a great deal, and quarrel
                            generally. It is said of them that "There is no peace in the church, in the meeting house,
                            in the school-house, in the sewing circle, nor anywhere else among them." 7th.�Should the
                            Adamic man cease from committing sin, and propagate in accordance with law. would he still
                            be the old man ? He would still be the old man, beautiful in his order, yet of the earth,
                            earthy. 8th.�Do you infer that it is in accordance with the higher nature or life in mau to
                            be heavenly while he is in the body? I do ; it is principles worked out�embodied, which
                            constitutes heaven. Heavenly principles, worked out, will bring forth heavenly fruit,
                            without reference to locality. In heaven they do not marry ; therefore, if heaven is ever
                            found on earth, neither will they who are in that kingdom marry, they will be celibates,
                            assuming that state, as a first condition that they are not of the world. 9 th.�You have
                            quoted from the Scriptures, showing that celibacy is a condition of the higher life, but
                            what manifestations have been presented in the history of our race, that celibacy is a
                            condition necessary to the fulfillment of human wants and desires, said desires being in
                            accordance with any laws of man's nature? We can only know of law by its manifestations, and
                            that there is a law in our nature responding to a virgin, a celibate life, is evident. It
                            has cropped out in all ages, from the earliest historic times. It was manifested in the
                            Theraputas of Egypt, and has flourished for thousands of years in Thibet. It cropped out
                            among the Jews in the Nazarites, and was developed as a permanent institution in the
                            community of the Essenes.�It may be traced f.mong the Brahmins and Ascetics of the East. The
                            Monastic orders of Europe speak of its existence during a period of nearly two thousand
                            years. And a class of heretics so-called by the Catholic Church, boldly declared that<pb n="80" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> the law was written on their hearts, and they lived it out in their
                            lives. The order of the vestal priestesses in the Roman temples lasted about a thousand
                            years, and gave sanctity and power, and shows the innate veneration of the human soul for a
                            life of absolute purity. No persons could be more honored and trusted than these females
                            were. Lastly, the Shakers of America are living respondents to the law, that absolute purity
                            of body and spirit ia an essential preliminary to their happiness�the manifestation and
                            growth of the life of God in the soul. They believe that all may enter into a heavenly
                            state, by cultivating heavenly principles. And that it is their mission to keep an open door
                            for all who live as Jesus did, and walk as He did walk. He was the first born of many
                            brethren. Having these abundant evidences in view, we say that Shakerism is not ��'founded
                            on a lie," but on that law which, when operative, has in all ages brought forth the
                            manifestation of God in human spirits. On this rock, and with such materials, will
                            Christ�the elder brother�found and build his church, and the gates of hell will not prevail
                            against it. And that the world may not run itself out, by its own doinga, before the
                            appointed time, we kindly advise all to draw a little nearer to the example of the Shakers,
                            so that their offspring may not die off prematurely, and that a measure of the blessing of
                            God, bodily health, peace and prosperity, may be theirs. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            concerned to know how I should find peace with God ; for I often read in the scriptures that
                            there was no peace for the wicked. While in these exercises of mind, one night, I saw a very
                            admirable woman. As she advanced, I saw a very large flock of sheep following her. They
                            appeared to be the most beautiful flock L ever saw, and were clothed with the cleanest and
                            whitest wool that ever my eyes beheld. The woman advanced till she came to a large plaiu,
                            where she halted; and I saw her bait the sheep with something that was in her hand ; to my
                            view it resembled salt. The sheep all seemed to gather round her and eat. I did not hear a
                            word spoken by the woman ; nor did I speak to her; but I viewed her very attentively, and
                            wondered what it could mean : for the scene appeared very solemn. Tn the spring of 1780, I
                            heard of a strange people living above Albany, who said they served God day and night, and
                            did not commit sin. I thought if there was such a people on earth, they must be the people
                            of God. I did not believe the professors of Christianity around me had this power: for they
                            said they lived in sin, and I believed it; I and I knew I had not found any thing that saved
                            me from sin. Under these considerations, I went to see these remarkable strangers ; for I
                            was determined to see and know for myself what sort of people they were. When I arrived,
                            Mother Ann met me at the door, took hold of my hand and led me into the house. Her first
                            salutation to me was iu these words : "Being a daughter of Zion, how earnest thou hither
                            without a cap on thy head ?" She sat down ir a chair, and I took a seat by her side. Her
                            eyes were shut, and it appeared that her sense was withdrawn from the things of time. She
                            sung melodiously, and appeared very beautiful. Her countenance appeared bright and shining,
                            like an angel of glory, and she seemed to be overshadowed with the glory of God. The
                            graceful motion of her hands, the beautiful appearance of her countenance, and the heaveuly
                            melody of her voice, made her seem like a glorious inhabitant of the heavenly world, singing
                            praises to God. As I sat by the side of her, one of her hands, while in motion, frequently
                            touched my arm ; and at every touch of her hand, I instantly felt the power of God run
                            through my whole body. I then knew she possessed the power of God, and I saw that she was
                            the very same woman I had seen in my night vision, several years before. Could I then
                            dispute the work of God in this woman ? Nay, in no wise ; I could not but acknowledge God iu
                            her ; for God was in her of a truth. Mother Ann and the Elders always maintained a strong
                            testimony against all sin. They taught us to abstain from "the lust of the flesh, the lust
                            of the eye aud the pride of life ;"�to take up our<pb n="82" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> crosses against
                            deceit and lies�agains all fraud, theft and intemperance� against wars and fightings, and
                            every kind of evil. They taught us to con. fess and forsake our sins ; and if we had wronged
                            or injured any of our fellow creatures, to go and make restitution to the full satisfaction
                            of the iujured party, and thus fulfil the strict demands of the moral law ; and follow
                            Christ in the regeneration, by a daily cross against the nature of evil. By becoming
                            personally and intimately acquainted with them, I found their lives and conversation to
                            correspond with their testimony. According to their teaching, I confessed my sins to God,
                            and told these his faithful witnesses what I had done : for I fully believed that in the
                            communion of saints, there was forgiveness of sins. By faithful obedience to what I was
                            taught, I received the gifts of God, and found that power over my own sinful passions, that
                            I was never able to find before, and which gave me peace and justification. I visited Mother
                            Ann at different times, and in different places ; and I never saw anything in her or the
                            Elders, as far as respected their Christian precepts and examples, but displayed a spirit of
                            love and peace, gentleness and meekness, forbearance and long suffering. And though their
                            testimony was sharp and powerful against the fallen nature of man ; yet they were kind and
                            merciful to the humble and penitent soul that was convicted of sin, and sought the mercy of
                            God. If I ever saw the image of Christ displayed, I saw it in Mother i Ann. I considered her
                            a perfect pattern j of piety. When the wicked came to take Moth- j er Ann and the Elders to
                            prison, I was ' present, and was an eye witness to the scene, and to us it was truly a
                            mournful scene. She prayed earnestly that they might be able to endure with patience all
                            that should come upon them. She often prayed for her persecutors, when they came to abuse
                            her, in these words: "Father, forgive them ; for they know not what they do." I feel under
                            no necessity of asking those who seldom or never saw Mother Ann, what kind of person she
                            was; because I know for myself. I was with her and the Elders several weeks at Hancock and
                            Richmond ; and was knowing to their being accused of swearing and blasphemy; but I saw none
                            of these things among them. I there saw several mobs who came to take Mother ; and I knew
                            they were under the influence of something which made them act very inhumanly. Had she been
                            a lewd woman, as they said, they never would have persecuted her as they did. It was the
                            purity and innocence of her life, and the pointed plainness of her testimony against the
                            sins and abominations in which they lived, that excited their enmity against her, and caused
                            them to revile and persecute her. I was with her, day and night, for weeks together; and I
                            knew of her purity and innocence. I was with her at Ashfield, and saw the power of God among
                            the people, through her ministration. I have known her to search out and expose sin and the
                            secret thoughts of the heart, by the discerning power of God, and have seen sinners tremble
                            before her heart-searchiug testimony. When she was at Nathan Goo^.rich's, in Hancock, I was
                            there, and prepared food for her and the Elders, and took care of her room. I know of u
                                cer-<pb n="83" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> tainty that Christ did commence a second appearance in Mother
                            Anr, "without sin unto salvation." And I am thankful to God that I have seen her and
                            believed her testimony : for it has saved me from sin, aud still affords me daily peace aud
                            consolation. , As every thing iu nature brings forth its own likeness, so the gospel has
                            always produced good fruits�the fruits of righteousness and peace, honesty, justice and
                            truth. And by these fruits I know it to be the gospel of Christ�the fountain of eternal
                            life�a stream that is never dry ; for such it has proved to my soul; it refreshes,
                            strengthens aud comforts me day and night. Many hundreds of souls have heard, received and
                            obeyed Mother Ann's testimony, and confessed their sins, taken up their crosses and followed
                            Christ in the regeneration ; and I know that all such souls can witness the truth of what I
                            say. The people of God in ancient days, always had some one to guide and direct them in the
                            way of righteousness ; and they still have a guide. Mother's ministry has ever been
                            maintained by her successors, who have kept her testimony pure and uncorrupted; and in
                            obedience to their counsel and instruction, we can still feel the blessing of God upon our
                            labors. It is my indispensable duty to bear witness to the truth ; and I cannot be justified
                            without it; for I know mankind have been greatly imposed upon by false reports. Our accusers
                            say, the Elders have taken away our property, and we are kept iu bondage by them ; but I
                            know this accusation to be false. We are all free thai are in Christ; we act according to
                            our own faith, and we receive the reward of our own labors, both in things spiritual and
                            temporal. The wicked accuse the people of God" of all manner of evil; and why is it so? It
                            is evidently because these accusers have not found a gospel which can save them from sin :
                            for if they had found such a gospel, and were subject to it, we should hear no more of these
                            accusations. But as they live in all manner of wickedness themselves, they judge us out of
                            their own wicked hearts. When I first heard of these strange people, I was asked what I
                            thought of them. I replied that L was not able to judge ; that if the work they were in was
                            of God, it would stand ; but if not, it would fall without any of my help. Many deprive
                            themselves of a great blessing by speaking against this testimony : for I know by the
                            revelation of God, that all souls that ever find salvation, must find it by obeying this
                            gospel. This is my testimony, and 1 have written it in the fear of God, and can bear witness
                            to it, in truth and soberness, before all my fellow creatures, in time and eternity. New
                            Lebanon, 1827.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To what are we coming?"

The poor wish to get rich and the rich aspire
                            to greater riches, and in too many instances the tradesmen, the farmers, the mechanics and
                            the professional men, are no longer satisfied with a small profit, but desire to do in one
                            year what it took their grandfathers to accomplish in a score of years. The slow but sure
                            method of earning money is no longer fashionable. It belongs to the old style coach period.
                            The six per. cent investment is laughed at.<pb n="84" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> What was called rascality
                            by our fathers, passes current now for business shrewdness. If a man can evade the law he is
                            called sharp, and society hails him as a shrewd manager. If a man can represent himself
                            something different from what he truly is, he is the man, and many will put their confidence
                            in him. But shall this continue? Shall we not learn something from human nature? Why not
                            stop and ask, Is it right? -Is it honest? Is it true? Is it just? Shall we not as a nation,
                            as a people, ask what can be done to arrest this fatal tendency of the age ? The remedy we
                            think is with the people. The public, moral condition must be improved. We must come back to
                            the common sense virtues of the past, when a rich man was no better than a poor one. when
                            men were honored and judged by the weight of their brains and not by their gold. Let those
                            who would be men of influence be so only by their moral worth, men of honesty, temperance,
                            virtue, Godliness and who will defend those of corresponding character, because it is right
                            and for the good of mankind. Let the press of the nation, the courts of justice, and may we
                            not add, the pulpit, labor in defense of the right. There are honest men yet in every
                            community. They do not throng the side-walk nor block the street by their numbers, yet they
                            can be fouud if the people will look for them. Summon them to the front and make personal
                            integrity the line of advancement as a means to strengthen the welfare of the nation and of
                            all mankind. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Workers of evil prefer darkness to light" TEIform="index"/>

                            since you discard the marital relation? We answer, God will take care of his own work ; if
                            we follow his guidance we need take no thought for the result. Again, your manner of life,
                            if carried into general practice, would run the world out." Did not Jesus say, ;'The harvest
                            is the end of the world?" Gad never intended the life of man to be one continued season of
                            seed sowing ; but there should come a time of harvest when he would be reaped or cut off
                            from those elements which have their roots in the earth and be gathered into the garner of
                            the kingdom of heaven. Every field of grain is not ripe at the same time and ready for the
                            harvest. The husbandman has a care to gather it iuto order as it ripens lest it fall back
                            iuto the earth and be lost. So the great Husbandman sends forth his reapers, who are the
                            angels of conviction to gather those who are ready to be harvested from the earth life. The
                            first Adam was of the earth, earthy, the second Adam, the Christ, was the Lord from heaven a
                            quickening spirit. The tendencies of those who follow the first man incline toward the earth
                            plane, while those who follow Christ are wholly cut off from the earth life which is the

                            it becomes serviceable in the household. Even so the soul, after receiving sufficient

                            Lord. "The soul that siuneth it shall die " The death is proportionate to the trans gression
                            Under the law every siu had its penalty and the offender could not be restored without
                            bringing the appropriate sacrifice or sin offering. From this we learn, since "the law is
                            our school master," that not only is confession necessary, but also witnesses who can
                            testify of our sincerity and humility. The priests stood as witnesses and leaders to the
                            people. From that time down to the dark reig:i of Anti-christ, the Lord always had an order
                            where lie had placed his name for salvation. During the dark ages this was corrupted and
                            lost sight of for a season, but in great mercy it is again revealed and is now manifested
                            through the second revelation of the Christ spirit, which admits no offering for siu, but a
                            sacrifice of sin itself upon the altar of confession and repentance. Thus has Christ
                            appeared the second time without siu, or a sin offering, unto salvation. The promise was
                            that lie should so appear to those who look for him and that he would save his people from
                            their sins, pot in them. It is not to give up his natural life, in the hands of cruel
                            persecutors, but that his daily life may be a crucifixion to the nature of sin which he took
                            of "the seed of Abraham" that he might leave us an example that we should follow in his
                            steps even to the laying down of the natural life, rather than deny the faith which prompts
                            us to follow Christ our Redeemer. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Promote virtuous communication" TEIform="index"/>

TEIform="persName"/>Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p">In the cultivation that is wrought upon the mind, a tender regard should be manifested for
                            its growth into the beauty of holiness. Manners should be more than a formal system of
                            external rules ; they should be the representation of life itself, pure, peaceable and full
                            of good works. To reach this state of pleasant anticipation the sons and daughters of God
                            must be the subjects of constant discipline, and these lessons of care and loving kindness
                            should make their first impressions upon the lives of the children and youth. This interest
                            in ;m education which is calculated to reach, in some degree, every quality of mind, from
                            infancy to old age, and at the same time enhances the peace and satisfaction of our own
                            lives, is accepted with pleasure aud affords us the privilege of walking with the children,
                            and then with them passing on to more advanced age. Gentle manners which are so essential to
                            our happiness in this life, cannot be too cautiously guarded. Experience has taught us that
                            the care and cultivation expended upon those who are young often becomes to them an
                            essential glory at a future date. It is very true that many of the ettrly impressions,
                            either for good or ill are permanently traced upon the young and delicate mind, and it not
                            unfrequently happens that aged persons will make reference to that which transpired in the
                            days of their childhood, while events of more recent date are not retained in the memory.
                            Some teachers have aptly illustrated this by comparing the mind, in its first<pb n="86" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> years, to those substances that in their plastic state are so susceptible of
                            impressions that time fails to blot them out or to wear them away. We are fully persuaded
                            that while gentle manners aid in forming the crowning glory of the youthful mind,
                            beautifying as they do the language, and the general deportment, they will at the same time
                            keep pace with the growth of intelligence and pleasantly bear us company through all the
                            varied changes of our earthly pilgrimage. In the acceptance of this treasure we have
                            something that never grows old, and never comes as an unwelcome guest. It introduces peace
                            into the cottages of the poor and righteousness into the homes of the wealthy. Neither the
                            heat of summer nor the cold of winter can have any influence upon this beautiful and coveted
                            gift. Lytton has said :�"What a rare gift is that of manners ! Better for one to possess
                            them than wealth,, beauty or talents ; they will more than supply all." The cultivation of
                            gentle manners forms an excellent foundation upon which to build for future usefulness. They
                            are the first lessons that lead to an honorable or Christian life, and cannot be neglected
                            without great loss, any more than truthfulness or honesty can be neglected in the formation
                            of a good character. Even in the humble walks of life an agreeable address and a
                            manifestation of the ordinary forms of civility do not fail to produce a good effect, and
                            certainly a still more careful cultivation of the rules that belong to well ordered society
                            must have a corresponding influence for peace. The youthful mind susceptible as it is to the
                            multiplied presentations, often manifests a singularly checkered experience. We sometimes
                            find in those who have strong inhereut tendencies to conscientiousness many deviations from
                            a straight course ; a singular combination of the good and evil influences of society ;
                            often accepting coarse and vulgar expressions instead of using chaste and correct language.
                            This state of the mind presents nothing more than its normal or natural inclinations. Like
                            the neglected garden it soon becomes the fruitful soil for the growth, of weeds, and often
                            for plants that are actually poisonous. More devoted to his duty should be the guardian of
                            the growing, active mind, which in scriptural language, becomes the living soul, to
                            eradicate this coarse and improper outgrowth, than is the faithful laborer in the earthly
                            garden who works diligently for the preservation of his tender plants. lie protects the good
                            while those in which he has no especial interest he destroys. Whatever success is
                            accomplished in the cultivation of gentle manners or in the acceptance of moral principles,
                            must be largely through the manifestation of the love of God. Guardians who have a wish to
                            develop the best qualities of the mind must hold in loving remembrance the words of wisdom
                            spoken by the beloved apostle:�"Whatsoever a man soweth that also shall he reap."

Y. ] An old lady, noted for her shrewd
                                    insight into the characters of young people, said lately : " I owe much of the
                                    content and happiness in my life to a trifling incident which oc-<pb n="87" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> curred in my girlhood. Like many ugly girls of sixteen I was morbid and jealous,
                                    craving sympathy, longing for a change, certain that a lonely future lay before me.
                                    There were, too, circumstances in our family relations that made me miserable. This
                                    misery I felt would last forever. One day I was in a boat in a wide river with my
                                    mother. The water was full of small boats which passed and repassed us, moving to
                                    and fro, darting from bank to bank. " 'Helen,' my mother said, after I had poured
                                    out some of my misery to her, 'you leave wholly out of your ideas of life, its
                                    change. You will go through this world just as you do through this river. "The
                                    people near you will fall back or shoot ahead of you, but they will never occupy
                                    again the position to you which they do now. The ban s and scenery will never be the
                                    same to you one hour as they will be the next. You find those who are cruel and
                                    foolish now ; but five years hence they and you will both have changed your base and
                                    grown into different persons. " Lay aside your hates and your sorrows for a year or
                                    two, put them out of your mind, and you will find that the cause for them has
                                    disappeared.' "The idea pleased my fancy. I remembered it. If I found acquaintances
                                    disagreeable or malicious, I deferred my hate for them for a year or two ; and lo !
                                    they were gone out of my way or had altered into friendly, pleasant members. If I
                                    tugged at some root of monstrous evil to no purpose, I bided God's time, and it
                                    crumbled away. In short, I have learned to depend on tomorrow as a cure for all of
                                    to-day's ills." This kind of teaching seems like the most hackneyed platitude to
                                    middle-aged people, who have seen the strange revenges brought on by the whirligig
                                    of time; who know that characters of men and women do alter, and that the sharpest
                                    grief will wear out. But if the young could be made to believe it, how much pain
                                    they would avoid, passing by on the other side. They are so sure of their
                                    convictions ! Their unpleasant neighbor is a villain of deepest dye, their
                                    loneliness of soul will last till death, their grief is immortal. Perhaps only time
                                    itself can teach them the healing quality of time, or that �' The darkest day, Wait

                                and work will determine the blessing that will crown our efforts in righteousness. Jesus
                                tells us that "We must work the works of Him that sent me, [Christ] while it is day ;
                                the night cometh when no man can work." This is and ever will be an admonition to all
                                who may accept any form of missionary duty for the elevation of the human race. We have
                                abundant evidence of the fruitlessness of those who are lukewarm and of those who are
                                engaged in personal selfishness, and we no less have living witnesses of the growth of
                                righteousness in those who consecrate soul and body to God and to the prosperity of the
                                gospel cause. Jesus in the giving of this incentive to duty could readily foresee the
                                necessity of an active service. It was given to those who were or who would be his
                                disciples. This was an imperative lesson, "We must work the works of Him that sent me."
                                It was to preach the kingdom of God and its righteousness. Nothing else could take the
                                place of this heavenly mission. This gospel testimony must be preached in the light, it
                                must be received in the light, and it must be lived in the light. It can have no
                                fellowship with any of the works of darkness. The age, the condition of society, and in
                                fact, everything demanded that the mission of Christ should be placed, immediately,
                                before the people, that they need not have this mournful excuse. "The harvest is past,
                                the summer is ended, and we are not saved." He knew so well the natural inclination of
                                man to procrastinate, that he proffered this stimulus in the name of the Savior. In the
                                world of labor, it may generally be expected that those who do not work, who fail to
                                become actively industrious will not be expected to prosper in their temporal interests
                                and the same is equally true when applied to that which is spiritual. The parable of the
                                man who gave all he possessed to purchase a field in which he was well assured that he
                                should find a pearl of great price, is a beautiful illustration of a Christian worker.
                                He gave all he possessed for the privilege to work in the field, through hope of
                                obtaining that beautiful treasure. This story seems to close quite differently from the
                                one that was told of the man who concluded to give only a part of his possessions to the
                                Lord, and to reserve the remainder for a<pb n="89" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> rainy day. He evidently
                                had the foresight of a modern Christian and no doubt, saved his house and some land, but
                                spiritually he was a failure. He neglected to work honestly during his day of salvation.
                                We seem to have good and able witnesses who are ready to testify to the blessings that
                                are found in the path of earnest work for righteousness and who do not hesitate to warn
                                us of the danger of neglecting to improve the advantages that are placed before us. It
                                is in the revelation of truth which has been given to man, leading him on in paths of
                                righteousness, that we are enabled to know something of God and of his divine goodness.
                                This, at once, adapts itself to our finite understanding and takes away all mystery. It
                                tells us that "As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God," and
                                that those who accept the wisdom that is from above, are pure and peaceable. In the W.
                                C. T. U. N. C. held at Nashville, Term., the prayer was addressed to�Our Mother�God. Why
                                not? We have long been accustomed to say, "Our Father who art in heaven," and why not
                                equally as consistent to say, "Our Mother who art in heaven." Can the fullness of
                                manhood exist where the qualities of motherhood are rejected? Does not the term Father,
                                imply with equal force to that of Mother? or how can we speak of the Son? This form of
                                prayer leads one of the Churchal brethren to manifest his ! wisdom and he calls it,
                                "either presumption or blasphemy." Perhaps he could see blasphemy in this much easier
                                than he could in the sensational prayer of his own order, that was made recently, in the
                                New York Senate, and for which the Rev.- - - - - -was called in question. That the
                                overshadowing infinite power is just the same now that it ever has been, there is not
                                the least doubt, and that it is now the incomprehensible to us poor, finite creatures,
                                as it ever has been, is equally true. Those men or those churches who have assumed to
                                make out an order of Deity, and then demand others to believe, would have done more
                                credit to themselves if they had consulted, for a few moments, the Book of Job. "Canst
                                thou by searching find out God ? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection ? " This
                                same worldly wise man informs us that " God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost, each takes to
                                himself the masculine gender." A masculine Deity, indeed! but in all probability just
                                suited to those who formed it. He fails, however, to afford us any proof of his
                                statement either in or out of the Bible, and we may, as heretofore, continue to address
                                our prayers to "Our Father and Mother�God. Hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come. Give
                                us day by day our needful bread. And forgive us our sins ; for we ourselves also forgive
                                every one that is indebted to us. Leave us not in temptation." Amen.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Ingratitude comprises in itself all itself all the other vices" TEIform="index"/>

A Chicago physician
                                        has recently taken the position that there are more people killed every year by
                                        insufficiency of nourishment than by overloading their stomachs, says a, writer
                                        in the San Francisco Chronicle. The fact is, he says, that most people do not
                                        eat enough, and, above all things, they do not eat meat enough. In direct
                                        opposition to this physician's opinion is the dictum of the celebrated Abernethy
                                        that a hundred people die of repletion to one of starvation. Wonderful as its
                                        advances have been, the science of healing is still far from being exact. Given
                                        the same subject, the same conditions, and two examining physicians, and the
                                        chances are that the diagnoses will be widely different. One doctor will tell a
                                        patient that the palpitation of the heart from which he is suffering is due to
                                        permanent cardiac weakness ; while the second will assure him that it is
                                        ascribable to indigestion, and is only a temporary trouble. Post mortem
                                        examinations play havoc with the concrete wisdom of an ante-mortem consultation;
                                        and a change of doctors without any change of disease invariably means a change
                                        of treatment. But the object of this article is not to arraign the medical
                                        profession, but to enter a protest against the harmful utterances of the hundred
                                        and one professors of dietetics who persist in confounding their own stomachs
                                        with everybody else's stomach. A peculiarity of the authority on diet is that he
                                        is not content with anything less than a cure-all. Some time ago the
                                        announcement was made that the demon of dyspepsia must be drowned in hot water,
                                        taken as a drink. Forthwith the dyspeptics began to scald their insides and then
                                        wondered why that which was tender before grew to be tenderer still. Nor was the
                                        evil confined to this tenderness. The new order of caloro-hydropaths insisted
                                        that it was necessary to distend the stomach, and the stomach having once got
                                        into the habit of being distended, was constantly demanding distension. The
                                        desire so created was an urgent one, and a craving was set up which was quite as
                                        absolute in its way as that which arises from the use of ardent spirits or
                                        chloral. Directly oppose/! to the hot water drinkers were those who pinned their
                                        faith upon the sovereign efficacy of cold water as an article of diet. It is
                                        God's own brewing, "Adam's ale," they said, and the flowing streams, purling
                                        brooks and limpid lakes were pointed out as a pellucid proof that cold water was
                                        intended to be the universal drink of man. The stomach should be treated to a
                                        glassful of this natural liquor before breakfast and there would be no more
                                        dyspepsia, provided cold water were used, and plenty of it. Then arose another
                                        sect who declared that much cold water was just as harmful as much hot water,
                                        and very little cold water should be drunk, and none at all unless it had been
                                        boiled. It was just as absurd, said this sect, for a man to drink water in its
                                        natural state as it was for him to eat carrots or sheep's trotters in their
                                        natural state Everything was full of low and dangerous forms of existence which
                                        had to be killed by heat before it was a fit article of food Just as there were
                                        trichinae in pork, so there were microbes in water, and the man was a fool who
                                        ran the risk of taking in scarlet germs as he quenched his thirst at the purling
                                        brook, or endangered his children's health by giving them horrid and unboiled
                                        bacteria out of the limpid lake. Against these gentlemen of the kettle and
                                        cookpot were arrayed the believers in an Edenic diet, who held that, so far as
                                        food was concerned, whatever is, is right, and that a raw turnip was a very fit
                                        turnip. Nothing must be cooked, not even rice, and all that was necessary to
                                        achieve a lusty and well preserved old age was to feed on uncooked vegetables
                                        and munch on unboiled cereals. These are but few examples of the stupid way in
                                        which some one particular food or fashion of feeding has been made to do duty as
                                        a general nostrum. The school of common sense is a good one to consult
                                        sometimes, and if its practitioners have only succeeded in mastering the truth
                                        that what is one man's meat is another man's poison, they have, at any rate,<pb n="91" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> reached a safe seat. There can be no general rule for
                                        eating, and the sooner we come to that conclusion the better. Age, climate,
                                        occupation, constitution have all to be considered before attempting any

                                come only by daily heavenward living. Clean hands and clean hearts are synonymous terms,
                                and without the one the other is impossible. Clean hands�clean hearts ! Do you consider
                                what the words imply? To have clean hands you must live above sinful desires, above
                                selfish strivings and impure thoughts. You must "keep your record clean," for clean
                                hands can only be an index of a clean life, a life devoted to holy purposes. Those who
                                have clean hands and pure hearts of shall see God," and feel his love and protection day
                                by day. Pure hearts and clean hands are acceptable offerings. A sure way to love purity
                                is to practice it. Think not to gain clean hands without selfdenying struggles; you must
                                have "deeds good and true," not dream them; you must have the courage to resist
                                temptation, as comparatively few do have. "Pray God that your whole spirit and soul and
                                body be preserved blameless.'" It is well to pray, but better still to watch and work
                                and to remember that "God helps those who help themselves." Good deeds are sincere
                                prayers. Let your constant prayer be, "Give me a blameless body," and your daily
                                endeavor be to use those means that will give answer to your petition. "Beautiful hands
                                are those that do, Work that is virtuous and true." And clean hands, or they could never
                                be beautiful, could never "do work that is virtuous and true." Clean hands forever!
                                Corning to angelic manhood and womanhood un.-tained by any thought of evil. Oh, glorious
                                hope of heaven, full and joyous evermore ! Thank God for it.

                                and live for others. We thank Brother Daniel for his nice letters and we hope to hear
                                from you both again. With love from all, I close.

                            followers of Christ. Among them all, none is more conspicuous in its effects on the life and
                            character of the individual, than the spirit of humility. Before we can make this virtue our
                            own, there is a work to do to divest ourselves of worldly pride, ambition, jealousy and
                            envy; then we make room in our hearts for the indwelling of humility* it cannot find a place
                            where sin abounds. It is the faith of the true Believer in Christ's second appearing, to bow
                            in submission to the will of God as manifested in a visible lead, and to be humble and
                            teachable. Humility leads us to see our errors, and to confess and forsake all our sins; in
                            this way we may grow in newness of lifey, and find a spiritual travel in the regeneration.
                            The meek and lowly Jesus set us a beautiful example to follow; his life was one of humble
                            and self-sacrificing service to mankind. I want to feel that I am truly his disciple; not
                            vain and self-exalted, but humble in heart, striving each day to do all the good I can. Mt.

                                    looking people? wa the unspoken query of my mind as I strolled along the esplanade
                                    of the West Side Driving Park the other day. Where do the fine faces, the noble
                                    brows and the sensitive mouths keep themselves, I wonder, gala days when the crowds
                                    outpour? Men with rotund stomachs and beery breaths ; boys with hard faces and
                                    cigarette-stained teeth ; women with whitewashed faces and painted cheeks ; girls
                                    with leering faces and gum-chewing jaws ; big chins, big necks, little foreheads,
                                    and thick lips, the panorama was continuous and depressing. uNow," said I to myself,
                                    "I wonder how far I shall go before I meet a face I would take on trial !" And I
                                    walked around the grand stand agaiu and again without meeting one, until, far off iu
                                    a fenced region beyond, I iound it�the delicate, sensitive face of a blooded horse !
                                    There was more intelligence in that one face than in the whole conglomerate mass of
                                    humanity I passed to find it. But what gave to the horse its supremacy ? Care in the
                                    breeding. Stockmen exercise no end of pains to breed high and not cross the record
                                    with an inferior. But in this human genealogy of ours we give no thought to
                                    requisites of race or temper or special adaptation. In other words, we tolerate
                                    mongrels nowhere but in the human species. No wonder the grand old stock is dying
                                    out. No wonder a walk to and fro in a crowd, or a ride in a street car, or an
                                    evening promenade through Clark street sends a thoughtful person home with a doub
                                    ing heart. While men are so careful to keep a clean record of the brute stock that
                                    perishes yet are indifferent to the sort of stock destined for eternities there is
                                    little chance for us. There should be a law to govern marriage as there is one to
                                    govern commerce. It should be a finable offense for ignorance and vice to propagate
                                    their species as it is for a grocer to adulterate sugar. These ai*e delicate matters
                                    to touch upon but they are presented with d.-ep earnestness. I have lost all
                                    patience with preachers and public teachers of every kind who shoot perpetually over
                                    the heads of these practical and vital questions, forever holding to the picked
                                    bones of dead, crude and useless theologies. Stop a moment and think what class of
                                    people are rearing most of the children to-day which are to make the men and women
                                    of to morrow. Is it into the homes of the pure and the cultured and the lovely that
                                    the little souls are thronging? Not at all. Where one child blossoms from .such a
                                    stalk, eleven are kicked and slapped on the road to vice in the homes of the
                                    drunkard and the worthless. Look on the curbstone yonder. There sits a blear-eyed
                                    woman, flat in the dirt, squeaking out the "Sweet By and By" from an asthmatic
                                    hand-organ. In her soiled arms nestles a bit of a baby, and at her feet play feebly,
                                    like animals, three other children, dirty and uncombed, bearing in their faces
                                    already the marks of their heritage. If no law can govern propagation among the
                                    criminal classes surely there should be a law to taks such children out of the
                                    environments of their birth and bring them up to be a benefit rather than a curse to

                                natures have not been developed; those who have lived selfish lives, finding in the
                                gratification of the animal instincts and propensities their greatest, in fact their
                                only pleasure. They are incredulous as to even the existence of a higher sphere than
                                their own, because their spiritual perceptions have not been awakened." "What is their
                                manner of living? Very similar to that to which they were accustomed on earth. Good and
                                evil impulses alike sway them by turns. They know no pleasure beyond those of the
                                senses, and selfishness is the dominant feeling. They have their discords and
                                contentions, their misunderstandings and their feuds, the same as on earth ; yet they
                                will tell you that they are contented and happy." Some of this chapter will remind one
                                of Dante's pilgrimage through Purgatory, a country so full of strange experiences and
                                through which so many incline to pass. From the Religio-Philosophical Pub. House,
