�"The Bank Tragedy" is the title of a
serial story of great power, written by Mrs.
Hatch, author of "The Upland Mystery,'
which was published in the Transcript two
years ago, which has since then had a sale of
about 100,000 copies in book form. The new
serial is a detective story, the plot of which
is constructed with remarkable skill. It will
exercise the ingenuity-of those who are experts in guessing the plots of half-read novels. The scene is laid in northern New
Hampshire, but some of the tragic and romantic incidents of a recent famous bank
case in Maine are worked into it. The story
is being publshed in the Portland Transcript, beginning Jan. 2d. The publishers
offer several premiums for the best guesses
at the plot sent in by subscribers before Feb.
20th.  Subscriptions, $2.00 ayr. 6 months, $1.

                            diversities of gifts, but the same spirit." He recommended the exercise of all spiritual
                            gifts ; but pointed to Faith, Hope and Charity, as the most enduring, and exhorted the
                            people to covet the best gifts: Charity in his estimation was the greatest of all. If
                            Charity means the covering up and hiding many sins, then the people of the nineteenth
                            century possess it to a large degree; but if it be love that worketh no ill to a neighbor,
                            or to any human being, we are left to judge by fruits manifest, that there is a great
                            deficiency ; and is a most needed gift at the present time, to teach us how to be just to
                            ourselves and to others. We have many learned teachers and philosophers in our day, as wise
                            as ancient sages. People listen to finely framed speeches and theories, but they lack
                            salt�the saving element,�and many want stronger proof of the reality of spiritual things.
                            The dry husks of theology do not feed and satisfy the immortal part, and they ask for bread�
                            living bread. They desire to know if God lives to-day, and is a rewarder of those who seek
                            Him; if the creating, vivifying Spirit that gave form and action to the inner and outer
                            worlds�the all-wise Father and loving Mother�can be approached by finite beings now, and by
                            what media. Evidently the spiritual waters are moving and a power is at work to bring order
                            out of the chaos now existing in what may be termed spiritual Babylon, where confusion of
                            ideas, and confounding of theological tenets, serve to darken counsel, and exclude from many
                            truth-seeking souls, the practical religion of the lowly Jesus, and his baptized followers.
                            There are upheavals and convulsions in society, in every department of life, civil, social
                            and religious. Plunderers of the national treasury, are found in the capitol of the United
                            States ; and many of the first trusted officers of our civil government, have proved
                            themselves unworthy the public confidence reposed in them. And it is said, by those who
                            ought to know, that it is barely possible under the present system, to impeach a high
                            official, or for an honest man long to exist as an honest man in the city of Washington,
                            society is so perverted. In large cities, rings are formed millions strong, and so firmly
                            welded together, that it remains to be<pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> seen whether there is legal power
                            sufficient to break them. Craft and cunning to a large degree, have taken the place of
                            justice and honest labor. In the social and domestic relations of life, bonds which in the
                            past were thought to be almost invulnerable, are now severed as if made of straw. Old
                            theologies are trembling; they have been weighed in the balance of truth and are found
                            wanting of saving power and life-giving energy. They do not supply the soul needs, which are
                            as real as those of the body. When we are in need of temporal food, theories and shadows do
                            not suffice ; we want something tangible to our senses, that we can grasp, eat and digest,
                            that will invigorate and strengthen the physical system : So is it in a spiritual point of
                            view. We who are solving the great problem of community life upon a religious basis, toiling
                            with our hands that we may eat the bread of industry, and planting vineyards, and under the
                            blessing of God gathering fruit therefrom, feel a deep interest in every reformatory
                            movement that tends to practical Christianity wherever it may be; and our earnest prayer is,
                            that the Christ Spirit may descend upon, and abide with the people as a purifier, and
                            dethrone the man of sin that has so long claimed a seat in his temple. We pray that the
                            churches may become so pure that the waters of life may issue from their thresholds, and
                            that the spiritual tide may rise higher and higher. If God be our friend and protector why
                            fear to trust Him? Why not bring all the tithes�without reserve�into the great temple of
                            truth, throw open the windows of our souls and let the sunlight of heaven shine in ? and
                            learn to be true to ourselves and just to our neighbor ; be what we would like others to
                            think we are ; then it will matter little by what name we are called. When the churches are
                            thus prepared, those who gather to them will be elevated to communion with saints. Society
                            will be purified�regenerated�gross sensuality, intemperance, monopoly and war will decrease,
                            and we shall have a clearer moral atmosphere ; there will be fewer assas.^ins and
                            thieves,�pri-ons and dungeons, crowded with felons,� and criminal courts open to convict
                            more, while executioners are waiting to send many to untimely graves. All who judge truly,
                            see that crime is not decreased in this way, but in effect it is demoralizing. We need a
                            revival as deep and soul stirring, as on that memorable peutecostal day, when the Holy
                            Spirit was poured out upon the believing Jews who were of oue heart and mind, waiting and
                            watching for the promised Comforter�the quickening Spirit�that would lead them into greater
                            degrees of truth. The spiritual power was so great, that it not only shook the house wherein
                            they had assembled, but their souls and bodies were effectually shaken ; for the baptizing
                            spirit that was sent unto them, convicted them of sin, and taught them that selfishness, and
                            the lusts of the wTorld were incompatible with true Christianity, and must be relinquished,
                            if they would inherit Christ's kingdom, and reap life everlasting. They were directed by the
                            Christ Spirit, to go and sell their private selfish possessions, and form a community home
                            upon the basis of virgin purity, non-resistance, love to God, and to their<pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> brethren and sisters. They did not spend their energies in reasoning against the Spirit's
                            call ; but Paul-like, were straight-way obedient unto the heavenly vision, avjd gathered
                            into communistic relations, and .shared together, rich and poor; ate of one bread at one
                            table. Was not that the communion of Saints in very deed? They were not satisfied to put the
                            new wine of the kingdom into old bottles in the Jewish synagogues. The spirit called them to
                            come out and be separate, to organize upon a new foundation and form new relations ; not for
                            the purpose of destroying the law and the prophets, but enable them to drop the weaknesses
                            and imperfections of old institutions, and make room for new laws given by a higher teacher
                            than Moses. That revival was out-wrought in life practice, and did more to convict the
                            unconverted Jews, than thousands of sermons would do, unaccompanied by works. And such a
                            revival in our midst today, would be more effective in lessening crime, than all the
                            criminal courts and capital punishment. If the question be asked, "How shall we obtain this
                            heavenly baptism?" It is held in reserve for those who are tired of serving earthly idols,
                            and are willing, by the aid of spirit power to break them in pieces. Firstly, elevate labor,
                            and make it honorable by taking part in it, and helping to bear the burdens of life in every
                            department; let honest labor take the place of fashionable stealth; and tear down the
                            partition walls that have been reared between the rich and poor, without reference to virtue
                            and integrity; let all gather where they have strewed, reap where they have sowed, and enjoy
                            the blessing of "life, liberty and happiness." Let woman who through long centuries in the
                            past, has given her best and noblest powers of mind and body, to fascinate and serve man,
                            cast off her shackles�break the bands that have held her in servitude so long, and lift her
                            heart above idolatry and self-pleasing, into the arena of noble thought and action ! Let her
                            come forth and represent herself�express her own ideas, if she have any, in her own way,
                            though simple they may be, and unlike the learned and eloquent speeches which fall from the
                            lips of men who have drawn their inspiration chiefly from books and colleges. This should
                            not be woman's aim, but to reach the heart's affections through divine love, and stir the
                            soil therein, and quicken the germs of the spiritual nature, should be her chief object. And
                            let those who still feel that their highest duty is to bend over the cradle, and make market
                            for soothing syrups, quietly rest in seclusion, trusting to fate and the popular opinion of
                            by-gone ages, i. e. "to keep silence, and learn of their husbands at hame." And those who
                            feel that they have a higher mission to perform, will see the need of placing their feet
                            upon true principle and lifting their hearts above a cold world's scorn, trusting God's
                            ministering angels to aid them while on their errand of love and mercy to humanity, and
                            especially to their own sex, who are ignorantly or wilfully on the highway to ruin. If in
                            virtue's name we plead the cause of the down-trodden and oppressed, and raise a high
                            standard of moral purity, and seek to gather the lowly and uplift the fallen to that
                            standard, and hold<pb n="100" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> them if possible, by the hand of love until a change
                            be effected, and they are secure from temptation, we shall not only feel that there is
                            rejoicing with the angels in the heavenly world over such a saved repentant soul, but our
                            joy will also be replete. Nor would we ask for a brighter star to gild the crown that may be
                            ours in the heavenly home, when the shadows of earth shall pass from our sight, and the sun
                            go down to rise no more to us on this side the river. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Kingdom's standard" TEIform="index"/>THE KINGDOM'S STANDARD.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="De Vere, Cecelia" TEIform="persName"/>Cecelia De Vere.</byline><p TEIform="p">Tis reared upon the mountain's height, And floats out on the morning air, The standard of the
                            Living Light, The answer to the centuries' prayer. "Thy kingdom come," the nation's prayed,
                            While yet they fiercely, blindly strove, Nor dreamed that kingdom must be laid Through toil,
                            in righteousness and love. "Thy kingdom come," the prophet moaned, When intuition stirred
                            his soul, For all the world his word disowned, . And ancient wrongs held full control. "Thy
                            kingdom come," the seer cried, As ecstacy upon him fell, The gates of heaven opening wide
                            Entranced him with uplifting spell. The wrapt musician sitting dumb, Heard music from the
                            angel choirs, Until the chant, "Thy kingdom come," Had thrilled him as with altar fires. On
                            rack, on gibbet and at stake, And in the dungeon's eddying gloom, Brave souls whose courage
                            would not break, Stood firm and prayed, "Thy kingdom come." They died in hosts, they died
                            alone, Their tortures, thought can scarcely bear, But well they knew all hope was sown For
                            time's fulfillment in that prayer. Some deemed the clouds across the day, The only barriers
                            between; Some viewed it as a distant ray, A star, not always to be seen. The solemn news, Lo
                            there ! Lo here ! Oft' sounded like the thunder's tread* But when the listening earth drew
                            near, It found the Heralds cold and dead. Then was there born unto the race, A prophetess
                            with sacred call, Who claimed no proud exalted place, On watch-tower or on turret-wall. For
                            her, the humble valley low, The bitter cup and cleansing stream; The purifying flames that
                            glow, The inward being to redeem. In sackcloth that repentance wove, In ashes of consumed
                            desires, In grief that had its source in love, In faith that inspiration fires ; She sought
                            for sin of every name; Went down to fathom human loss, The prayed for kingdom to her came
                            Thruugh revelation of the cross. To victory she bore that sign, 'Mid persecutions up the
                            steep, Until she saw its glory shine For seeking souls to gain and keep. Then was she
                            clothed as with the sun, With man-wrought reason 'neath her feet, That gift of revelation
                            won, Made earth and heaven hence-forth meet, That gift of revelation new, Protects the
                            kingdom's changeful day. For, from its standard bearers true Its might will never pass away.
                            * Though weak and wavering souls should fail, Or God's commissioned ones should fall, Yet
                            will the kingdom's strength prevail, For noble spirits He will call. They who the standard's
                            grace maintain Above Mount Zion's happy homes, Are heirs with Christ, to work and reign,
                            Until the Perfect Kingdom comes. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Religion is love to God, manifested to one another..." TEIform="index"/>

                            may remain." Assuming that "the earth" means the civil governments, founded in force� by the

                            theological systems that exist in combination with all such " force and fraud " governments,

                            States government of North America: we can begin to see why God should "shake" them and man
                            curse them�"curse their God and king, and look upwards," towards a Universal Republic,
                            composed of all the human races, under the guidance of a heavenly Father and Mother�God�as
                            being Brethren and Sisters of one great household. All these Babylon governments are "turned
                            to blood"�war. They conserve the greatest good of the fewest number�the non-producers, and
                            the greatest misery of the vast majority of producers, who do all the work and create all
                            the wealth. The "feudal system" is the basis of the force and fraud, war governments. Under

                            the Conqueror of England, parcelled out, as being his own, all the land of the nation, to
                            his officers. These rented it to the common soldiers, to farm and work, on the terms they
                            dictated, which allowed the farmers barely enough to support life.,�as in Ireland, and
                            Turkey, and, indeed, in all nations in Christendom, at the present time ; where "acre is
                            added to acre and hous� to house," until there is no place left for the poor, landless
                            people. JUDGMENT DAY. "He shall come whose right it is to reign." Hitherto, might, not right
                            has ruled the nations�they take the sword and perish by the sword. And the wise scientists
                            of this world go prospecting and digging amongst their ruins, searching for the things that
                            destroyed them� ungodly treasures�the fruit of human suffering and misery. "The prophets
                            prophesy lies, the priests bear rule by their means, and the people love to have it so;" and
                            all unite "to give their power unto the beast" of Church and State�the warring civil
                            governments. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES. " The foundations of the earth are out of course." They
                            cannot be repaired ; the old building must come down. " If the foundations are destroyed,
                            what can either the wicked or the righteous do"�but begin again and rebuild ? A nation
                            conquered by the swovd, its land held by the conquerors us rulers, in the name of God�"the
                            divine right of kings"�produced the terrible cry, from outraged humanity, "Crush the

                            inalienable inheritance! "Blessed are the meek" when war is abolished�"for<pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> they shall inherit the earth"�"the new earth wherein shall dwell
                            righteousness." HEREDITARY RULERS. An aristocracy by birth�a house of bishops�belong to the
                            old earth, who proclaim the Jewish Bible to be the plenary Word of God ; the Jewish God of
                            war and of generation, io be the Deity�one of three male Gods, constituting a Trinity, who
                            constitute themselves the rulers and governors of the universe, composed of all worlds, and
                            of all the governments on earth, except the United States of North America. And to make this
                            no longer an exception, the church and state priesthood are now getting up petitions, signed
                            by seven millions of priest-ridden men and women, who know not what they are doing. They are
                            as a flock of sheep, in a safe fold, surrounded by a hungry pack of wolves, who make them
                            break down their own protective fence, by frightening them from side to side, until the
                            fence gives way, and they are in the power of their devourers : so will it be with the
                            people of this non-Christian, favored, secular government, which secures to all its
                            citizens, freedom of conscience�from the ignorant fanatic to the enlightened skeptic ; from
                            the true Christian, to the Brahmin or Mohammedan. When they put the Trinitarian God and
                            Christ into the American Constitution�on whose coin they have unlawfully put, uIn God we
                            trust," instead of, "In gold we trust ;" which would, at least, be a truth and not a
                            lie�liberty of conscience will be gone. The sectarian priesthood are undermining�and will
                            move the old heavens and earth to destroy�the American government. Let freedom's friends
                            awake to the danger ! The priesthood constitute themselves judges of all people outside
                            their sectarian fold. They set up a book as the word of God ; then they translate, interpret
                            and revise it, to suit their own selfish ends and purposes. On this Jewish book, they build
                            a system of orthodox theology, -is a standard of truth for all souls. Dis.senters are
                            heretics to be '"restrained by the sword," when they get the civil government into their
                            hands, and God and Christ into the constitution�meaning themselves. The civil government
                            will then be, as in Rome, a, Holy Inquisition, in the hands of a most unholy priesthood :
                            they will do by our souls, as the doctors are doing by our bodies. They assume that human
                            beings can believe, by authority, anything that the orthodox church and state may dictate,
                            regardless of evidence�"a doctrine of devils." If they do not so believe, they are obstinate
                            heretics, wicked blasphemers, whom it is the duty and glory of the orthodox to kill, in the
                            service of God. To butcher, as at the slaughter of St. Bartholomew, when from seventy
                            thousand to one hundred thousand Huguenot Protestants perished in a single night; being
                            killed by the Catholic part of the population ; and the Pope returned thanks to God, in a Te
                            Deum, for the church and state destruction of the best part of the inhabitants. And the
                            Protestants are but an image of the Catholics; each sect having its Pope, who exercises all
                            the power of the first Beast, and in the same manner, as far as they have the opportunity.
                            PHYSICAL RESURRECTION. They believe "that the bodies of all who have ever lived upon this
                            earth will be reanimated, resurrected, at the Judgment day."<pb n="103" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> PROBATION.
                            " At death, all persons, old or young, will go, immediately, into an everlasting heaveu or
                            an everlasting hell ; there being no probation in the next world : yet, at the Judgment Day,
                            all must be forthcoming, iu order to find their old, earthly body ! ATONEMENT. "As in Adam
                            all die, and are worthy of eternal perdition, by reason of the j sin of Adam; so, in Christ,
                            they are! saved from that perdition, by the blood of the atonement�provided they believe in
                            it" (which I do not, in the least.) Yet the orthodox hold that the Jews are much to blame
                            for crucifying Jesus ; although it was the only means by which any one of them ever was or
                            will be eternally saved. Such are the dogmas of the "first heaven and first earth," now fast
                            passing away, by means of the shaking that is extending, from Dr. Farrar of London, to the
                            Andover University in America, and all over Christendom. TEN HORNS. Tpn horns�powers�grew
                            out of the beast of Church and State. They hated "the whore of Babylon," and tormented her
                            with the fire of the rational, scientific truths of geology, astronomy, chemistry, and all
                            the science?. These were the infidels�Voloey, Voltaire, Hume, Franklin, Washington, and his
                            bosom friend and private secretary, Thomas Paine, and Jefferson; with hosts of others, who
                            produced the. French Revolution, and the American Revolution. In the American Revolution, it
                            was " Vox populi, vox Dei"�the voice of the people became the voice of God : they were the
                            sovereign people. INALIENABLE RIGHTS. Upon these rights, a purely nonChristian, secular
                            Government was founded : A right to be born ; to live ; and to an equal education ; and
                            equal possession of the land. Class-education means destruction of Republican government :
                            therefore, all children should be held in public institutions, until of age� in
                            self-supporting, manual-labor schools. REVOLUTIONS. The rise and Call of empires that Volney
                            records- �turnings and overturuings, upheavals and revolutions�-have ever succeeded one
                            another, from ancient Egypt, Persia, India, Babylon, Rome, and Greece, down to our own Civil
                            War. But there awaits a final change of Systems. vwIn the days of these kings ; the God of
                            heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ; but it will stand for ever. And
                            it will break in pieces all other kingdoms in the old heavens and old earth"- �Church and
                            State systems and all their institutions. Two forces are working to effect this� reason and
                            revelation. INFIDELITY AND SHAKERISM. The coming revolution will not be personal or
                            national�a change of rulers, or the ups and downs of a single people or race ; but a change
                            of principles, applicable to the whole of the human race. The revolution will be for the
                            permanent benefit of all mankind. A new heaven and a new earth. Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N.

                                    Busily, ceaselessly, goes the loom In the light of day and the midnight's gloom; The

                            :�I am informed that my uu worthy name is in some measure known to you already. But having
                            sold all I had to buy the field with the true treasure, I desire to become more intimately
                            acquainted with that body in whom the spirit dwells, and to find a lasting and uninterrupted
                            union with them. I take the opportunity offered me, to write my faith. My earliest education
                            such as it was in things pertaining to God, was in the Presbyterian, or Calvinistic order. I
                            entered on the Ministry, and continued for some years, until after the work of God broke out
                            iu Kentucky. When standing in ne ir connection with others, and in particular, our dearly
                            beloved and ever faithful brother Richard Me. Nemar, I began through him as the instrument,
                            to learn that salvation is brought to men in the gospel of Christ, in a much more liberal
                            and equitable measure than I had, heretofore, understood. The increase of light I received
                            by slow degrees, in the first dawn of it. But as soon as I became clearly satisfied<pb n="105" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> of any oue point, that it was truth, and saw that it tended to open
                            the door of salvation to sinners, I gave forth my light to the world freely as 1 had
                            received it, in the pleasing hope that others would hear, embrace, and find salvation. I
                            greatly lamented that so few regarded those things which made for their peace, and that my
                            labors were so unfruitful, yet all praise to God, they were not all lost; for God made use
                            of so unworthy a creature as me, to do something toward preparing the way for the true
                            gospel. But I have now to lament while I behold the fruit of my labors in those to whom I
                            have become an enemy, because I tell them the truth which I now begin to know, and in which
                            I feel determined to abide, though at the expense of counting my past gain, loss, and my
                            former attainments, dross, that I may win Christ, and be found in him. Tn those times, I
                            often felt that the great reason of my little success in preaching, was the shortness of the
                            work of God in my own soul. How to remedy this defect, I had little or no knowledge ; the
                            dregs of the old antichristian forms of waiting for God to do his work, being not yet purged
                            out, though I had in some measure learned the folly of it. Add to this, the extreme length
                            to which the doctrine of justification by faith was strained, and the useless fea,r of
                            laboring to do the will of God, and overcome all sin in order to find acceptance with God,
                            and obtain true peace. For the right understanding of these things, the true and perfect
                            light was wanting. Therefore, when I felt myself under guilt, for quenching the spirit, by
                            falling into sin, I had no strength to keep myself entirely free I found a law in my members
                            warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
                            was deeply rooted in my members. Yet there was a work in my mind which could not be easily
                            checked, and my soul stretched forward to the work of God which I apprehended was before me.
                            I began before long to lose my attachment to the literary works of men, and to all the
                            antichristian forms, and to search the Scriptures, comparing all things with them as my best
                            guide ; for I had not yet learned that God dwelt in a living temple, nor that his word was
                            there to be found. In this pursuit, however, God blessed me, and led me through many of the
                            dark mazes into a good degree of the light of the gospel, which, as fast as I found to be
                            expedient, I opened to the people, though often obliged to cover the clearest of my views,
                            for a time, in the shade of old phrases, because the people were not able to bear the light.
                            I learned that Christ was not the minister of sin, that we ought to have the very faith of
                            the Son of God, and to walk as he walked, to be like him in all things, and follow him into
                            the holiest of all, into which he had entered and opened the way for us through the vail,
                            that is to say, his flesh. I was now not far from the kingdom of God, and believed there was
                            a way out of all sin, but how to perform that which was good, I found not; how to perfect
                            the things which I had learned, I knew not. And that was not all, I really found an
                            unwillingness to have it done in me, so that .when I would do good, evil was present [to
                            dispute the<pb n="106" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> way.] This was strictly Calvinistic religion, but now it
                            would not do for me. I found the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against
                            the flesh, and the latter was not willing to die. I longed for clearer light for the benefit
                            of myself and others. In this situation, the witnesses from New Lebanon found me. And
                            however strange, it is true that the sight of them produced in me more pain than as if I had
                            met an enemy. I sought to escape the death, but all in rain. I could not renounce the light
                            I had received before, though sometimes I fought against it; yet not directly against
                            anythiug which I felt to be truth. The light continued to break in upon me, one flash after
                            another, and to draw me nearer to the point where I found ease when I could. I soon found 1
                            was left of God as soon as I felt against the testimony which these witnesses bare. I began
                            to feel love for them, and a kind of union with them, but was obliged to conceal my faith.
                            Awhile ago, if I felt against the testimony, I could not preach to profit. I could not hold
                            the people. Yet they understood not what was in me�and now, I dared not let my faith be
                            known ; they would have shut their hearts against me. I ;iad long offended the world and
                            lost much of my name, and now I might have recovered all, had I rejected the finishing
                            stroke. But to attain to the resurrection from the dead was more to me than all besides. I
                            was determined to know Christ, aud be conformed to his death. The world and the flesh were
                            strong in me, but these were dying things ; they did not fill my poor soul. This is a short
                            vi-^w of that traTel in which 1 drew near to death, and came to the conclusion to renounce
                            my carna hopes, and recall my fond desires for the world and the flesh, and to aim for a
                            better world, even the kingdom of God. For God in the riches of his goodness has reached
                            even to me. The work which now began in me, was faintly shown me years ago, when I did not
                            understand it. I felt in me a nature against holiness, aud that I felt to be the flesh�but
                            did not understand how it was to be destroyed ; neither was I willing. But now it has come
                            to me in the order of God, and I bid adieu to the world aud the flesh, with all their
                            pollutions, and all their charms, to seek union with him whose nearest kindred are those who
                            do the will of their heavenly Father. I find some increase of faith and strength, though my
                            growth, or skill in the work of God is scarcely worth naming. Yet, if there is so much
                            bounty in the church of God as to feel any union with so unworthy a creature as me, I can
                            gladly lie down at their feet, and worship God in his holy Temple. My desire is to be
                            strengthened in the way of God. to learn to do his will, to serve hia interest in the world,
                            aud to have my labors and my rest among the saints. I find, indeed, the truth of the present
                            testimony, its being of God, in the effects of it in my own soul. To remove all the strength
                            of corruption, and to extirpate every root of bitterness, to deliver the creature from the
                            very root of that nature which is against God, and to save from that fear which hath
                            torment, to regenerate the soul into a union with God in the way of his own manifestation,
                            and to fellowship with the saints, are things which cannot come from any other source than
                                God.<pb n="107" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> By the grace of God I am what I am. I have by this grace been
                            enabled to testify, and to feel my testimony true, that the foundation of this work in which
                            I now stand, is no other and can be no other than the one true and eternal God. But O how
                            unworthy of such grace. I cannot boast of my own faithfulness, as I do of God's grace,
                            goodness and love. I have, indeed, set out to be saved from all sin, and to be cleansed from
                            all uncleanness. I count not myself to have apprehended, yet one thing I begi i to learn; to
                            forget the things which are behind, and to reach forth to those before. If any of the
                            brethren feel a gift to communicate anything to me, I trust it will be accepted as from a
                            brother in the Lord. Dear brethren accept the offer of my love to you, and let me be united
                            to you in the same bond.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Dunlavy, John" TEIform="persName"/>John Dunlavy.</byline></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Coming of Christ" TEIform="index"/>THE COMING OF CHRIST.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hollister, Alonzo G."

                            concerning a future coming of Christ, " The Lord himself shall descend from heaven TGr."] in
                            a command, in a voice of an archangel, and in a trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall
                            rise first. Then we the living that remain, shall at the same time with them, be caught away
                            in clouds [multitudes] to meet the Lord in the air, and so be always with him." 1 Thes. iv.,
                            16. This text has been quoted by some who give a literal interpretation to figures of
                            speech, to prove a personal coming of Christ Jesus, and also a resurrection of physical
                            bodies. But the figurative style of the language makes it evident that the coming referred
                            to is spiritual, and was to be manifest as an inspiration from heaven. Air is a diffusive,
                            all pervading element, which inspired as breath, sustains the vital operations of the body.
                            It was regarded by the ancients as a type of spirit, and the Greek has one word which
                            represents breath, air, wind, or spirit, according to the connection in which it stands.
                            Hence, as Christ is spirit, if he comes in the air, it is evidently as an unseen, and to
                            many, as an unsought inspiration. How often it is remarked of certain ideas, such as
                            spiritualism for instance, or of communism, " It is in the air." Because so many considerate
                            people are talking, writing, or meditating upon it, and all seem to feel it, or to be in
                            some way affected thereby. A person inspires certain thoughts in the atmosphere and reasons
                            to conclusions which nobody has taught him. When he meets a stranger who is possessed of
                            like views, after comparing thoughts, he judges that said thoughts must be true because
                            having silently conceived them in his own interior conciousness, he has found a witness to
                            the same in the conciousness of another. The two are no longer strangers, for a feeling of
                            kiaship has sprung up between them, arising from similarity of inspirational ideas, the
                            cause of said ideas being in the air, or life sustaining elements. Multitudes of minds thus
                            operated upon at the same time, may be prepared<pb n="108" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> to assume the higher
                            kindred relationships, and so be led to cooperate in putting those idea.s into practice.
                            Only such as are organizationally and aff'ectionally qualified to receive said ideas, will
                            have their lives changed thereby. Therefore it is written of that period, "Two shall be in
                            the field, one shall be taken and the other left. Two shall be grinding at the mill," "Two
                            shall be in one feed, and one shall be taken and the other left." Those left will be
                            resurrected later. Those taken will form groups or societies, homogenous in spirit, as
                            particles of moisture in a cloud, (drawu by the heat of the sun,) and are caught away
                            together in spirit, by the power of the "Sun of Righteousness," to a meeting with- the Lord
                            io the air. whose presence will henceforth be an abiding source of strength, direction and
                            consolation. Thus the change is realized without suspending the law of gravitation, or
                            chauging the relation of physical bodies to the material universe. If is a lifting up in
                            spirit, thought, interest, purpose, and execution, to an atmosphere of perpetual inspiration
                            from the Lord's own presence, while our mortal bodies remain on the earth, subject to the
                            spirit, being instruments thereof, and to the laws of gravitation, growth and decay
                            governing all physical bodies, until the debt to nature is paid. The foregoing explanation
                            of the presence, and of being with the Lord in the air, in spirit, is supported by the
                            following language of the same Apostle, written in Philippi, to Coriathians. " For I indeed
                            being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as if prose:.t, him who has
                            done this thing." 1 Cor. v., ?&gt;. Also the following written in Rome to Colossians. " For
                            though (lit.) to the flesh I am absent, to the spirit I am with you, rejoicing and beholding
                            your order, and the stability of your faith in Christ." Col. ii., 5. These passages show
                            that the Apostles recognized the intelligent action of one's spirit in places remote from
                            the presence and limitations of the physical body, which tethers it for awhile to earthly
                            conditions. We here call to mind that the last of the four general dispensations of God's
                            grace to man, symbolized by the four cherubim within and around the throne, is represented
                            by the flying Eagle, inhabitant and king of other teuauts of the upper air, which
                            corresponds to spirit. We are hereby enabled to understand why the Angel (a noun of
                            multitude,) having the everlasting gospel to preach to those (lit.) sitting upon the earth,
                            (both spirits and mortals,) was seen flying in mid heaven. Rev. xiv., 6, 7. Mid heaven
                            corresponds to the resurrection state, being medial between the earthy, unregenerate
                            condition, and the discarnated, pure Redeemed, who stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion, out
                            from whose midst, the messengers of the gospel go forth to harvest and judge the world. For
                            "The Reapers are the messengers." "The Son of man shall send forth his messengers to gather
                            his Elect." Jesus. That is, those who elect to comply with the terms of the gospel, and are
                            called to the marriage feast Rev. xix., 9. and iii., 20. "Know ye not that the saints shall
                            judge the world?" asks the Apostle. Christ is in his saints, judging the world and ending
                            it, in all who will come to him. "And judgment was given to the saints of the<pb n="109" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> Most High. * * And the dominion and greatness of the kingdom under the whole
                            heaven was given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an
                            everlasting kingdom." Daniel, vii., 27. How do these explanations chime with the promise
                            that " Every eye shall see him?" It is not said that all shall see him at once. For however
                            sudden may be the destruction coming on the disobedient who refuse to hearken, and to
                            understand, being joined to their idols of creed, dogma, pleasure, worldly honor or profit,
                            the harvest itself and the work of the judgment, which is a separating, purifying process,
                            will extend through many generations, occupying the entire period of the millennium.
                            Moreover as Christ is spirit, seeing him cannot be predicated of any but spiritual eyes. The
                            carnal or animal mind sees only the outward form. Christis not recognized by outward form,
                            neither in his first or second appearing. To perceive his spirit, one must be in a degree
                            conformed to it� must be resurrected. "Every eye shall see him," is promised to those only
                            who live and are looking for him. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Spiritual bible school lesson" TEIform="index"/>A SPIRITUAL BIBLE SCHOOL LESSON.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Carl, (Dr. Semelroth)" TEIform="persName"/>Dr. Carl.</byline><p TEIform="p">God is a Spirit.

                            death. Rom. viii., 2. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our Spirit, that we are the
                            children of God ; and if children, then heirs ; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
                            Rom. viii., lo, 17. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God

                            walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. Rom. viii., 1. Ye are not in the flesh, but
                            in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the
                            Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of
                            sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. For if ye live after the flesh, ye
                            shall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.

                            Better is it to be of an humble Spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the
                            proud. He that is slow to anger is better than ijhe mighty ; and he that ruleth his Spirit
                            than he that taketh a city. Prov. xvi., 18, 19, 32. Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not
                            fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
                            against the flesh ; and these are contrary the one to the other ; so that ye cannot do the
                            things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. If we live
                            in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Gal. v., 16, 17, 18, 25. Endeavoring to keep

                            And put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness, and true holiness. Eph.
                            iv., 3, 23, 24. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.
                            Eph. v.,9. And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word
                            of God. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching. Eph.
                            vi., 17, 18. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of
                            his Spirit. Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God.
                            Hereby know ye the Spirit of God ; Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in
                            the flesh is of God; And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the
                            flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it
                            should come : and even now already is in the world. 1 Jno. iv., 13, 1, 2, 3. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            passed away in the year 1871 in the 77th. year of her age. The numbers have varied from that

                            other organized societies. But the integrity, the zeal and coarage to abide in the faith, is
                            as unflinching as ever, and agrees with the testimony of Jesus: "Where two or three are

                                    hear not the fall of a footstep � Around me save God's and my own; And the hush of
                                    my heart is as holy As houses where angels have flown ! Long ago was I weary of
                                    voices "Whose music my heart could not win; Long ago was I weary of noises That
                                    fretted my soul with their din; Long ago was I weary of places Where I met but the
                                    human and sin, I walked in the world with the worldly; I craved what the world never
                                    gave, And I said : "In the world each Ideal, That shines like a star on life's wave,
                                    Is wrecked on the shores of the Real, And sleeps like a dream in the grave." And
                                    still did I pine for the Perfect, And still found the False with the True: I sought
                                    'mid the human for Heaven, But caught a mere glimpse of its blue; And I wept when
                                    the clouds of the mortal Vailed even that glimpse from my view. And I toiled
                                    heart-tired of the human, And I moaned 'mid the mazes of men, Till I knelt long ago
                                    at an altar And heard a voice call me. Since then I walked down the Valley of
                                    Silence That lies far beyond mortal ken. Do you ask what I found in the valley? 'Tis
                                    my trysting place with the Divine, And I fell at the feet of the Holy And above me a
                                    voice said : ''Be mine," And there arose from the depths of my spirit An echo�"My
                                    heart shall be thine." Do you ask how I live in the valley? I weep, and I dream, and
                                    I pray, But my tears are as sweet as the dew drops That fall on the roses in May;
                                    And my prayers like a perfume from censers Ascendeth to God night and day. In the
                                    hush of the valley of Silence I dream all the songs that I sing; And the music
                                    floats down the dim yalley, Till each finds a word for a wing That to hearts, like
                                    the Dove of the Deluge, A message of peace they may bring. But far on the deep there
                                    are billows That never shall break on the beach: And I have heard songs in the
                                    silence That never shall float into speech; And I have had dreams in the valley Too
                                    lofty for language to reach. And I have seen thoughts in the valley� Ah me ! how my
                                    spirit was stirred! And they wear holy veils on their faces� Their footsteps can
                                    scarcely be heard! They pass through the valley like virgins Too pure for the touch
                                    of a word! Do you ask me the place of that valley? Ye hearts that are harrowed by

                            </head><p TEIform="p">In the exhibition which is before the world, to-day, it would seem that a lesson might be
                                learned that would fully demonstrate the difference between a Christian Church, and a
                                church that is circumscribed by a creed. Jesus in speaking of his mission to his
                                disciples, said, " Greater works than these shall ye do," and at that time he was
                                spiritually healing the sick, giving sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf. He was
                                buildingup a new order on the revelation of God and teaching man that to worship God, he
                                must do it in spirit and in truth. It was not to be confined to a city like Jerusalem
                                nor to the mountains like those of Samaria. To discipline themselves into peaceful
                                relations with mankind, would secure to them a place among God's children, and by the
                                purification of the heart, they were permitted to march into the Kingdom of God and into
                                the very presence of our Heavenly Father. Such was the religion of Jesus which was to be
                                preached to the world. It was a growing revelation which would lead man by degrees from
                                the relation of the world, and establish him in the peaceable Kingdom of Christ. The
                                creedal church admits of no change. The lines have been drawn, the seals set, and the
                                spiritual growth of that body determined by a majority vote. This is one of the singular
                                ways to make an heir for the kingdom of heaven, but so long as it is in the power of man
                                to make and accept a creed, or to be led by the spirit of God without a creed, the two
                                forms of religionists will be known among men. The only advancement toward God, however,
                                that either class will ever make, will be made manifest before the world, by their
                                steadfastness in a life of righteousness and peace. In accepting the doctrine of our
                                divine Teacher as the way and the truth, it becomes imperative that we should follow his
                                example in the truth. If he advocated the principle of peace then we should learn the
                                best way to promote peace, first in our own souls and then in those around us. When the
                                apostle put that direct and essential question before his hearers he was testing their
                                depth of love for the Christian principles. "For he that loveth not his brother whom he
                                hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?" But the Christians as well as
                                Pagans have not hesitated to persecute and to put to death those who did not subscribe
                                to their formula of religious belief, and contend that in this they were doing God's
                                    service.<pb n="113" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> Even so late as in this wonderful age of light, the
                                Christian Church is actively engaged in the same murderous scheme. Proctor in his
                                history of the crusades makes mention of the order of the knights of St. John of
                                Jerusalem : Its origin was long before the crusades when some Italian merchants
                                purchased a license to found a hospital for the benefit of sick and poor pilgrims. They
                                devoted themselves to the care of the suffering and were contented with the coarsest
                                fare while they gave a better to their patients. At the time of the crusades they
                                introduced a military character into their order without discarding their religious garb
                                and profession. The union of chivalric and religious sentiment, however discordant in
                                modern ideas, was equally congenial to the spirit of the age and thenceforth the banner
                                and battle cry of the Knights of St. John were seen and heard foremost and loudest in
                                every encounter with the Infidel enemy. It was, indeed, a singular combination of the
                                Prince of Peace and the Demon of war. Accepting it as a truth that "No man can serve two
                                masters," and that " Ye cannot serve God and mammon" we conclude that the hospitalers of
                                St. John, on their introduction into the war element, for the murder of Infidels or
                                Pagans, left their gospel Teacher of peace and accepted the teaching of Satan. And yet
                                how nearly like the more enlightened and the more seemingly religious of this present
                                day. The following will show how discordant this amalgamation of peace and war rests
                                upon modern ears. The Churches of the nineteenth century may well boast of some
                                advancement beyond their brethren of the tenth century, but it must be conceded that
                                they still have itching ears for martial music, and a fancy for salvation through the
                                horrors of war and through streams of blood. The Christians of England have recently
                                formed an organisation that is half religious and half military, and is known as the "
                                Boys Brigade." And modern ideas of Christian Churches in this wonderfully christianized
                                America, have not been shocked in the least. Some Sunday school teachers in the City of
                                Glasgow have the honor of forming this very Christian amalgamation. "It has a paid staff
                                and a present strength throughout England and Scotland of 800 officers and 11,000 boys.
                                There are church parades, when all the boys muster at the school and march to the church
                                in uniform. There are ambulance instruction and stretcher drill, with instructions how
                                to render ' first aid to the injured.' " The modern church has no occasion to be
                                surprised at the course taken by the Knights of St. John. Their life harmonized with
                                their surroundings. Their education was largely in the war camp and on the battle field,
                                and their Christian glory was in persecuting their enemies the Infidels of Jerusalem. We
                                however, may well express our surprise that the professed Church of Christ, in the light
                                of the present age, when Peace Societies abound, and when humane Societies are
                                encouraging those of every age to exercise the law of kindness toward both man and<pb n="114" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> beast, can be so thoroughly instilled with an anti Christian
                                principle as to teach that the horrors of war and the blessings of peace are in harmony,
                                and admissible doctrine for the Kingdom of God. But Christians do not fight with carnal
                                weapons. They are told to pray for their enemies and not to murder them and during the
                                first century no Christians were to be found ill the army.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shaker sanitation" TEIform="index"/>SHAKER SANITATION.</head><p TEIform="p">The Shakers of New Lebanon, N. Y., have always given a great deal of attention to
                                hygiene, and their secular reading includes journals like the Scientific American,
                                Journal of Chemistry, New York Tribune, Boston Herald, American Agriculturist, and the
                                Sanitary Engineer, all of which are in their reading room. During a brief stay in the
                                community we had an opportunity of seeing how carefully they attend to sanitary matters.
                                It seems singular that a community whose main thoughts are turned toward spiritual
                                things and to preparing for another life should be so zealous to secure bodily health.
                                The results of this care and attention are shown in the remarkable vigor and longevity
                                of all their members; and their example might well be followed by more worldly-minded
                                people. The tombstones in their cemetery record numerous deaths among the nineties, and
                                we were struck with the fresh and lively interest which an elder past eighty showed in
                                conversation on general topics. The Shaker doctrine as regards hygiene is simple, and
                                includes plain and wholesome food, manual labor for all, early and regular hours, and
                                good ventilation. The latter is a constant study. Slats are placed in every window to
                                make an opening between the two sashes, so that there shall always be an influx of
                                atmospheric air. Small holes along the base-board in all of the halls aid this end. In
                                the gathering rooms are round openings from out-doors; just below the steam radiators,
                                to supply fresh air, and the central (student) lamps have vent pipes to carry off the
                                products of combustion ; in addition, all beds are stripped and windows kept open to it
                                sure an ample circulation of air. They have a copious and pure supply of water brought
                                from a distance with a heavy pressure, GOIbs. The wooden conduit has just been replaced
                                by a cement pipe and the storage reservoir enlarged. All rain water from roofs is
                                utilized for laundry purposes. The laundry itself is a model of convenience and
                                neatness, and is a curiosity from the fact that all the fittings were put in by the
                                Shakers themselves. The washing, wringing, and drying apparatus is simple, yet perfect,
                                and nothing seems wanting. The sanitary arrangements are well worth imitating. In each
                                dwelling there are baths, sinks, and w. c.'s, all well ventilated, while the out-door
                                privies, which are more generally used, are treated much the same as earth closets, the
                                material being taken away every few days and composted. The house drainage, which is
                                mostly kitchen waste, is conveyed to an open drain which encircles an orchard and is not
                                offensive, while it is very serviceable to the growth of the apple trees. The Shaker
                                regard for cleanliness is strikingly shown in the milking room in the huge stone barn,
                                which is wonderfully clean and neat, while the arrangements for carrying off and
                                preserving the manure are very ingenious. The Shakers are a progressive people, and are
                                always experimenting with new devices. When the farmers in the vicinity want to buy new
                                implements or machinery they usually call and see what the Shakers are using, and what
                                they think will serve best for the purpose. To have gained the endorsement of the
                                Shakers for his wares is a great card for a manufacturer or dealer, and one man remar ed
                                that "he would rather do a piece of work for them for nothing than make a bad job of it,
                                as their good will was not to be despised." Another noticeable thing is the solidity and
                                durability of everything that the Shakers<pb n="115" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> construct. Their walls
                                seem as if laid for all time, and the thoroughness with which every detail of
                                workmanship�both indoors and out�is executed would draw tears from a "jerry" builder,
                                and recalls the work of past days when men labored with a conscience. My visit was
                                limited to the North Family, one of the seven communities that compose the New Lebanon
                                society. The Elders informed me that their careful attention to hygiene has a
                                theological basis, they believing that science and religion, "truly so called," are one
                                and the same. � Charles F.

                                    preserved in a museum in Pans, and translated by a French orientalist. The English
                                    translation was sent to the Humane Journal by J. F. C. Kuhtmann, president of the
                                    Great German and International League to Protect Animals, with headquarters at
                                    Bremen, Germany. And it came to pass that our Lord departed from the town together
                                    with his disciples and crossed over into a mountain district. And they came to a
                                    mountain whose side was steep; there they found a man with a beast of burden; but
                                    the beast had fallen down for his master had overloaded it and he beat it so that it
                                    was bleeding. But Jesus drew near to the man and said, "Man, why dost thou beat
                                    thine animal, dost thou not see that it is too weak to bear its load and knowest
                                    thou not that it is suffering pain!" But the man answered and said: "Why trouble
                                    thyself about it? I may beat it as I will, seeing that it is my property for which I
                                    have given a large piece of money. Ask of those who are with th'ee, for they are
                                    acquainted with me and know of the matter." And some among the disciples said: "Yea,
                                    Lord, it is even as he says. We saw him buy the beast." But the Lord said: "Do ye
                                    also not see how it bleeds, and do ye also not hear its lamentations and cries?" But
                                    they answered and said; "No, Lord, we do not hear it lamenting and crying." Then
                                    Jesus was sad and cried out: "Woe unto you that ye hear not how it cries and
                                    complains to the heavenly Creator for mercy, but thrice woe unto him who hath caused
                                    it to utter these cries and complaints." And he drew near and touched it, and the
                                    beast got up on its feet and lo, its wounds were healed. But Jesus said to the man:
                                    "Now, proceed on thy way, and from henceforth beat it no more, so mayest thou also

                            plenary inspiration of the gospel, there is inference irresistible, that the above history
                            directly from the Lord, was written to show the purest fruits of Christianity. Could
                            anything be of higher obligation upon the disciples of Christ ? The condign punishment
                            inflicted upon Ananias and Sapphira for seeking to escape this obligation is a solemn
                            confirmation of the Christian's duty and privilege of putting all their goods in common.
                            True as the entire gospel system is voluntary, contrasting with the violent impositions of a
                            selfish world, so is this its unselfish, noblest deportment. It is not too much to say, that
                            the leading trait in the life of Christ was self-denial, to livt for the salvation aud
                            ultimate felicity of others. All manner of vanity, pride, silly and hurtful fashions,
                            slavery, caste and war were utterly repudiated; while meekness, kindness, generosity aud
                            peace were enjoined by precept and example. But the marvel confronts us, that the more
                            leading and popular churches in the world utterly ignore the purer practical injunctions of
                            the gospel they profess and cling to absurd, and we must add, demoralizing dogmas. Hence is
                            the gospel light obscured under a bushel, and our race unreformed and unredeemed. Save in
                            the Quakers and Shakers, violence, bloodshed, slavery,� "the sum of all villainies," four
                            tedious years of intestine war, slaughtering a million of our citizens prevailed, and every
                            so-called Christian church participated. Sadly marvelous, that the ungodly, the so-called
                            infidels are fouud in this wretched conduct! But as professed followers of Christ are seen
                            in the same line, the marvel seems enhanced beyond solution; the single orthodox dogma of
                            total depravity it may prove, while others are sadly discredited. Regeneration by the Holy
                            Ghost, sauctification aud final perseverance of God's elect saints get but little support.
                            If by their fruits we are to know them, then evidently the least we have to do with such
                            dogmas the better. By forsaking all for the Believer's communistic life, a leading passage
                            in the gospel is exemplified. Matt, xix., 29. Forsaking' goods and sundering earthly ties,
                            we are promised more,� a hundred fold and eternal life. Believers, though persecuted and
                            their property often destroyed, have still by their steadfast industry and economy, acquired
                            better homes, more brethren and sisters and spiritual enjoyments. The stain of oppression,
                            slavery, caste and bloody war is fouud nowhere among them. Instead, they enjoy the luxury of
                            a clean conscience and the firm hope on the absolute promise of eternal life. Santos,

                                    advice thrust upon them, good, bad and indifferent; they are made a kind of moral
                                    target for fools and wise men to shoot at indiscriminately. But the counsel to make
                                    themselves a necessity in the calling which they pursue, is both sensible and
                                    philosophical. And anybody of average energy of character and brain-force can do
                                    this. It matters not what business you follow, whether you are tillers of the soil,
                                    blacksmiths, machinists, painters, tailors or laborers; whether you drive a dray or
                                    a coach, labor with the muscle or the mind. In your own separate spheres, wherever
                                    and whatever they may be, you may win an enviable reputation for first class
                                    workmanship, and become in some sense a necessity to your employer, or if you are
                                    your own master, to the community in which you reside. The great majority of young
                                    men lack a sufficient ambition to give them anything more than a mediocre place in
                                    the handicraft or profession which they have elected to pursue. They are perhaps
                                    amply endowed with talent, but it is of that ponderous quality which crushes because
                                    it lacks tact, agility, and force. And the consequence is, they never rise above the
                                    dead and uninspiring level where the masses are content simply to eat, toil and
                                    perpetuate their dull and stagnant existence. If there is any inherent vitality in
                                    their natures it is repressed by false views of life and its opportunities. But, on
                                    the contrary, the men of pluck and nerve, who strive to make themselves a recognized
                                    necessity in their avocations, get higher wages and better positions almost
                                    invariably. They rush by the sluggards and dolts in the exciting race of life,
                                    winning alike its honors and its gold. It is said of the late Moses Stuart, that
                                    when a young man settled over a church in New Haven, Rev. Dr. Spring of Newburyport
                                    went to hear him with a view of offering him a professorship in Andover Theological
                                    Seminary. He interrogated Rev. Dr. Dwight, President of Yale College, as to his
                                    fitness for so exalted a trust. The latter replied, "he is just the man you want,
                                    but we cannot spare him!" "Sir," responded Dr. Spring, "we don't want a man that can
                                    be spared." This illustrates very forcibly one of the fundamental and practical
                                    principles of common life. All the vast business, educational and moral interests of
                                    community are seeking after preachers, attorneys, phyeicians, clerks, accountants
                                    and artisans that can't be spared. They don't want young men who are floating
                                    around, such as the idle and the vicious, but smart, earnest and practical men�men
                                    of ideas, of fruitful minds and vigorous muscle, who will strip themselves for the
                                    work of life, like genuine heroes. The men who can be spared just as well as not,
                                    are never fixed in their situations. If there happens to be a little financial
                                    flurry, they are set adrift, because, while they do a certain amount of hard work,
                                    they manifest for it neither aptitude nor enthusiasm. As soon as the clock strikes
                                    the hour for ceasing labor, they jump for their coats and hats with more abruptness
                                    than the machines they tend come to a close when the power is shut off. In other
                                    words, they have no impetus of any kind that can possibly carry them beyond the
                                    "dead point" of the stipulated hours of labor, while the unthinking machine does
                                    sometimes exhibit considerable momentum. In every pursuit of life there are men who
                                    cannot be spared without a positive loss to then- employers and to society. A
                                    mechanic resolves, for instance, that he will take a foremost place in his craft. To
                                    accomplish this commendable purpose, he works early and late, and by skill and care
                                    saves his employers in the course of the week, a large per cent of the stock usually
                                    consumed. He don't slight the work; on the contrary, he comes up exactly to the
                                    standard of requirement as to weight of metal, while others overrun and thus waste a
                                    quarter of the amount of their wages every day. The employers recognized this
                                    faithfulness and the man gets what he is entitled to�the more lucrative and
                                    honorable berth of foreman. Such cases are by no means uncommon, and one has lately
                                    come under our notice in Springfield.<pb n="118" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> Men can make for

                                    a truly honest man will not take a larger sum for property than its just value, even
                                    if he is offered more. A certain man named George Smith came one day to a farmer
                                    named Daniel Jones, wishing to buy a pair of oxen, and said: "Those red oxen of
                                    yours suit me, and I will give you one hundred and twenty dollars for them." Daniel
                                    Jones replied: "That is thirty dollars more than they are worth." George Smith
                                    looked wonderstruck at this remark. The farmer said : "I know the value of those
                                    oxen better than you do. One of them is a little "breachy," and the other one cannot
                                    bear the heat so well as some oxea, and yet there are many good qualities in them ;
                                    but, all things considered, ninety dollars is all they are worth, aad you may have
                                    them for that price." George Smith gladly took the oxen, and said to a man on his
                                    way home : "It beats all what a difference there is in the religion of men. Now
                                    there is old James Clark, my near neighbor; I have heard him make many a long

                                    asked me one hundred and thirty dollars or more for them, and he would have called
                                    them a great bargain at that price, and he would not have said a word about one of
                                    the oxen being inclined to be breachy, and the other not very tough in hot weather.

                                    who received donations, and who presented the plate for my contribution. I put in,
                                    as I supposed, a sixpence and passed on, stopping a moment inside the font to
                                    examine a miniature model of the great edifice. I paused again, when the person had

                                    however, with double what I had intended before. As I was walking alongside of the
                                    ship I noticed an oldish gentleman looking wistfully at the vessel, and I said,

                                    me for not thinking of that before. He called upon God to look down upon us, and in
