                            readers of the New Testament have ever imagined. Jesus seemed to realize the force of this
                            expression as the active and earnest order of his life so fully demonstrates. Released from
                            the ordeal of the wilderness, the Kingdom of God becomes his all absorbing theme.
                            Exhortations, lamentations, and the publishing of the glad tidings verified his word, that
                            he must be about his Father's business. With this example before us, what should be the duty
                            of his followers? Are they justified in taking less interest in the promulgation of the
                            principles of peace,—in the disseminating of truth, and in the establishing of charity and
                            love among men ? " Work while the day lasts ! " comes home as an imperative command. There
                            can be no deferring till the tomorrow that which should be done to-day. Waiting and watching
                            may do for those who are looking into the great future, for an advent which we believe is
                            already consummated, but for those who denominate themselves the children of the
                            resurrection, it looks very much like hiding their gospel light under a bushel. "Put your
                            hands to work and your heart to God "* has a corresponding echo. It has no *Ann Lee. form of
                            guess work, nor even a shade of future tense. It is a swift testimony against
                            idleness—either temporal or spiritual. The disciples of that order, which is a sharp sword
                            against every iniquitous work, must harmonize the spiritual interest with that of the
                            temporal. A circumspect walk, before God and man, is as essential as is the food we eat, or
                            the garments we wear. While there are so many errors in life to correct, and so much light
                            and intelligence for us to study, we certainly have need to work with diligence and care. To
                            wait for God's time is a plea of the easy-going Christian, and to stand idly by from day to
                            day, and from year to year, illy comports with the word: " Thou shalt love the Lord with all
                            thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." His time is the ever present,
                            and as faithful servants, why should we not be actively engaged in the Master's service ? He
                            who compares the development of man's mind to the growth of fruits and vegetables, must have
                            a very earthly conception of the workings of the spirit. " Say not," said Jesus, "there are
                            yet four months, and then cometh harvest." Better by far, accept the teachings of the
                            Revelator : " Thrust in thy sickle and reap, and gather the clusters of the vine of the
                            earth, for her grapes are fully ripe. " If, however, we have neglected to become as the
                            Angels of God, and have no sickles (testimony of gospel truth), provided, we shall -become
                            but indifferent workers in the field. In this age of reason, as well as of faith, we must
                            not walk blindfolded. Would it not be a singular arrangement for the servants to congregate
                            in some pleasant place to eat, drink and make merry, and say to the good Master : " We are
                            waiting for and trusting in thee. Gather to thyself the fruits of the earth, as seemeth
                            best, and we will patiently wait thy arrival! " St. Paul may have met with persons of this
                            frame of mind, when he said: " Put on the whole armor of God," and work while your day
                            lasts. No person understood better than did the apostle, the preparatory work and the spirit
                            against which the disciples were to contend. Take to you, said he, the breast-plate of
                            righteousness; have your feet shod with the preparation of gospel peace, and then take the
                            sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. While we stand as witnesses of the
                            prostration and even death of many religious bodies which have arisen, and from time to time
                            contended against the elements of the world, should we not take warning from these, lest we,
                            thinking we are on the highway to the Kingdom of God, find ourselves, as did the servant at
                            the feast, unprepared to meet the Master ?</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Gain of virtue" TEIform="index"/>THE GAIN OF VIRTUE</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Brady, P. H." TEIform="persName"/>P. H. BRADY, OhiO</byline><p TEIform="p">Any one having practically learned the true character of virtue, reflects the same on the
                            minds of his associates. As the brilliant rays of the sun are reflected by the glistening
                            particles of snow, so does the influence of virtue shine on the hearts of truthseekers, and
                            unveils the mist that hovers over the brink of death. The most prominent characteristics of
                            virtue, are godly knowledge and purity. Mankind, commonly ignorant of the sustaining power
                            of chastity, are, unknowingly, sinking deeper in the abyss of degradation. It is true, that
                            virtue is an essential element in the progress of divine truth ; however unable men may be
                            to explain the wide difference between its theory and practice. But the perfected
                            religionist requires both the knowledge and power of virtue, to rise above the level of
                            common humanity, help others up, and hold complete government over the passions. We look
                            upon the inimitable foliage, cast in the crucible of virtuous nature. If we cultivate in
                            opposition to nature, that soon becomes imperfect. So, by failure to use the power of
                            virtue, men become akin to the satanic. Virtue is a characteristic of truth ; and meekness
                            and patience under trials are evidently the fruits that proceed from truth. Crossbearing is
                            necessary for the maintenance of purity. Under the power proceeding from the testimony of
                            Shakerism, which is in opposition to every unchaste practice, we find an ability to learn
                            and practice an exceeding virtue. And souls are rising up in demonstration of this fact, and
                            are living evidences, that the knowledge and power of virtue, once lost, can be gained, and
                            more than gained.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Progress" TEIform="index"/>PROGRESS</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Webster, Ruth" TEIform="persName"/>RUTH WEBSTER</byline><p TEIform="p">Progression is a law of the Universe, of which we are a part, and are subject to the same

                            and we add, intellectual also. In order to understand how far Believers have progressed, let
                            us go back a' hundred years, to the time when the Gospel testimony was first opened in
                            America, and contrast the past with the present. At that time the best that our fathers and
                            mothers could do was to work for their support, where they could find honorable employment,
                            until they could procure homes for themselves, which they soon did by great exertion and
                            toil, by enduring much hardship and many privations. Some of the pioneers in the work have
                            informed us that they had little room, and many had to couch on the floor, for a season,
                            without a pillow ; and they were under the necessity of subsisting upon a scanty allowance
                            of food, so that they resembled skeletons more than robust working men and women. Should

                            and with all the temporal supplies and comforts that we can appreciate and use to profit,
                            ever be tempted to murmur and complain, would it not be well to recall to mind the
                            sufferings of Mother Ann, and her co-laborers and faithful followers ? A century ago all
                            implements of husbandry were constructed upon the most simple plan. And as far as the
                            feminine department of labor was concerned, labor-saving machines were unknown. Sewing,
                            knitting, spinning and weaving, all had to be done by hand. Periodicals, newspapers and
                            public libraries were few, and not accessible to common people ; and indeed, in that day,
                            those who earned their own living by honest toil, found very little time for reading and
                            intellectual culture. As far as book-learning represents knowledge, they would in the
                            nineteenth century be called illiterate; but were they an ignorant people practically
                            considered ? They possessed the knowledge requisite to adapt the means to the ends to be
                            accomplished; and we should rejoice in spirit if we could say the same in regard to the
                            present and rising generations. We can but faintly depict the deprivation and embarrassment
                            which the first founders of our institution passed through. Now, stately mansions, furnished
                            with every necessary convenience, have taken the places of log-cabins; and work-shops and
                            barns are well supplied with labor-saving machines, and improved implements to facilitate
                            and lessen the work of the tillers of the soil. The then wilderness places have now become
                            cultivated fields and well watered gardens. All this has been accomplished by the blessing
                            of God under the leadership of a woman. " When the righteous bear rule," whether the ruler
                            be man or woman, " the people rejoice." Wisdom is justified of her children. We now look
                            admiringly upon the great change that has been wrought by devoted souls and willing hands.
                            Early and late they toiled for other's weal; they worked and did not faint, and through
                            faith in God they renewed their strength and ran in the path of duty as it opened before
                            them, and did not grow weary. In those days we heard very little of individual sovereignty
                            or rights; but all truehearted Believers were intent upon filling their sphere of duty, and
                            idleness was abhorrent to their feelings. In this, brethren and sisters were a unit. As the
                            first founder of the Second Christian Church, or Shaker Order, was a woman, and their strong
                            faith in the duality of Deity was so well grounded there was little trouble experienced in
                            regard to the sisterhood finding their proper sphere of action, and having unrestrained
                            freedom to move therein. Great changes have been wrought in the public mind in regard to
                            woman's powers and capabilities since that time ; and according1 to the signs of the times,
                            as we read and understand them, this peculiar evolving period in which we live will effect
                            marked radical changes in regard to woman, until she will be, politically, morally and
                            religiously free as man is free. The laws of progress are never idle — always at work—-on
                            and on is the watchword. Self-culture, individual improvement is loudly called for by the
                            spirit of reform to-day. Through public schools the masses have the means of education
                            placed within their reach; and the ever-busy press of our land is scattering books,
                            newspapers and periodicals, both secular and theological, far and wide, and they are
                            accessible to all, opening a wide channel for thought, intellectual growth and culture.
                            Notwithstanding the present facilities for education and mental improvement are far greater
                            than in the past, we are not certain that the present generation will fulfill its destiny,
                            and acquit itself better and more in accordance with the demands of the age, than did the
                            past. However that may be we can join with the poet, who said, " Honor and fame from no
                            condition rise, act well your part; there all the honor lies." If we behold a beautiful tree
                            covered with foliage, and radiant with blossoms, or laden with fruit, we would not contemn
                            the root because it is less comely; were it not for the root the tree had not existed. Every
                            thing in its place, time and season. "First the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in
                            the ear." Those who preceded us did the work of their day faithfully ; we honor them and
                            cherish their memory, and revere them as our gospel parents. They paved the way through
                            deprivation and suffering for us to walk in, and left a godly example — way-marks for us to
                            observe as a guide while on our homeward march. May we follow them as they followed Christ,
                            and perform the duties of our day as fnlly as they performed theirs; and so fear God that we
                            may make a right use of knowledge, and thus be perfected in wisdom, is my prayer.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Time, and its work on the soul" TEIform="index"/>TIME, AND ITS WORK ON THE SOUL</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Davidson, William" TEIform="persName"/>WILLIAM DAVIDSON</byline><p TEIform="p">Do we notice how much more rapidly each succeeding year seems to pass away? Can we not
                            remember how in our childhood the term of a year appeared boundless, and that we could
                            compress into that great space of time almost any amount of work and play ? But, that as we
                            grow older how is it with all our industry ? Time seems too short for the work we take in
                            hand ; we become so engrossed, that sabbaths and holidays are alike invaded ; and after all
                            is done, how much we leave unfinished, how many schemes remain untried ! It is a solemn
                            thought connected with life, that its last business is begun in earnest, when midway between
                            the cradle and the grave ; and man begins to marvel that the days of youth are gone, only
                            half enjoyed. When the first gray hairs become visible —when the unwelcome truth fastens
                            itself upon the mind, that a man is no longer going up hill, but down—he looks back on
                            things behind, as the dreams of other days. As we review the disappointed hopes, and our
                            short comings, the heart grows weary of the struggle, and we begin to realize our
                            insignificance. Those who have climbed to the pinnacle of fame, or reveled in luxury and
                            wealth, go to the grave at last, with the poor mendicant— that begs by the wayside, and like
                            him, are soon forgotten. But what does a man take with him when he launches into that which
                            is beyond the grave ? It appears that he takes nothing. Death seems to pass a sponge over
                            all that has gone before. It seems a total breaking off, from all that life has hitherto
                            consisted. But if we look truly, past life is just the one thing that a man takes with him
                            when he dies ; and that self is the product of all his past experiences and actions. When he
                            stands at the end of life he is what he has been made by all his actions, joys and
                            sufferings ; these he takes into the other world—in his own character. The life to come, and
                            the life that now is, are parts of one life—they are related, just as youth and manhood are
                            related. The man is not the same that was the boy; but the boy entered into the man, as a
                            part of him. The strength I gain by victories this year, and the weaknesses into which I
                            come by defeats, will be a part of me next year. So that there is not an act, a word, or
                            thought, but casts its influence into the tomorrow, which lies beyond the grave. According
                            to what man attains in this stage of life, so is his beginning in the next — so must he
                            commence there according as he has finished here — on a high plane or a low one. To love
                            God, to trust in him, and to obey him, to be pure, upright and loving, is a good preparation
                            for death, and is true life. Every man has his own work to do — his own battle to fight — to
                            overcome the flesh, subject the animal, to the spiritual; even through many struggles. Each
                            has his own field to conquer, or to be conquered in ; and every hour has its skirmish. Nor
                            has any one a single line of effort only. We are tried on this side, and on that. Now in
                            temper, now in faith, now in the solitude of our hearts, and now by those around us. Not one
                            of these experiences but leaves its mark, according as we are true or false to the
                            opportunity. And by the summing up of all these, character is formed through these many
                            daily acts; and this abides with us, when we face death, and cross the boundary line.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Address of Antoinette Doolittle" TEIform="index"/>ADDRESS OF ANTOINETTE DOOLITTLE</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Doolittle, Antoinette" TEIform="persName"/></byline><p TEIform="p">Before Peace Society, New York, February SI, 1876. Over the door through which we passed this
                            evening I saw the words written, "Hitherto, God hath helped us." The inspirational power
                            that has attended our sister (Phebe A. Hanford) who has addressed us, is evidence that He
                            will continue to help us, if we will help ourselves. The subject of "Universal Peace "
                            brought to our attention is a theme worthy of profound consideration. Jesus said, "If my
                            kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight." What was the world of which Jesus
                            spake, and which one of the apostles said, "If any man love, the love of the Father is not
                            in him?" According to Scripture, "The lusts of the flesh and mind, and the pride of life,"
                            constitute that world, from which the followers of Jesus are exhorted to be separate, and to
                            keep themselves unspotted. It would appear that human society as it exists today — in its
                            domestic relations, political factions and national councils — resembles physical bodies. As
                            the life-fluid finds its way through the capillary vessels in human bodies, and passes into
                            the veins, thence into the larger arteries, keeping the machinery in motion, so the spirit
                            of the world permeates and runs through every department of life, passing into broader,
                            deeper channels, culminating in war, monopoly and slavery. True religion is not bounded by
                            creeds; it is nonsectarian. God is not a respecter of persons, but of character. "In every
                            nation, they who fear God and work righteousness " — according to their highest light—"are
                            accepted of Him." And all who live above the spirit of revenge, intemperance and war, and
                            exert an influence to help others to do the same, are fraternally one, and may clasp hands
                            over all creeds and dogmas which serve to bind the conscience and to shut out the sunlight
                            of truth and divine revelation. The ages that have come and gone have left enough of their
                            history to show that Truth has ever been maintained through suffering; that bigotry,
                            superstition, love of pleasure and self-indulgence have stood in the way, sword in hand, to
                            do battle against its promulgators all through the centuries that are past. True, there has
                            been a highway cast up for the prophets, witnesses of truth, to walk in; for at no time has
                            the earth been so darkened that God has left it without a witness of Himself. Often-times
                            those witnesses, like lone travelers in a waste wilderness, clad in garments of mourning,
                            with sandals on their feet, walked more by faith than by sight, over rocks and unbeaten
                            paths, surrounded apparently with beasts of prey, who stood ready to devour them. The lamps
                            which they carried could only burn dimly, but they were firm in their integrity. Hope gave
                            their weary spirits rest, and invisible friends bound up their lacerated and bleeding hearts
                            when they were persecuted and bereft of human sympathy. The prophetic period to which the
                            seers of olden time pointed, when "Righteousness would be established and truth in majesty
                            ride prosperously, bearing the right sceptre," must have appeared to them far in the
                            distance. But time rolled on, and even now how changed the conditions! Then, there were a
                            few scattered witnesses, seeking to evade the rage of their persecutors by fleeing to the
                            caves of the earth for safety. Now, truth has so far gained the ascendancy over error that
                            it finds its way through <pb n="27" id="p3" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER. the deep waters, the mountain
                            ranges and wilderness places, and its defenders and standard-bearers have become numerous.
                            Under the laws of progress, natural and spiritual science have been developed and
                            accelerated. New channels of thought have opened, and new modes of transit have been
                            devised; and pedestrianism is now superseded by swiftly-running cars, bearing the lovers of
                            human progress to their proper fields of labor in every land and clime. Thus is the promise,
                            in part, fulfilled. Righteousness is so far established that its ministers may fearlessly
                            bear their testimony, and truth, in triumph, ride prosperously through the land. Mortals are
                            weak when depending upon their own strength, but strong when trusting in God, and
                            cooperating with divine agencies to better their own conditions and to elevate humanity. We
                            can do nothing effectually against that which is true. We may oppose, and place obstacles in
                            the way of its growth and increase; but, apparently crushed to earth, it will rise again
                            with new life and resurrected strength. It is interesting to witness the balancing powers —
                            good and evil — at work in our own time. Spiritual forces, in higher spheres of spirit life,
                            are evidently operating to put an end to sin, and to roll back the elements of sensuality,
                            intemperance and war in the earth; while the dwellers in the lower spheres of the invisible
                            world are stimulating evil passions of leading men and women, making themselves abettors of
                            crime by adding fuel to demoniac fires already kindled, and with their foul breath are
                            fanning the flames. Sensuality, arrayed in queenly attire, is found in king's palaces, the
                            consort of priests and laymen, and is fed and pampered, and treated with delicacy, but
                            concealed under many false names and pretenses. Disguise it as we may, its direful effects
                            upon society cause a fearful trembling; its growth has been rapid, and who can divine how
                            those elements may be stayed, and the fast-rising tide be kept from deluging the land? No
                            one who is capable of discerning good from evil can fail to see that war has its foundation
                            in error. If we cast our eyes over America's broad lands today—said to be a home of liberty
                            for the oppressed of all nations, races and colors — and see the maimed who were wounded in
                            battle in the recent civil war, and hear the moans of widows, bereft of means of support,
                            and witness their tender offspring crying for bread, we at once decide that war is a product
                            of fiendish passions. If there ever was a justifiable war, perhaps it was the late American
                            conflict. Millions of human beings, whose limbs could tire, and whose hearts could throb
                            with grief, had plead in vain through long years of anguish for relief. And when their
                            masters refused to hear, they sent up strong cries to God for some redress, and seemingly no
                            answer came. Then they imploringly asked, "Is there no pity in the hearts of men, and no
                            mercy in heaven?" There were many hearts that pitied, but were powerless to relieve. All
                            true philanthropists denounced chattel slavery as a base wrong done to humanity, and a great
                            sin against God, who is the author of all existences. In the nation's extremity, when
                            neither moral suasion nor appeals to conscience caused oppression to cease, the sword became
                            the arbiter, and through blood and battle the captives' chains were broken, and civil
                            liberty was a boon to all of the male population. But lovers of justice, and advocates of
                            universal freedom, irrespective of sex, caste or color, deprecated war as much as slavery.
                            They had not lost faith in God, nor confidence in humanity, and believed there might have
                            been a peaceful solution of the vexed question. If the North — who in reality shared the
                            product of slave labor, and in principle upheld the slave power as much as did the people of
                            the South — had opened the public treasury [The speaker must have forgotten how often and
                            earnestly this was offered by Lincoln, Greeley and others previous to and after the
                            beginning of war.—Ed.] and offered to remunerate slaveholders if they would liberate their
                            bondmen, then have passed laws bearing equally upon North and South, forever prohibiting
                            chattel slavery in the United States, many believed, and still believe, that bloodshed might
                            have been avoided. Others claim that the love of slavery was so deeply rooted in the hearts
                            of those who were born under its influence and reared amid its surroundings, that it was so
                            interwoven with their very existence, nothing short of dire force would have caused them to
                            relinquish their stronghold, for they verily thought they could not live without it. If
                            there could have been a peaceful settlement of the slave question without resorting to arms,
                            anc those who were slain in battle had been left to pursue the practical duties of life,
                            providing for their families, who to a large extent are now dependent upon subsidies from
                            the national treasury, would there not have been a great gain, financially? How much would
                            have been left in the public coffers that could be turned to relieve the widow and
                            fatherless, the needy natives, and strangers who are cast upon our shores at the present
                            time ? War, even if we claim that it be a contest for principle and right, therefore
                            justifiable, is appalling to every sensitive heart. Its fruits may be seen in almost every
                            form of vice, in hamlets and cities, from the Atlantic to the Pacific shores, showing its
                            demoralizing effects upon character. The advocates of peace principles are doing a noble
                            work. We pray that they may have courage and strength to continue in well-doing, to work in
                            the sunshine and in the storm, until they receive the reward of their labors. Nothing less
                            than the triumph of their cause will give rest and satisfy such toiling spirits. Peace and
                            temperance are inseparable companions: when.we pray for the success of one, the other is
                            included. All lovers of humanity who desire the peace and prosperity of the nations of the
                            earth will give their best efforts, through faith and prayer, to call down divine influences
                            from higher spheres to aid the work and sustain the laborers. If we would remedy the evils
                            of war and intemperance, we must trace them to their primal source, the fountain whence they
                            originate, and this will require some deep digging. If we would kill the life of a tree, we
                            must find and strike the life-root; we might use the pruning-knife from age to age and lop
                            off its branches, and it would chance to live and produce fruit. In like manner, if we
                            attempt to dry up or destroy a large body of water, we do not think to lade it out with a
                            bucket, but rather seek to find and cut off its source of supply. We see God, and hear His
                            voice, in the various reforms of our time, and rejoice to see woman stretching forth her
                            hands in the cause of right. Her influence is needed, and will prove a strong power for
                            good, and, when fully awake to the glorious truth that God is dual — that in Deity we have
                            an all-wise Father and loving Mother, cooperating in harmony to save, bless and happify
                            their children, who are one in spirit and purpose, then we shall better understand our
                            duties and responsibilities, and how we may uplift humanity to better conditions. And in the
                            language of the poet we say, "Fly swiftly round, ye wheels of time, and bring the welcome
                            day," when woman shall be free and stand in her proper place, a co-worker with man in every
                            good word and work. That is the lever that will move the world to higher and better
                            relations.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Still on the wing" TEIform="index"/>STILL ON THE WING</head><p TEIform="p">My Dear Elder Lomas : Grace and mercy; peace and good will to you and the " Zion of our God"
                            — that God who is Father and Mother, wisdom and love. With pen-and-ink I greet you this
                            morning from the sunny south-land of our country. And although it is yet February, the
                            people of the Crescent City have made their gardens and mown their lawns. The yards are full
                            of roses, and the orange trees fragrant with white blossoms, prophecy of a.golden fruitage.
                            But as all pictures have — and necessarily so — a back-ground, it is but justice done, to
                            say further, that the effects of the late civil war linger— that the times are very hard —
                            that the foga of New Orleans are damp and dismal — while in the night-time, blood-hunting
                            musketoes hum infernal music around my pillow. Sleep departs, and I often fail to coax it
                            back by singing to myself, even that dear good song — " God is infinitely able." On my way
                            to New Orleans I stopped two nights at South Union, lecturing twice and attending one
                            religious meeting. The angels were with us ; and there seemed to be an outpouring of the
                            spirit. I believe in a perpetual revival — a constant growth in grace — progression ! Paul
                            said, "Go on unto perfection "— " So run that ye may obtain "—'' Work out your own
                            salvation." To work — to " run " is not to stand still. I find in all organizations
                            individuals who are exquisitely delighted with the biblical passage —" Wait on the salvation
                            of the Lord." And waiting, they nod, sleep, die — and while thus dead, spiritually dead,
                            they often walk about in the graveclothes of a rotting conservatism, and think themselves
                            alive. It is a strange delusion. The ministry, the elders, and the believers, all received
                            me most cordially. Their welcome was soul-felt, and proved an oasis — a very blessing to my
                            soul. If possible, considering other engagements, I shall call again at South Union on my
                            return north. In Memphis, Tenn., I lectured three Sundays to very large audiences. The
                            people seemed interested and awake. With Doctor Watson and others in this city, spiritualism
                            is a practical and a saving power. They have recently had startling manifestations here
                            through the mediumship of Mrs. Miller. In some respects they are far superior to those you
                            and I witnessed at the Eddys. In the open field, by starlight, spirits often appear clothed
                            in white and walk by her side. Dr. Samuel Watson, Mr. Silliman, Mr. Miller and myself
                            witnessed this phenomenon one evening out on the common, adjacent to the city. It was for
                            the moment the mount of transfiguration. " Without a vision the people perish," said a
                            prophet in olden times. Vision and trance — inspirations and revelations constitute, in a
                            measure, the life of the soul. The principles that underlie the platform of
                            Believers:—purity, and "all things in common ;— peace and perpetual revelations — are
                            immutable. They are the methods — the doors that open into the kingdom whither the
                            resurrected have entered. Well said Jesus under the influence of the Christ-spirit —" I am
                            the way, the truth and the life." Pardon me for a bit of philosophising, concerning moral,
                            evil and wicked spirits. That man is a moral being, no solid thinker disputes. But moral
                            being implies moral law, and moral law implies not only conscience and freedom, but moral
                            government and compensation. Conscience, in connection with moral judgment, ever prompts to
                            the right; but the reasoning and reflecting organs, in connection with moral consciousness,
                            must ever determine what that right is. This applies to every scale of human life. " Green
                            apples are good," says a spiritualist writer — "good in their place, as the ripened ones of
                            October." The proposition is a bald sophism. Neither green nor ripened apples are good. No
                            moral quality inheres in apples. They are neither "good" nor evil, because moral qualities
                            pertain to moral beings — not unconscious fruit, or blind forces. There is a class of
                            pseudo-philosophers who tell us there is " no moral evil in the universe"—only a graded
                            good. Is a positive lie a lower degree of truth ? malice a lower degree of love ? and rape a
                            lower degree of chastity ? To enunciate is to reveal the terrible hideousness of such
                            reasoning. Good and evil are moral conditions, each real and positive, according as it
                            becomes the leading force in purpose or quality of character. And the higher the moral
                            altitude attained, the more exquisitely keen are the soul's distinctions between good and
                            evil. 27 <pb n="28" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> All moral acts pertain to the intellectual and spiritual, and
                            not to tlie body, except medially. Can the foot of a corpse tread on forbidden ground ? Is
                            it the fleshly hand that steals ? Are not these rather the implements of conscious force
                            operating in and through them ? Without this intelligence, or spirit, man is but a corpse,
                            and a corpse never violates either physical or moral law. The body does not sin. Constituted
                            of physical elements, it can know nothing of moral or immoral acts. And death, which is only
                            a severing of this outer envelope from the spiritual, affects in no way the real, immortal
                            man. Each, at death, goes, Judas-like, to " his own place." All sensations, all thought,
                            reason, moral responsibility, pertain to soul — the innerthinking man. Accordingly, the
                            shrewd and the selfish, the wicked and the evil-minded, enter the spirit world as such, and
                            are there denominated evil spirits. Nature knows no spasms. Sudden leaps from vice to
                            virtue, from folly to wisdom, are contrary to the processes of development. The same
                            clairvoyant and phenomenal evidences through mediums that prove the existence of spirits,
                            prove the existence of unregenerate, or evil spirits. In New Testament times, these evil
                            spirits were termed "demons." And that eminent church writer, Dr. Lardner, says: " The
                            notion of demons, or the souls of the dead, having power over living men, was universally
                            prevalent among the nations of those times, and believed by many Christians." Jesus
                            addressed these demons — that is, evil-disposed spirits — as thinking, conscious
                            individualities, and commanded them, as beings distinct from the obsessed, to "depart."
                            There are obsessed mediums in this age ; and there are those gifted with power to " cast out
                            these demons." Although we term them " demons," we must not forget that they were onco
                            mortals, and are still our brothers, though occupying the lower spheres of spirit life. They
                            are also the subjects of progression, and the objects 6f God's love. To such — denominated
                            by Peter "spirits in prison"—Jesus preached, after being " put to death in the flesh " upon
                            Calvary. And the fact of his preaching to them implies that*they could be benefited and
                            regenerated by this preaching, or these moral efforts in their behalf. Progress is open to
                            all orders of beings in the future life ¦— spirits becoming angels, angels archangels, and
                            these Arsaphs, and thus onward toward the Infinite. The prevention of obsessing influences
                            lies in the pure purpose and the good life, in the cultivation of broad aspirational aims, a
                            firmness of moral principle, a determined desire to do right, and a calm trust in the
                            overshadowing presence of God and good angels. In Shaker assemblages, as in spiritual
                            seances, truth attracts the true, wisdom the wise, charity the charitable, unselfishness the
                            angelic, and purity the pure and holy that walk the heavenly fields of immortality.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I would never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden of the world..."

                                    language, and therefore in addition to the sense of the letter, there is in the word
                                    an inner or spiritual sense, which can be interpreted only by the law of
                                    correspondence between things natural and things spiritual. IV. Now is the time of
                                    the second coming of the Lord, foretold in Matt, xxiv, and the establishment of the
                                    new church signified by the New Jerusalem in Revelation xxi, and this second coming
                                    is not a visible appearance, on earth, but a new disclosure of divine truth and the
                                    promulgation of true Christian doctrine, effected by means of the Lord's servant,
                                    Emanuel Swedenborg, who was specially instructed in this doctrine, and commissioned

                                    heaven or hell, according to the character acquired during his earthly life. VI. The
                                    spiritual world, the eternal home of man after death, is not remote from this world,

                            The Prelatists mounted the next wave, and overwhelmed the unhappy Presbyterians. Then the
                            Presbyterians in their time, came into power and wreaked their vengeance on the Prelatists.
                            Then the tide turned under James II, and the Presbyterians had again to bite the dust. Thus
                            it was in England and all over Europe, till the earth was fattened with blood, shed in the

                            letter written by the Carlist General Castella. The writer had command of the fortifications
                            at Villareal during a recent engagement: "I have, during my life, witnessed some very sad
                            scenes of war, and I thought I had seen the summit of human misery in the retreat of the
                            Army of the East (in 1870), of which I commanded the rear guard. But I cannot recall any
                            impression which can be compared with the feeling which I experienced on entering with
                            Brigadier Valluerca the principal street of Villareal, when it was on fire from one end to
                            the other. The crackling of the flames, whose red glare struggled against the light of the
                            mid-day sun, the heavy crash of windows giving way, and of roofs falling in, the shrieks of
                            frenzied women and the cries of the children, who ran with bare feet on the ashes, the grim
                            despair of the old men, as they gazed with a dry eye and fixed stare upon the scene, the
                            imprecations of the Carlist soldiers as parties of them rushed in hot pursuit of the
                            incendiaries, the rattle of the musketry, ail formed a horrible spectacle which baffles
                            description. I saw in a side street, between two burning houses, a woman lying stretched out
                            on a mattress, surrounded by little children halfnaked, who were uttering piercing cries.
                            The atmosphere was unbearable. The flames all but licked the paths; the burning ruins were
                            falling down on all sides quite close to them; and this family, abandoned in the confusion,
                            were about to be either rosted or crushed. I got off my horse which was dreadfully
                            frightened by the flames and the noise around, and I went up to where the sick woman lay.
                            She was paralyzed. Her husband, a mule-driver, was away. Some soldiers had carried her out
                            of the house before setting fire to it. The only thing left her —and that by mere good luck
                            — was the mattress on which she was lying. The heat was becoming more and more intense;
                            their faces were crimson; the children, in their agony, redoubled their shrieks; their poor
                            mother, as she looked at them, weeping, and calling the Holy Virgin to her aid. "What could
                            be more heartrending than this picture, framed, as it were, in fire?"</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="When the late war began, a young man, the only son of a widow..."

                            the nations under the teachings of the Divine Author and His inspired disciples, even in an
                            age of civilization; much longer does it take learning and art to rise above the power of
                            ignorance, indolence, superstition and the customs inherited from ancestors. All pioneer
                            inventors have felt the strength of this combination against any new mode of increasing the
                            products of industry. Many years ago an engineer, for amusement, hunted the chamois on the
                            plateau of Mount Piletus, in Switzerland, where he found a lofty forest of inaccessible pine
                            timber, nearly nine miles from Lake Lucerne. By the aid of a few Swiss gentlemen, he
                            executed a design to construct a trough or slide, such as we see on mountain sides, or along
                            our river hills, to convey wood and timber to accessible points. It passed sometimes by
                            tunnels through hills, again on supports 100 feet high, or hung to the rocky mountain side.
                            Timbers would pass the entire distance in three minutes, or at the rate of 180 miles an
                            hour. The intense friction caused them to ignite, and at the base they would plunge twenty
                            feet into the earth. These difficulties were readily overcome by turning a stream of water
                            into the trough and plunging the timbers into Lake Lucerne, whence they were safely borne
                            away to the Khine to become material for constructing many an elegant home, or to be spars
                            and beams and masts for ships that would visit either India and bear the strain of the
                            storms of every sea. All this was the product of a little practical thinking, using only the
                            inclined plane and the force of gravity; but the work was conducted among a peasantry, who
                            charged the inventor with heresy, and with having communion with the devil. When saw-mills
                            and looms were invented, the common laborer became loud, revengeful, and clamorous for
                            redress, not knowing that accumulating wealth only opens multiplied channels for well-paid
                            industry, in its reinvestment. It has been but little more than one hundred years since a
                            great banking company of England were afraid to risk giving aid to Richard Arkwright, while
                            constructing his spinning-jenny, which earned for its inventor more than $2,000,000; and
                            since, James Brindley, at the request of the Duke of Bridgewater, planned a canal from his
                            coal field of Worsley to Manchester, a distance of seven miles. It was to pass by aqueduct,
                            forty feet over the Mersey, and again, by subterraneous tunnels through hills. On submitting
                            his plans to the judgment of a distinguished engineer of that day, he received for criticism
                            the cool remark, "I have often heard of air castles, but never before saw the place where
                            one was to be built." The success of this invention soon led to a canal investment in
                            England of more than $50,000,000. It has been but about seventy years since Robert Fulton
                            launched the Clermont and Car of Neptune on the Hudson in our age when all men were
                            deprecating his "folly." He had an equal struggle with his own poverty and the want of
                            public appreciation. Even in this generation Congressmen have failed to be re-elected
                            because they voted aid to Prof. Morse in the construction of the electric telegraph that now
                            gathers the hews of yesterday from every nation for our daily papers.</p></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">THE SHAKER.

                            are only happy that there are more fortunate souls than we are. But we do not apprehend that
                            such is the case. We are believers in heavenly principles; that these same causes, ever and
                            forever will produce heaven wherever exercised. The knowledge of heavenly principles is
                            ours. If we exercise this knowledge, heaven is ours. If we fail to use such knowledge,
                            disorder and discomfort will be ours, even in excess of those not thus enlightened. The
                            gospel should be to us, not only the bow of promise, but the practical existence of
                            salvation; not only the ark of safety, but a positive deliverance from the world, and into
                            every good and perfect joy. Let us look at the heavenly Arc: VirCxInity; Celestial
                            Brotherhood, or Earthly Equality; Peace, and the blessings Avhich floAV from it; entire
                            UxspottedKES8 from the World! These are as firm as the Eock of Ages — as the heavens are
                            eternal. On these, the house of Shakerism has been erected; on which it has firmly stood
                            through the tempestuous seasons of ridicule and" persecution; has flourished; has saved; has
                            ever held oat the beacon of eternal life, to the sin-sick and sin-wrecked. Love has been the
                            bond of union, that has acted the key-stone to this beautiful arc. Love for these principles
                            collectively, is what makes the practical, desirable, model Shaker — fisher, and saviour of
                            men ! Eeverence for either with irreverence for any, presents at best an unsavory, spotted
                            hybrid. Even practical attachment to several, and not for all, savors only the possible and
                            probable fall of the beautiful structure. Said Elder G. B. Avery: "There is no salvation in
                            mere communism;" and, excepting salvation from the poor or lazar-housc, this is true.
                            Considered separately, either principle of the Shaker arc has a similar value; and any
                            evasion or negligence of entire conformity to the whole order of the temple, removes the
                            key-stone of Angel Love, and razes the structure to worse than worldly institutions. Said a
                            grand legal star of Albany, N. Y.., when studying the Shaker Constitution: " Gentlemen, you
                            have here something which cannot be broken, tuilcss you break it yourselves ! " Let us look
                            about us, and see whether these principles are guarded and lived intact. Let the love and
                            direction which led out of Egypt, still be ours to keep out! Let us have a Revival; and let
                            it renew in us the most ardent consecration to gospel principles, with which the city of
                            God, the paradise of Eden, the perfect love of gospel brethren and sisters may and will be
                            ours forever, and without which, let us consider our days narrowed down, and numbered as a
                            people ! From hence, let the joyful, revival song be: AVe avill sustain" the structure.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Martin Luther, and reformation" TEIform="index"/>MARTIN LUTHER, AND REFORMATION</head><p TEIform="p">" From the year 1517, the beginning of the Reformation, to 154fi, in which Luther died,
                            nothing but the fruits of corrupt ambition are manifest on the whole face of history, during
                            that period of more than twenty-eight years. Endless controversies, debates about diets and
                            councils, violence and wars, are the distinguishing marks of those times of discord. And
                            even the means, by which the Reformation was finally established, were as opposite to the
                            precepts of the gospel, as bloodshed and robberies are opposed to peace and good will."
                            Benj. S. Youngs. (Shaker.) Could we ask for a better demonstration of Luther's adoption of
                            the vicarious atonement introduced by Paul, than his remark to a comrade : " Be thou a
                            sinner, and sin boldly ; but still more boldly believe, and rejoice in Christ. From him, sin
                            shall not separate us; no, though a thousand times in every day, we should commit
                            fornication and murder!" Under his pernicious solifidian system of '' Imputed
                            Righteousness," he did commit fornication with the nun, Catharine a Bora; was excommunicated
                            therefor by Rome ; and were it not for this expulsion, there had been no Reformation. Luther
                            was in full accord with the " Head of the Church " in England — Henry the Eighth,— who
                            became such " Head," because Rome would not permit unlimited indulgence to his fleshy lusts.
                            This lecherous beast, to further the aims and ends of his lusts for the flesh, and ambitions
                            for power, had six wives; some of whom he killed, and to these, he added the sacrifice of

Second Paper</head><p TEIform="p">Our first paper upon this eminent character has aroused an intemperate zeal in his admirers ;
                            who, dealing severely with us, are loud in the excellencies of their idol The champions of
                            Paul of old, would, probably, be first to rise in denunciation of any modern Paul, who,
                            creating a new formula of doctrine, should contend for the same, at any and every expense of
                            the vital principles of original and genuine Christianity. This is j list what Paul did ;
                            and his being successful in displacing the essential elements of Christianity by his own
                            peculiar theories, does not render him the less censurable. Confident that the Jews would
                            not receive the gospel, as delivered by the twelve, we find Paul, in the entire ignorance of
                            the disciples in Jerusalem, leaving them; and proclaiming himself the apostle of the
                            Gentiles, entering Arabia, Damascus, Syria and Asia Minor, and here for a dozen years,
                            laboring earnestly, making many converts, establishing churches, with which he kept up a
                            continual correspondence, the general purport of which, was the denunciation of the law, and
                            imbuing the people with a belief that Jesus was a God! That by his death the law became a
                            nullity ; that by a faith in him, all sins, past, present and future, should be forgiven.
                            When we think that neither Jesus nor his apostles, had, up to this time, ever spoken of the
                            law but with respect ; and never, previous to the divergence of Paul, had alluded to any
                            vicarious atonement of Jesus, we begin to see where and by whom these mischievous
                            machinations were concocted. When the disciples heard of the incendiarism of Paul, they sent
                            emissaries from Jerusalem to Antioch, charged with the duty of overturning such
                            demonstrations of the ardent Paul, and to preach the sacredness of the law, and the
                            necessity of its observance. This was a terrible blow to the infant Gentile church; and to
                            its founder, who felt that all his labor was lost, unless he should go to Jerusalem, and
                            obtain the disciples' indorsement of the system he had inaugurated. Paul arrives at
                            Jerusalem; and the close reader is made aware that the discussions between him and the
                            disciples were very violent. The disciples withstood Paul's proposals, finding no
                            recognition therein of their master's teachings; and had they remained firm ever afterward,
                            the church would have fallen away no sooner, and possibly, the world would not have been
                            cursed, as it is with certain Paulism. Paul refused to yield; claiming that at his marvelous
                            conversion, he came en rapport with Jesus, and declaring that he would continue his
                            apostolate at all events. A compromise was effected — the first, between Christianity and
                            paganism — a downfall to that, a gain for this. Paul was to yield, so far as teaching a

                            non-essentials. But, Peter visiting Antioch, and there losing his justification among the
                            Gentiles, James, (brother of Jesus, and real head of the church), addressed serious
                            remonstrances to him, which had the effect of entirely separating him from the Gentiles, and
                            weaning therefrom also, one Barnabas ; through hearing of which circumstances, Paul's
                            indignation lost all bounds, and he expressed himself so homely of the apostles, that in
                            return, the second epistle of James was addressed to him, than which never was better
                            Christianity, and which was and is, an unanswerable argument against all objectionable
                            Paulism. Paul, not only would not now submit to the apostles, but returned with all his
                            force to his old tactics against the law. The apostles organized an opposing mission, (see
                            Cor.) and we may j udge of the gravity of the occasion, by the ardor of Paul in his own
                            defense, reaching an egotistic climax in 2 Cor. xi: 5; eti. Cor. xv : 10 ; and yet the
                            adherents to the original faith, completely carried the day. Paul returned to Jerusalem, a
                            penitent; was required and made a public apology and entire recantation of unchristian
                            Paulism; but so great had been the disturbance, the tribune arrested him, and confined him
                            for a term of years; after which he preached Paulism unrestricted ; and learning, that
                            during his imprisonment the apostles in Judea were losing ground continually, invited them
                            to Rome, where they became converts to Paulism. Even Peter, in his turn, quitted Judea,
                            hastened to Rome, became the bosom companion of Paul; exceeded Paul, if possible, in
                            doctrines that contained not Christ, and closes (2 Peter, III: 15,) with a stirring appeal
                            fora thorough belief in the writings of Paul — the adulterator of the "faith once delivered
                            to the saints"—and through which adultery, the original was lost beyond resuscitation in
                            their day. We yield to none in his admiration of Paul's Christian teachings — nor to
                            Beecher's — and 'tis only in opposition to the positively unchristian that we have attempted
                            to raise our voice. ^</p></div2><div2 type="humor" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="A King's jester was once asked..." TEIform="index"/>A King's jester was once asked...

                            subject of music, we come to recognize, in connection with the lungs, that wonderfully
                            working organ — the diaphragm — which, in the language of physiologists, " is a flexible,
                            circular partition that separates the respiratory from the digestive organs, and the chest
                            from the abdomen. In a state of repose its upper surface farms an arch, the convexity of
                            which is toward the chest. In forced expiration its upper point reaches as high as the
                            fourth rib. In ordinary inspiration, it is depressed as low as the seventh rib, which
                            increases the capacity of the chest." [See Cutter's Anatomy.] It is to be understood that
                            these actions of the diaphragm take place when nature has not been superseded by long
                            perverted habits which render these actions more or less imperfect. And it must be admitted
                            as a fact proved by what is daily and hourly to be seen, that a comparatively inactive
                            diaphragm is a fault exceedingly prevalent with a majority of singers ; and no one fault in
                            the music-department taxes the skill and patience of the teacher more than this. To remedy
                            this fault is a part of the teacher's first duties in his arduous calling, and implies no
                            less active and spirited exertions on the part of the pupil. But what to do, and koto to do,
                            is the point to be reached. Physiological investigation establishes the fact that in the
                            respiratory process various muscles are brought into use, whose contraction and dilations
                            are in part, at least — unconscious and involuntary. Foremost among these are the lower
                            muscles of the trunk—anatomically termed abdominal, which, by their inward and upward
                            contraction, act directly upon the diaphragm — giving it its ascending motion. The
                            diaphragm, thus acted upon, imparts a pressure upon the lungs, equal in power to that which
                            the diaphragm receives from the muscles. The lungs, thus acted upon by the diaphragm, are
                            forced to exhaust themselves of the greater portion of air in their cells. The air, thus
                            expelled, finds its escape from the system through channels whose various parts will be
                            considered and treated upon in their proper time and place. The process, thus described, is
                            called expiration. But as Nature abhors vacuity, the lungs cannot remain void of the element
                            they are wanted to contain, hence a reverse process of action immediately ensues. A new
                            supply of fresh air rushes in to fill the vacuum in the lungs causing them to expand in
                            corresponding proportion to the amount of air inhaled. By this expansion, the thorax (great
                            cavity of the chest), also expands by means of the concerted action of three sets of
                            muscles, viz.: the intercostal at the lower, and the thoracic <pb n="31" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            SHAKER. 31 and pectoral muscles at the upper part of the trunk or chest. Simultaneous with
                            these actions the abdominal muscles relax — the diaphragm descends in proportion to the
                            pressure it meets from the inflation of the lungs. This process is called inspiration.
                            Continuous through life are these alternate processes carried on — partly involuntary, and
                            partlythrough power of the will :— especially the latter in regard to degree. Hence it
                            becomes a fact beyond even a shadow of contradiction that in a majority of cases musical
                            students quietly submit to a mere passive process of respiration — inhaling just air enough
                            (and sometimes poorly at that) to merely exist, but falling far short of the proper quantity
                            for promoting vigorous and healthy action of the blood. In this enfeebled condition the
                            abdominal muscles lose their natural tension, the diaphragm becomes measurably inactive, the
                            lungs and thorax become dwarfed in extension, and the whole system must yield inevitably to
                            the fatal ravages of disease.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Miscellaneous" TEIform="index"/>SHAKER APOTHEGMS</head><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our life is like a calm lake..."

                            not require cleaning by us ; nature undertakes the task, and in the healthy state fulfills
                            it perfectly. Her means for cleansing the ear is the wax, which dries up into thin scales
                            and peels off and falls away imperceptibly. In health the passage of the ear is never dirty,
                            but an attempt to clean it will infallibly make it so. Washing the ear out with soap and
                            water is bad; it keeps the wax moist when it ought to become dry and scaly, and makes it
                            absorb dust. But the most hurtful thing is the introduction of the corner of a towel screwed
                            up and twisted around. This proceeding irritates the passage and presses down the wax and

                                shoemake buds, one pound of resin, one pint ginger, half pound mustard, one pint
                                unslacked lime, six ounces cream-tartar, four ounces gum guacum, one pound epsom salts;
                                mix together and make into thirty parcels. Give one every morning in the horse's feed
                                before watering him. This is the first time this recipe has been printed. For half a

                                he will be simple, docile, faithful, and inured to hardship and fatigue. If you have
                                your horse to serve you on the day of your trial, if you desire him to be a horse of
                                truth, make him sober, accustomed to hard work, and inaccessible to fear. Do not beat
                                your horses, nor speak to them in a loud tone of voice; do not be angry with them, but
                                kindly reprove their faults; they will do better thereafter, for they understand the
                                language of man and its meaning. If you have a long day's journey before you, spare your
                                horse at the start; let him frequently walk to recover his wind. Continue this until he
                                has sweated and dried three times, and you may ask him whatever you please, he will not
                                leave you in difficulty. Use your horse as you do your leathern bottle; if you open it
                                gently and gradually you can easily control the water within, but if you open it
                                suddenly the water escapes at once, and nothing remains to quench your thirst. Observe
                                your horse when he is drinking at a brook. If in bringing down his head he remains
                                square, without bending his limbs, he possesses sterling qualities, and all parts of his
                                body are built symmetrically. Four things he must have broad—front, chest, loins and
                                limbs; four things long —neck, breast, forearm and croup; four things short — pasterns,
