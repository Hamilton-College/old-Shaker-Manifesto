ADDRESS
THE FLORAL WORLD, Highland Park, Lake Co. 111.
It is a fact that remedies almost without
number, already contest the claim to cure all the ills
that afflict suflering- humanity. Thousands have
found them powerless to work a cure lor them.
No diseases have so baffled all attempts
at permanent relief as have Rheumatism and Neuralgia. A long- succession of disappointments has made
their agonized victims despair of the possibility of
cure. For centuries they have been considered beyond the power of medical skill to cure.
And yet we say both can be cured, and
that Athlophobos will do the business. The best
proof that it can do it is that it lias done it.
Eev. S. R. Dennen, D.D., pastor Third
Congregational Church, New Haven, Conn. Rheumatism had kept him from the pulpit four or five
months at a time. He says he had suffered all that
one could, and live. He took his first dose of Athlophoeos on Friday ; Sunday he was in his pulpit;
Monday he was well, and has remained so since.
Eev. William P. Corbit, D.D., pastor
George St. M. E. Church. New Haven, Conn., was laid
up for two months with Inflammatory Rheumatism,
suffering most excruciating torture. Athlophobos
cured him, and he believes it to be infallible.
H. S. Chandler, of the N. Y. " Independent," says Athlofhobos cured him of Rheumatism from which he had Buffered for a year and a half.
Rev. W. B. Evans, Washington, D. C,
says; "I consider its work almost in the light of a
miracle. It is a most wonderful medicine. It ought
to be spread throughout the land."
The great question is, Will it cure me ? We
elieve it will. Is it worth trying? You must decide.
belie
If you cannot get Athlophobos of your druggist,
we will send it express paid, on receipt of regular
price�one dollar per bottle. We prefer that you buy
it from your druggist, but if he hasn't it, do not be
persuaded to try something else, but order at once
from us as directed.

TEIform="persName"/>GILES B. AVERY. </byline><p TEIform="p">I beheld, in the engiscope, the ensanguined ensign of a creedal judgment for humanity reading
                            thus, "The punishment inflicted on Christ for our sins ! ! " On viewing this, my spirit
                            burned with indignation and pity, and I sighed with grief, and cried out, O Lord have mercy
                            and open the eyes of the blind ! In thy goodness, justice and love, tear off this mask of
                            wretched sycophancy, and let these ease-loving, sin-living professed believers in Christ,
                            know that the Christians' God is not "less just than his creature,�man ! What human Court of
                            arbitration would adjudge and decree to punish the known innocent, for the proved and
                            confessed guilty? Again I looked, and, on another so called Christian banner, I saw the
                            pennant streaming creed, written in ghoulish letters of blood. "Judgment�The sentence of
                            damnation on the wicked ! ! " Then my vision upward turned toward the shrine of the God I
                            worship : before it I saw His glorious Son�The Christ; he spake, and Io the utterance from
                            his loving compassionate lips�UI came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them." Then
                            listened I to angel voices, and I heard one of his beloved disciples proclaim, li God sent
                            not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but, that the world through him mjght be
                            saved ! " I now turned to the Orient and Egypt's Moloch next before me came, and, with his
                            horrid burning brazen bosom and his fiery arms, grasping his sinless infant prey�Its
                            judgment tribute for the parent's sin, at the cruel sickening sight I shuddered, and I
                            wondered how the heathenish and devilish ingenuity of man CONTENTS.<pb n="170" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>could devise a scheme so monstrous in its scope and object�the depletion of over
                            population, and the provision for the gratification of lust unlimited�a scheme so
                            sacreligious to the true God. could be thought acceptable, even to a heathen idol deity ! !
                            A judgment offering so scathing to the affections and tenderest emotions of the human heart,
                            declares that vice, even though unknown as such, petrifies humanity into a block of marble,
                            too senseless to be joyful, too emotionless to weep ! Next India's golden strand before me
                            came. I saw the sacred Ganges silvery judgment stream. On either bank arrayed stood penitent
                            worshipful mothers, casting their bundles of dear or hated infant life,�a judgment tribute
                            to the ravenous avenging crocodile !�An offering of the fruit of the body, for the sin of
                            the soul. Sorrowful, I turned, and prayerful to a better God, I wept. Bitter tears of pity
                            would flow. Then I turned to Hindostan's burning plains ; there, with my lorgnette I saw the
                            'lorn heathen prostrated before the attantan bloody wheels! of Jugernaut, thus to be crushed
                            from life by the ponderous moving of his judgment car; thus the wretched heathen supposed
                            his cruel idolatrous deity avenged, and pai'don won at last! Now, sickened with the
                            offerings of blood-stained cruel worshipers, again my vision turned to so called Christian
                            lands, there I beheld Jesus, the Son of God, nailed, hands and feet, to the bloody Jewish
                            cross,�a tortured victim ; I beheld the murderous spear, the bitter draught of gall, and I
                            heard the anguish stricken moan, "My God, My God, Why kast thou forsaken me? " and then the-
                            sweet-mellifluous prayer "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. " To those
                            cruel worshipers of that creedal Christianity which claims the necessity of this human
                            sacrifice of the pure and innocent Jesus, slain by wicked Jewish hands, for this God's
                            judgment tribute for human sinners, that the guilty wretches who only believed in Jesus'
                            righteousness, and that he thus inglorious]y and cruelly suffered to appease an angry God,
                            that these sinning believers might go scot free, I then turned, and I asked them, Is not
                            this the most cruel sacrifice, as a tribute to judgment, that my vision has yet beheld? The
                            recording angels answered, Yea! Then I hurled such (Christian?) creeds to earth, � I crushed
                            them 'neath my heel; I prayed for better, higher birth, For nobler nerves to feel! For sight
                            to see a better God, More wise, more just, more true, Earth's myriads on her blood-stained
                            sod, A God of love might view! My soul now bowed in grief at the unutterable blindness, and,
                            in some cases the deep hypocrisy of the professors of Christian grace, the mockery of these
                            so called Christian lives ; but I drew a faint breath of relief, as I recalled to mind an
                            incident in the experience of a sincere seeker after truth and honesty, of the mediaeval
                            ages, as follows. Fra Rocco, a mediaeval preacher, commanded all the penitent in his
                            audience to hold up their hands ; and every man's hand was raised ; then Fra Rocco cried
                            aloud, "O thou Archangel Michael,�thou, who, with adamantine sword standeth at the judgment
                            seat of God, cut me off every hand that has been held up hypocritically ;" And every man now
                            dropped his hand in haste ! Now is revealed a judgment-seat near-<pb n="171" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> er to
                            the heart's emotions, and truer to the lines of justice, than the breast of Moloch, the
                            avenging f crocodile, the wheels of Jugernaut, or the cruel Jewish cross and bloody spear;
                            '-a judgment not rendered according to mere professions, or relations, or reputations, but
                            the deeds done in the body ; and these deeds not as merely external, but as man's vital
                            spiritual conduct, "�the book of life's records, the secrets of the heart! I was next in
                            vision taken to the mansion of the beloved Apostle John. I told him I was seeking the truth
                            concerning the judgment day and work; he made me a welcome guest, and bade me go with him.
                            We now journeyed to the home of the lovely prophet Ezekiel, he led us forth on to a " sea of
                            glass mingled with fire. " "This, " said he, 4'is Wisdom's judgment court tribunal." "Here
                            there is no possible place for hypocrisy ! This is the platform whereon all souls must stand
                            to meet the judgment day of Christ's Second Appearing." On this sea I saw a vast multitude
                            standing who had been judged ! No hiding ! Life was here to be seen in all its naked
                            truthfulness. And the fire of truth had burned up all that was not fit to be seen. Souls
                            assembled here were known to each other,�The fold of Christ,- -The Children of God !
                            Confidence here was mutual, and universal peace, union and love, was its ripened fruit. And
                            now said the beloved Apostle John, " Come up hither and I will show you the New Heavens, "
                            And, behold a " White Cloud, and One Sitting thereon like unto the Son of Man," even Christ,
                            descended " in his glory"�The female manhood manifestation of the Christ�Woman, the glory of
                            man, and the united twain the radiant glory of God. This cloud Avas a "Cloud of Witnesses"
                            And lo, a voice from the Christ on the Cloud, " Lo I come quickly, and my reward is with me,
                            to give to every man according as his ('* own ") works shall be. " And now we heard the
                            Avords of Isaiah concerning this judge declare. " And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
                            him, the spirit of Avisdom and understanding, the spirit of council and might, the spirit of
                            knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. *'* � And he shall judge not after the sijjht of his
                            eyes, neither repro\'e after the hearing of his ears ; but, with righteousness shall he
                            judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. " For the effects, the
                            ultimate of deeds is not always to be judged by immediate and present appearances, but, by
                            consequences also. A man may gradually use arsenic, commencing in small quantities, with
                            apparent momentary benefit ; and he may increase the dose until he takes enough to kill,
                            outright, a dozen men, and, for the time being, he may not appear to be essentially harmed,
                            but, alas ! Very soon he perishes suddenly ! Precisely so of mental, moral, and spiritual
                            influences ; and, on the good side effects are similarly noted. Words of goodness ; deeds of
                            love and kindness ; feelings of unity, and magnetisms of purity. Love! " Tho' but a little
                            thing, Dropped in the heart's deep well. The good, the joy that it may hring, Eternity shall
                            tell." As a just standard of judgment's aid, nothing is so \-alual&gt;le as the simple
                            naked truth. Even the heathen Avere so well convinced of this that they worshiped the
                            goddess of truth stark naked."<pb n="172" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> " To diminish, or exaggerate, or to give
                            a talse coloring, either by word, gesture, doubtful accent, or any kind of inuendo to plain
                            truth, is Satanical." The age we live in is surfeited with hollow professions of the truth,
                            with mockeries ; and multitudes are disgusted with its own false life, both in manners,
                            morals, and religious profession ; and this is the most powerful cause of its infidelity.
                            "The living Jesus was meanly clad, and lived cheaply ; but the dead was clothed in fine
                            linen, and laid in a tomb. " Do not the great masses of professing Christians, do more to
                            adorn and honor the formalities and ceremonies, the houses for worship, of a mere dead
                            powerless Christian profession, than to grace the true Christ life ? Let conscience judgment
                            answer ! " A little damsel, seven years old, solicited her father to purchase for her a
                            London Doll, with a china face and a silk dress. The affectionate father gratified her
                            wishes ; but, she soon grew weary of it, and exclaimed "I want a baby that will cry and eat
                            victuals." The application is easy. The spirit of the age and dispensation demands of the
                            professors of Christianity a living, practical conformity to the pattern set by Jesus. A
                            baptism that shall bring sinners to repentance ; reform them ; give them a new and a true
                            life ! Some few years since there was claimed to have been a religious revival in our town,
                            and numbers joined the church and were said to have been couverted to Christianity ; a
                            non-professor inquired if a certain person among those claimed to have been converted, who
                            bad stolen some of his property, had confessed it, and returned the goods ? He said he had
                            not heard anything of such a change ! Could he be a } eliever in the said conversion ? Thus
                            the enlightened, and reasonable human mind demands a judgment for the living ! And this is
                            precise-ly what Christ, in his Second Appearing, came to introduce, and he said, "For
                            judgment came I into this world, that they who see not, might see, and they who see, (with
                            the eye of worldly wisdom, and self-conceit,) may be made blind. " This Judgment day and
                            work is inaugurated, and its mission fulfilled, which requires a full and free confession of
                            the deeds, motives, and intentions of life, made by each and every member of the true
                            Christian Church ; the Church of the resurrection of the souls (not of the dead bodies) of
                            mankind, into the elements and power of an eternal soul life, and love, and liberty, to live
                            to (Jod in holiness, (set apart for a godly use,) and worship him in spirit and in truth. To
                            all such the day and work of judgment is come when they hear the gospel testimony, and by
                            its light and law judge themselves, confessing all their sins' These are they "whose sins go
                            before hand to judgment, and cannot follow after to condemnation." No other judgment day or
                            work, need they ever fear ; and to these shall the Christ who sitteth on the White "Cloud of
                            Witnesses" proclaim "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you."

                            of the aged, as well as of the youth in Zion. We thank you many times, loved Sister, for
                            your kind remembrance of our aged brothers and sisters, who are such a treasure to us,
                            although they are far down the side of the hill towards the setting sun; but sometimes
                            strange things occur, and some of those who are in the great thoroughfare of life's busy
                            throng find the chariot drawn by the white horse, Avaiting for them, and are forced to enter
                            it, and are carried swiftly by the aged and infirm to the final goal contrary to human
                            calculations. Hence it is wise for us all to heed the injunction, "Be ye also ready. " The
                            leading question to-day is, or should be,�how can Zion direct her efforts and use her
                            ability in a spiritual and temporal point of view to the best advantage, in building up and
                            sustaining the one great cause, for which, by profession at least, we have pledged our all!
                            What is life to us, if Zion is dishonored, her bulwarks destroyed and htr foundation
                            overthrown! Can temporal wealth, houses, lands or gold supply the soul's needs? Could all
                            that the natural generative relations, of father, mother, husband, wife and children give,
                            supply the lost treasure? Never! Those who seek pleasure in unrighteousness, will, in the
                            future as in the past, seek in vain. We have a deep and living hope, an abiding confidence,
                            that God is able to accomplish His own designs in the great work of human redemption,
                            whether wo poor mortals will it or not. It is true, we may hasten the work by our firm
                            adhereuce to gospel principles, and willingness to work with God, or we may retard, by
                            refusing to co-operate with the spirit; for men and women are the agents, through whom the
                            work is effected. But, if a few at the present time sell their birthright for the sordid
                            pleasures of a carnal life, others more noble, who have a deeper love of truth, will
                            purchase it by giving the price required ; and will come in and occupy a place in God's
                            spiritual temple and become shining lights therein. We are laborers in the Lord's vineyard ;
                            and if we can do the good Father's and Mother's will acceptably, we shall yield our will to
                            theirs, in obedience to their request, as we have done heretofore, rather than to miss the
                            blessing. The destiny of all the Societies of Believers is linked together in one chain of
                            brotherhood and sisterhood. If one suffers, all are pained ; if one prospers and is made
                            glad, then all rejoice. Love of earthly possessions, means by which creature comforts may be
                            obtained, has swallowed up the love of gospel simplicity in a great degree among Believers,
                            and the cxirrent of thought is turned more towards the world, to know what will be pleasing
                            and acceptable in their sight, than is towards the spiritual heavens, to pray for a renewal
                            of the pentecostal fires that will rebaptize us all with a hatred to the world and all its
                            lusts in our own hearts. In this respect we have all sinned to a greater or less degree, and
                            in proportion, "have come short of the glory of God "and the true resurrection power. Shall
                            we continue in this course is the question to be answered ! But, unless we conclude that the
                            earth sphere contains the all of life, and like the animals that are sroverned<pb n="174" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> by instinct, we eat, drink and die, without thought or care for the future,
                            then it seems to me, if Believers retain spiritual life and energy enough to rise and again
                            stand on their spiritual feet, they must return to the waymarks, (as far as principle is
                            concerned.) of the first founders of our institution, which gave them power and pre-eminence
                            over the world; Again we ask,�When and where will the great reform action commence? All mean
                            well; we all excuse ourselves, because A. B. and C want this and that and are unreconciled
                            if it is not provided for them, and we have no other means of obtaining it for them. Well,
                            let us watch closely and see if such members are not unreconciled after their demands are
                            supplied ! The plain truth is, there is no earthly thing that can fill the aching void, in a
                            soul that is destitute of the gift of God.

                            influence the material elements for good or evil�for man's benefit, or to his detriment? Is
                            a frost that is wide-spread, destroying the promise of one of the most fruitful seasons that
                            avc ever experienced, purely material, the simple operation of natural law ? Or are there
                            occult forces, spiritual laws, back of, or interior to it? Man is composed of the elemeuts
                            of two worlds, an exterior and an interior. His body and soul are focuses of the forces and
                            powers of both worlds. Again, his spirit may stand in relation to a third sphere or world.
                            His physical, intellectual and moral being may each draw life forces from their appropriate
                            world or sphere. The vital power of the man or woman is from the innermost to the outward
                            world. If we see a man's physical body expressing intense love and affection, or powerful
                            anger and rage, do we not at once recognize the fact that his soul is stirred within him and
                            that his spirit is the primary cause of the physical manifestation in his body? Why then
                            should we not refer an extraordinary exhibition of force in the external world, such as a
                            Cyclone, an Earthquake, a Whirlwind or a great flood or fire, in a similar manner, to the
                            inner worlds, of man's complex organism? If he move the even tenor of his way, in unison
                            with the laws of nature and the will of his God, wherefore should not all things work
                            together for good�the physical, the moral, the intellectual and the spiritual, all in
                            harmony ? If one plants and another reaps, rf one builds and another inhabits, if one
                            creates wealth and another possesses it, do we not realize that man, not God, is the cause
                            of this abnormal phenomena, and that when certain religious changes are wrought in man's
                            spirit, soul and body, they will cease? The teacher Moses, taught explicitly, that the
                            external world Avas an effect of a world of causation�that in all things it was subject to
                            that interior world. The blessings aud cursings Avere traced directly to man as a religious
                            and moral being�in his sphere a God. "If thou diligently j hearken unto the voice of the
                            Lord thy God, to do all his commandments, these blessings shall come upon thee. Blessed
                            shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field, in the fruit of<pb n="175" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> thy body and the fruit of thy ground, the fruit of thy cattle and the

                            all of this good was and is possible to the natural man�making the New Earth. "In
                            disobedience, the Lord shall send upon thee vexation and rebuke in all thou settest thy hand
                            unto. The pestilence shall cleave unto thee. Thou shalt be smitten with consumption, with
                            fever, with an inflamation, an extreme burning, with drought, blasting, mildew. The heaven
                            even over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thy feet shall be iron. The
                            Lord shall smite thee with the botch of Egypt, the emerods, the scab, the itch, whereof thou
                            canst not be healed, with madness, blindness and astonishment of heart, and thou shalt grope
                            at noon day as the blind grope in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways. Thou
                            shalt build a house and not dwell in it, plant a vineyard and not eat of the grapes thereof.
                            All thy trees and the fruit of thy land shall the locusts consume. The Lord shall bring upon
                            thee all the diseases of Egypt, make thy plagues wonderful, even great plagues and of long
                            continuance. Also every plague and every sickness that is not written in this book of the
                            Law, them will the Lord bring upon thee." These things apply to the natural man under the
                            law, "and when it shall come to pass, when all these things have come upon thee, if thou
                            shalt return to the Lord with all thy heart and all thy soul, and obey his voice and keep
                            his commandments, the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart to love the Lord thy God with
                            all thy soul, and thy neighbor as thyself, that thou mayest live. The word I speak is very
                            nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and iu thy heart and thou mayest do it. " This is at the end of
                            the law, an'l the beginning of a New Creation, New Heavens. Then cometh Christianity, in two
                            Dispensations, a First and a Second appearance of the Christ Spirit I ask, What are the
                            causes of our untimely frost? Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            fashioned into man, There Power ami Wisdom we can view, Names of the Everlasting Two. The
                            Father's high eternal throne Was never fill'd by one alone :<pb n="176" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>There
                            Wisdom holds the Mother's seat, And is the Father's helper-meet. This vast ereation was not
                            made Without the fruitful Mother's aid; For by the works of God we know The fountain-head
                            from which they flow. The Holy Spirit then did bear The anointed one, the second heir, A
                            virgin soul, a holy child, A Mother pure and undefiled: In her the heirship is complete, In
                            her the types and figures meet, And God's last building stands upon The sacred truth ot two
                            in one. The law and prophets all unite To seal this true eternal light; Two tables did the
                            law complete, Two cherubs on the mercy-seat, Two silver trumpets plainly show That gospel
                            truth proceeds from two : And though the priest one goat did slay, The second bore their
                            sins away. The order of eternal rest, Next by the temple was expressed : This building was
                            laid off in two, The one concealed from public view : Thus in the female and the male, The
                            flesh was still the parting vail: But when this vail is rent and gone, The building is
                            complete in one. The prophets saw in visions clear, By whom redemption would appear, That
                            "two anointed ones" would stand Before the God of all the land. Two olive trees supplied the
                            bowl, As life from Christ supplies the soul: And certain as the vision's true, The male and
                            female are the two. Ezekiel saw a river wide, With many trees on either side: The tree of
                            life appeared to John, And truly there were more than one ; On either side the tree was
                            seen, While living waters flow between � This'tree of life on either side, He calls the
                            Spirit and the Bride. We surely know by what we feel. Their leaves will yet the nations
                            heal: Ye lame and blind ye deaf and dumb, " The Spirit and the Bride say, come : " Let him
                            that heareth swell the sound, And let it go the nations round, That all who will their sins
                            forsake, May everlasting life partake.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In honor preferring one another" TEIform="index"/> In Honor Preferring One Another.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Pearson, Julia" TEIform="persName"/> JULIA PEARSON.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Should not this be the law written on our hearts where we could feel the importance of it

                            others in small matters. Of course we should not go contrary to the laws of Zion, or sin
                            against our consciences to please another ; but there are many things that are non-essential
                            to right and wrong that we push for, to the harm of our friend's peace of mind. Or we with

                            with peace and kind thoughts for all. Do we expect that our Heavenly Parents will not heed
                            our supplications before the throne of grace, because of our faults? Then why should we
                            disown any of our brothers or sisters as unworthy our thought and consideration for their
                            welfare even in little things? O, when shall we reach that state when we shall not allow a
                            slight from another to alter our tone and manner towards them ; when true love shall fill
                            our hearts to the exclusion of bitterness and strife throughout the Temple. Shirley, Mass.

                            write you a letter, beginning it on this calm Sabbath afternoon. The day is warm and light
                            clouds are sailing over the blue sky, sometimes intercepting the sun's rays for a few
                            moments and then continuing their course eastward across the pure, cerulian expanse. A
                            slight breeze stirs the green leaves of the trees, and the singing of the birds breaks the
                            stillness and dreamy monotony of the scene My dear friend, the immortality of the soul and a
                            wise efficient preparation for another and better life, are the most momentous questions
                            which can possibly engage the human mind. All otner interests sink into insignificance when
                            compared with the salvation of the soul and a final home among the saints of the Most High,
                            in that heaven "where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. " It is now
                            four o'clock and thirty three minutes, P.M. [ intended to write this letter very leisurely,
                            but as we have to be somewhat steadily on the wing, I shall have to finish it immediately,
                            or wait till I return from North Union. J.�if I were going to express in three words the
                            entire substance of Christ's evangel and the testimony which Mother Ann preached, those
                            three words would be, Love, Purity, Obedience. If you can thoroughly and practically become
                            imbued with these three virtues, not only will your salvation and acceptance with God be
                            insured, but all other virtues, such as patience, forgiveness, and concession be gradually
                            added to your already priceless treasures, and you will never regret the days of your life
                            on the earth. I know you cannot appreciate to their full extent the privilege of instruction
                            in holiness and peace and the faculties for the practice of the same which you enjoy in your
                            sequestered home. " What millions are lost in the dark, And carelessly run the broad road;
                            While you are secure in the ark, Whose great master builder is Uod. " Never be surprised at
                            any amount of suffering you may be called to endure and above all try to arm yourself with
                            patience and to believe that you are just as worthy of victory and blessing as any one.
                            Never become disheartened. Now while I will not so cruelly deceive you as to try to make you
                            think the path of virtue is one of unalloyed pleasure, flowers without thistles, roses
                            without thorns, yet here I will give you two rules which the young do not generally know,
                            because it has to be many long years in coming into their experience. " The path of sorrow
                            and that path alone, Leads to that land where sorrows are unknown." This is the first rule
                            and is worth its weight in gold. The second is, Though we must meet many temptations and
                            trials and even sorrows, yet in our travel to the celestial mansions we shall find that the
                            scenes oi suffering will come to be farther and farther apart and continue for shorter and
                            shorter periods, while the scenes of peace and tranquil enjoyment will occur nearer and
                            nearer together, until a serene and continuous heaven eventually results as the fruits of
                            all our toil and self-sacrifice. You will see that I have written this letter as a kind of
                            guide along the road of what I presume will be your future experience. We are in a state of
                            ordinary prosperity. Your Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hampton, O. C." TEIform="persName"/> O.

                            single hypocrite. " Of all the metals which nature has so kindly provided for our use, gold
                            seems most precious, yet gold in the quartz, in its crude natural state is good for naught,
                            it must be dug from the mines, and cleansed, refined and separated from all the impurities
                            connected with it, after being tried in �the furnace and going through the various processes
                            of puiificatiou, lo ! it comes forth a pure solid mas-, bright, shining and valuable. On
                            reflection the mind draws a comparison on this wise. Every human being endowed with an
                            immortal soul is a lump of Gold. Not purified and cleansed, but gold in its native state ;
                            in the rocks and mountains. Closely adhered to this human gold, are clumps of earth, pieces
                            of rock and indeed it is so covered with other substances that it would require great care
                            to ascertain if there were really any gold there at all. Consequently there is a great work
                            to be done, much labor to be performed, for all the evils with which mankind are troubled
                            and subjected too, are more or less like this earth, quartz, and unnecessary attachment to
                            the bit of gold from which a separation must be made. Put the metal in the crucible of
                            truth, over the furnace of affliction, and the work of regeneration, the cleansing and
                            refining has begun. Realizing this, all who wish to beeome a lump of pure gold, why not
                            begin at once? If evil habits have been formed, why not break them up and form those which
                            are new. There has been counterfeit gold, and probably is some now, yet are there not
                            counterfeit characters, alas how many ? But gold is gold, and in the end it will prove so.
                            There are sound truth's in every religion, yet in how great a degree covered up and cloaked
                            under a false theology. The simple Christianity taught by Jesus, and practiced by so few,
                            was the pure gold. It did not pei'ish nor grow dim, for the work which Jesus proclaimed in
                            his first appearing, was clearly elucidated, and gloriously revealed by Mother Ann Lee, in
                            his second appearing, without sin unto salvation. Those who embrace her gospel and obey its
                            teachings, are gradually becoming the choicest gold. Let the doubting come and see. Gold is
                            gold, if will show for itself. Mystery, deceit and fraud, do � not constitute a Christian,
                            but those who stand in the light, who speak truly, act nobly, and live godly. These are the
                            best, the pure gold, whose value is not diminished, and whose lustre is forever untarnished.

                            in all things. The following incident took place some years ago which is worthy of note. He
                            had been presiding Elder many years, at White Water Village, Hamilton County, Ohio. On his
                            return home to Mt. Lebanon, he called at North Union, which is a half-way house, between the
                            two remote Villages. While at the table one of the sisters asked him what he would like for
                            drink? Water, cold water; said he. Is that all?<pb n="180" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>That is all. She was
                            surprised She began to expostulate with him. Would it not l&gt;e better to heat the

                            What shall I do to make it better? Nothing ' It is good enough. The venerable patriarch,
                            modestly replied. Just let it be, as God made it. I do not think you can make any
                            improvement on God's work.

                            R.] Shirley, Mass. Apr. 1884. Dear Brother ;�In answer to your question, Why the Shakers do
                            not marry, I would say; *ve have many reasons why we do not. First, Because we regard the
                            teachings of Christ as being of the utmost importance, and he very emphatically says, "that
                            they who are counted worthy of that world neither marry nor are given in marriage. " And if
                            any one love father or mother or houses or land, yea, his own life more than me, he is
                            unworthy of me. And you will find that the example of both Christ and St. Paul and their
                            teachings establish the fact beyond dispute that a celibate life is more in harmony with
                            Christian duty and the requirement of the Gospel. Second, The mind kept free from carnal
                            desires is capable of rising to a higher and holier state of devotion. The soul approaches
                            nearer the beatitude of angelic life when the pure stream of consecration is untainted by
                            the animal propensities. The Shakers are not the originators of this doctrine. They accept
                            the teaching of Christ, practically, and thus become not only hearers, but doers of the
                            word, and is it not more noble in the Christian Soldier to take up arms and fight against
                            the Lusts of the flesh than it is to submit to this insidious enemy of our peace, and of our
                            soul's salvation? I am aware that many try to throw a roseate hue, about the married life,
                            but God knows and he only how many are groaning under matrimonial burdens. Whence come
                            suicides, broken homes and broken hearts? Ask the gray haired sire whose son sets him at
                            defiance or whose daughter sets at nought his parental authority. The power of the Beast
                            should have no dominion over us. It is against this gigantic evil, this wholesale slaughter
                            that the Shaker takes his stand. Against the reading of lewd stories that inflames the
                            imagination. Against the indiscriminate marriage, which binds two uncongenial natures, two
                            antagonistic spirits to fight life's battle out as best they may; against all such things
                            the Shaker lifts his voice. And such will continue to be the case until the pulpit and press
                            and men in high places cry mightily against this hydra headed monster, (Sen.sunlity,) even
                            if it does wear the mask of matrimony. It is even so. Dear Brother, be not deceived " Evil
                            communications corrupt good manners. " When I look upon my gospel relation I rejoice to know
                            that there ar? so many, at least, who have given their hearts to religion and to God.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Rhodes, J. E." TEIform="persName"/> J. E.

                            stood as embassador for, or Gorl, as supreme rider over the earth. Moses was pronounced God
                            to Pharaoh, to Aaron and to the tribes. The Prophets had the word of God, as Jesus stated,
                            the Psalmist said "They were called Gods to whom the word of God came. " One of the Quaker
                            sisters now came and sat by my side, saying ; " I want to hear all you�ay." "Please tell me
                            of your government, for I know nothing about you." We explained to her, two males and two
                            females form the several orders as the Ministry, Elders and Trustees^ and that these
                            officers ruled among their own sex. She raised her hands, exclaiming,�"Good, male and female
                            government, like ourselves ;" and add ing, " I like your explanation. " They were not
                            offended at this plain talk and many seemed to give it a candid hearing. We then stepped to
                            a company that were discussing the creation. By invitation we took part and argued it as
                            true. On closing, all thanked us for throwing light upon a dark subject. It was now the hour
                            for meeting. We ware permitted to attend what they called a social gathering, to hear
                            reports from other Quarterly meetings. Again solicited to speak, we remarked. We came here
                            determined neither to interfere with your theology, nor press our own upon others. We
                            believe the difference of theological views has been the most fruitful source of division,
                            bitterness, hatred and destructive feeling of any evil that ever cursed professed
                            Christianity. It has produced more darkness and spiritual death, than all the other causes
                            put together. We claim the right to declare, there is no person who accepts a higher degree
                            of adoration for the character, standing and Godlike qualities of Jesus, the Lord of the New
                            Creation than we do. This perhaps is saying enough on this matter. The Spirit of Worship. We
                            have greatly reverenced the spirit which hii;* pervaded this assembly. We know the still
                            small voice of the spirit of worship, and have felt it present at these gatherings ; without
                            it, worship is a dead formality ; with it all are clothed with the spirit of devotion.
                            Consecration . There is a striking similarity between your fraternity and ours. As we
                            entered your village, and observed many gathering here, and saw the ample provision marie
                            for their comfort; as we listened to the kindly greetings and words of welcome uttered, we
                            were strongly reminded of the first Christian consecration, after the day of Pentecost, and
                            the witnesses who gathered in mountains and valleys to extend and share their scant temporal
                            blessings, and the more abundant stores and comforts, shared in common among our own people,
                            who,by following the Christ spirit, have long mingled together and shared all things in
                            common. Simplicity of Dkess. The plainness and simplicity of dress handed down by Heaven's
                            own inspiration from spirits of light, to cause a separation between God's people and a
                            proud lost world, to strongly rebuke the fashion, folly and extravagance of sinful men,
                            which was to have been kept sacred and unbroken, is a sign to all. In looking at both
                            people, we think it must be said, that we have been the<pb n="182" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/>most plain and
                            uniform, and have best carried out the original intention. The Resurrection. Both you and we
                            hold similar views respecting the Resurrection. We have both written and preached to the
                            world, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. That it is the spirit, and
                            nothing but the spirit, that holds and will share this eternal birthright. On War. In the
                            late war, when our non-resistant principles were unheeded and our conscientious views were
                            set aside, as a last appeal, we offered our prayers to the Rulers at Washington ; and when
                            we appeared there, we found our Quaker friends, who in petitioning for their Christian
                            rights, made common cause with us; and depending on a higher power, we both came off
                            victorious. Silent Worship. You silently worship, after the example of the primitive
                            Christians. Jesus told his disciples to tarry in Jerusalem, till they were inspired with
                            power from on high. The; obeyed, and retired in an upper chamber to pray iu sorrow and
                            silence. This spiritual power brought in by the Comforter, jell upon them, accompanied by
                            one of the most important manifestations ever given in primitive days. All will do well to
                            remember, it was a God-given gift, administered to them in silent worship. Jesus had told
                            twelve illiterate disciples, who could speak nothing but the Hebrew tongue, and that very
                            imperfectly, "to go into all the world and preach the gospel. " The mighty question must
                            have come up with fear and force, how are we to do it? But when, with a sound, like a mighty
                            rushing wind, this holy fire fell upon them, like cloven tongues, and they began to speak in
                            other languages, it remained a mystery no longer. When the Jews from the temple came as a
                            multitude to listen and learn, unbelievers scoffed and tried to smother the flame, by
                            crying,�delusion and intemperance. But the fire of God's truth, had with the word, entered
                            many honest hearts ; devout Jews from fifteen different nations who inquired : '' How is it,
                            that we hear these illiterate Gallileans speaking to us in our own tongues, wherein we were
                            born?" This started the primitive church. Jesus said, We have come to bring fire on earth,
                            and what if it be already kindled! This fire brought in by Jesus was now gloriously kindled
                            ; language was given to meet the occasion ; and by this language inspired by the spirit of
                            God, it spread over the earth. Friends, we have said there were strong points of resemblance
                            between us. We will speak of one more and close. Both churches have kept very far from
                            outsiders, we think we are both at fault here ; but both are becoming more liberal, open and
                            inviting; you in holding your awakening gatherings, and we in publishing our testimony to
                            show the world just where we are. Let both toil on, until we come to a full knowledge cf the
                            truth, as it was in Jesus. Please receive a good portion of our best love. Extend to your
                            good Brethren and Sisters, Farewell till we meet in some heavenly place.

                            was exercised in religious impressions, and thought much about God, and " I believed" said
                            he, "that God was all holy, righteous and good, and that I must be so too, or never see his
                            face in peace." This form of simple faith he maintained with great care throughout his long
                            and eventful life. His parents, William and Mercy Bates, were members of the Presbyterian
                            churchIn this they were honorable and honest and brought up their children in the admonition
                            of the Lord. The Sabbath was kept after the order of the Puritan fathers, and the atendance
                            upon the church, the learning of the creed, prayers, catechisms and hymns faithfully
                            attended to as a protective influence against the suffering of a day of Judgment. His
                            parents were devout readers of the Bible, and as would be expected anxiously looked forward
                            to be witnesses of the wonders that would appear in the heavens and of the signs that would
                            be seen on the earth. The children partook of the same spirit, and with the parents became
                            witnesses of the wonderful displays of God's power. Among these signs was a remarkable
                            exhibition of the Northern Lights, which night after night, for weeks flashed over the
                            heavens and appeared like a flaming fire. Then came a comet which for many nights was as red
                            as blood. Other signs were observed which spread terror among the people and they looked for
                            the sudden appearance of the judgment day. Some one had seen a vision of two angels
                            descending from heaven. The first cried, " Watchmen what of the night? What of the night?"
                            To which the answer was given. ''Midnight! midnight!!" The second angel then cried aloud. "
                            What of the times? What of the times?" and received for answer, " Doleful times ! doleful
                            times !! For the judgment of God shall begin in old England and shall spread into New
                            England, and there shall be wars, and great calamities, and darkness shall cover the land. "
                            A man who was a professed Deist often visited the family of Wm. Bates, and made sport of all
                            these wonderful signs so that Issachar writes. " This took off a part of the sharp edge of
                            my fright, but still I kept a good look out. " "In May 1773 General Gage landed his army in
                            Boston, and all the conversation to be heard was about the war. Every man that was able to
                            lift a gun and every boy that was large enough to c rry a few sticks of wood, were also
                            learning war. " Issachar now obtained a fife and a large part of the time was spent in
                            becoming familiar with some martial tune. " When the minute men were called out to be in
                            readiness, I went to fife for them." He accompanied them to Boston, but his father soon
                            requested him to return home, which was a sad disappointment to his youthful mind. At the
                            age of seventeen, by consent of his father he enlisted under Captain Dexter and was accepted
                            as a fifer. He was subsequently promoted to fife major and although no other duty was
                            demanded of him in the army, he says he often as a point of kindness took the place of a
                            comrade in going out on scouts, on fatigue and on the watch. Speaking of himself as a
                            soldier, he says, "I always did my duty in the war like a man, and never received an unkind
                            word from an officer. " Issachar was generous, kind and mirthful, and easily made friends
                            wherever he went. He says lie could " sing about every song that was generally known whether
                            civil, military, sacred or profane." ' This experience in the war was written long after
                            Issachar became a Christian man, and was more for the satisfaction of others than as a
                            pleasure to himself. It was a matter that belonged to the past, and he looked upon it as did
                            Solomon on some of his own doings, ' This also is vanity. ' In May 1775 he was with a
                            company of rangers and stationed in open view of Boston and also of the old Somerset, a 70
                            gun ship, belonging to the British. "I now find, said he, that nothing remained but for me
                            to shut my eyes and harden my heart, and enter fully into the school of vice, in<pb n="184" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> which, alas, I was not slow to learn. " They remained at this place all
                            Summer and were often treated to some of the balls from the old war ship. What at first had
                            been very annoying to the soldiers, after a while became a matter of sport and the soldier
                            would dig the balls from the ground, load them upon a wheelbarrow and take them to Gen.
                            Putnam who liberally compensated the men by sending back some rum. " On the seventeenth of
                            June we were ordered to take fort at the foot of the hill by Mystic river, between Charles
                            town and Boston and there stand openly exposed to the balls of the Somerset, the Glasgow
                            Frigate and to three floating Batteries. " Issachar says that the company were obliged to
                            take a full share of the British, pot metal, grape and canister shot. The horrors of the
                            day, however, were exceeded by those of the night. The American army retreated just at the
                            close of the day, when the enemy, in their hatred, threw hot shells into Cliarlestown and
                            destroyed that beautiful place. The army passed from Bunker Hill to Prospect Hill and began
                            to fortify this latter place. To prevent this the British began immediately to bombard the
                            place, and continued so to do till the fort was completed. Issachar says, "I could see their
                            great nasty porridge pots flying through the air, crammed as full of evil as they could
                            hold. They had blue tails in the day time and fiery tails in the night. Sometimes these
                            would burst in the air and at other times on the ground. In either case they made fearful
                            havoc with whatever stood in the way.

                            is there any connection between what we call education, and what we define as religion? In
                            reflecting on this subject my mind has been directed to an article lately published in a
                            religious paper written by one of our clearest thinkers, in which he says :� So far as we
                            can judge by a large induction of facts, there is no action ot the Divine Mind upon the
                            human, except in the line of already established powers and faculties. There is no result
                            produced, except such as can be produced by arousing the faculties already there to
                            extraordinary power and efficiency. So that the Divine Mind is not attempting to make up
                            something lacking in the structure of the human mind; but simply seeking to develop latent
                            energy in powers that are already provided. It amounts to giving man the benefit of the
                            whole power of his own mind, in a sublime way, to be sure; but somewhat after the manner
                            that a teacher helps his pupil. How? Not by thinking for him, nor, in a literal sense,
                            thinking in him ; but by bringing the stimulating power of his thinking part to bear upon
                            the child's, and waking up its dormant capacity, and making the child think; not
                            dispossessing the child's intellectual nature; but simply making the child use its nature to
                            accomplish the things desired There are many persons Mrho seem to think that the human soul
                            is like a stereoscopic box and that the Divine Spirit takes truths which have been framed
                            outside of the box, and slides into the soul those pictures of truth which it had no hand in
                            making, and which it only sees when put into it. There is no evidence of any such results
                            framed by the Divine Mind. In other words, there is no evidence that God dispossesses the
                            mind, or considers it incompetent for the results which it was designed to produce. In
                            speaking of the Bible heroes, particularly of Moses, this same writer says, " Could any one
                            but Moses have done the works of Moses ? He was organized and educated to be Moses, and no
                            one else; He was educated in " all the wisdom of the Egyptians. " And when the spirit of God
                            rested upon him, his wonderful administrative power, (covering a breadth perhaps never
                            equalled, certainly never surpassed) it was the Divine Spirit simply acting upon an
                            organization already prepared and educated for the work. Massive browed was he Large
                            universality was he. The comprehensiveness, the foresight, the complexity and wisdom of his
                            mind, the whole knowledge of life, and society, and of<pb n="185" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>men, manifested
                            by the great law-giver of the desert�these were brought forth, and developed by the Spirit
                            of God in him. They were not created without regard to his education and his organization.
                            It was so with Paul. He was trained and educated in the school of Gamaliel, one of the most
                            learned and scholastic of the Jewish liabbi?. When he said that he counted all his
                            intellectual attainments but dross that he might win Christ, did he mean to say that they
                            had no influence in enabling him to perform his great mission among the Gentiles? that Paul
                            would have been the same Paul still, although all his previous years had been spent as a
                            humble fisherman, on the sea of Galilee? We think not; and believe, could he now speak from
                            what he has since learned, he would say so. To come down to our times. If we look at the
                            history of those who have been the most useful to men, and the most devoted to God, shall we
                            not find that by a providential training and education they have been prepared for the work
                            that was before them ; and have they not always been ready to acknowledge the Divine hand in
                            thus training them for thevrork they had to do? Among the noble men and women who went forth
                            in the cause of the abolition of slavery, can we not see tliat a previous training and
                            education had prepared them for the work, or it would not have been accomplished? Mrs.
                            Stowe, in speaking of her book, " Uncle Tom's Cabin, " said, " I could not rest day nor
                            night while that work was on my hands. It seemed as if I was awakened by a voice in the dead
                            hours of the night, saying, "Get up ! work for the slaves. It is the God of those who are
                            groaning in bondage who is calling you. Get up, and do your work ! I will help you ! " And
                            how had she been prepared and educated for that work? Accustomed from a child to read of the
                            sufferings of the slaves, with the blood of the Puritans in her veins, and their fire in her
                            heart, she was always planning some means to eifect their liberation. She developed under
                            the highest culture, and ripened, in mind when the times were ripest for action. She
                            emigrated early to the west, where she had opportunity to see all that her pen afterward
                            portrayed in cuch glowing colors; ard was enabled to indite the work that was to thrill the
                            nation's heart to its core, and was translated into nearly all the languages of Europe. Who
                            shall say that she was not thus providentially prepared and educated for the great and
                            momentous mission before her? But, perhaps, it will be asked, " Is not anti-slavery and
                            abolitionism one thing, and religion another? And here I am reminded of a question asked by
                            an eminent Boston clergyman, directed to the Rev. Theodore Parker. " Do you think that
                            Benjamin Franklin was a Christian? I do not; lean find no evidence in all his writings that
                            he was a converted man, or that he believed in Christ and him crucified to the saving of his
                            soul. " Parker replied, "If to go to meeting on Sunday, and to make long prayers to atone
                            for the sins of the week, if to eat sacramental bread in the meeting house, and to be
                            baptized with holy water, and to sing pious psalms through your nose, for your own
                            edification; then to go home and whip your children for laughing on Sunday, as I was
                            whipped; if all this is religion, then Franklin had none. He was worse than an infidel. But
                            if religion be to do justly, love mercy, and to walk humbly with God; if it be to love God
                            with all the mind, and heart, and soul, and one's neighbor as one's self; if it be to
                            forgive injuries, to do good to all men, to protect the needy, clothe the naked, instruct
                            the ignorant, feed the hungry, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, to
                            lift up the fallen, to break the rod of the'oppressor, and let the oppressed go free, and at
                            heart endeavor to keep one's self unspotted from the world; if such things as these,
                            practiced, make a man a Christian ; then Franklin must stand high on the list. If they do
                            not, then it is of no consequence who is called Christian, or Pagan, or Turk." Canaan, N.

Its mission the word of God
                            and its baptism the testimony of divine light. The Church and the World can never enter into
                            harmonious relations, as the life of one depends upon its living testimony, the spirit of
                            truth, while the other fulfills the desires of the flesh ani of the mind. Jesus taught most
                            emphatically that his disciples were not of the world any more than he was of the world, ft
                            was their privilege to walk in a new wav, in the light and to become the sons and daughters
                            of God. The separation which was demanded was so marked that those who were baptized into
                            the spirit and were able to take up their crosses and become faithful disciples were hated
                            of the world and counted as among those that were dead. " For ye are dead, and your life is
                            hid with Christ in God." All of this came through the preaching of the cross. Jesus as a man
                            and iu his relations among men was evidently held iu high esteem, as the disciples have been
                            i'rce to leave on record this pleasing remark. " He increased in wisdom and statue, and in
                            favor with God and man." The same may be said of those Avho have accepted his form of life.
                            They grow in favor with God and man. The line of separation is always the doctrine of the
                            cross. This the apostle defines very clearly in his remarks to the Galatians,�"God forbid
                            that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
                            crucified unto me and I unto the world." This separation between the Church and the World
                            was so distinct that it became impossible for one to live in the element of the other. The
                            sons of Light and the sons of Belial cannot maintain a relation that will harmonize. That
                            which stimulates the life and growth of the first, as effectually produces death and decay
                            in the last. In its true order the Church is the representative of a life of regeneration r
                            while the world knows only the life of generation. Jesus as a reward to his disciples,
                            promises them the blessings of eternal life if they will follow him in this work of
                            regeneration, and gives to them the assurance of an hundred fold reward in the treasures of
                            this life, if they will, as God's servants, forsake their selfish interest and become
                            members of his spiritual Order. Many professors readily admit that the Church and the World
                            are distinct elements ; that they are ever at variance., and yet at the same time they work
                            diligently to blend the two orders into one so that the so called Church of Christ, instead
                            of being a light to the whole world becomes more directly a place of confusion. The Church
                            of Christ establishes peace and good will among men, while the world encourages the spirit
                            of war and bloodshed. Any attempt at the amalgamation of these opposite influences must
                            always be attended with disappointment. Christ's people are not of the world. Their life and
                            prosperity depends largely upon their faithfulness in accepting the spirit of God.

                                        and one who eats too little from a sentimental notion that it is vulgar to eat;
                                        and that the less one can eat, and still manage to live, the more refined and
                                        spiritual one becomes. If a man has no control over his appetite, and no
                                        judgment as to the quantity of food he requires, it would have been better had
                                        he belonged to a lower order of animals, subject to the control of a higher
                                        intelligence. Neglect or refusal to partake of sufficient food to sustain the
                                        body in its full vigor should be regarded as evidence of disease, requiring the
                                        attention of a competent physician. Nature will not patiently submit to be
                                        abused or cheated. The quantity and the quality of food required in each
                                        individual case depends on the size and health of the person and on his
                                        occupation. A person of sedentary habits should regulate the diet to the
                                        requirements of the system, remembering that it is safer to err on the side of
                                        eating hardly enough than too much. Over-eating produces accumulation of fat,
                                        which is a disease of itself, and increases the quantity of blood, rendering one
                                        liable to heart disease and apoplexy; and paradoxical as it may seem,
                                        insufficient food tends to produce the same diseases. Either condition causes
                                        derangements in the circulation that may induce the same troubles. If we follow
                                        the indications uf nature we are safe as to foods. What the appetite craves is
                                        usually best for us; the stomach notifies us when we require food, and when we
                                        have eaten enough. It is often the last mouthful that invites an attack of
                                        dyspepsia. " Variety is the spice of life. " In nothing is this more applicable
                                        than as to foods. Select a list of foods that experience has taught us are most
                                        acceptable, and then from the list get a variety for each day of the week. Salt
                                        meats should be used sparingly, because they are more indigestible than tresh.
                                        Pies and rich puddings try the digestive organs severely, and cannot be safely
                                        indulged in by adults, except they have vigorous out-door exercise. The quantity
                                        and quality of food should depend upon what is required of the individual; just
                                        as the amount of fuel requisite depends on the work a steam engine has to
                                        perform. A wise regulation of the food supply cap be made to supersede the use
                                        of medicines to a very great extent. The remote cause of a majority of our
                                        ordinary ailments is taking cold; the natural functions of the body are retarded
                                        and waste material is retained in the system long enough to do mischief. The
                                        usual remedy is to take a cathartic or a laxative in order to remove it. But a
                                        more convenient and a more natural plan, in ordinary cases, is to cut off the
                                        food supply for twenty-four hours, and trust to nature to do the rest. Instead
                                        of food, a few tea-cupfuls of hot water drank during the day will hasten the
                                        desired result. Whenever the bowels become constipated there is an uncomfortable
                                        feeling in the system, often accompanied by restlessness and anxiety of mind.
                                        The above suggestions, if followed strictly, will bring relief more promptly
                                        than medicine, and without its inconveniences. On the other hand, there is a
                                        class of persons who are borne down by constant fear of eating too much, and who
                                        are ever anxious lest what they are compelled to eat in order to sustain life
                                        may do mischief. It would not be inappropriate to speak of such people as "
                                        dietetic cranks. " They are probably the most unreasonable and troublesome
                                        patients the practicing physician has to deal with. If he favors their theories,
                                        there can be no improvement, and if he opposes them he loses their confidence
                                        and their patronage. There is as much ill health caused by underfeeding as by
                                        overfeeding. The man who has lived too freely may generally moderate<pb n="188" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/>Iiis course and regain his health; but through a long course of
                                        semi-starvation the digestive organs become weakened, and the stomach contracts
                                        so that it cannot properly perform its work; the body cannot be sufficiently
                                        nourished. These abnormal conditions generally result from mismanagement during
                                        childhood. The child who is restricted to Ihree meals a day comes to the table
                                        with a ravenous appetite, and with the certainty that a long fast awaits him
                                        after he has finished his repast. These two incentives nat urally lead to
                                        gluttony. The child who is permitted to eat what ever he wishes, at all times,
                                        becomes the vie tim of disease, because an unnatural appetite is formed, and he
                                        craves those things that de range the digestive organs, but contain but little
                                        nourishment. No child was ever injured by plain and wholesome food, no matter
                                        how freely or how often it may have been partaken of. When a child is a year old
                                        it should be allowed a pretty wide discretion as to foods of this sort. Three
                                        meals a day are not sufficient for children. All the operations of the system
                                        are more active than with the adult, and the food supply requires more frequent
                                        replenishing. Allow children to eat of plain, wholesome food, as often as ihey
                                        desire to, if you wish to escape responsibility for impaired health, which is
                                        certain to follow a strict adherence to absurd rules tespecting diet. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Hall's journal of health" TEIform="index"/> Hair s Journal of Health. </bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="When the mists have cleared away" TEIform="index"/> WHEN THE MISTS HAVE CLEARED AWAY.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">"When the mists have rolled in splendor From the beauty of the hills And the

                                This is an important subject, and one that is attracting so much attention at this time,
                                as to render the rational consideration of it seasonable. This book gives the reason why
                                some articles oi' diet are better than others, more economical as well us more
                                healthful. It opens with tables showing the constituent elements of different articles
                                of food; the relation of food to physical development as well as to intellect
                                and,moral?. Wheat and oilier cereals are compared, and especially whole -wheat and white
                                flour, presenting a strong argument in favor of the former. Fruits and vegetables come
                                in for a share of consideration, as also the question of meat as an article of diet,
                                which is not considered favorably, especially the eating of pork. The relation of sugar,
                                salt, and other condiments is taken up from a somewhat new and radical stand-point. What
                                to drink and why it is viewed as an important question; aiwj a very valuable part of the
                                book relates to food combinations, in which it is shown that there are some articles of
                                diet that cannot be partaken of at the same meal with good results. Closing with
                                dietetic rules, hints on cooking, etc., it is not on that account a book of recipes. All
                                who would eat for health and strength should read it. Handsomely published, it is
                                certainly cheap at 25 cents, and will be sent by mail, prepaid, on receipt of the amount

                            our friend John Bain, whose heroic death occurred in rescuing the Stewardess of the ill
                            fated SteamShip State of Florida, of which he was the Chief Engineer. After getting into the
                            boat after the collision, he saAv the Stewardess Jane McFarhne, on the deck of the sinking
                            ship ; he had the boat put back, but the timid woman refused to get into it. He leaped upon
                            the sinkingvessel and by main force tossed her into the boat. But before he could get off,
                            the ship gave a lurch, and carried him �down to a watery grave. So perished our noble
                            friend. The despairing cry of a helpless woman touched his heroic heart; lost to every
                            thought of self or danger, amidst that terrible crash, and the midnight darkness of the
                            lonely sea, Iiis noble soul went up to his Maker, a bright example in this self-seeking
                            world, of god-like self-sacrifice. The tender memories of such heroic men, has a
                            strengthening influence for .good upon our lives. The last time I saw him, three months s'go
                            he spoke of you and expressed a wish to again pay you a visit; I think we would have come up
                            your way this Summer had he been spared. My dear friend I often think of you, and of the
                            life work you and others are engaged in. If you could have some of the younger members of
                            your community write your recollections, it would be a matter of great interest, and incite
                            some to persevere and carry out any good work. I would be pleased to have a few lines from
                            you at any time. I am happy to say my family, and myself are well.

                            which involved your lamented Friend Bain, is one of the most terrible on record. By his
                            selfpossession, and self-sacrifice, he is already a historical character. No doubt in the
                            unseen world he will be met by friends who will do him honor. On his visit here, with
                            yourself, he impressed me that there was force in him. Should he turn to the right or to the
                            left, something would be done. Under that impression, I spoke a few words to him. A visit
                            from yourself, will be very acceptable. With this 1 will mail a Number of our paper. It
                            contains an article "Eternal Life." Our young friend Bain, is gone ; by and by, it will be
                            said of us, " gone too. " Life is an invisible force. Force, is eternal, and also invisible.
                            Even steam is, till it becomes vapor. All creative forces are invisible. Our own persDuality
                            is also so. The steam engine is the creation of the unseen man. It can do a thousand fold
                            more work, and with greater precision than can the animal who is said to be the person who
                            made it. The real personality of man is like his Creator. Indeed all the forces of life are
                            invisible. The Strawberry for instance ; there is in it a living invisible force,
                            commissioned by i',s Creator to manipulate the inorganic elements to suit its own wants, as
                            does the Cocoauut tree. Why is a Cocoanut not a Strawberry ? The answer is ; Why is an apple
                            parer not a locomotive�They are the products of unseen intelligent personalities ; causing
                            these plants, and ma-<pb n="192" id="p28" TEIform="pb"/>chines, to accomplish special designs and to meet
                            specific conditions. The sphere of thought, of man's invisible personality, widens as he
                            thinks when unlimited by earthly conditions, the possibilities involved in his destiny are
                            beyond comprehension. Therefore, to die, is to live. The article alluded to, is based upon,
                            "The Problem of Individual Life." the last chapter of that wonderful book, "Poverty and
                            Progress. " It is a Revelation. And like all other :evelations, it appeared when most
                            needed. I feel assured that the Author, has been led on and supported by unseen
                            intelligencies, to justify the ways of God to man, and to upset the materialistic theories
                            of modern political economists. Desiring that a just civilization may supersede the one we
                            now have�of force and fraud ; and that a divine Order of human society may find shelter
                            under its wings. I have the happiness to be, respectfully, your friend,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><index level1="Fraser, D." TEIform="index"/>D.

A THEILLING EPISODE.
A Iiocoinotiw Engineer's   Instinct�
How toe Saved a train anil bo�
he Saved Himself.
On one of the darkest and stormiest nights
of the recent unusual winter, the express on
one of the leading New York railroads was
moving westward from Albany. The engine's headlight threw a strong reflection in
advance, but the storm was so blinding it was
almost impossible to distinguish anything
even at a short distance. Under such circumstances instinct necessarily takes the place of
sight. All seemed to be going well, when,
in an instant, the engineer reversed his engine, applied the air brakes, and came to a
full stop. Why he did so he could not tell
any more than any of us can account for the
dread of coming disaster and death, and to the
wondering inquiry of his fireman he simply
said: "I feel that something's wrong.'1
Seizing a lantern he swung himself down from'
the cab and went forward to investigate.
Everything appeared to be right, and he was
about to return to his engine when his eye
caught sight of a peculiar appearance at the
joint of the rail next to him. Brushing the
accumulated snow away, he looked a moment,
and then uttered an exclamation of horror.
The rails on both sides had been unspL;::!
and would have turned over the instr.nt the
engine touched them. What inspired this at.
tempt at train-wrecking is unknown, but it was
presumed the confederates of some prisoners
who were on the train hoped, in the confusion of an accident,  to deliver their friends
Engineer John Donohoe, of Albany, to
whose wonderful instinct was due the salvation of the train, when asked by the writer
why he stopped his engine, said :
"I can't tell why. I only know I felt
something was wrong. "
" Do you have these feelings often when
upon the road? " continued the writer.
"No, very seldom, although for the past
twenty years I have been in a condition to
feel apprehension at almost anything. "
" How is that? "
" Why. I have been a victim of one of the
worst cases of dyspepsia ever known.    I have
uot been confined to my bed, as like thousands of others, I was compelled to work
whether able or not. Indeed, when it first
began I had only a loss of appetite, a faint
feeling that would not go away and a bad
taste in the mouth, but I finally got those terrible craving and gnawing feelings that make
life so unbearable and are known as general
debility. "
" What did you do?"
" I tried physicians until I became discouraged. I gave eight different ones fair tests,
but none of them benefited me. I the.i tried
proprietary medicines, but they failed, likewise. It looked pretty dark for me so far as
any more peace or enjoyment in "this world
were concerned and I became terribly discouraged. "
" You certainly do not look that way now. '
" Oh, no, indeed, I am in perfect health
now, " was the -eply " and I propose to continue so. My nervousness is entirely gone ;
I can sleep nights ; the aching numbness has
disappeared; the pale, sickly appearance has
given place to the color of health, and I have
readily put on flesh. This is what has been
accomplished by means of Warner's Tippecanoe. If I can be cured after a chronic illness of nearly a quarter of a century I believe
all suffering in a similar manner can be restored by using the same remedy. "
Such is the testimony of a man who could
detect and remove unseen danger on the
road but could not remove the dangers from
within his own system until brought face to
face with the great preparation above named
which did so much for him and can do as
much for ull those w,ho require it.

BREAKFAST.
"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and
by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast
tables with a delicately flavored beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist
every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever
there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood
and a properly nourished frame. "�Civil Serrice Gazette.
