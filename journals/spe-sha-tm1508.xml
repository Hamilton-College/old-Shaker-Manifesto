John Parrington.</head><p TEIform="p"> In consequence of an extraordinary revival of religion which took place at New Lebanon in
                            the summer of 1779, and extended through the neighboring towns, I was brought into a deep
                            labor of mind concerning my own salvation. In this revival I diligently attended the
                            meetings, and was much engaged in religious exercises, by which I was greatly awakened to
                            pray earnestly to God for deliverance from sin and from the nature of evil; but no
                            deliverance could I find. I closely observed the operations of this revival; but could not
                            find that it wrought any abiding effect upon its subjects. I therefore diligently searched
                            the scriptures, prayed to God, and confessed my sins to Him alone in secret places. But all
                            this produced no abiding comfort; for I found that in all my labors and struggles I could
                            not obtain any victory over sin ; nor could I see any among the subjects of the revival that
                            appeared in any better situation, as t� religion, than myself. Notwithstanding all my
                            experience in the illuminations of the Divine Spirit, and all the flattering encouragements
                            of many old professors, who earnestly endeavored to persuade me that I was a Christian and
                            an heir of salvation, my feelings were not satisfied. I felt myself unworthy of the name of
                            a Christian, and had no confidence in making a public profession of religion, unless I could
                            live according to my profession; and therefore determined not to name the name of Christ,
                            till I could depart from iniquity, nor call myself a Christian without being convinced that
                            I was such in reality. (See 2 Tim. ii., 19.)<pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> In the spring of the year
                            1780, I received intelligence of a singular sect of Christians who had come from England,
                            and lived somewhere above Albany, and who excited much attention on account of the
                            singularity of their religion and the remarkable power and operations which attended it.
                            This intelligence made me very anxious to see the people for my own satisfaction, feeling
                            myself fully prepared by my late experience and my knowledge of the scriptures, to receive
                            an understanding, and to judge of the virtue and efficacy of their religion. In agreement
                            with my parents I went to see them, (being then in tke 20th year of my age,) and was among
                            the first in this country who visited these remarkable strangers. I found them indeed a very
                            singular people ; and after critical enquiry and careful observation, I had evidence
                            sufficient to satisfy me that they possessed the power of God beyond any other people I had
                            ever seen. Instead of asking me to tell my religious experience, and inviting me to join the
                            church, as my former teachers had done, Mother Ann Lee, the leader of this little community,
                            taught me the necessity of confessing my sins in the presence of God's witnesses, and showed
                            me the propriety of bringing my deeds to the light, and of being joined to the Lord in one
                            spirit, according to the scriptures. I saw and acknowledged this to be right. I tarried
                            several days, and saw with much admiration the wonderful displays of Divine Power among
                            these people. When I was about to take my leave of them to return home, Mother Ann told me I
                            might open my mind and confess my sins, if I was so minded, before I returned home. I said I
                            believed it to be right to confess my sins ; but I had thought to return home and labor to
                            get a deeper sense of sin, and try to mend my life a little. Mother replied, "That is very
                            good ; but you can gain a deeper sense of sin after you have confessed them, as well as
                            before, and be better able to mend your life. " Being fully convinced by what I had heard
                            and seen, that this was the real requirement of God, I undertook it, and made as honest a
                            confession as I was able at that time. After I had got through, Mother said, " You have done
                            very well so far ; but you have not confessed all." She then told me of a number of secret
                            sins that I had committed, which I had not recollected, and which I well knew was before
                            unknown to any living mortal but myself: and I was fully convinced that she could not have
                            known these things but by the revelation of God. I therefore felt able to return home and
                            say as the woman of Samaria did of Jesus Christ, / have seen a ivoman who ivas able to tell
                            me all that 1 ever did in my life. Here I received that holy unction from Christ, through
                            Mother Ann, that fully enabled me to cease from sin. Here I found boldness and confidence
                            before Grod and all men, and felt my adoption into the family of Christ, and among the sons
                            of God. Here I found an entrance into the pure and peaceable Kingdom of Christ, and felt my
                            soul united to the invisible, heavenly host, and filled with the quickening power of God,
                            which gave me strength to resist all evil, and to keep every sinful propensity in subjection
                            to the law of Christ. And I felt a full assurance that by continuing in obedience to the
                            testimony I had then embraced, I should gain a<pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>complete dominion over
                            the powers of darkness, and reign triumphant with Christ, in purity and holiness. In this I
                            have not been deceived ; for I have found my faith fully verified. Indeed it is impossible
                            it should be otherwise ; for the testimony that I received, and with which I united, was
                            like a two edged sword against all ungodliness and every appearance of evil; therefore all
                            who are obedient to it, must certainly be saved from all ungodliness. This grace I have
                            obtained, and this power I have received through the special ministration of Mother Ann Lee,
                            whose piercing testimony awakened the inmost feelings of my soul, and roused the sleeping
                            faculties of my mind, which had long been bound in nature's darkness. Thus did my soul
                            receive a special manifestation of the healing power of God, as really as the impotent man
                            at the Beautiful gate of the temple received the miraculous cure from Peter and John. (See
                            Acts iii.) And here I would ask all candid people, By what authority and power did Peter and
                            John heal the lame man's infirmity? Did they communicate that which they did not possess?
                            Peter testified that God had glorified his son Jesus ; and through faith ia this same Jesus
                            whom they had crucified, was this man healed. Even so I can testify before all men, that it
                            was through faith in Mother Ann, whom God raised up and endowed with the spirit of Christ,
                            that I was healed of the infirmities of my spirit; even through Christ manifested in that
                            woman, who was shamefully persecuted, abused and slandered by a lawless and wicked
                            generation; because she zealously maintained the principles of purity and holiness, and
                            boldly testified, by precept and example, against all the abominations of the wicked. It
                            must appear evident to every reasonable mind, that had she not possessed the spirit and
                            power of Christ, she could not have communicated it to others. And had she been laden with
                            iniquity, and fraught with evil and unclean spirits, as many have asserted, she could not
                            have purged those things from other souls. Christ did not cast out devils by Beelzebub, and
                            no one else could ever do it. The nature of evil and all evil deeds are directly opposed to
                            godliness, and if ever subdued and purged out of a soul, it must be done by the spirit and
                            power of goodness, or it never can be done at all. And had not Mother Ann brought forth the
                            genuine fruits of righteousness in her own life and example, she never could have wrought in
                            souls such conviction of sin, and turned so many from the ways of iniquity into the pure
                            paths of peace and righteousness, as she has done; and that this was truly the fruit of her
                            labors, many living witnesses can testify from their own personal knowledge and experience.
                            Now let the candid among mankind judge and compare evidences ; let them contrast the
                            accusations against her with her uniform testimony and doctrine. Her worst enemies cannot
                            deny that her testimony was a &gt; opposite to every evil of which she is accused, as
                            fire is opposite to water. Can any man or woman of common sense suppose that thousands of
                            rational beings, born in a land of ]iberty and civilization, and brought up in the midst of
                            moral and religious principles and instructions, and in the pursuit of a pure and undefiled
                            religion, and who possessed all the propensities of<pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> human nature common
                            to other people, would deny themselves of all worldly pleasures and enjoyments, and subject
                            themselves to the dictates of a woman of base character, who lived in direct opposition to
                            those principles which she daily preached to others ? Or are the people called Shakers such
                            dupes to folly and fanaticism that they will constrain themselves against every dictate of
                            reason and common sense and in violation of every feeling of nature, to maintain for such a
                            long period of time, the principles of a fanatical female whose life and example
                            contradicted her own testimony ? I was well acquainted with Mother Ann, and had many
                            opportunities with her during her ministration in this country. Being a free man, and
                            feeling a powerful religious attachment to her and the Elders with her, I embraced every
                            suitable opportunity to visit them, and be in their company at the different places where
                            they ministered the gospel. I often visited them at Watervliet, and was with them in prison
                            at Albany�I was with them at Harvard, Shirley, Woburn, Ashfield, Richmond and Hancock, in
                            Massachusetts, at Enfield in Connecticut, and here at New Lebanon : I have seen and heard
                            them in many meetings, and was well knowing to their deportment in public and private, and
                            was well acquainted with their manners at home and abroad, and therefore feel fully able to
                            give a true statement of their lives and characters. And I feel it justly my duty to
                            contradict the false reports which have been spread abroad by the tongue of slander
                            concerning them : for in all my acquaintance with them, I have ever observed the same
                            uniform example of temperance, chastity, righteousness, and every gospel virtue. Their lives
                            and characters were in strict conformity to the doctrine and example oi Christ; and they
                            constantly taught the same to others. Although many malicious and abusive charges have been
                            published abroad in the world, for the purpose of criminating the character of this Society
                            and its first iounders ; yet all that can be said in the spirit of slander, is unworthy of
                            the credit or attention of any rational person. Those who have little or no acquaintance
                            with the Society, are not qualified to give any correct information concerning it. And as to
                            those who have apostatized from us, they condemn themselves by violating their own faith and
                            consciences ; and to them the words of the beloved apostle will justly apply : "They went
                            out from us, but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us, they would have continued
                            with us." (See 1 John ii., 19.) Many such unfaithful members have vainly pretended to hold
                            relation for a season; but their ungodliness has justly brought them under reproof; and
                            instead of reforming, they have thereby taken occasion to indulge themselves in resentment
                            and falsehood, and to deny the faith which they had once embraced, and become as traitors to
                            those who honestly maintain the cross of Christ. Such apostates have often palmed upon the
                            Society and its leaders the crimes which they themselves had committed, while pretending to
                            hold relation with us. Mother Ann was ever faithful in good works, she often deprived
                            herself of comforts, that she might be able to comfort others. She spared not her strength
                            nor her life in promoting the cause of<pb n="173" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> God, in strengthening the
                            feeble, comforting the afflicted, reproving the careless, correcting disorders, purging out
                            sin, and zealously striving, at all times, to build up righteousness and peace in all who
                            embraced her testimony. I bless the God of Heaven that I have lived to see the fulfillment
                            of those blessed promises, given us by the faithful messengers of truth, who first
                            administered the gospel to us, "That if we would yield a faithful obedience to the law of
                            Christ, now made manifest, we should be blessed in our outgoings and incomings�in our basket
                            and in our store ; and above all that we should enjoy the blessings of peace and salvation,
                            which Christ had promised to the faithful. " As the fruits of their precepts and examples of
                            industry, neatness, prudence, temperance and godliness, I have seen a Society of people
                            spring up, and grow and increase in order, beauty and harmony, till they are, in my view,
                            the glory of the earth�a city of refuge, a shining light to the nations. On the other hand,
                            I have seen the false accuser, the vile slanderer and proud persecutor, who gladly would
                            have trampled under foot the meek and lowly followers of Christ, either left to become a
                            shame and a reproach to civil society, outcasts among men and vagabonds in the earth ; or if
                            their rank and standing in society has preserved them from these disgraces, they have not
                            escaped the stains of dishonor, nor the stings of a guilty conscience. Numbers have lingered
                            out their days under evident guilt and condemnation, and left this mortal stage with '' a
                            fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation," knowing that the day of reckoning
                            must come. Knowing and feeling a sense of these things, and standing in the fear of God, I
                            solemnly warn all to be careful that they touch not the Lord's anointed, and do his people
                            no harm. Kemember the counsel of Gamaliel to the Jewish high priest and his council: ''
                            Refrain from these men and let them alone: for if this counsel or this wTork be of men, it
                            will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found
                            even to fight against God. " (See Acts v., 38, 39.) Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            perfective development, nature invariably adapts the wants of the physical system to the
                            ability of acquirement. As muscular vigor deteriorates in consequence of oft repeated
                            violations of nature's laws, and, because of increased mental activity ; we find all
                            difficulties surmounted in the realization of the fact that mind is superior to matter, and
                            brain rules over muscle, as is practically demonstrated in the wonder-working realm of
                            inventive genius ; from whose workshops come all the nicely wrought, and marvelously planned
                            appliances, that are designed to lighten and lessen the heavy labors of life. Still we toil
                            and grow weary ; continually exhausting the vital forces, that we4may maintain a certain
                            standard of civilization, with all its complications, superfluities and extravagances. If
                            the ascetical does not balance the esthetical ideas of society, the needless will supersede
                            the useful; and all beauty that has not a foundation in use, soon grows distasteful, and
                            needs continual replacement with something new. By wrong thinking and wrong living, the
                            tastes of the people become vitiated ; and, catering to those tastes in every department of
                            manufacture and production, there is created and fostered among all classes, a spirit of
                            competition and rivalry, in dress, equipage, fine houses, and epicurean pleasures. "The lust
                            of the flesh, the hist of the eye, and the pride of life," rule society at large, and form
                            the triple chain of the soul's enslavement to the world. A bondage stronger than the yoke of
                            the Egyptians, or the manacles of the slave. " True to nature" is an axiom unknown to modern
                            life. We seem to have so much to diminish care and make work a blessing, and yet we are not
                            as comfortable or contented as our forefathers, who in the rude simplicity of their time had
                            less of everything but health to enjoy, and who, in possession of that inestimable blessing,
                            held the secret of happiness and sweet unruffled peace. In the line of correspondency and
                            improvement there seems to be no stopping place. As the mental faculties are quickened, the
                            heart feels the impulse and the hands act in unison, these form a three-fold power, strong
                            for action ; but this combined force turned to the external alone, absorbs the whole being
                            in earthliness, and needlessly drains the vital force. To continually create
                            creature-comforts for the sake of hoarding up beyond present needs, or a just provision for
                            those who shall succeed us in our labors, seems to rob the soul of the greater blessing of
                            striving for the acquisition of mental and spiritual wealth, and hence the triune forces of
                            our being are not balanced into harmonious activity. It seems necessary therefore, if we
                            would enjoy a healthful and happy existence, that we would justly consider our manner of
                            living, in reference not to our wants, but to our needs, as the poet truly remarks. "Man's
                            rich with little were his judgment true, Nature is frugal, and her wants are few, [lights,
                            Those few wants answered bring sincere deBut fools create themselves new appetites." Let us
                            live as sentient thinking beings should live, " using the things of this<pb n="175" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>world as not abusing them." Making our bodies fit temples for the Holy Spirit, and keeping
                            our homes, sweet, clean, plain, and attractive. Ever remembering that above all riches are
                            the treasures of immortal truth, garnered in the realm of spirit; and above all ornament and
                            glory is the beauty of heavenly virtue. Mt. Lebanon, N.

TEIform="persName"/>HARRIET A. JOHNS.</byline><p TEIform="p"> We often read, From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh, and As the heart is, so
                            are we. It is the fountain from whence springs our thoughts, words and actions ; and as in
                            nature a stream cannot rise higher than the fountain from which it is supplied ; so the
                            streams of love and affection, welling up and dictating our actions, are governed and guided
                            by the impulses of the heart; if they be earthward, as is too often the case, they lead us
                            from God, and we become blinded to his goodness. Through purity of life, we approach nearest
                            to God, and are better able to understand the Divine nature of that Being, who is the
                            embodiment of all righteousness. We may possess many virtues, and pass for Christian men and
                            women ; yet as long as envy, hatred, pride, hard and unkind thoughts, find admission, we are
                            not strictly pure, saying nothing of the grosser elements that so often control human
                            beings. Christ likened the impure heart to a cage of unclean birds. God requires us to give
                            our hearts to Him; and would they not be very unacceptable in this condition ? As man was
                            made in the image and likeness of God he is, or should be, his representative on the earth.
                            This likeness is manifested by the development of his attributes in the heart. When we
                            strive to become pure, God draws near. If prepared, we see Him to-day and eternity will
                            perfect us in the knowledge of the Divine. " The seven attributes, constituting the nature
                            and essence of God, " revealed to mankind, from which all others proceed, are: Truth,
                            Wisdom, Mercy, Justice, Holiness, Love and Righteousness. Exercising ourselves in these
                            according to our best understanding, we are able to receive additional knowledge, aur sight
                            becomes clear, and we comprehend more and more the spirit of God. But the work of first
                            purifying the heart must be done"; for unto the pure only is the promise given ; " They
                            shall see God. " Canterbury, N.

When his disciples asked him
                            why he did so, he answered ; '' To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
                            heaven, but to them that are without, it is not given." Doubtless there were other reasons,
                            but this is sufficient for our present purpose. Jesus explained some of them, and some were
                            left to be explained at his Second Appearing ; of the latter class is the following. He
                            said: "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
                            measures of meal, until the whole was leavened. " Part of a loaf of bread leavened and<pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>part of it unleavened would render it unfit for use. The meal
                            represented the people that were prepared to receive the leaven, which was the word of God,
                            to be administered to the world by a woman. Mother Ann, and all who received the leaven or
                            word which she spoke, became one in the spirit of love, and one in interest, and purpose�and
                            they all unite in supporting the testimony of Jesus and Ann. If it was right for the
                            Apostles to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven in that day, why not for those who
                            in this day are strictly living up to Christ and Mother's testimony. The requirements being
                            the same, those who fulfill them by perfect obedience must be entitled to the same
                            blessings. Hancock, Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="God's anvil" TEIform="index"/>GOD'S ANVIL

                            child? It seems to me that you are too young to talk of destiny. Why, if I mistake not, you
                            are only fourteen years of age, and consequently very immature. Pray, why are you so
                            depressed ? M. I am young, indeed, but I have reason to fear that I shall not survive long,

                            trying to disseminate. I am painfully aware that I am scornfully treated by the majority of
                                unpro-<pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>gressed minds, am often thrown into some dark corner where
                            dust, soot and tobacco smoke "do congregate." am imprisoned for months with that
                            objectionable literature called, "yellow covered, " and my only solace is that I am not of
                            them though dwelling so near. Happily at most Societies of Believers I receive marked
                            attention. My pages are read and my theories discussed to profit. At some special
                            localities, however, I find it hard to get the amount of mental stimuli that I need though I
                            can find a good lodging anywhere. If what one modern writer states is true, then I need not
                            wonder it is thought that I shall die young ; just read ;�"Literature of a higher order is
                            universally neglected in this age. The most profound treatises upon scientific, moral and
                            religious subjects are allowed to grow dusty on the shelves of libraries and book-stores,
                            while the details of criminal courts, incidents of prize fights, baseball games, etc., are
                            read with avidity. " This statement does not console me, in the least, but if I die it may
                            be in a good cause. S. Poor little Innocent. You have our warmest sympathy and we assure you
                            that there is a better time coining. Why, you may well be termed our modern David who with
                            the little missiles of truth will yet be able to slay the giants of selfishness, animalism
                            and sordid Ignorance. The quotation, "Whom the gods love die young" is a mythical one in
                            value and therefore unworthy your thought, for your God is the God of the living, you being
                            his agent, should never die. Did you never hear the parable in the New Testament, of the
                            woman, who put a little leaven into three measures ot meal and the whole was leavened? And
                            of the mustard seed which is the smallest of all seeds, and which grew to the proportions of
                            a tree ? Just so we predict your mission will increase and expand in usefulness though you
                            resemble the mustard seed in diminutiveness. Young though you are, you represent the moral
                            and spiritual status of more than a dozen hoary headed Communities that have survived the
                            storms of a hundred Winters and the intense heat of as many Summer suns without
                            disintegration or decay. It is from these sources that you must continue to draw your life.
                            You are destined to become one of the most active Teachers of our youth who are to
                            perpetuate the Testimony. To teach them that theirs is to be more than a mere muscular

                            your duty to promulge. Take our suggestions, if you please and remember that our sympathies

                            Peter, iii., 9. We will quote a few of the promises of God. 1. " Blessed is the man that
                            feareth the Lord. " Psa. cxii., 1. 2. "All things work together for good to them that love
                            the Lord. " Rom. viii., 28. 3. " The prayer of the upright is God's delight." Prov. xv., 8.
                            4. " Whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother and
                            sister and mother." Matt, xii., 50. 5. "Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, they rest
                            from their labors and their works do follow them." Rev. xiv., 13. 6. " The just shall come
                            out of trouble. " Prov. xii., 13 7. " God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom
                            and knowledge and joy. " Ecc. ii., 26. 8. "He saved his people from the hand of him that
                            hated them." Psa. cvi., 10. 9. "The righteous hate only the haters of God. " Deut. xxxiii.,
                            11. 10. " The Lord preserveth the strangers and relieveth the fatherless and widow." Psa.
                            cxlvi., 9. In the fifth chapter of Matt, from the third to the ninth verses we find promises
                            as follows ; "The poor in spirit shall obtain the kingdom. " " The mourner shall be
                            comforted. " "The meek shall inherit the earth." " Those that hunger and thirst after
                            righteousness shall be filled. " "The merciful shall obtain mercy. " "The peacemakers shall
                            be called the children of God." " The pure in heart shall see God. " The pure in heart,
                            only, are granted the privilege of seeing God, and of beholding him as he is, and of
                            feasting on the beauties and comeliness of his being. To see God we must see him by and
                            through our whole body. Our bodies must be full of light. God is a whole, not a part,
                            therefore we must be a whole, or in other words we must be wholly cleansed from all
                            impurity. Our love must be cleansed. We must love God above all others. He should have no
                            rival in our hearts. Forsaking the worldly relationships of father, mother, brethren,
                            sisters, wife, children, private property and their enjoyments, let us go on to purity and
                            perfection. Whosoever looketh on a [man] or woman to lust after [him] or her hath committed
                            adultery already in his heart, Matt, v., 28, and Paul has said. " It is good for a man not
                            to touch a woman. " 1 Cor. vii., 1. For the better protection of Brethren and Sisters in the
                            gospel of Christ's Second Appearing all undue familiarity is disapproved, and great care
                            should be observed that we go not in the way of temptation. We may be defiled by the
                            cherishing of impure thoughts, as we lose sight of God. Have God first in the heart to the
                            slaying of self and selfishness ; then love each other as brothers and sisters in spirit.
                            This far excels any mutual worldly relationship. Thinking improperly of any person, will in
                            the end prove to be defiling to the pure in heart. Let God only have a seat there and he
                            will invite the guest to the wedding feast.<pb n="179" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> Let us ask. Do we make the
                            purity of our feelings the greatest enjoyment we have? Do we feel that when we are "away
                            from the world and the flesh," that we are nearer to God ? The only chain that is able to
                            bind the natural man and to "crucify the world with its affections and lusts, " thereby
                            setting the spirit free, is, in truth, the order of Believers. By obeying this purifying
                            light, we are admitted into the Holy of Holies, and there we can see God and "follow the
                            Lamb whithersoever he goeth." Such Christ delighteth to lead. " Blessed are the pure in
                            heart for they shall see God.

Yet the
                            present is one which admits of no sad reflections. Full of years and honors our beloved
                            Mother has calmly stepped into the hereafter, leaving a, life and example over which we may
                            look with hardly a regret. For more than three quarters of a century she has been on holy
                            ground. Was the first young child taken into this Society to be trained in the Gospel life.
                            Being docile and intelligent she readily received a planting in the faith. Having become
                            convicted of sin at an early age she received a baptism of the spirit by repentance and
                            striving to make straight her paths. The true faith of the Gospel dawned on her young mind,
                            and was received in a receptive and fertile soil. She saw that not only was ordinary
                            morality necessary to become a true child of God, but gained by labor a deep spiritual
                            understanding. To become redeemed from the nature of the loss under which every child of
                            Adam and Eve is created was her real life work. She perceived that a life of Virgin purity
                            and Christian community could alone enable souls to work out their redemption, that in this
                            relation the woman by cross-bearing becomes the equal of the man, and instead of being a
                            slave, becomes a great power in the ultimate redemption of mankind. Her mind being of a
                            progressive type, she received with much interest, and readily accepted on due reflection,
                            all the progressive developments of spiritual light and understanding which have so
                            abundantly been bestowed on the chosen people of God. While such was the real inward life of
                            her soul, she was very capable in temporal business, and during the period of sixty years
                            filled every office of trust among Believers ; at the time of her decease she held the
                            office of Trustee. She was able and willing to stand anywhere in society as her lead
                            required, being meekly resigned to whatever lot was chosen for her. Thus adorned with
                            simplicity, purity and resignation her life has been a blessing to herself, and to all who
                            came within her influence. Her life example has been given to show that to build up the
                            spiritual temple of God, the Virgin prophetic church of the ages, it is needful to support
                            the order of God, and that while doing this, souls may become redeemed from the earth,
                            living stones in the house of God.

                            these men, nor of ever giving one of them an impertinent word, though I lived with divers of
                            them for several years. This habitual feeling of respect has continued with me thus far
                            through life, and although I am now over seventy years of age, I retain quite a portion of
                            my young feeling of giving precedence to persons much younge-r than myself. This habit of
                            feeliug and acting has been of gveat advantage through life ; it has made the path of
                            obedience and compliance to the feelings of superiors easy, and I may say natural, though to
                            some it seems hard and unnatural. It has enabled me to live in peace, and gain the good-will
                            of all the variety of persons and characters with whom it has been my lot to associate, so
                            that I do not remember an instance for over fifty years in which there have been
                            difficulties and hard feelings existing between myself and others. I am aware that youth
                            sometimes labor under peculiar disadvantages. They live and work with all gradations of age,
                            from youngest of themselves to the most aged, and it is difficult to define the starting
                            point where this feeling of respect should begin. Add to this that there are always some of
                            adult age, and even some that are aged, who expose their weakness to such a degree as almost
                            to cancel their claim to respect. Although these are serious disadvantages, they are not
                            without remedy. Generous minded youth, as a first step and incentive to action, will urge
                            themselves deeply to consider and appreciate the great moral worth of character, which the
                            genuine principle of Christian love, and consequent politeness and true benevolence, gives
                            to all who possess them. This pure prin-<pb n="181" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>ciple is the only sure
                            fountain from which this respectful feeling of which we are speaking can uniformly now. In
                            order, then, to acquire this heavenly principle, we must exercise it, practice it, must give
                            it scope in action�must cultivate it whenever an opportunity offers. Bather than fail of
                            attaining it, we had better bestow our kind and loving feelings on our yom.ger companions,
                            and train ourselves to treat every one, young and old, with due refinement, respect and
                            kindness, let their treatment to iis be what it may. If this is practiced toward the
                            younger, it will be surely easy to bestow it on those more advanced in years. We have thus
                            found a remedy for the first named disadvantage. The same principle would, Ithink, be also
                            found a sufficient remedy for the second ; but we will add an additional consideration,
                            which will help us wholly out of the difficulty. All the weakness, unworthiness and
                            coarseness of manners which we are displeased with in older persons, are the result of their
                            not having acquired the true principle and practice of politeness in their youth, and we
                            shall be just like them unless we succeed in gaining that principle. This we cannot do if we
                            imitate their manners, and and treat them as they treat us and others. The only use we can
                            make oi their imperfections is to let them stand as a beacon to warn us of our danger, and
                            induce us to ply every means to escape their sad condition. We must not adopt the practice
                            o: being polite to those who are polite to us, and rude to those who are rude This would
                            show decidedly that we have no principle of goodness or politeness o our own, or in
                            ourselves, but that our actions depend wholly on those of other people. As we cannot admit a
                            man to je just because he deals fairly with some people while he cheats others, so leither
                            can a man be polite who treats some respectfully and others rudely. If youth have to
                            associate with older persons who through their weakness and disagreeable qualities forfeit
                            respect, still will it not be best to treat them with respect for the sake of the principle?
                            Will not this be quite as effectual in disciplining and refining the manners and spirits of
                            young people, as if the object were more worthy? Undoubtedly it will, and much more so, as
                            it will be a victory and triumph over greater obstacles. Respectful manners, or politeness,
                            comes under the same law as that of love, of which our Savior says, "If ye love them only
                            which love you, what thank have you ? Do not even the publicans so?" And we may as justly
                            say, '' If you are polite to those who are polite to you, What thank have you?" This but
                            places you on the very level of uncultivated nature, without the least refinement of
                            manners, since the very savages will do the same ! But by the practice and attainment of
                            showing kindness and respect to all, regardless of their conduct to us, we are brought up to
                            the threshold of a still higher and more Godlike principle, namely, to " love and do good to
                            our enemies!" This our holy religion requires ; but if we cannot love and be kind to our
                            aged friends because they have some faults, how can we love, pray for, and be kind to our
                            enemies, who are seeking to do us injury? But if we gain and practice the former, we shall
                            have made a near approach to the latter. As we cannot love and do good to our enemies merely
                            because they have evil dispositions and are injurious to us, we<pb n="182" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>place
                            our actions on a higher principle, we will love and bless them because Christ requires it,
                            and for the sake of imitating the Divine Benevolence, who sends the bounties of his rain and
                            sunshine on the bad and unthankful; we can love them with a love of pity and compassion,
                            knowing how unhappy they are, and must continue to be, while under the influence of hatred.
                            On more rational grounds we can descend so low as to love them for our own sakes, in order
                            to put ourselves as far as possible from their deplorable condition, i. e., full of hatred.
                            We will call nothing love that does not manifest itself in deeds of kindness. So reflect on
                            two human beings, one of whom is constantly using every opportunity of abusing and
                            ill-treating the other, while this other is as constantly improving every chance to show
                            kindness in return, is making a contrast of character which it is hard to find language to
                            express. Every rational being, however, will at once decide which is infinitely the more
                            excellent of the two, and would of course prefer the possession of the good and Godlike
                            character and disposition, rather than of the bad one. There are, however, few, if any human
                            beings, so debased that they cannot be overcome with kindness ; and how noble and Godlike is
                            such a deed ! I remember to have read an account of a very depraved convict which will
                            illustrate this. The said convict had been several times confined in the penitentiary, and
                            had several times broken out, and was considered very dangerous and unmanageable. At length
                            he was put in the Massachusetts penitentiary, whose keeper was noted for his ability to
                            manage depraved cases. The convict had not been long confined before he attempted to break
                            out, and being discovered, got badly wounded by the guard in preventing his escape. The
                            keeper called the physician, and took great pains to have the wounds well dressed, and with
                            great kindness had the convict conveyed to his cell, and everything done necessary to make
                            him comfortable. This was in the evening. Near midnight the keeper arose and went to the
                            convict's cell and examined his wounds, and kindly inquired how he felt; told him, he had
                            felt so uneasy about his sufferings that he could not sleep, and thought perhaps he could do
                            something to alleviate his pain. He gave him good cool water to drink and redressed his
                            wounds. This was too much even for this hardened convict. He burst into tears and wept,
                            saying, "Sir, everybody has for years treated me as a beast, but you treat me as a man. I
                            regret trying to break out and giving you so much trouble, and I now promise to make no more
                            such attempts. " He was as good as his word, and under the influence of that kind keeper he
                            left the penitentiary a reformed man. I would rather be the author of such a deed than
                            possess all earthly wealth. To attain to such sublime heights of excellence, we must begin
                            early in youth to train ourselves to kind actions ; and the very lowest beginning point in
                            this work is to treat our equals with fairness and justice, and our superiors in age with
                            good manners and due respect. We must, if we expect to succeed, set out in earnest in this
                            matter. We must have no condition, but resolve, let others do as they will to us, we will
                            treat them, 1st, Politely ; 2d, Kindly ; 3d, Lovingly ; and so persevere till we arrive at
                            the sublime height of pure Christian love !

                            trumpet was sounded for a general move. At ten o'clock A. M. Nov. 10th, we arrived at the
                            Village where we were cordially received by all the Brethren and Sisters. For several days
                            many of the company were entertained in the meeting house. As soon as convenient a home was
                            found for each one. In this case every family received an accession in numbers and were glad
                            of the opportunity to be able to render this assistance. From the exposure and fatigue that
                            was borne while on this journey, several, of the company were subjected to chills and fevers
                            which terminated only with their lives. We will now return to Eed Banks and keep company
                            with those who are to make the journey in boats. On the 11th. of Oct. with a fair wind and a
                            good sail, well rigged we pushed off from the shore into the Ohio river. We had thirty-fix
                            passengers on board and on that first day made twenty-four miles. The next day by hard work
                            at the poles we made only fifteen miles. On the 14th. a heavy rain obliged us to remain on
                            shore. Our next move was a distance of ten miles, but even this proved very disagreeable to
                            walk the running boards of a keel boat all day. On the 16th. we moved along slowly but
                            safely. On the 17th. we had more or less difficulty by running on logs that were concealed
                            under water, but received no injury. We pushed on fifteen miles and then went on shore late
                            in the afternoon and encamped among the rocks. Some of our company are still afflicted with
                            chills and fever, but bear their sufferings with great patience. We moved along carefully
                            making each day a distance of about fourteen miles. With the catching of some fish and the
                            killing of five wild turkeys we considered ourselves amply supplied with provision for a few
                            meals. On the 22nd. we overtook a boat managed by a company of rough men. They did not
                            intend to let us pass. For a while we lagged behind them but this proving unpleasant we
                            attempted to cross the river that we might push on ahead. So soon as they discovered what we
                            were about, they pushed after us. One of the Brethren in attempting to keep their boat from
                            us, fell overboard. He was soon on the boat again, and after the exchange of a few boatman's
                            compliments we pushed off and saw them no more. On this day we sailed twenty-three miles. On
                            the 24th. we encamped just below the Falls, where we rest till the 26th. when we unloaded
                            the boat and hauled all our goods up the river to a place where we could again carry them on
                            board of the boat. It was a very laborious job and we became much fatigued. A heavy rain
                            obliged us to stop in Jeffersonville during the day. Fortunately we found a boat and some
                            goods at this place which we left here in 1811 while on our way to Busro. We loaded the boat
                            and then took a receipt for all we left. On the 31st. of Oct. we made twenty-seven miles
                            which was our best record for travel up to this date. The next day Nathan Pegg and Wm. Price
                            were sent on foot to Union Village. We now encamped at Big bone creek, twenty-seven miles
                            below Cincinnati. We reached the latter place on the 3rd. of Nov. here we met Elder Issachar
                            Bates and Nathan Sharp from Union Village who kept us company the remainder of the journey.
                            As this was our last landing place we unloaded the boat and stored our property and then
                            commenced our journey to the Village, on foot. Our first walk was only a distance of three
                            miles. At night we had excellent accommodations in a large and beautiful house We had the
                            most severe rain storm in the night that we had experienced since leaving Busro. In the
                            morning the roads were muddy but we walked all day as best we could. As night came upon us
                            we obtained some hickory wood for torches and marched on, reaching Union Village at eight
                            o'clock in the evening of Nov. 5, 1812 where our friends received us with every
                            manifestation of kindness. That night we lay down to rest, thankful that we had found an
                            asylum of peace, away from the tumult of war. Not less than six persons died during the
                            winter of 1813 and several are still confined with a fever. On the approach of Spring<pb n="184" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> the Brethren found employment on the farm and in the shops, while the
                            Sisters were engaged in duties about the house. In August such favorable tidings were
                            received from the War department, that the question arose about returning to Busro. The
                            Indians had sued for peace and the prospect was very encouraging. On the 4th of October John
                            Hancock returned to Busro, and called on his way at South Union. On the 18th. of the same
                            month John Edgington and Daniel Redman went on horsehack. On the 25th. four Brethren with a
                            horse and an ox team left for Busro. In 1814 preparations were in progress with the
                            expectation of moving to the home in Indiana. On the 3rd. of Feb. six Brethren and four
                            Sisters moved to Busro. March 12th. thirty Brethren and seven Sisters left Union Village for
                            their western home. A part of this company traveled on horseback, the others went in a boat.
                            Ten others went on the 22nd. of March. This last company had been to Pittsburg to make some
                            purchases, and then sailed from Cincinnati. They landed at Louisville to unload some freight
                            that was billed to that place. They write, We had a keel boat and a ft,, t bottomed boat.
                            After leaving Louisville the keel boat pushed on, leaving the larger boat with two hands to
                            come as best they could. We experienced some severe March gales, but set down to our oars
                            and pulled for the mouth of the Wabash. On the first of April we landed at the old camping
                            ground, above Red Banks. On the morning of the 4th. everything was covered with snow. At
                            twelve o'cIock on the 15th. we reached the mouth of Busro. Leaving a guard for the boats the
                            others of the company walked home. The next day the goods were hauled from the boat which
                            ends this journey. The Brethren that had been in Busro during the winter were employed most
                            of the time in preparing the fields for the plow, hauling rails, making and repairing
                            fences. We all felt thankful that we had landed safely on our own possessions, where, the
                            Lord willing, we expect to remain thrdugh life. Wm. Davis went to Union Village on the 29th.
                            of May and returned with the cattle. On the 12th. of July another boat load of goods arrived
                            from Union Village. On the 21st another company of Brethren and Sisters arrived having been
                            on the journey eighteen days. The people were generally well after so fatiguing a march, but
                            this was not to be of long continuance. Several of our people were taken with chills and
                            fever and no medical applications seemed to relieve them. During the Summer season several
                            persons were called from this to another life much to our sorrow and a great loss to the
                            Community. In 1815 the Brethren were busy in making repairs and in piitting up new buildings
                            for the better accommodation of the people. A mill was built and a reservoir made to hold a
                            good supply of water. A large number of persons were confined with fever, which served to
                            cast a gloom over the minds of many through fear of its continuation. A dwelling was built
                            in 1816 under the direction of Joseph Lockwood. The building was forty feet square and
                            seventy feet high to the ridge beam. In July we harvested ninety-five acres of wheat and
                            thirty-five acres of rye. On the 8th. of July, 1817, Father David, Elder Solomon, James
                            Hodge, Mother Ruth and Eldress Hortensy arrived in eight days from Union Village. This
                            company returned on the 11th. of August. We passed a mild winter in 1818 but with the spring
                            came cold and violent winds and also much sickness. At one time only seven persons were left
                            without an attack of the fever. We enjoyed a remarkably mild winter in 1819. Showers were
                            not uncommon accompanied with thunder and lightening, and during the month of Feb. the grass
                            grew from two to four inches, so that all anticipated an early spring. In this, however, we
                            were to be disappointed. On the 4th. of Mar. the snow fell to the depth of eight inches and
                            the cold so increased that from the 4th. of Mar. to the 4th. of Apr. but little work was
                            done on the farm. This gave a late spring after so mild a winter. On the 7th. of May a
                            fearful tornado passed a short distance South west from our Village. Everything in its path
                            was swept<pb n="185" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>to the ground. One of our barns, sixty-five feet long and
                            twenty-eight feet wide was hurled twelve rods from its foundation and broken in pieces. We
                            saved the timbers as well as we could and after adding some new pieces, rebuilt the barn On
                            the 15th. of Aug. this building now finished was struck by lightening and considerably
                            damaged. On the 9th. of Feb. 1820 we were visited by a company of evil minded persons. They
                            stole from us some irons which they found in the blacksmith shop, and they cut twenty-seven
                            yards of linen from the loom. They also attempted the burning of our buildings, but the fire
                            was discovered before much harm had, been done. The building\&gt;f a brick dwelling
                            50x44 ft. was the first business of the Spring of 1821. The bricks were burned at the
                            Village and all the work on the building was done by the Brethren. A mill for washing
                            clothes was built and accidentally, its first motion broke two fingers on the left hand of
                            one of the Sisters. The Society was visited with a great deal "f sickness this year and
                            several of our members were taken from us.

                                me with the Shakers. Just three months before this happened my Mother was attacked with
                                a serious illness, called Spinal Meningitis. After six weeks of suffering she expired,
                                or her spirit passed out of her body. Her last words were, "Father take me home, " often
                                did she repeat them. Her greatest anxiety was that her children, a little brother and
                                myself, should be kindly and wisely cared for, after she was gone. I know many children
                                who can tell the sad experience of an irreligious Mother, not so with mine. I often
                                wondered why Mother prayed with us so many times and read the Bible so much, now I think
                                perhaps she thought she should not live long and so she tried to teach us how to be good
                                that we might be protected when she should leave us. Had my Father not placed me with
                                the Shakers, I should have missed my dear Mother very much. I think I love her as I
                                cannot tell and I think she loves and watches over me, I would love to speak to her so
                                much. I am a favored child and I will try to be just as good as I can to repay my kind
                                friends who are my Mothers so I am not an orphan. I have written this so that if there
                                are any little children abroad who read the Manifesto and who lose their mothers they
                                may ask for this good home with me. They must be willing to leave all their naughty
                                ways.

                                    to repent of it. But it is a very hard thing to hide a sin. It is like hiding seed
                                    or root in the ground. It draws strength in its concealment, and finally pushing up
                                    though the soil, brings forth fruit, thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold. Sin is not
                                    dead enough to be safely buried. It is like a smoldering flame. It is a poisonous

                                    destroy on every hand. A sin needs to be dragged out of its hidingplace, and
                                    extirpated. Hiding it only gives it a fresh hold. " Whoso covereth his sins shall

As was said of those who stood at the corners of the streets and in the synagogues,
                            having a personal satisfaction in their protracted religious exercises, so it may be said,
                            equally as well of the religious world of to-day, in their preaching, praying and singing.
                            ''Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward. " It is the reward that follows directly
                            upon the consummation of the work. It is the self-consciousness of receiving that for which
                            we have sought. If the work has been done in the interest of the children of this world, we
                            can only look to them for a corresponding compensation. It seems to be an idle notion when
                            one assumes to seek for that which they do not want, or to ask for that which they would not
                            accept, History on its first pages records, most distinctly, the reward, or as we Avould
                            say, the fruits of unrighteousness. The reward must come. Whether appreciated or not it must
                            certainly come. There cannot be even the shadow of a mistake. Men in their wanderings have
                            sometimes lost sight of the principles of righteousness, and have accepted darkness for
                            light, and have even flattered themselves into the belief that they could violate the laws
                            of God and yet remain unpunished. They entertained, only, a vague idea of the laws of
                            retribution, and had written for themselves a formula which included a certain class of
                            trespasses, and their consequent punishments. All these days of ignorance have been
                            carefully mantled with charity, and the time has been when almost every form of
                            transgression has received the commendation, either directly or indirectly, of the religious
                            and irreligious world. In these times men ran rapidly on to destruction. A better day has
                            dawned upon us. Ignorance no longer commands respect. Every man is expected to give a reason
                            for the course that he pursues. To those who fear God, the sun of righteousness has arisen
                            '' with healing in his wings." Knowledge has accumulated and every department of the life of
                            man is filled with light. He can if he so chooses walk the highway of peace and happiness,
                            or take the road that leads to inevitable ruin. It was no idle word that Joshua spoke to the
                            children of Israel, "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve." In this he gave them the
                            privilege to exercise their own free will. To keep the laws of God in the discipline of
                            their minds and bodies would protect them in all<pb n="187" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>their rights and lead
                            them successfully into the land of Canaan ;�a land flowing with milk and honey, while a
                            .neglect of these laws would lead them into captivity and make them the slaves of their
                            enemies. The history of man abounds with lessons of corresponding interest. At every step he
                            finds himself face to face with God's law which plainly teaches the blessings that follow in
                            the path of right doing, and no less the anxiety and sorrow that is sure to follow in the
                            footsteps of the transgressor. Although there are instances where a penalty seems to pass
                            over one generation that merits it and is inflicted on a future class who are not the active
                            transgressors, yet this fact is being learned in its entirety and often to the deep sorrow
                            of the afflicted. The good apostle was positive on this point, "Whatsoever a man soweth that
                            also shall he reap. " "If he sows to the spirit, he shall of the spirit reap life
                            everlasting," but if he sows to the world and the flesh he shall of the flesh reap
                            corruption. Like begets like as the inevitable sequence of the law. Here again we have the
                            most convincing evidence of the workings of the spirit of God. It cannot be thwarted. The
                            simple minded man who had such a large appreciation of the beautiful, as to sow his field
                            with thistle seed, gave to himself and to his posterity a great deal of hard work for which
                            they received but a slight remuneration. Some men banter with their lives as a matter of the
                            least importance. Carelessly and foolishly they move along from one degree of transgression
                            to another, till they actually solicit the tempter to ensnare them. Others who glory in
                            error, after finding that " sentence is not executed speedily against an evil work " allow
                            themselves to entertain the falacious hope that no especial harm will ever arise from the
                            course which they have chosen to pursue. Charmed into security by the voice of the syren,
                            they easily fall into the broad way and pass on to destruction. "Verily I say unto you, they
                            have their reward.

                                        too large, it is incorrect to suppose that a very large drain is safer than one
                                        of moderate size, because the smaller the drain the more concentrated the flow,
                                        and the more thorough the flushing when larger amounts of water than usual are
                                        passed through it; as on washing days. If the liquid drainage is received
                                        directly from the kitchen without any provision for stopping grease, a
                                        twelve-inch drain will soon become partly filled with a greasy sediment ; and
                                        the water-way will assume a broad, flat form, over which the flow will spread
                                        itself and become too thin and too slow to ensure the proper scouring effect. A
                                        much smaller pipe would have this deposit of grease cot.' fined to a narrow
                                        channel, and the whole of a copious flow, being concentrated on it, would have a
                                        much better chance to cut it away and remove it. It may be taken as a rule that
                                        no private house, no matter how large, can need for its drainage, a pipe larger
                                        than four inches in diameter, Neither would it ordinarily be prudent to use a,
                                        smaller pipe than this, for any house. The smaller the amount of drainage a pipe
                                        is to carry, the more perfect must be its construction; for, a deposit of
                                        offensive matter is much more easily retained in a drain which is little used
                                        than in one which is often flushed with large quantities of liquid. Angles and
                                        curves must, if possible, be avoided in the drain ; for, besides affording
                                        lodgment for the<pb n="188" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/>sediment, they diminish the force of the
                                        stream, on account of the increased friction they offer to it. In a strait
                                        drain, moreover, it is often easy to remove any obstruction, by means of a wire
                                        brush thrust into the end of the pipe and pushed on through, like a chimney
                                        sweeping-brush. The fall or inclination of the drain need not be great, but must
                                        be uniform, or obstructions will almost surely result. The best material for
                                        drain pipes is iron ; but if the expense is considered too great the next best
                                        thing is glazed earthenware. In any case the joints must be water-tight. It is
                                        customary to lay the pipes loosely, and nil in the joints with clay; this plan
                                        is liable to result seriously for the health of the persons using the drain. The
                                        joints should be cemented together in such a way that a large mass of cement
                                        surrounds the joints. The brick, stone, and cement drains are dangerous. The
                                        importance of exercising the utmost care in building drains will be felt when it
                                        is known that the greater number of cases of diptheria and typhoid fever may be*

                            blooming, and fruitful with the growth of spices and other tropical productions. This spot
                            of emerald earth has been kept fresh and fair for many thousand years by a small river
                            running through its centre in a steady constant flow of pure water. It was, and is now, a
                            halting place for the caravans that came across the desert from the cities and towns of the
                            Orient, laden with the choice and valuable goods so famous in the history of the ancient
                            East. This traffic led to the founding of a city, which is now so old that no person on the
                            earth can trace the time of its origin. It is the city of Damascus. A city that was old when
                            Jesus of Nazereth was a chid. It was old when Abraham was a boy. It was old when Jacob
                            journeying across the plain of Mamre, laid himself down at night to sleep, with a stone for

                            and angels ascending and descending, a prophecy of the blending of the two worlds which
                            should come to pass in the latter days. This strange city of Damascus whose history can be
                            traced back thousands of years, still flourishes in its intermingling of ancient and modern
                            architecture; watered and refreshed by the river that flows through its centre. In the rise
                            and growth of primitive Christianity, it found an abiding place in Damascus, Jerusalem and
                            other cities of Oriental history, under circumstances of cruelty and terror, Saul of Tarsus
                            satiated with his persecutions of the Christians at Jerusalem, obtained permission of the
                            high priests to proceed to the city of Damascus on a bloodthirsty mission against the
                            Christians in that place. Armed with written credentials, with a retinue of followers, all

                            he should bring bound, unto Jerusalem, of the innocent followers of the Divine Teacher. When
                            within but a few miles of this noted city of Damascus, behold there shone round about him a
                            light brighter than the sun, Saul, dazzled, smitten and blinded fell to the earth in terror
                            paralyzed by a spiritual manifestation which has no parallel in modern history. A voice
                            spoke from above his prostrate form, crying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Saul
                            answers, who art thou Lord? The reply came back, " I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, " Saul
                            of Tarsus inquires again, Lord what wilt thou have me to do ; " Arise and get thee into the
                            city and it shall be told thee what thou must do. " Saul arose, and was led with blinded
                            eyes into the city of Damascus, thence to the house of Ananias, who restored his sight, and
                            sent him forth as Paul preacher of the Gospel of Christ. Gifted above the men of his time,
                            as warrior, scholar and orator, he became well adapted with his spiritul gifts of healing

                                    Dominican Order, where the rule was but carelessly observed, and in which a spirit
                                    of pride and self-indulgence was creeping in among those who had promised themselves
                                    to the service of God. It was however the purpose of the Almighty to bring this
                                    community to a state of perfection, and thus a vision was granted them which aroused
                                    them to a spirit of greater fervor. One day when the brother whose duty was the care
                                    of the refectory, went to make ready for dinner he beheld, to his surprise, a number
                                    of religious sitting on the benches, perfectly motionless, but there was something
                                    so terrifying in their stillness that his very flesh seemed to creep with fear as he
                                    gazed on them. Then running to the Prior, the brother told him what he had seen,
                                    explaining that these strangers who were in the refectory gave him such awful
                                    sensations of fear that he suspected they must be demons from hell. The Prior was
                                    alarmed, and, after a moment's thought, he called the community together, and
                                    bidding them follow him to the church, he took out the Blessed Sacrament, that it
                                    might be carried in solemn procession to the refectory. He entered, followed by the
                                    brethren. Yes, it was indeed true, there sat the strange friars; but as the Prior
                                    advanced, bearing our Divine Lord in his hands, they rose and prostrated their forms
                                    to the ground, and again seated themselves as silently as before. Then said the
                                    Prior, " In the name of God, who is here present, tell me who you are and from
                                    whence you come, and what you desire. " The strange company immediately threw back
                                    their hoods and displayed countenance. )lackened as if by fire; then they opened
                                    heir habits, and the red flames were seen onsuming their very bodies, and one of
                                    them poke these terrible words :� "We are all your brethren," said the voice:
                                    "behold us who were once priors, ub-priors, masters, and lpaders; and we are all
                                    eternally lost!�Lost for our contempt of poverty, for our neglect of rule, for our
                                    pride, our slothfulness, our self-indulgence ; and we have come here to warn you,
                                    lest by ike sins you come into like condemnation. " Striking a blow upon the table,
                                    the strange company disappeared. But their visit of warning was not thrown away, for
                                    it sank so deeply into the hearts of the brethren that they became models of piety
                                    and perfection, and never afterwards gave way to the promptings of their lower

                                    and power. It is gentle enough, and active enough, and well-meaning enough, but is
                                    wanting in moral muscle. It can sweetly sing at a prayer meeting, and smile
                                    graciously when it is the right time to smile, and makes an excellent nurse to pour
                                    out, with steady hand, a few drops of peppermint for a child that feels disturbances
                                    under the waistband, but has no qualification for the robust Christian work that is
                                    demanded. One reason for this is the ineffable softness of much of what is called
                                    Christian literature. The attempt is to bring us up on tracts made up of thin
                                    exhortations and goodish maxims. A nerveless treatise on commerce or science in that
                                    style would be crumpled up by the first merchant and thrown into his waste-basket.
                                    Religious twaddle is of no more use than worldly twaddle. If a man has nothing to
                                    say he had better keep his pen wiped and his tongue still. There needs an infusion
                                    of strong Anglo-Saxon into religious literature and a brawnier manliness and more

                                    the souls of men. If, with all the thrilling reality of eternity at hand, a man has
                                    nothing to write which can gather up and master the thoughts and feelings of men,
                                    his writings and speakings are a slander on the religion which he wishes to
                                    eulogize. Morbidity in religion might be partially cured by more out-door exercise.
                                    There are some duties we can perform better on our feet than on our knees. If we can
                                    carry the grace of God with us down into everyday practical Christian work, we will
                                    get more spiritual strength in five minutes than by ten hours of kneeling. If Daniel
                                    had not served God save when three times a day he worshiped toward the temple, the
                                    lions would have certainly eaten him up. The school of Christ is as :r;uch out-door
                                    as in-door. Hard, rough work for God will develop an athletic soul. Religion will
                                    not conquer either the admiration or the affection of men by effeminacy, but by
                                    strength. Because the heart is soft is no reason why the head should be soft. The
                                    spirit of genuine religion is a spirit of great power. When Christ rides in

                            body. The duties imposed upon children, whether of a mental, or physical character, should
                            be made as pleasant and attractive as possible; and the healthful, needful plays of
                            childhood should never be ignored. Manual or mental labor should not be assigned as penance
                            for some unwise speech or act; because it creates a dislike for the tasks, from unpleasant
                            association. If the offence be a serious one, fifteen or twenty minutes of quiet reflection,
                            seated by parent or teacher, is, we think, the better remedy. To know how the children are
                            employed is the duty of parents and teachers. We recall the satisfaction expressed by a
                            mother that her daughter, an active girl of twelve years caused her so little trouble during
                            the long school vacation, consoling herself with the thought that the girl was so contented
                            to remain at home, and spend hours alone by herself with her books. Had the mother
                            accompanied the child and investigated the reading, as she should have done, she would have
                            found it to have been from Magazines and Ledgers, which were the property of an older
                            brother, who, upon the false theory, which is now rapidly losing ground, that boys can be
                            allowed to read, and engage in many pursuits, that would be considered morally detrimental
                            for their sisters was the possessor of many such books. The effect of light reading is to
                            unfit the mind for study requiring close application. It requires years of careful guidance
                            under religious influences, to eradicate the taste which should never have been acquired.
                            "Peed my lambs," was the injunction of the great Teacher whose precepts and life proved that
                            he loved the children. Both soul and body require to be fed from the wells of superior
                            intelligences resulting in salvation from ignorance and sin. Canterbury, N.

                                    said a friend whom I had often advised to change his manner of life but in vain. "
                                    And when, " replied I, "do you intend to carry into effect this determination?" "
                                    Next week I shall certainly do so, " said he. " But why not to-day; why not do so
                                    this very hour? Why incur the risk of failure by delay ?'' " Oh ! I cannot all at
                                    once break the links of so strong a chain; I must have a good opportunity�a
                                    reasonable excuse for such a step; some opportunity will doubtless arise in a few
                                    days, and then be assured, I shall avail myself of it. " As we walked and conversed
                                    thus, we arrived at a river, on the bank of which sat a man with his eyes intently
                                    fixed upon the water as it rolled along. My friend was anxious to know the reason of
                                    this, and he asked the man the reason why he looked so attentively at the river. "I
                                    wish, " replied he, " to pass to the other side of the stream; and as there is no
                                    bridge or boat, I am waiting until the water ceases to flow, and the bed of the
                                    river becomes dried up. " Turning to my companion, I said, " My friend, in this
                                    foolish man you see a picture of yourself. You lose in forming fine intentions the
                                    most precious of your days, and in waiting for some future time, at which if you
                                    arrive, your task will probably be still more difficult than it is now; you wish to
                                    pass over the stream; cast yourself in at once, and swim vigorously for the opposite
                                    shore. To wait is folly. The river flows on, and will flow on forever.

                                    very cold water, and whenever the evil appetite craved indulgence, I resorted
                                    immediately to fresh drawn water. Of this I drank what I desired, and then continued
                                    to hold water in my mouth, throwing out and taking in successive mouthfuls, until
                                    the craving ceased. By a faithful adherence to this practice for about a month / was
                                    cured! And from that time to this have been entirely free from any appetite for
                                    Tobacco.� Medical and Surg. Reporter. Dr. II. V. Miller of Syracuse furnishes the
                                    following from reliable records. A French physician investigated the effects of
                                    tobacco smoking upon thirty-eight boys, between the ages of nine and fifteen, who
                                    had formed this habit. The result was: twenty-seven presented marked symptoms of
                                    Nichotine poisoning; twenty-three serious derangements of the intellectual
                                    faculties, and a strong appetite for alcoholic drinks ; three had heart disease ;
                                    eight decided deterioration of the blood; twelve had frequent nose bleed ; ten
                                    disturbed sleep ; four ulceration of the mouth in its mucous membrane.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Happiness consists in occupation of mind..."
