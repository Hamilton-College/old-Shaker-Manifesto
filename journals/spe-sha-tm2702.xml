TEIform="persName"/> By Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> WITH the advent of the testimony of "peace on earth and good-will to men," that was heard in
                            the streets of Galilee, in the halls of Capernaum, and in the city of Jerusalem, came the
                            gathering together of kindred souls who accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ and separated
                            themselves from sin and sinners, that they might become the sons and daughters of God, and
                            be able "to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world." That the work was
                            for the direct growth of the moral and spiritual faculties, no one can dispute. It was the
                            prayer of Jesus;�"Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven." It was the
                            establishing of a kingdom among men that should embody the divine element of repentance and
                            forgiveness. In this progressive work the spiritual faculty of man was stimulated to move
                            into a higher and purer element, and this change has been beautifully and forcibly held up
                            to our view through the practical righteousness which Jesus has taught. "Blessed are the
                            peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God," and "the pure in heart for they
                            shall see God." Men were to become brethren and learn to do unto others as they would that
                            others should do unto them. This was the higher law of life, the great and good law for
                            humanity. The testimony of Jesus condemns even the manifestation of anger, and FEBRUARY, <pb n="18" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> no less that of slander. The very thoughts were to be under the
                            discipline of advanced law, and through this remoulding of the individual, the Christ life
                            was to be manifested. The disciples and apostles accepted these truths and presented them
                            fully and plainly to the children of this world, and it is these same great truths that have
                            ever been struggling to be recognized as messengers for the d liveranee of man. Witnesses
                            for freedom of thought as well as for religious liberty have arisen from time to time and
                            delivered their testimony as they were able, in favor of righteousness and against the �ins
                            of the world. During those long, dark ages when the consciences of men were bound by
                            ecclesiastical bigotry, many faithful witnesses for the word of God, testified against the
                            dominant rule of an antichristian order and look! forward to a new day of spiritual light.
                            It matters not that they have been denominate;! schismatics and heretics, their lives of
                            self-sacrifice for the promulgation of the principles of truth and for the good of humanity
                            are known and are on recoixl in their favor. In France the Albigenses were ridiculed as the
                            pure and the Beghards as those who cry for mercy. In the caves of the earth, in the depths
                            of the wlderness and in the privacy of the chamber, these despised outlaws cried day and
                            night for the blessings of the son of God to be with them. As long ami as fearful as the
                            night may have been, the anticipated morning of their deliverance was hailed at last. The
                            Friends or Quakers were the last witnesses that suffered persecution unto death in
                            consequence of their testimony before the world. A spirit of protection and toleration had
                            so grown in the minds of men that religious persecution through sectarianism, creedal power,
                            churchal authority and religious bigotry, had in part, lost its power. Through these humble
                            and faithful Christians, the light from God has made its manifestation upon the earth and
                            been the guiding star to many weary pilgrims, into the light of a pure, Christian element.
                            As the love for religious freedom began to claim the attention of reasonable and progressive
                            minds, revivals of the Pentecostal season were witnessed in many parts of the country of
                            France and Germany and more or less throughout all Europe. Among those who had accepted this
                            revelation of divine light was a large class of zealously, devoted minds, soldiers of the
                            cross of Christ, and souls gifted in the spirit of prophecy. Like the Baptist at the river
                            Jordan, they warned the people of an approaching day of God's power. "Amend your lives,
                            repent ye, the end of all things draws nigh." Their cries were for mercy, for their own
                            order, and then for the world. This was the voice of God to the children of men. It past
                            from country to country, and from city to city and entered England about the year 1706. Here
                            it was the means of a great awakening and many were baptized into the spirit of a new life.
                                <pb n="19" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> During the year 1747 a small body of these people who had been
                            recipients of the divine Spirit, were led to form themselves into a society under the
                            ministry of James and Jane Wardley, of Manchester, England. These leaders were sincerely
                            devoted to the cause of truth, and were most signally blest with manifestations of spiritual
                            light. "They possest great meekness and were very plain in their apparel, and unassuming in
                            their manners." Their testimony was like that of the primitive Christians, as they, through
                            visions and revelation, testified that Christ, the anointed Savior, was at hand and that the
                            Church was rising in its full glory and would increase till every divine promise was
                            fulfilled. It was the outpouring of the holy Spirit upon honest, prayerful souls. The public
                            devotion of the Society was in diverse operations of the power of God according as they were
                            imprest at the time. Silent meditation for an hour was not uncommon. At other times they
                            exercised in violent shakings, then changed to singing, dancing, shouting or walking the
                            floor. Sometimes they would pass and repass each other like clouds driven by a strong wind,
                            and from these exercises the people received the name of Shakers. To this little band of
                            worshipers it wras the manifestation which God had promist by the prophets;�"Yet it is a
                            little while and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry
                            land."�Hag. ii., 6, and hence the name Shakers was very appropriate although given in
                            derision. The Society, however, at a subsequent date, arranged a name by which they wisht to
                            be known and which was illustrative of their religious calling, "The United Society of
                            Believers in Christ's Second Appearing." In 1758, Ann Lee accepted the testimony of these
                            people and was baptized with them into the same inspiration that gave life to their gospel
                            mission. The religious light of the order had led them to an honest confession of every sin,
                            and to the bearing of a full cross against that which they knew to be wrong. This work
                            continued to increase in divine power until the year 1770, when the present testimony of
                            eternal life was preacht by the special revelation of God, through Ann Lee, who was at this
                            time acknowledged by the Society as their spiritual Mother in Christ, and has ever been
                            called by the Believers since that date, "Mother Ann." * Ann Lee was born on the 29th of
                            February, 1736, in Manchester, England. "The powers of her mind were remarkable, and under
                            the operation of the holy Spirit, she appeared divinely beautiful. At an early age, she was
                            peculiarly favored with religious impressions, and often a witness of heavenly visions."
                            Mother Ann and her people, like all other true witnesses of God were rejected by an
                            unbelieving world. They were clast among the false proph*For a more extended notice, see

                            perverted and misrepresented. At the hands of persecuting mobs they were exposed to extreme
                            cruelty. Their houses afforded them but slight protection, as the lawless mob assaulted them
                            with clubs and stones, breaking the doors and windows and shamefully abusing the Brethren
                            and Sisters. The last imprisonment of the Believers in England, was under the pretense of a
                            profanation of the Sabbath. This appeared to be a concerted plan of the enemies of Christ to
                            prevent Mother Ann and her little family from worshiping God on that day. A number of spies
                            had been placed in the streets under the pretense of preventing the people from profaning
                            the Lord's day. The Believers assembled that morning at the house of John Lee and began
                            their worship as usual. The spies gave the alarm and a mob was soon raised, directed by the
                            principal warden. They surrounded the building, burst open the doors and past to an upper
                            story where the Believers had assembled. The whole company were arrested and inhumanly
                            dragged from the house and thrown into prison. All, however, were set free the next morning
                            except Mother Ann, who was held under arrest for several weeks. In 1774, Mother Ann received
                            a special revelation of God to repair to America, at the same time, receiving1 the divine
                            promise that the spiritual work would be blest with a great increase. This revelation was
                            placed before the Society and permission was given to all who were able, to accompany her.
                            Those who became the companions of Mother Ann on this voyage, were William Lee, James
                            Whittaker, John Hocknell, Richard Hocknell, Abram Stanley, James Shepard, Mary Partington
                            and Nancy Lee. This little company of Believers left Liverpool, England on the 19th of May,
                            1774 and after enduring the storms and dangers of the great ocean, in an unseaworthy ship,
                            they reached New York on the 6th of August following. In America,, Mother Ann and her band
                            of followers suffered many privations. For two years, they were obliged to find employment
                            in different places, as they were not able to move to their anticipated home in the
                            wilderness of Niskeyuna, till the month of Sept. 1776, when they took up their residence in
                            the town of Watervliet, about seven miles N. W. from the city of Albany. In this place they
                            toiled industriously for a temporal support and" through agonizing prayers, offered up their
                            devotions to God for the opening of the testimony of the cross of Christ. At this time, the
                            whole country was involved in the war of the Revolution, and all persons coming from
                            England, were lookt upon with suspicion and the charge of treason was publicly preferred
                            against them, which resulted in the imprisonment of Mother Ann and several others of the
                            family in the old fort in Albany. An attempt was subsequently made to banish Mother Ann to
                            the British army. Failing to ac- <pb n="21" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> complish their object in this, she was
                            imprisoned in the jail at Poughkeepsie, but subsequently released by order of Gov. Clinton
                            of N. Y. While engaged in divine service, the Believers proclaimed a strong testimony
                            against all sin, and through the gifts of the spirit, manifested the most convincing proofs
                            of a pure and living work of God. In the spring of 1780, large numbers of people visited
                            Mother Ann and the Elders, to hear of the new and living word, and to witness the operations
                            of divine power among them. Mother Ann Lee and Father William Lee, died in the year 1784,
                            and Father James Whittaker in 1787. During this progressive, religious work that had been
                            conducted by the Believers since their arrival in America, a preparation had been going
                            forward, the consummation of which, would be the formation of societies, based on the
                            principles of united inheritance and separation from the world, and like the Apostolic
                            church, all their interests would be in common, and consecrated to religious purposes. The
                            first society was formed at New Lebanon, N. Y. in the year 1787, and has from that date,
                            been denominated the parent Society of the Order. Persons from almost every religious
                            denomination, embraced the faith and accepted the cross of Christ. They were also afflicted
                            with mockers and scoffers whose object was to seize every occasion to scandalize the work.
                            Through good and evil report, the Elders workt faithfully to establish righteousness among
                            the people. Communities may now be found in New Lebanon and Watervliet, N. Y., Hancock,

                            flee from his presence in terror, Or, like young David with pebbles be strong. Well, well he
                            knows that truth's weapons will slay him, Tho they are simple and ever at hand; Seeks he for
                            victims, he first will betray them Into the trap he has secretly planned. <pb n="22" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> He may approach Ihee with calm, pleasant greeting, Wishing thy road were less rugged and
                            straight, Ah well! he knows at the very first meeting Whether his triumph be speedy or late.
                            Thy sword with its two glittering edges he praises, Its steel, hilt and point, he examines
                            them all, Then carelessly o'er thee his keen blade he raises, And keeps thee in dread lest
                            it on thee should fall. Here is a stone that tby faith would have lifted, Had not the
                            Tempter been clearing thy path, By his adroitness it onward is shifted, Yet thou shalt meet
                            it a mountain of wrath. There is a vine that thy faith would have mangled, Torn from thy way
                            and cast into the fire, Now in its poisonous branches entangled Thou to be rid of it hath no
                            desire. Here is a fountain of zeal that is frozen, Chilled by the breath of the Tempter's
                            coid scorn, Death and not life for its tide thou hast chosen, Better for thee thou hadst
                            never been born. There is a cloud that tby faith could have broken, And shown the bright
                            rainbow concealed in its fold, Now it remains as a burial token, Over the spirit that Death
                            grimly holds. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            blessed of all the beatitudes. Purity is the basis of all goodness, truth, beauty and
                            strength as well as of all real civilization. God is love and love is purity itself. The
                            practical value and importance of this gospel of purity becomes more apparent every day in
                            these times of degenerate morals. Men and women in the world of progressive and aspiring
                            tendencies, see it to be the pearl of great price, the stone which the builders of so-called
                            civilization having rejected, must become the head of the corner. A nation is great in
                            proportion to the purity of its citizens and when general degeneracy and profligacy prevail,
                            the nation's doom is sealed as was notably instanced in the Grecian and Roman empires. Since
                            the fall of man, howev- <pb n="23" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> er, we have been without that spotless purity
                            which was the gift of the gods, the race having inherited the mark of the beast, and, as a
                            consequence, all human efforts at self-government have been ignominious failures. The
                            prophet Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the four kingdoms which were to be
                            destroyed and succeeded by the kingdom which the God of h aven should set up and which
                            should never be destroyed because founded on the chastity of Christ. This kingdom had its
                            foundation in the mission of Mother Ann who laid the ax at the root of the tree, in her
                            testimony against all the works of the serpent. Paul says : "For other foundation can no man
                            lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ," whom Mother Ann acknowledged to be her head
                            and Lord. No one but God could lay such a foundation. He sent his only Son into the world
                            that the world through him might be saved. The chaste life is not and can not be sustained
                            by mere mental determination, and by this life we mean of course, the pure, virgin life of
                            thought. Intellectual celibacy is sure some day to meet its Waterloo. "Not by might, nor by
                            power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord." By the spirit alone, then, can we sustain that
                            purity which is the food of angels. All the afflictions that flesh is heir to, are traceable
                            to the serpent, whether they be of war, famine, pestilence or poverty. It is the sensual
                            gratification that robs mankind of that indispensable prop to true, living, pure love. Love
                            is the fulfilling of the law, and purity of thought and of life, brings forth fruits of
                            love, while impurity generates hate. If mankind were bereft of all purity, by the entire
                            withdrawal of the Christ Spirit, the race would destroy itself. It is the gospel of purity,
                            not "the blood of Jesus," that must be the battle-cry of the next great religious army to
                            sweep over the world, calling many to shine as the brightness of the firmament and turn many
                            to righteousness as foretold by the Prophet. It is this everlasting gospel, to be proclaimed
                            to all peoples, nations and tongues, that will snatch mankind from the yawning chasm of sin
                            which threatens to engulf all. It is only by the power of the spirit of Christ that humanity
                            may be cleansed from the leprosy of sin. Every one truly called to the higher life is a
                            witness for truth. Only by the daily cross, where religion is an ever present reality and
                            not a Sabbath specialty, can the spirit and power of the gospel so well up in the human soul
                            as to draw all men unto it. Those who are called to this life, have a great privilege in
                            Zion. To be a good Shaker involves purity, humility, gentleness, long-suffering,
                            loving-kindness and industry. To reach that point in the growth of the soul where the things
                            which are real, are clearly discerned to be the things which are eternal and the visible to
                            be but the outward expression of the invisible, is to grasp and cherish the divine and drink
                            at that fountain of eternal love which never faileth. John wrote: "We know that we have past
                            from death unto life because we love the brethren. He that <pb n="24" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> loveth not
                            his brother abideth in death." This sentiment should be the expression of every dweller in
                            Zion. This is a love the world knows not of, because it manies and is given in marriage. By
                            no other gospel than that of purity can mankind be lifted to those supernal heights where
                            there is neither sighing nor crying and where they learn war no more. "To him that
                            overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and I will give him a white stone, and in
                            the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it." Mount

                            star, And softly shine the lights of dawning day: Lo! unseen hands the gates of life unbar,
                            And bid a child fare through the earthly way. The babe knew not what perils round him prest:
                            Love held him fast; and, as he wept and smiled, An angel said : "With peace he shall be
                            blest; He shall not feel life's tempests fierce and wild." Through fourscore years and five
                            his soul hath found In quietness and confidence its strength, And still he seeks that
                            knowledge without bound, Of love the wondrous height and breadth and length. O happy soul,
                            turned ever toward the light! For thee with light all life and death shall shine; Rare
                            Heavenly visions open to thy sight: All good thy heart can hold is freely thine. O Breath

                            When through this life his patient feet have trod, Before him may the endless bliss unfold!

                            every intelligent person is supposed to admit, that life is progressive ; for if not, it
                            would be a contradiction of terms and not be life. The present ideal, when attained, only
                            finds the vision extended and the possibilities greater for a further advancement. Reasoning
                            from these premises, the reply to the question,�Can we attain unto the perfect ideal? must
                            be answered in the negative. This is eternal progression. The environments which, dependent
                            upon education and temperament, have given the limit, beyond which our comprehension does
                            not extend, are only removed by the operation in our lives,- of a superior force which we
                            may term the higher will power, which is inherent in every soul, however undevelopt; but
                            ready to respond when the proper conditions exist for its growth. The experience of
                            missionaries among the lowest types of humanity, is evidence that in the majority of cases,
                            the presentation of advanced ideas, finds conditions ready for their acceptance. This ideal
                            life is at times personified in individuals who, having attained unto that exalted state
                            which enables them to understand truths, that to the masses, are a sealed volume; and being
                            placed where they can point the way that must be traveled to reach the higher vantage ground
                            that is seen beyond. The worshipful faculty in the soul, that causes it to deify the being
                            who has made these attainments, is a legitimate one, being the most powerful incentive
                            known, to stimulate its progress. The good old adage that "a contented mind is a continual
                            feast," does not imply a state of lethargy. There is a nobler discontent; and the races
                            which to-day lead the world in all that pertains to true progress, were the ones tluit
                            dissatisfied with present conditions, and perceiving the truth with less mixture of error
                            boldly proclaimed their independence of antiquated forms, and moved forward in the
                            increasing light. The restless condition of modern thought, in its religious, scientific and
                            miscellaneous departments, indicates not a fevered condition of an ebbing tide, whose mighty
                            flow has borne it upward to its present position; but that the current of its life forces is
                            strong, and will carry forward human life to that exalted ideal which the most advanced
                            minds have given it illustrations. The danger lies not in the quickening into more life the
                            latent forces that dwell there, but in their suppression. The upheavals, that in the past
                            have overthrown governments and destroyed civilizations, were the result of efforts to
                            suppress investigation and compel the mind to wear garments that were outgrown and only
                            adapted to the infancy of the race. When the advocates of that infernal system of chattle
                            slavery, undertook to prop it up, by striving to suppress the efforts to enlighten, the
                            words of the Divine Teacher be- <pb n="26" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> came appropriate, "For men love darkn
                            ss rather than light, because their deeds are evil." That testimony can be applied to every
                            phase of human existence. 1 he powers that for ages have claimed the divine right to rule,
                            are being disturbed by the quickening of that divinity in the soul which has so long
                            slumbered but is now asking, Are not those fountains of living waters whereof if a soul
                            driuketh it shall never die, also for us? That all men are created equal, that they are
                            endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty
                            and the pursuit of happiness. This ideal, illustrated in that immortal document, the
                            Declaration of Independence, must be actualized before that day which is reasonably expected
                            will dawn,�The Millennium. Class distinctions and all the artificial barriers that at
                            present disintegrate society would disappear, "for the knowledge of the Lord would cover the
                            earth as the waters cover the sea." It has been truly said, that human life is better than
                            its creeds ; proving the fact that the interior or soul life, no matter how much encumbered
                            by externalities can not be effectually hindered in its upward march. That every action
                            which is in accord with the ideal, is a force which helps to realize the truth "that each
                            to-morrow finds us farther than to-day." Looking down the dim vistas that separate the
                            present from even the historic past, we see that progress has been made. Looking forward, we
                            see greater attainments to be realized. For whoever seeks to place limits to the development
                            of the soul, is in danger of being crusht in its onward march. For like an army with
                            banners, are the hosts that have been marshaled to aid in the uplifting of human life above
                            the mists and shadows, and where can be seen the glorious ideal of a perfected humanity.

                                G. Reed. Jan. 1897. Editor Manifesto;�I have just been filled with the life-giving
                                spirit of the gospel, having freely partaken of the bread and waters of life fresh from
                                the spiritual conservatory of heaven. To-day the North family met with the Church in
                                worship and the heavenly avenues were opened and the indwellers of the celestial temple
                                were with us in spirit and in truth. Elder Giles was with us as a minister of the power
                                of the world to come. He repeated some things that he had spoken befoi'e, viz: Hear ye
                                my people! The Lord's work is in its infancy. You will be surprised at the
                                manifestations of his power. There is light emanating from the Spirit world that will
                                prove the fulfillment of the prophecies delivered to the Shakers during the period of
                                time between 1837 and 1846. Ministering spirits are busily engaged in sowing the seeds
                                of a Spiritual Revival among mankind that will raise them from the mire of worldliness
                                and its degradation into a higher life emanating from God the Father and Mother of all
                                the souls of the human family. There will be a sifting and a separation of the chaff and
                                the wheat. The wheat among my people will be pure, and will yield unto the needy and the
                                hungry, the bread of life and living fountains will pour forth for the thirsty, the
                                waters of eternal life. They that truly drink thereof, shall not thirst again for the
                                bitter waters of Sodom. Tribulation lies in the pathway of my people. I see it rise like
                                a dense, dark cloud. When the harvest day shall come, those who shall garner the wheat,
                                will need the whole armor of God. Our meeting was one that will not soon be forgotten by
                                the thoughtful who attended it. Many were deeply imprest, as the emanations of their
                                overflowing spirits clearly indicated. It is a time of general health in our family,
                                also of the Society, and a spirit of unity prevails, feeling� "Fis selfishness only that

                                even a New Year, the year of our Lord 1897. Righteousness belongs to the Lord thus ;
                                "Holi- <pb n="28" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> ness unto the Lord," is a fitting password for the present
                                year. The past season is pleasantly remembered by the visit of Eldress Alvira Conklin
                                and Sister Harriet Jones of the Albany Co. Community. Sister Harriet was formerly a
                                member of the Philadelphia Society. By kind invitation, a party from this place,
                                attended the Christmas Entertainment held at the Second family. The afternoon was
                                devoted to musical recitations and dialogs. The singing of that choice hymn, "There'll
                                be no dark valley when Jesus comes," contained in the Christmas number of the "Christian
                                Herald and Signs of our Times," was one of the fine features of the Sociable. The
                                musical dialog, "What did Jesus say?" was most creditably rendered by six young Sisters.
                                The military march given by the junior members added largely to the interest of the
                                occasion. Br. Henry Hallett's personification of an English Auctioneer, Dry Goods'
                                Merchant and Landlord, produced a spirit of mirth among his audience. Another lively
                                event of the proceedings, was the rendering of a dialog on Physiology by three boys; the
                                article was prepared by Br. Ernest Pick. "The Coming Woman," perfectly executed by four
                                little girls. At the close of the program, dainty refreshments were liberally served. We
                                were all blest by the pleasant service, and we live in the pleasant anticipation of
                                another reunion at the next Christmas day. Oenevieve DeGraw. North Family. Jan. 1897.
                                To-day, as on several previous Sabbaths, we attended religious service in the Church
                                family's home chapel. They have a most beautiful room, large and convenient for seating
                                a goodly company in the centre and for exercise in the march when the outer circle is
                                formed. We have been greatly strengthened in spiritual union and Christian fellowship,
                                by frequent mingling and commingling of soulful gifts, uplifting testimony and inspiring
                                song. How pleased we would be, to meet with all the families in turn during the winter
                                months. Our dear Canaan friends spent the Sabbath with us at the close of the year and
                                we were only too glad to have them feel that we loved them as only gospel kindred can
                                love. We would be happy if some generous hand would give them a lift in building up and
                                sustaining their lovely home. May God bless all Zion through his instrumentalities, that
                                prosperity and peace may reign in her courts. The spiritual cause is first in our
                                hearts; but while we are inhabitants of this mundane sphere, we are under physical
                                necessity and have material needs. Job said that "He never saw the righteous forsaken
                                nor his seed begging bread." So if we work along the lines of righteous endeavor in
                                earning our bread, and keep free from the entanglements of the world, we shall be "blest
                                in our basket and in our store." We have no sleighing as yet; mountain roads are rough.
                                Brethren are threshing by water power, and sawing wood when the mill pond is low. There
                                are five members in our home that were not here at the beginning of the past year. Our
                                good Brother, Levi Shaw, now nearly eighty years of age, is an honor to the Christian
                                Communism, a shining light among the upright in character, and a blessing in his home
                                where he is much beloved. Beloved Brother Alonzo Hollister, who occasionally attends our
                                Sabbath evening meeting, is always a welcome visitor; his beautiful, chaste spirit wears
                                the mark of angelhood. Love, joy and peace be with the whole household of faith. An
                                especial blessing to those who sustain and continue our monthly Manifesto. May the
                                increase of precious truth, be borne on its leaves for the uplifting and "healing of the
                                nations." Martha J.

                                enacted, how nice it would be if our Editor was with us to view the characters as they
                                were portrayed by the actors. The young people managed the entertainment, which
                                reflected great credit in selections and rendering. We send program as it was enacted
                                Christmas evening at the South family. Our home talent from the North being represented
                                in the following. Golden Bells, Song. The Seasons, Dialog. What ailed the Pudding,

                                the following, which was very nicely rendered. Twelve Christian Virtues, Dialog. Jesus'
                                Seat, Recitation. The Answered Advertisement, The Ship of Life. That ancient and honored
                                prophet of the Lord, Melchisedek, appeared in the entertainment, clad in the robes of
                                his priestly office, on his mission of collecting tithes, with which he set up an altar
                                and offered a burnt offering. The entertainment lasted from 4 till 7 p. m., when,
                                adjourning to the dining-hall, refreshments were served. We have been both entertained
                                and instructed, in the perusal of some of the writings of Thomas A. Kempis. Living in
                                what is termed the dark ages of the Christian era, his was a mind largely free from
                                theological bigotry and had an understanding of spiritual gifts, which places him in the
                                ranks, as one of the inspired teachers of the race. He was translated in the year 1471
                                at 91 years of age. Our friend, Simon Emery hits the nail on the head in his letter in
                                the Jan. Manifesto. We fully endorse the sentiments there exprest. Whoever receives the
                                gift to minister the gospel, must let their light shine, and proclaim from the
                                house-top, that testimony which has been unfolded to their spiritual understanding.

The Christmas and New Year greetings will have long been past before this
                                comes to the readers of The Manifesto. Yet is not every day that comes to us a part of
                                the New Year, and shall we not strive to make it a happy one for our fellow men? Lite is
                                made up of such little periods and if we would live righteously one day at a time, not
                                only one year would be pleasant and happy, but the whole lifetime would be filled with
                                true pleasure and happiness. Christmas witli us was a very pleasant season. Santa Claus
                                did not forge t to visit the children, much to their delight; neither did he pass the
                                older ones by; every one from our aged fathers, who are in the eighties, to the little
                                one seven years old. The Christmas dinner was a feast of goodies. Our meeting was a
                                season filled with rejoicing over the victories won through the faith and life of Him
                                whose birth we celebrated. Peace on earth good-will to all was our theme, with many new
                                resolves to walk more closely in the footsteps of our blessed Lord and Savior. In the
                                evening the members of the Bible Class and Sunday School, gave an entertainment, which
                                consisted of singing, reading compositions, written expressly for the occasion, and
                                reciting dialogs, all of which occupied two hours. The time was very pleasantly and
                                profitably filled. At the close, Elder Henry <pb n="30" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> Green made some very
                                appropriate remarks and all were invited to the diningroom where they partook of
                                ice-cream, cake and chocolate, after which "Good Night to all" was sung and we retired
                                to rest, feeling it had indeed been a Merry Christmas. It is hoped that love and
                                good-will filled the heart of every one. At this writing, the ground is bare. Ice thick

Since our last call at the "Home Corner," the holidays have come and gone,
                                with all their messages of love and courage. We have exchanged the "Merry Christmas"
                                greetings, and have felt the renewal of the Christ spirit, a new birth into the divine
                                life, so many years ago personified. The New Year has presented us its sealed volume,
                                and as we commence the daily writing, we resolve to follow closely each line of the
                                divine copy, that each day present a well written page in the year's history. Tho we
                                know not how difficult may be the lessons on the pages that follow, yet with true
                                Christian faith to control and direct, we will endeavor to pen each page with care. Snow
                                has not been very plentiful with us as yet. At present there are a few lone flakes,
                                wandering in an aimless, bewildered manner through the air, as tho uncertain that they
                                had appeared in the right place, and finally falling to the earth and disappearing from
                                sight. The channel of life, connecting our world with that above, is flowing smoothly at
                                present. We feel daily the blessings borne on its waters, to us, and our gratitude flows
                                back in an equally warm and bountiful current to the wise Giver of these blessings.
                                Still amid its ebbs and tides, which once in a while, rise above the daily mark and
                                threaten our coast, one has visited us by the illness of Br. Ira. We trust it will break
                                and roll back to the sea, foaming and bright, for the greater force of its action. Our
                                hope and earnest prayer is, that our loved Brother may soon recover. Yet not selfishly
                                would we desire it alone, but that we might see him free from the suffering which his
                                illness involves. We see in the morning, the sturdy teams ascending the rugged mountain
                                sides, and judge that the wood-choppers are wielding their axes to advantage. Cruel
                                indeed, as when in the early colonial days, men were mercilessly snatched from their
                                native homes, by the greedy invaders; these kingly trees are torn from their forest
                                homes, to be slaves of their owners. We hesitate about sending our New Year greeting
                                when we look at the calendar which says "10 days past," but reading further, we find,
                                "to come, 355," and conclude that a sufficient number of days are left before the year
                                grows old. So to all gospel kindred, far and near, from the rugged mountain home, to the
                                leyel plains, we extend our best wishes for a happy and blessed New Year. Fidelia

                                as is becoming a class professing the name of Christ. What does it profit a society if
                                its ability to help humanity is kept in a nutshell of spiritual apathy? If God helps

                                who would reach their ideal of Christianity must expect to become weary sometimes.
                                Storms are necessary gifts of creation; they invigorate more than they destroy, and no
                                mortal can under all conditions be full of merry, rippling joy, for the innate elements
                                that crave better qualities must expect hard trials and only by a strong spirit of
                                decision that sounds a genuine yea to right and a decided nay to wrong, can reach the
                                top of progression's steps, where victory over all that debases stands radiant in her
                                glory, giving to all victors her rewards of joy, rest and soul happiness. On Christmas
                                evening, we enjoyed an entertainment, in which thirty of the younger members took part.

                                time that is coming, as that may afford us an opportunity the better to prepare for it.
                                If the voice of prophecy is to be relied on, there is a time coming when nations shall
                                leai n war no more. The savageness of human beings in war and the savagery of wild
                                beasts seem quite alike in the results, and it is a wonder that after so many thousands
                                of years so little has been learned of the loving kindness of our God. This testimony of
                                peace on earth, which the Christ mission, publisht, should be the accepted mission of
                                Believers, and faithfully publisht to the world. With the return of Christmas comes the
                                renewed Christian thought of God's love to man, and to know that this has been generally
                                observed throughout the several Communities of Believers, adds much to the pleasant
                                remembrance of the day. By the young, especially, the yearly visit of St. Nicholas is
                                one of great joy, and it is well for old and young to have pleasure in the anticipation.
                                The receiving of <pb n="32" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> gifts, and the cheerful entertainments may all
                                contribute to the great sum of human enjoyment, and be the means of helping forward the
                                beautiful mission of peace. Like our Brethren and Sisters in other Communities, East

At

                            Sixty-five head of cattle were in the barn, but the Brethren were able to unloose and drive
                            out all except five quite young animals. As the herdsman was in the family Dwelling at the
                            time of the alarm, the origin of the fire is not known. The barn was 124 ft. by 45 ft.
                            Several other buildings adjoining the barn were burned at the same time. There was a loss of
                            150 tons of hay, 30 tons of meal, an ensilage cutter, a corn husker and several other
                            farming tools. Elder George Wilcox says he would not have taken $20,000 for the loss. The

                                Visions, have chosen a beautiful title for a beautiful subject. Then follows a Christmas
                                sermon and that must be good, as all who think of Christmas, think of a good time when
                                all sorrow shall flee away. The illumination of Death spreads a beautiful light over
                                what some would make a scene of sorrow. One writer has chosen lor his text, The beauty
                                of the Lord,�Psalms xc, 17, and this beauty permeates the whole of his article. The
                                Pulpit is now able to publish the portraits of the several writers, which adds much to
                                the value of the Magazine. Pub. by G. Holzapfel, Fredericksburg, Fa. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Phrenological annual" TEIform="index"/>The Phrenological
