                            OF. MT. LEBANON, N. Y. NO 2.</head><p TEIform="p">Origin of the Church. Since the first preaching of the gospel in America, the Believers have
                            had seven years of experience, aud it was thought best to establish a Community. In the
                            month of September, 1787 all who had accepted the faith were notified by the three united
                            Elders, that those living in the vicinity of New Lebanon, if they so desired, could on
                            application, be gathered into the Church. Many of the Believers, who were able to so adjust
                            their business and social relations as to warrant their change of residence, sought the
                            privilege to become members of the new-formed family. As might be expected, a discrimination
                            must be made, and those who were still in bondage to the world could not be received.
                            Unmarried persons and adults free from debt, or independent of all obligations to others
                            were generally admitted, and also some of the children by the free consent of their parents.
                            The Elders considered it a sacred duty to exercise great care in the formation of this first
                            Family, as upon this care depended much of their success. Those who were not sound in the
                            faith, or were not exemplary persons as well as those who were involved in debt or in
                            bondage to their natural relations were not permitted to become members. An order called a
                            "family relation," distinct from the Church was also established, in which the members were
                            not required to follow, so closely, the rules of the senior order. Before the close of the
                            year 1787 the Church had a membership of more than one hundred persons. Hezekiah Hammond,
                            Jonathan Walker, David Darrow and others having consecrated their houses and lands, for the
                            good of the Society, it made ample provision for the Believers for gardening, but not for
                            farming. The limited number ot' dwellings, however, very poorly accommodated the many
                            members who had entered the new home, but these privations were borne with patience till
                            more buildings could be erected and more land purchased. At the beginning of 1788, Elder
                            Calvin Harlow and David Meacham went on a journey to visit the Believers in the several
                            states, and left Elder Joseph Meacham to close the organizing of the Church, and to direct
                            the affairs of those who lived in the vicinity of New Lebanon and Watervliet.<pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> On their return they saw with pleasure the success that had attended the
                            labors of Elder Joseph, and at once ac knowledged him as their superior, and the proper
                            person to stand as the director of the Society. It also became evident to the people, by the
                            gift of penetration and wisdom with which he was endowed, and the talent of ministration
                            which he possessed, that he had a parental gift, and was thenceforth unanimously
                            acknowledged and addressed as "Father" by the members of the Community. By revelation,
                            Father Joseph saw what should be the order of the Church of Christ. It must be a united
                            body, composed of men and women, and the members must be responsible to those who were
                            appointed to be the directors. That an order of Ministry should preside over the whole
                            Church, wherever they might be located, and that an order of Elders should be appointed ia
                            each of the several families, to be the directors in the spiritual management, aud an order
                            of Trustees, to take charge of the temporal interests, in buying and selling, and in the
                            holding of the deeds of the real estate. Every branch of the Zion of God must be under a
                            directing influence, as vested in these several orders, and as the governing spirit was to
                            be the consecration of soul and body to God, selfishness must be ignored and the government
                            shared equally by the Brethren and Sisters. It was also found necessary to establish a
                            system of orders, rules or regulations, for the safe guidance, protection and harmony of all
                            the members. Father Joseph saw the order of the spiritual Kingdom, and the Christian union
                            that should exist between the members, and make of men and women who embraced the faith,
                            Sons and Daughters of God. The selfish relations which formed the life of the old
                            inheritance, must be shaken off and left among the children of the world, and a new
                            inheritance gained in the spiritual relations of Brother and Sister in the pure testimony of
                            Christ. It was on this foundation that Father Joseph established the Church, and in union
                            with the body, an order of Ministry was formed as the leading authority. This order
                            consisted of two Brethren and two Sisters. Father, Joseph Meacham, Abiatha Babbett, Mother,
                            Lucy Wright, Ruth Landon. During the year 1788, the Church at New Lebanon was organized and
                            the several officers appointed to their respective places of trust. From this date a greater
                            distinction was made between the spiritual and temporal departments, although a
                            manifestation of union and consecrated interest governed the whole. It now became necessary
                            to provide more extended accommodations for the family, and a dwelling was soon in process
                            of construction. The frame-work was raised on the 27th of August 1788. A large number of
                            workmen were employed, who contributed their services gratuitously, and so rapidly was the
                            work pushed forward that the family began to occupy it on the following Christmas. The
                            progress this year consisted mostly in the gathering of the members, and in the arranging of
                            the temporal affairs. The limited accommodations<pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> subjected the family
                            to much inconvenience, which with the plainness and scarcity of provisions, required of them
                            much Cbristiau kiudness and a large store of patience. The whole section of country for many
                            miles around that of the Community, suffered more or less from the unfruitfulness of the
                            season. The Brethren and Sisters were so deeply absorbed in their work for God and for
                            humanity, that they gave themselves but little rest from their daily labor. In their
                            religious devotions they manifested the same untiring zeal, and this with their testimony of
                            the sharp sword against all the sins of the world, gave them but little time for anything
                            else. They were learning that they must make a full consecration of soul and body to God,
                            and for the blessing of his people. The year 1789 followed on very much as the one already
                            recorded. In 1790 the temporal duties of the family were more carefully adjusted and a
                            system of order much better established. Elder Calvin llarlow was appointed to take charge
                            of the Society at Hancock, which Community was formed in the month of September. Sarah
                            Harrison was also appointed to the Ministry. The other members of the order were selected
                            from the Society at Hancock. As the formation of several Societies in New England was about
                            to take place, the senior Minister for the Brethren, as well as for the Sisters was sent
                            from the Society of New Lebanon, and the others were chosen from the place where the
                            Community was formed. In May 1791, Eleazar Rand and Hannah Kendall moved to Harvard, Mass.,
                            and in February 1792, Job Bishop and Hannah Goodrich moved to Canterbury. In Feb. 1793, John
                            Barnes and Sarah Kendall were appointed to the Society at Alfred, Me. The eight delegates
                            were received as the parents in church relation and addressed as such in the Societies where
                            they resided. In this way four Bishoprics were established, according to the order of the
                            gospel church, all having secondary branches. For the maintenance of union, and to sustain a
                            spiritual relation to the Central Church, these Ministers made it a rule to visit the
                            Community at New Lebanon once or more each year.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Coming of Christ" TEIform="index"/>THE COMING OF CHRIST.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Danforth, Nancy G."

                            glory." The clouds of heaven must be composed of something beside the murky vapors arising
                            from the earth. Then where shall we seek the clouds of heaven? We read of ''clouds of
                            witnesses." "Ye are my witnesses if ye do whatsoever I command you." "Behold they come as
                            clouds." From these and similar passages of Scripture, we learn that people are sometimes
                            called clouds. Then why might not the clouds in which Christ should appear, be a people?
                            Then there must be found a people watching and praying, ready to receive their King. More
                            than a century ago there was a great shaking in the kingdom of antichrist, when the
                            rottenness of all man-made creeds became apparent to many illuminated minds. Then was the
                            cry heard, "What must I do to be<pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> saved?" After severe struggle and
                            mortification to a proud, haughty nature, their spirits became willing to accept deliverance
                            on any terms ; when, lo ! in a secluded place, there appeared the glory of man, even a woman
                            clothed with power from God, insomuch that it caused sinners to awake and fear in her
                            presence, for by this power she was enabled to read their wicked lives and expose their
                            hidden abominations. Herein was power. The great glory was manifested in mercy and tender
                            compassion for the humble souls who williugly laid down their lives of sin at the altar of
                            confession, showing their repentance by walking in "newness of life." This spirit has
                            continued, with faithful souls, to the present day. Many can testify that He has come "in
                            ten thousand of his saints." He has come in clouds of living witnesses, who stand daily at
                            the altar witnessing the honesty of souls who come humbly, as before God, desiring a
                            cleansing from all the "fihhiness of the flesh" and the bondage of a corrupt inheritance.
                            The lowly soul that seeks help in the order of God, or in presence of his appointed
                            witnesses, never fails of receiving the blessing, which shows plainly that the Christ or
                            Anointed Savior has appeared as truly in these last days as He was manifested in Jesus of
                            Nazareth many year? ago, and the work is as much out of sight of the worldly-wise as it was
                            hidden from the Jews. Nevertheless it is a living fact known and understood by those who do
                            the work. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To sell the Christ within us..." TEIform="index"/>To sell the Christ within us...

                            a white horse signifies, in a spiritual sense, victory, gladness, and rejoicing. The bow is
                            a symbol of forethought. What is it that subdues circumstance, accident, tumult, and

                            partially exemplified in the mob rule of the French Revolution, and in the avuwed sentiments
                            and purposes of the Russian Nihilists. Nevertheless, unwillingness on- the part of the
                            majority to exercise the controlling faculties of calculation and foresight can never
                            justify avarice, oppression and extortion in those who do, for both justice and mutual
                            benevolence hold that the party rendering the inferior service is entitled to compensation
                            from the served, equivalent in kind to that in which itself is deficient, and where this is
                            fairly and honorably rendered, there is no just cause for grievous complaint of the
                            advantages either party reaps from the toil of the other. As the bow sends forth the arrow
                            that secures the prey, so forethought sends the world's labor and capital, (which represents
                            and commands labor,) along the course of intelligent design, and wrests victory, gladness
                            and rejoicing, from time, nature, circumstance and fate. This principle or faculty, so
                            potent in its application to earthly affairs, is indispensable to spiritual unfoldment,
                            discipline and progress. It has been observed that "it is only by forethought, or by
                            intently aiming at a specific end, to the attainment of which, lesser objects are regarded
                            at best as subservient, that man endures with undiverted purpose." And as "Good associates
                            only with the directing will and permanent purpose," so also "It is only by a determinate
                            course, pursued in a given direction, with reference to an attainable object, that the
                            development of the will can be accomplished." Hence the careful, and often prayerful
                            exercise of forethought is necessary to the rule of reason over animal appetite and passion,
                            and it is not likely that any sane person who can be persuaded to attentively contemplate
                            the certain results of different lines of conduct, will voluntarily choose an evil course
                            while the good is open before him, any more than he would with his eyes open in the day
                            time, rush upou a deadly weapon, or into deep mire in preference to walking ia a clear and
                            clean way ; or, more than the ordinary mind would choose poverty before wealth, or prefer
                            hate to love, or misery to happiness, or bondage to freedom. For the inexorable law is, that
                            every pleasure has its price, fixed and equal to all, without paying which, it cannot be
                            enjoyed. And while one class of pleasures has to be paid for after enjoyment, in suffering,
                            poverty and slavery, until the last farthing is exacted, the other class require prepayment,
                            and constantly enrich, while they may be enjoyed with the largest liberty of the faculties
                            exercised in procuring them. If we will meditate often on eternity, the accidents of this
                            mortal life will less trouble us, and the thoughts drawn from thence will give us a
                            spiritual strength that will carry us over many obstacles. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="As, from the creedal and numerical point of view..." TEIform="index"/>

TEIform="index"/>"WHAT IS TRUTH?"</head><p TEIform="p">Truth in a qualified sense, may be considered as the reality of the Universe. There are a
                            variety of Truths, which may be classified under the heads of Scientific, Moral, Theological
                            and Spiritual: each and all in their diverse applications bearing upon human weal, and
                            helping to furnish the real man and woman and make them efficient in good works. The
                            Mojalist seeks Truth, the application of which will elevate man in his social relations and
                            make him a better citizen, wiser, more just and honest in his dealings with his fellow man,
                            temperate in all things, sober and considerate in word and action, neither giving nor taking
                            offense ; but reducing the beautiful theories which he has conceived to practice, i. e. to
                            be governed by the law of right. The Scientist, in his department of labor, probes the
                            elements, searches the earth's interior, dives into the depths of the ocean, and leans the
                            illimitable stellar regions to obtain knowledge and understanding of things hitherto hidden
                            from mortal vision ; thus educating the race to a truer conception of the Divine Architect.
                            Without such knowledge we would have very crude and imperfect ideas of the earth under our
                            feet, and of the heavens above us, and be correspondingly limited in the use and application
                            of our faculties to the honor and glory of God, and to the benefit of ourselves and each
                            other. The Theologian who is honest and sincere in his search for truth in the religious
                            field, and is prompted by noble sentiments and high aspirations to save immortal souls, will
                            be blest in his efforts to aid the progress of humanity. But in this broad field there is
                            and has been a great diversity of opinions ; many speculations and conflicting ideas arising
                            many times from different organisms, being constitutionally diverse in modes of feeling, and
                            the capacity to comprehend spiritual Truth, which is ever developing and revealing new forms
                            of life and beauty through psychological forcer. But ofteuer, because the vast majority fail
                            to make right doing, the foundation or substratum and test of right thinking. Here we find
                            some theological disputants forming Deities after their own modes of thought, constituted of
                            parts and passions like themselves ; and creating a Theology as contradictory as it is
                            inconsistent, representing G-od as being at one time moved by love and then again by anger
                            and jealousy, moods and tempers by which we would hardly be willing to own that we ourselves
                            were governed. If we judge Deity by our intuitive perception of the best qualities, and the
                            revelation He has made of Himself in the noblest and most spiritually elevated human beings
                            claiming to be his messengers, we must conclude that He and She are the perfect embodiment
                            of Wisdom and Love in the broadest sense and most significant application of those terms.
                            The Father and Mother of the Universe of Mind. But to narrow the Infinite down to finite
                            comprehension is impossible, and the finite mind forms many absurd and grotesque notions in
                            attempting to grasp it. Truths, like precious gems, lie scattered here and there to be
                            gathered and appropriated by whomsoever found. Real religious spiritual Truth, which<pb n="175" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> flows from the deep emotional and devotional feelings of the soul, is
                            superior to all other Truths ; its province being to inspire, to energize, expand and
                            elevate the character, and it is the grand center to which all other truths converge. There
                            is power in it, which few comparatively speaking, have as yet, ever conceived of; a power
                            emanating from the throne of Deity ! Who shall withstand its mighty influence? It will
                            eventually progress mankind to the condition and position in the scale of being that they
                            were created to occupy ; lords of creation, ruling not by animal strength, but through love,
                            which is the most potent force known in the realm of mind. It will subdue all opposing
                            forces in its course of action till God shall be all in all from center to circumference,
                            the Alpha and Omega. Blessed forevermore, shall be this power that permeates all things
                            animate and rational! To it we bow in reverence and filial love. With Truth for our motto we
                            will move on to peifect victory ; and love shall be oue of our guiding stars in our progress
                            home to God. "Love is a fountain deep and pure, Love will make us firm and sure, Love will
                            banish every wrong, Love shall be our constant song. Hail! all hail! the power of love,
                            Wafted from the spheres above, Joining every heart in one, Father, Mother, Daughter, Son.
                            May we ever keep in view, How this love creates anew, Every trusting, pleading soul, Under
                            its benign control. It doth brightpn as our sight, Opes to catch new rays of light. 'Mid the
                            changing scenes of life, 'Mid the conflicts and the strife. Love shall ever be my theme;
                            Blessed power on which to lean ; And, on this consecrated spot, This pledge I give, refuse
                            it not." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            blessings manifold. Manners should be more than formal, Systems of external rules; They
                            should represent the life� Of every scholar in Christ's school. Pure and peaceful, kind and
                            loving, Sons and daughters of the Lord; Chastening every act and motive, Wholly in good
                            works absorbed. Youthful friends, let gentle manners, Give your lives their first impress ;
                            Peacefully through life they'll lead you, Bless you in the hour of death. Gentle manners, so

                            rife. Gentle manners, aid in giving Grandeur to the youthful mind; Beautifying their
                            deportment, And their language is refined. And through all life's varied changes, In our
                            pilgrimage below, Pleasantly they'll journey with us, And intelligence bestow. In acceptance
                            of this treasure, We have something always new ; Bearing peace to humble cottage, Making
                            every home more true. Summer heat or chill of winter, Changes not this gift so rare : To
                            possess it more than talents. Wealth nor beauty can compare. Gentle manners cultivated, Form

                            good effect. In society well-ordered, Gentle manners should abound; And of language coarse
                            and vulgar, We should never hear the sound.<pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> But alas ! it sometimes

                            Thus, devoted to our duty In God's love we shall prevail; Moral principles increasing,
                            Gentle manners never fail. Lovely plants be cultivating, All obnoxious weeds destroy ; Our

                            wisdom, We in loving memory keep : Whatsoever a man soweth, That also he'll surely reap. Mt.

                            work in their season, but because human calculations upon them are not fulfilled and
                            realized. When we see generations wasting away under the hand of time, we feel it. When our
                            faith is called in question we often call up the recollection, that our parents in Eden
                            peopled the world; Noah and his household, after grrat restrictions, started humanity again
                            after the deluge. Abraham received the promise to stand as father to the Jews, and God
                            promised the Messiah through that line, and we almost hold our breath, startled, when we see
                            how many times the people stood on the borders of utter destruction, but Jesus was born and
                            with the twelve, overthrew Judaism and introduced the more advanced truths of Christianity.
                            Nineteen out of twenty would have predicted the overthrow of Christianity at the crucifixion
                            before the destruction of Jerusalem. But it survived and triumphed, beautifully illustrating
                            that instruments may be struck down but truth will run its course aud clear the way for
                            brighter truths. Succeeding witnesses kept the fire burning through the dark ages. Mother
                            Ann and the Elders were called to leave nearly all they had preached to in England, and open
                            the doctrine of the last resurrection in America, single-handed and alone. In such times we
                            cling to faith as something unspeakably precious, leave the whole matter iu the hands of a
                            higher power and pass ou to our duty. We believe from evidence unquestionable that every
                            mansion in heaven is dual in its order. From the parental ruling power, down through every
                            grade of spirits, reasoning from what we see in created worlds, we must conclude that all
                            are male and female either in God's order or out of it. If iu order, they harmonize in all
                            law aud action allowed and practiced, which forms their heaven. If out of order, they form a
                            hell of confusion fearful to contemplate. We know comparatively nothing of what goes on in
                            higher orders, how they harmonize or what in; but judging from the life and practice which
                            God's law rules us into, we cannot believe that we shall again descend, to act over low
                            scenes which we have risen out of, after we have by patient travel become elevated. In our
                            present state we are<pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> even in nature's order a spirit world, in the
                            most rudimental condition which spirits can exist in. The natural world is like a
                            wide-spread nursery, like starting plants, merely to begin human existences. An infant
                            spirit is begotten in organized matter under the law in nature, if right, where the
                            begetting ought to be done. God's law, and sound philosophy and rational progression rules
                            it out of the spiritual order. "We are clothed with matter to chain us to the earth, and
                            formed with organs suitable to at in this our first work, till higher light readies us.
                            There low down in nature while begetting offspring, the harmonial relation ought to exist
                            between the sexes and stamp itself upon their generations. But this harmony, however
                            cordial, cannot raise the parties above the earth. Adam and Eve started in the flesh ; their
                            race have for six thousand years continued in it, and should they exist here a million ages,
                            unaided by a higher power they would never advance one step out of it. The Spiritualists
                            received light, which taught them some things beyond a male God, male angels, and a heaven
                            all in the masculine gender. Their revelations taught them male and female in Deity, and
                            through all the heavenly orders. But as a people they were never called to separate flesh
                            and spirit, or lust from a pure Christ-like love, and never attempted to do it. They prized
                            the sensual enjoyments of the flesh beyond anything that nature or revelation ever gave
                            them. In this state of mind, why should they not wish to daub and plaster the whole heavens
                            over, with the same darling lusts which they all looked up to as their highest heaven and
                            happiness. This may be passed over by those who are dark and were never spiritually
                            enlightened : but what kind of an excuse can any render who have learned better, know better
                            and have practiced better, and have held up a more excellent testimony. I have no doubt
                            there are two classes of sinners. It stands confessed that there are ignorant sinners. Jesus
                            recognizes them and says, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin, but
                            now they have no cloak for their sin." Jesus patiently taught them and they would not obey.
                            They were like counterfeit Chiistians in this day. Jesus recognizes such as wilful
                            transgressors, and so do we. And what else are they? When those who are young begin to
                            mingle with older sinners, and they are invited into sin which they have been taught to
                            shun, and they yield; do they do it ignorantly? When enticed and hired, and through a lively
                            conscience, the well-remembered counsel of friends pleads with them to abstain and they heed
                            it not, but pass on to destruction, how can it be said they are ignorant sinners ? When an
                            offender has sinned and suffered for the same offense many times over, and understands just
                            what kind of anguish it will bring upon him, what insane reasoning can prompt any one to
                            call such the sins of ignorance? Such a sinner, if candid, would laugh in your face, if you
                            attempted to fix him up in so ridiculous a posture. The time was, when secret sins could be
                            committed in ignorance, but now in all moral and enlightened society, cause and effect are
                            quite universally known. , Still we find such sinners who disregard their best instruction
                            when they know<pb n="178" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> much better. Strange ignoraace this. Can the inebriate,
                            who has many times set out to abstain from his cup, and as ofteu been drawn back through
                            extreme compunction of conscience be called ignorant in this matter? There are a host of
                            political offenders ami many wilful sinners that it would insult the common understanding to
                            call ignorant offenders. But why pursue this matter farther, as it is in vain to illustrate,
                            for their name is legion. We are asked, "Is the millennium to be ushered in, by gradually
                            enlightening mankind through and by the spirits of departed friends." We doubt not there
                            will be a gradual light, which will finally lead souls up to these very principles. We also
                            believe that all this will be brought about by the direct agency of spirits, but they will
                            undoubtedly be of that class, "Who (are regular) ministering spirits, sent fort 1 to
                            minister for those, who shall be (prepared to become) heirs of salvation." When the Jews
                            were God's chosen people, as soon as they began to produce prophets and mediums, to bring
                            out revelations suited to the Hebrews, the sameorganizations were developed by other
                            nations, showing a growth or enlargement of capacity in the whole human family. Moses, Aaron
                            and others were peculiar mediums, perfectly adapted to their order, but they were nearly
                            equalled by Jarnnes, Jambres and others, who withstood Moses before Pharaoh. Balaam
                            consulted the same spirit who talked to the seers, and delivered his messages as truthfully
                            and eloquently as Isaiah himself, but the Jew claimed and held the preeminence. History
                            tells of heathen oracles, whose Priests ministered at their own altars, and brought down
                            judgement or blessing on their own people and nation. Just before the great medium, Jesus,
                            appeared on earth, the fires of inspiration were kindled through the whole hill country.
                            This was not done in a corner. The angel commenced with Zachariah, and a sort of outside
                            spiritualism spread like the prairie fires of the west, till John stood up the
                            personification of God's word, to call thousands of Hebrew sinners to the banks of Jorda:;,
                            to pass through the waters of repentance, and stand ready for the baptism of fire. This
                            state of things was started under John, that when the Messiah came, he might exhibit gifts
                            and power far in advance of things around him. He would thus prove that he was sent to lead
                            them into the new and living way. At the death of Jesus, the priesthood thought that the
                            Christian power was killed. After the crucifixion, the fires of Christian inspiration on the
                            day of Pentecost blazed out like a furnace, inspiring terror in the whole Levitical order.
                            Paul's persecution set all Jerusalem in an agitation, and scattered the fire which Jesus
                            kindled on earth, far out among the Gentiles. "The apostles (now) went everywhere preaching
                            the gospel; and Philip went down to Samaria," to introduce Christian spiritualism among that
                            people. Now if they had no knowledge of spirit manifestations, Philip's visit in that
                            quarter would have turned out a blank. But they had taken the initiatory steps to receive
                            the testimony. Philip preached Christ unto them. "And unclean spirits came out of many, and
                            many taken with palsies and they that were lame were healed, and there was great joy in that
                                city."<pb n="179" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> It appears that Simon Magus, a spirit medium on a low
                            plane, had prepared them for this event. Tlie Jews called him a sorcerer, and so they did
                            all mediums who were noi of the tribe of Levi, but the Samaritans considered him the
                            connecting link between them and the spirit land. "For to h m they gave heed from the least
                            to the greatest, saying this man is the great power of God." If they looked up to him as the
                            representative of the power of God to them, he was to th.'in something above a sorcerer.
                            When the people were baptized unto Christ, Simon was baptized also wondering to witness a
                            power entirely beyond his own. Peter stood in the first gift. When he came among them, Simon
                            saw that by the laying on of hands, the people received something more than Philip could
                            minister, and he showed out just what and where he was. Like the mediums of our period, he
                            stood in power, and like them he wished to stand in more power. He wished to purchase
                            Peter's gift, that he might have the best spiritual article in the market. Say what we may
                            of this man, he was like many in these times ; however low his state or manifestations, they
                            prepared the way for the higher power under the apostles. Through the dark ages one class of
                            witnesses paved the way for another. The French Prophets introduced a spirit that opened a
                            preparatory work for Mother Ann, and American revivals prepared a people for the opening of
                            the gospel, East and West. We are taught that, "In the days of the voice of the seventh
                            angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished." Rev. x., 7, If
                            the mystery of God is to be finished, it will be by a revelation of gospel principles,
                            delivered in the power of them. Then every religious movement that aids in bringing them to
                            light, must be brought in by the operation of the true spirit, to help spread gospel truths
                            in the earth. Before and in the days of Jesus, mammon was the God of wealth among the
                            Syrians. The rich were supposed to be the favorites of that Deity. The tribes were inclined
                            to worship heathen Gods who invited to sensuality and riches. Jesus knowing this, instead of
                            correcting the theory of the false, endeavored to point his followers to the true God. He
                            well knew the difficulty of removing old prejudices, and let mammon stand where the Syrians
                            had placed him. His instructions were, that they could not worship a false, selfish God for
                            gain, and the true God, of universal love and good-will at the same time. Jesus had to take
                            men as he found them, and teach them what were proper objects of worship aud what wer?. not.
                            Therefore, when he says that mammon could not be reverenced by the worshiper of the true
                            God, he simply means that a Christian cannot set up wealth as a God, to idolize and worship
                            and at the same time be consecrated and leveled down into the equalizing spirit of the
                            gospel.

                                received. I had seen the notice in the "Star." He was a grand old man. In his death, the
                                Society lost one of its ablest, most honest and true friends. Intellectually, as
                                physically, he was a giant. Only the opportunity was lacking, to have made him a power,
                                in a greater field than the one in which his life was spent. He was almost born in the
                                Society, with which he labored and devoted his life-work for three-fourths of a century.
                                Integrity of character, honesty of purpose, fidelity to friends, were among his sterling
                                qualities. Resides these, he had a strength of intellect, a power of comprehension, a
                                will power that would have made him a leader in state or nation, had his ambition led
                                him in that direction. He educated himself, or was educated to keep within the pales of
                                his belief, to stand aloof from the world, to honor his people, to be a leader among
                                their leaders. He reached the climax of promotion. His counsels were honored, where
                                those of his chosen belief were found. The Society being a little world to itself, he
                                reached the topmost round of honor in it. Among those with whom he lived, labored and
                                achieved, he was a Napoleon in deeds, but unlike Napoleon he did not have to meet death
                                an exile, his remains were not buried on other than his own lands ; but his ashes will
                                rest surrounded by those who lived and died in the same cause, who were devotees to the
                                same creed. About thirty years ago I first met him, for more than twenty-five, I knew
                                him well. He was not only kind, but friendly ; he was sincerely, my friend. He
                                accredited to me, honesty. lie appreciated and was proud of my partial success, and was
                                sadly sorrowful when my reverses came. I had hoped to have had the pleasure to receive
                                his kindly welcome, to look into that strong conscientious face once more, to tell him
                                of my trials, the battles I have made against adversity, the partial victories I have
                                won. He is dead. The patient ear will listen no more ; the encouraging smile is not to
                                be seen ; the words of advice and wisdom no longer fall from his lips. He has gone
                                hence,� "rossed the river. We too will soon follow. Old age is following us fast. Its
                                iufirmities are on our tracts. I regret your sufferings, but hope the worst is over and
                                that you will regain your strength. That was too sad about Eldress Louisa. Give her my

                            We read of wars, Of pestilence and famine : devastation, Crime and woe : of learning,
                            intellect, Morality and power; of many people Who have lived and died, and varied instances
                            That seem to mark the centuries of a Nation. But 'mong it all there is rehearsed a dreadful
                            Tale, more terrible perhaps than other wrongs Committed, a fault, a sin, a woeful crime. The
                            only question is, who can forgive? What can atone for it in heaven or earth?� It was the
                            Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Unto the conscience of thy children Had God appeared, to work
                            his will, And each spirit aimed to be a loyal subject In his cause, but man-made creeds and

                            Which indeed unlocked the gates of hell. * * * Hi He The sky was dark above the wooded
                            hills, And vales, and hamlets rested in the quiet Of serene repose. The starry Virgin Walked
                            with noiseless tread above the ripening Sheaves of harvest-time, and happy stillness Left
                            unborn all thoughts of ill. But hark! Mid'st dreamings all unfinished, thro' the si[lence,
                            Sounded out the peals of bells that echoed� What? The ioys of Celebration? that told The
                            coming of the anniversary whereon Would be high homage done to greatly Honored Saints? Not
                            so. It was the knell Of death, the solemn knell of death. Deceased. Not only one or two dear
                            friends whom some [one Strongly loved, 'mid deep and aching grief, But eighty thousand souls
                            gave up the ghost, Before the dismal sounds died out upon the [air. 'Twas not a dreaded
                            blighting pestilence, Disease, nor accident that caused this havoc Among human lives, but
                            worse, far worse; It was a brother's hand with treachery Uplifted 'gainst a brother : foul
                            plots con[ceived And executed when the light of day Was not, which made more infamous the
                            deed When but a tiny meager badge distinguished The living from those who were ordained to
                            die. The fiery flames of bondfires shot athwart The gloomy sky, from hills that raised their
                            Verdant summits to the free, clear air of [heaven, And signaled but again the terrors Of the
                            impending fates. Oh base and wicked Heart! Oh cruel hands ! that with the sword, The pistol,
                            spear and every deadly Missile, and instrument of death, could thus Deprive so many of the
                            right to live; And all beneath the folds of that fair cloak Religion. Could God once
                            tolerate such crime? Could it be else but fearful frenzy, Stirred and heated by the burning
                            passions Of a truly unconverted mind? Could Jesus Have walked the frightful streets afloat
                            with [human blood And not be weighed with grief at the sad Mistakes of man? Could saints
                            whom many Worshiped have listened to the groans and [crying Of terror-stricken ones, and not
                            with words Of stern rebuke, condemned the falacy Of such a faith, by no means born of

                                Every ray of divine light that enters the soul...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">Every ray of divine light that enters the soul is a witness of God's love to man. As this
                                love is boundless, including all the gifts and graces of the spirit, it must remain
                                infinite in its manifestations and quite beyond our ability to surround it. On every
                                hand we witness the wonderful work of an over-ruling Providence, which serves to inspire
                                the mind with reverence, thankfulness and with thoughtful care for the unnumbered
                                blessings that are vouchsafed to man as well as to "the earth and all that therein is."
                                Among the rays of light we find the gospel of the kingdom of Christ which shall be
                                preached in all the world. It has come to us as a revelation of God, as a harbinger of
                                peace, and as a gift of good news. In its ministration it gives grace to the humble and
                                a divine blessing to the pure in heart. It becomes the power of the resurrection and all
                                who accept it are made alive. God's love is our spiritual armor, and those who are clad
                                in the whole armor of God have nothing to fear while engaged in obedience to the call of
                                the divine Teacher. Even the fiery darts of Satan can do no harm. A growing confidence
                                awakens in the soul, and every duty is accepted as an inspiration from on high.
                                Beautiful examples of unshaken confidence are written on the pages of history where men
                                and women have dared to do right. When God is for us, who can be against us? Neither the
                                depths of the Red Sea nor the floods of Jordan could form a barrier against a pleasant
                                and safe march to the shore nearest to the promised land. "Though thou walkest through
                                the waters I will be with thee, and through the fire it shall not burn thee." God's love
                                was beautifully illustrated when Jesus called the attention of the Jews to the fact that
                                God was no respecter of persons in his distribution of the common blessings to man. The
                                Jews claimed that God had prospered them as a people in a marked degree over that of all
                                other nations. He had taught them to love their friends and to hate their enemies. He
                                had permitted them to walk through the sea as one would walk on dry land, had rained
                                manna down from heaven, and with this had fed their nation during forty years. Other
                                wonderful and miraculous<pb n="185" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> things had been brought about as a
                                special favor to their name and nation, and warranted them in making the assertion that
                                God loved them as a nation, and as a special mark of favor, hated their enemies. Jesus,
                                however, did not hesitate to spread before them a system of religious life, much more in
                                accordance with the rights and the privileges that should belong to our common humanity.
                                He urged them to love their enemies that they might be known as the children of God,
                                "for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
                                and on the unjust." God's bountiful goodness is proffered to every one, in every nation
                                upon the earth, and none can say that the distribution is wanting in wisdom or remains
                                unappreciated. If we are made able to accept of these treasures with a pure and thankful
                                heart, we may rest assured of the influence that will rule in our own mind, but we may
                                not be at liberty to judge the depth of appreciation that is in the heart of another.
                                The keeping of God's love is the fulfilling of the whole law. It stimulates us to active
                                works of kindness, of mercy and of forgiveness, and gives to its possessor a power to
                                bear the cross of Christ and to live a life consecrated to God and to his people.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Turn straight away..."

                                        generally known and practiced with almost uniform success in both England and
                                        the Continent, consists in the administration simply of large amounts of
                                        potatoes, to which the diet should be restricted. It is stated by Profes| sor
                                        Cameron, of Glasgow, that this plan, ' which, so for as we know', is almost
                                        unknown in this country, originated with the London i pickpockets, whose custom

                                        successful. Thus, Dr. Salzer (Deutsche Medizinal Zeitung for January 24, 1889)
                                        repuls the case of a child who had swallowed a brass weight of three hundred
                                        grains in September, 1887, and in whom the physician was on the point of
                                        performing gastrotomy. According to Dr. Salzer's advice the child was put in
                                        bed, kept on his right side, so as to facilitate the passage through the
                                        pylorus, and then fed with as much potato, prepared in different methods to
                                        stimulate the appetite, as he could be persuaded to take. In five �Jav s the
                                        foreign body was evacuated in the faeces. He also refers to a case of a patient
                                        who had swallowed a set of artificial teeth, and another who had swallowed a
                                        breast pin one and a half inches in diameter, in both of which cases the foreign
                                        bodies were removed without difficulty. At the meeting of the Society of
                                        Physicians in Vienna, at which the above cases were reported, the discussion
                                        which they stimulated led to the report of several other cases, one especially,
                                        by Hochenegg, which is especially remarkable in that it dealt with the case of a
                                        young carpenter, who, in 1884, swallowed a long nail, which was removed by
                                        gastrotomy. Two years later the patient was so unfortunate as to swallow a
                                        second nail similar in all respects fo the first. The potato cure was employed,
                                        and the nail was secured after nine days. In the Deutsche Medizinal Zeitung for
                                        March 11, 1889, Dr. Deichmuller refers to a case of a young girl, ten years of
                                        age, who had accidentally swallowed a pin. Pain was complained of under the
                                        breastbone, and Dr. Deichmuller, acting on the suggestion acquired through the
                                        report of the above cases, restricted the patient to the potato diet. Very
                                        shortly afterward the pain disappeared from the chest and was felt in the
                                        stomach. Six days later it appeared in the right inguinal region; two days
                                        subsequently, having increased in severity, it was felt in the left inguinal
                                        region, while in the evening of this day the foreign body was evacuated with the
                                        faeces. It is hardly necessary for us to call attention to the principles upon
                                        which this method is based. Potatoes, as is well known, are composed of nearly
                                        twenty per cent, of carbohydrates, eighty per cent, of the solids being starch
                                        and cellulose. On account of this large amount of carbohydrate, a great portion
                                        will resist the action of the digestive juices. The cellulose and other
                                        carbohydrates increasing greatly in volume from imbibition witli water, lead to
                                        an accumulation of an immense amount of indigestible residue ; consequently the
                                        intestinal tube is, throughout the entire time of the administration of this
                                        food, filled with large masses of non-absorbable matter. The folds of the
                                        intestine become obliterated, ard fixation of the foreign body in the intestinal
                                        tube is thus avoided. It seems that from five to nine days, or even longer, are
                                        required for the evacuation of the foreign body, and in every ease which does
                                        not seem desperate, a trial of this simple plan of treatment should precede
                                        resort to gastrotomy. In fact, at the recent meeting of the Vienna Medical
                                        College, Prof. Billroth said that since the introduction of this procedure,
                                        gastrotomy for foreign bodies should become an obsolete operation.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Therapeutic gazette" TEIform="index"/>Therapeutic Gazette.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="What a world" TEIform="index"/>WHAT A WORLD.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">"The best general statistical work is Daniel's Lehrbuch der Geographie.

                                    however crude. Christianity has 432,000,000 adherents. The Roman Catholic Church
                                    numbers 208,000,000, the Greek, or Oriental Orthodox Church, 83,000,000; the

                                    there are about seventy smaller<pb n="187" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> Mohammedan sects. All other
                                    human beings are non-monotheistic or heathen, and embrace 875,000,000 souls. Among
                                    the heathen religions Brahminism is the most widely spread, and embraces about
                                    138,000,000 adherents, and its younger offshoot, Buddhism, embraces 503,000,000.
                                    Other religions embrace 135, 000,000 adherents. There are thus yet one thousand

                                    life's table. Thousands of people are perfectly willing to be Christians if their
                                    discipleship will not interfere in the slightest degree with anything else that they
                                    wish to be or do. In fact their sole purpose seems to be to solve the problem how to
                                    grasp the world with one hand, and to keep hold of heaven with the other. They do
                                    not seem to care for any stars in their crown, for any sheaves in their garner. "A
                                    starless crown and a third-rate harp in heaven," they seem to say, "are good enough
                                    for me, if I can only keep from getting shut out forever." Such service is little
                                    better than no service. In fact, we are not sure that it is considered service at
                                    all. If we read our Lord's life correctly, He would not have allowed such people to
                                    count themselves arao..g his disciples. If there was one thing about which He was
                                    emphatic, it was that if any one would be his disciple he must take up his cross.
                                    What sublime courage it was for a friendless young man, as He appeared to be, to
                                    turn away the rich young ruler from his standard, when his cause seemed to be in

                                    make a compromise with Christ, and gives Him anything less than all it is or hopes

                                    Rev. Edward EL Smith, and the charges were as follows : 1. "That Mr. Smith teaches
                                    that the Bible will perish with the using of it; that the<pb n="188" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> Word
                                    of God is in the Bible and not that the whole of the Bible is the Word of God; that
                                    the Bible contains historical and scientific errors. 2. That he holds that Christ,
                                    though of a high order of being, is yet a created being-, created for the specific
                                    work of revealing God's love, and that Christ is not-a being to be worshiped. 3.
                                    That he doesn't believe that the sufferings and death of Christ of itself made an
                                    atonement for the sins of mankind, or is a sufficient ground and procuring cause of
                                    forgiveness, but, on the contrary, that God pardons on the grounds of his essential
                                    love, and Jesus Christ is the revealer of that love. i. That he doesn't believe in
                                    the eternity of future punishment in the popular sense : that souls will experience
                                    eternal loss, but not be eternally lost. That he does not believe in such a thing as
                                    eternal banishment from God, but that punishment is a reminder, preventive and
                                    restorative, both in this life and the life hereafter; that the end of punishment is
                                    to deter from sinning; that the future state is one of probation, and in it man
                                    doesn't get beyond God's operative love." Mr. Smith admitted the substantial truth
                                    of the foregoing charges as regarded the statements of his opinions therein
                                    contained, and upon them submitted the question of his membership in the convention.

After Gideon had delivered the children of
                            Israel from the hand of the Midianites, they were inspired with great confidence in his
                            ability as a Leader, and very naturally desired to do him some honor, and therefore said
                            unto him,�"Eule thou over us, both thou and thy son and thy son's son." Gideon who had won
                            the victory by his strict obedience to the commands of God, refused to accept approbation or
                            honor from<pb n="189" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> men and replied,�"The Lord shall rule over thee;" giving in
                            this brief sentence the honor and glory to God who had given the victory. Do we remember why
                            Moses failed to enter the Promised Land? Was it not because he took to himself the power and
                            authority belonging only to God? It may be that Gideon had learned dependence upon God
                            through the sad experience of those before him. How much respect arises in our minds toward
                            those who manifest a humble dependence upon a superior power. Jesus said at one time to
                            those who doubted that he was the Messiah, "Though ye believe not me, believe the works."
                            Another example of recognizing the power of God, is found in Mother Ann's dealings. To those
                            who wuuld kneel to her she would say, "Do not kneel to me, kneel to God, I am but your
                            fellow servant." We are all privileged as Christian Disciples, to achieve victories in the
                            formation of a spiritual character. Let us remember in the battle, as in the victory, the
                            words of the apostle, "God forbid that I glory save in the cross of Christ." Canterbury, N.

Jesus
                            answered until seventy times seven. It seems that Peter thought if he forgave his brother
                            seven times, that was enough, but Jesus taught him, and the lesson teaches us, to forgive
                            seventy times seven, which means we must forgive all our lives. When we forgive a person, we
                            should not do it in the spirit that we will furgive him, if he will never do the wrong
                            again, but forgive in the spirit that we are just as bad ourselves, only we did not happen
                            to do the same thing that our neighbor did. If we have this spirit it will lead us to

Can any of you tell me what
                                slang is? It is low vulgar language, often without sense in form of expression, although
                                it conveys a meaning, coarse and base, which is generally understood by that class of
                                persons who habitually use it; but it is never elevating to mind or morals. The English
                                language abounds with choice words, which are capable of expressing the most beautiful
                                thoughts and sentiments. We may judge of the refinement of people by the purity of their
                                speech, which is an external symbol of thought and feeling. So if you would be chaste
                                and cultivated, you must be very careful in speaking. You need not employ ambiguous
                                words on any occasion; I mean those of uncertain or doubtful meaning; but simple, direct
                                and truthful words that all can understand. There is another habit in speaking much to
                                be deprecated, and that is, extravagant and equivocal expressions. You strain the
                                smaller occurances to the proportions of awful, dreadful, terrible and shocking; when
                                very, extremely or exceedingly would be much more appropriate; for if you use adjectives
                                in the superlative degree for trifles, you will have no words to express great
                                calamities or misfortunes. Now I want you to think seriously on what has been said, and
                                see how much improvement you can make the coming week, month and year. You can all help
                                each other to speak nicely, by a gentle reminder when any one of you are in fault. Your

                                command. Watch the stealthy approaches of the tempter. As the Adversary watches for
                                opportunities to destroy your souls, so should you watch, and by heavenly<pb n="190" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> power, win victory. Watch for occasions of doing good; for storing
                                durable riches ; for all means of increasing your purity and happiness. Watchfulness
                                will strengthen you where you would falter, encourage where you might fail. You cannot
                                progress heavenward without constant watching. Watch well what you gather and scatter
                                again. Watch in little things. "Avoid the appearance of evil," is advice worth taking.
                                Shun little temptations and you will resist great ones. The danger of evil beginnings is
                                often overlooked. Take them in time. It is far easier to follow the seli-denying way
                                than to retrace your steps after having swerved from it. But with every temptation there
                                is a way of escape. The right path may be regained. Heed the counsel of the pure and
                                wise and you will be saved from many wrong steps and much misery. Watch! This is the
                                secret of success in the Christian warfare. Watchfulness is wisdom. Be ever wise. Learn
                                valuable lessons for the world to come. Rely on God's unchanging guidance. "Trust Him
                                through the sunshine and the storm." Oh, the comfort that comes from this. The whole
                                life of Jesus was constant watching and prayer. How worthy of imitation. Copy as much as
                                you can of his holy character into your own lives. He loves the little ones who deny
                                self and win victories in his cause, for He sees the love in the heart that prompts the
                                action. Be not discouraged because you are little. May the sweetness of an approving
                                conscience be yours. May your years be many and bright with virtue and truth. May your
                                ways be ways of pleasantness and your paths paths of peace, is the earnest wish of Your

                            speech, silence is often more valuable. "5. Do not expect too much from others, but forbear
                            and forgive, as you desire forbearance and forgiveness yourself. "6. Never retort a sharp or
                            angry word. It is the second word that makes the quarrel. "7. Beware of the first

                                new work and No. 1. of Vol. 1. is before us filled with articles that are interesting
                                and instructive to both Teachers and pupils. It is published by the Teacher's Publishing
                                Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, and will be devoted to "Literature, Science, Health, Industrial
                                and National Affairs." The Magazine will contain a review of the Month, and present to
                                its readers a fund of information that cannot be found in any other educational Journal.
                                An essentially new feature in this work, will be to awaken an inspirational interest in
                                the Teacher, in his high calling, and at the same time to place before him all the
                                Literary questions that are receiving the attention of active minds. For the outlook we
                                may anticipate an extended circulation, as we wish for it the success of earnest labor.
