                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. N0 3.</head><p TEIform="p">Condition of the Church. The year 1791 was one of marked interest in the history of the
                            Church. The Brethren and Sisters were deeply interested in the prosperity of their gospel
                            home and made a willing sacrifice of their time and strength for the general good. They
                            worked with au assurance that they were laying a foundation that would endure for ages. The
                            different branches of domestic business became better established, and were managed more in
                            harmony with the general wishes of Society. The Brethren not only built two dwelling houses
                            in New Lebanon, but they sent members from the church to assist in the building of a
                            dwelling at Hancock and a Meeting House in each of the Societies of Watervliet, N. Y.,
                            Harvard, Mass., and Enfield, Conn. The spiritual prosperity of the Church was, during this
                            time, in active operation and Church Order was the watch-word in all things. 1791. This was
                            a memorable year as the Church was fully established in the permanency of order, government,
                            and general management. The principles upon which the Church was founded, were agreeably to
                            the life and testimony of Jesus Christ. These may never be excelled by any other church, as
                            this was one of consecration ;�the Lord's house. Those who entered were expected to dedicate
                            soul and body to the service of God and his people. Although the office of Trustees had been
                            partially established, Elder David Meacham was now appointed to the office of senior
                            Trustee, and was the director of all business transactions which took place between the
                            Believers and those not of the Society. An order was also established bearing the name of
                            Family Deacons which was expected to have the oversight of the temporal affairs of the
                            family. The several orders of the Church as now appointed for the protection and prosperity
                            of the Community are as follows,� The Ministry�Elders�Trustees and Family Deacons. After
                            this arrangement every ord?r was expected to manage their own business affairs, and to
                            maintain a good union with the others and be responsible, in all their transactions, to
                            their superiors. The Ministry now withdrew from the management of all temporal duties, to
                            attend more directly to that which was spiritual, while the Elders took the immediate
                            oversight of the family.<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Some bye-laws or orders had been established
                            at an earlier date, but none had beeu committed to writing. These orders were founded on
                            necessity and indispensable to the protection and harmony of every family of Believers.
                            Their object was to enjoin what was right and to forbid what was wrong. In the experience
                            and growth of the Church these orders were liable to be changed or modified to meet the
                            necessities of the day. Already the people had learned that "Order is heaven's first law,"
                            and without a system of order there could be no permauent protection to the Believers. As an
                            illustration of the rules given we append the following :� No one shall buy nor sell in the
                            Church, nor trade with those not of the Church, except by the union of the Trustees. No one
                            shall hold private property. A selfish, private union should not be maintained, nor a
                            private correspondence held with any person in or out of the Society. These orders were aids
                            in the securing of equal rights, according to several needs, and well calculated to promote
                            a practical righteousness. The Society at Watervliet, N. Y., after the decease of Father
                            James was included in the same Bishopric with New Lebanon, as the organizing of the
                            Community in that place was effected at the same date. Elder John Hocknell who resided at
                            Watervliet was very helpful in assisting the people to enter into the Community relation and
                            to establish the order of the Church. So soon as it could be made consistent with other
                            duties, the Ministry of New Lebanon delegated from the parent Society, Timothy Hubbard and
                            Anna Mathewson lo be the senior Elders of the Church of Watervliet. Aaron Wood and Sarah
                            Bennett were appointed as their associates. 1793. The estate of the Society, although
                            limited, had up to this date been quite sufficient for the Community, but it was now
                            considered best to purchase still more, and several farms were added to the consecrated
                            inheritance, and dedicated to God and his people, so that no one called aught his own, of
                            all he possessed. Neither was any one in debt or bondage to those not members of the
                            Society. They were now much belter prepared for the inward work of the gospel, and able to
                            briug forth the fruits of their faith in righteousness, peace and order, undisturbed by
                            those without. They had already become permanently testablished as a religious and spiritual
                            order of Brethren and Sinters, and disciples of our Lord, Jesus Christ. After the organizing
                            of the Society the Believers remained very quietly in their home, and industriously working
                            for the increase of the temporal and spiritual interests of the Community. Even the Trustees
                            were very careful of the relations which they held with those not of the Society. In their
                            manners, however, they studied to be kind and respectful, and in their business relations,
                            honest aud above reproach. Those who had been chosen as the spiritual leaders, were rigidly
                            cautious in all their deportment, that they might maintain a gift of God in their
                            respecttive callings. The same care w_is manifested in their general manners, iu walk-<pb n="195" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> ing, iu keeping step, and even in the quality of their manufacture.
                            All this was kindly impressed upon the minds of the whole Community by example as well as by
                            precept. So thoroughly was this careful spirit accepted by the whole body of Believers, that
                            it dispelled much of the crudeness, the vanity and the self-love from the mind. The Church
                            was now fully established as to its external organization, yet it was but the beginning of
                            the real inward work of redemption, a mere start ing-point, from which there must be a
                            progress through many degrees of spiritual travel. As saith the Apostle, first that which is
                            natural and outward : then that which is spiritual and inward. Up to this date one important
                            point of gospel order, which was indispensable to the true relation of the Church had not
                            been perfected. It had existed only iu the kind and friendly relations which the gospel of
                            Christ had so far revealed. As its office was more directly felt in the work of
                            spirituality, it required more time for its full completion. The faith of the Believers had
                            shown to them that the disorderly union of men and women had been the sin of the world, and
                            to avoid this dangerous point they must set a double guard, in carefulness and watchfulness,
                            against this besetting sin of the race. As the burdens of the Community increased, it was
                            found necessary for the Brethren and Sisters, in their management of the general business,
                            to confer with each other as to the means and methods that should be used. Every order that
                            had been established soon saw the necessity of this new demand, and meetings were appointed
                            every other day or oftener if necessary. Ihis union of the officers, in the order of the
                            Church, gave the Sisters an equal privilege with their Brethren, in consultation, and in the
                            management of all their business relations. It was soon ascertained that it was promotive of
                            protection, and contributed to the peace and comfort of the family. This system of union
                            meetings was soon universally adopted. OF THE WORSHIP. Previous to the building of the house
                            of worship at New Lebanon, the Believers had no regular manner of holding their meetings.
                            They were scattered in various little families and spent their hour of worship iu their o\xu
                            houses. Sometimes several families would meet at a designated place, where the residence
                            would afford more room, and at the same time be the home of a Minister or Elder who could
                            direct the order of service. All who could, however, depended upon making a visit to
                            Watervliet, as at that place, they would meet Mother Ann and the Elders, and be privileged
                            to attend meeting with them, and be profited by the ministration of their spiritual gifts.
                            These first Believers manifested great zeal in their efforts to live a religious life. Many
                            men and women would perform the journey from New Lebanon and adjacent towns, to the Society
                            at !Watervliet on dark, stormy days and nights, leaving their comfortable homes, and their
                            pleasant surroundings, to enjoy a short season of spiritual communion with their gospel
                            friends. At this date no fixed form was used for the opening of the religious service. The
                            people would assemble in the house,<pb n="196" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> and after sitting a few minutes in
                            silence, would on a given signal prepare for worship. Usually the service began by the
                            singing of a solemn song, or by the speaking of one of the Elders. This season of devotion
                            was often attended with diverse spiritual gifts, of signs, of tongues, shaking and turning.
                            At other times it took the form of prayer, exhortation and a searching testimony against all
                            evil, or it would be a manifestation of thankfulness, of love, of simplicity or repentance.
                            The prevailing theme, in all these gifts was the crucifixion of pride and of self-love. (TO
                            BE CONTINUED.)</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How hast thou fallen" TEIform="index"/>"HOW HAST THOU FALLEN."</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anderson, Martha J." TEIform="persName"/>Martha J. Anderson.</byline><p TEIform="p">Stars have gone out from stellar space Which once in brightness burned, Thus many souls
                            illumed with grace, To darkness have returned. The prophet Isaiah applies this satirical
                            sentence to the king of Babylon. "How hast thou fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning ! "
                            And to show clearly the cause of his destruction, continues. "Thou hast said in thine heart,
                            I will ascend unto heaven ; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God ; I will ascend
                            above the hights of the clouds ; I will be like the Most High." The elements of that great
                            humiliation were long ripening to fruition. Pride, arrogance and injustice surely go before
                            destruction, and judgment comes sooner or later as a just recompense for disobedience. The
                            mightiest of earth cannot with impunity disregard the laws of God. Ability, power and
                            position are too often the means of lifting souls above their proper sphere of duty and
                            action ; and the greatest gifts prove snares of temptation and ruin. Alas ! how sad the
                            sight, "When he who might, Have lighted up and led his age, Falls back in night." Talents,
                            God-given and holy, prostituted to ignoble purposes rob the soul of true glory. "Ichabod" is
                            clearly written on the characters of many who have fallen through plighted faith, and in
                            disobedience to the gift of God manifested in their souls, which teaches them in humility to
                            follow the guidance of the divine light within. "So fallen ! so lost! the light withdrawn
                            which once he wore," might be said of many whose knowledge of the higher life has been
                            clouded by sensuality and sin, until they walk in the blackness of spiritual death. There is
                            always a blight resting upon those, who, having been blest with light have departed from
                            grace; who, having gained eminence in spiritual things, have felt too secure in their
                            surroundings ; and tempted by the yet un� subdued passions within have descended by degrees
                            from morality and virtue, till, lost from God, they have become a by-word and a stigma to
                            mankind. "For if that light within you becomes darkness how great is that darkness." "When
                            faith and honor both are lost, the soul is dead." Better never have known the truth than
                            disobey its teachings. Better never have been enlightened, than fall in sin and obliquity.
                            To retrace lost steps will cause more bitterness and anguish, than a straight-forward course
                            in self denial and obedience. Let us look to our eternal interest, and obey the promptings

                            no act by day Which from the night shall drive thy peace [away. In months of sun so live
                            that months of rain Shall still be happy. Evermore restrain Evil and cherish good ; so shall

                            furnished with the elements of progress until woman is permitted to exercise her God-given

                            establish, on earth, a home for his people. This home cannot exist without the combined
                            efforts of both ordeis of humanity, man and woman. The holy spirit of truth the comforter of
                            which Jesus spake, whom the world could not receive, signified the Second appearing of

The question is asked
                            and will be answered from the stand-point of a Believer in the spiritual Philosophy. The
                            Materialist will fail to comprehend our definition. What is Prayer ? It is the divine
                            unfolding of the innermost soul, bringing it into rapport with those subtle elements of the
                            spiritual world which are the fountain and source of life to the soul. Can appeals change
                            the infinite plan and cause it to turn from those immutable laws that govern the spiritual
                            world as well as the material? Nay. to whom then do we pray ? JSot to a personification of
                            great sovereign power that resides somewhere in the universe of miud, dispensing rewards to
                            the meritorious and punishments to the guilty, but to the Divine Father and Mother of life,
                            personified in angels and spiritual beings that are daily ministering to our necessities.
                            Ask the blind or those whose olfactory nerves are dead, if the rose is beautiful and if it
                            smells fragrant. The reply will be that those terms are dead<pb n="198" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> sentences
                            to them. But never-the-less the rose is beautiful and fragrant to those whose senses are
                            alive to its subtle impressions. As well tell a hungry man who is seated before a table
                            loaded with luscious and nourishing food that it does not taste good and will not revive
                            him, as, to tell the soul who is spiritually hungry that by entering into rapport with the
                            fountain of life he will not be refreshed. Then why is prayer not always answered? Because
                            we pray amiss ; if we ask for the impossibilities then we are disappointed. If I pray for
                            the lightning to strike my neighbor's house because I have a grudge against him ; that does
                            not imply an answer to my prayer. His house was simply on the line of the least resistance
                            to the electric fluid and therefore it was struck. The writer says "Pray not, the darkness
                            will not brighten." Pity to the individual that is so wrapped in the winding-sheet of doubt
                            and buried in the grave of materialism, that never felt the "darkness brighten" while in the
                            sweet and silent communion of prayer. "Within yourselves deliverance must be wrought." True
                            that each individual must work out his own salvation, but the fact remains that each
                            individual is helped by every other individual that is in spiritual sympathy with their
                            hopes and desires, and retarded in the same ratio that they come ui:der the magnetic
                            influence of opposing forces. It is a fact well known to Believers in the spiritual
                            Philosophy, that there are malignant forces operating against mankind, as there are benign
                            forces working for his elevation, and it is absolutely necessary to understand and
                            discriminate between these two elements if the race is to make any real advancement and not
                            be carried back to barbarism. Viewing it from our stand-point,�Prayer is not that mysterious
                            unknowable force by which concessions are granted to man by the Infinite mind, but a
                            harmonious blending of the human with the Divine spirit by which the human is polarized and
                            made more positive in its power for good the more it comes in contact with the divine mind.

                            of God, standing on Nebo's lonely mountain and beholding the Promised Land before his eyes,
                            doubly beautiful bv the vivid contrast of the barren desert behind him, yet not permitted to
                            set his foot upon it, but called upon to die in the solitude of the hills, unaided by human
                            sympathy and kindly offices in his last extremity. This was the reflection in the writer's
                            mind as he stood upon Perry's Peak, one of the many prominent elevations in the Berkshire
                            hills. It rises but a few miles to the west of Shaker Village ; the ascent is not very
                            difficult and the outlook from the summit is graadly beautiful. When fortune has favored one
                            with a bright day and a clear atmosphere, and you are provided with a good telescope and a
                            substantial lunchbasket, you can spend the better part of the day there, looking, thinking,
                            dreaming, rejoicing in the simple fact of living with a satisfaction long to be remembered.
                            Perry's Peak rises to the height of<pb n="199" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> 2400 feet above sea level,
                            receiving its name from one of the early settlers of the last century ; it w.as also one of
                            the stations of the U. S. Geodetic survey, the evidence of whose labors remains i 1 a tall
                            signal staff. The partly wooded slopes of the mountain do not prevent an unimpeded view of
                            the valley below. At our feet cluster the buildings of Hancock Shaker Village, the most
                            striking among which is the Round Stone Barn, which in its solid massiveness as it rises
                            from a rocky eminence, remindy one of grim Castle William in New York harbor; but no
                            frowning guns look out from its embrasures and a peaceful weather-vane (which points the
                            major part of the year to the northwest) takes the place of the proud stars and stripes. The
                            smoke, that busily crowds up from a tall chimney in the grounds of the East Family, marks
                            the location of an iron-ore mine, the product of which is shipped to the furnace at Chatham,
                            N. Y., 20 miles away. Close by are the neat buildings of Shaker Station on the Boston and
                            Albany R. R., one of the finest roads in the country, double tracked and kept in first-class
                            condition. A short distance to the east looms up Shaker Mills, situated on a large tributary
                            of the Housatonic river, which furnishes a powerful and unfailing water power. Here Brother
                            Ira Lawson, the popular and energetic trustee of the Society, does a large business ; his
                            monthly freight-bill for grain amounts to over $2000. Pittsfield, a village of 18000
                            inhabitants, occupies almost the center of the valley; around it cluster many manufacturing
                            hamlets, which utilize every water-course, supplementing it by steampower. The range of
                            vision is limited by the Hoosac mountains, here pierced by the world-famed tunnel, five
                            miles long ; from their midst rises Mt. Greylock, 3500 feet high. Turning our gaze southward
                            we behold the Blue Catskill mountains, the identical region of the immortal Rip Van Winkle's
                            exploits. Through a gap in the hills we see a stretch of the noble Hudson river, and even as
                            we look, a mighty tug-boat heaves in sight, towing a whole fleet of canal boats towards the
                            great metropolis by the se^. Almost beneath our feet glisten the waters of Queechy lake, and
                            upon one of the hills which cast their shadow into its bosom is a quaint group of
                            pink-colored buildings, constituting Canaan, an outpost of Lebanon, where Brother Clark and
                            Mldress Miriam are gallantly holding the fort. Broadly sweeping toward the west and north
                            opens Lebanon valley, dotted with many villages and farm houses till it is lost among the
                            lofty mountains of Vermont. But where is Mt. Lebanon, the parentSociety of all Zion ? We
                            shift our point of observation somewhat to the north, and then on a broad shelf on the
                            hillside we behold the five families of Lebanon. God bless Mt. Lebanon ! Beautiful for
                            si'uation, spoken of throughout the world as a center of spiritual activity, may it long
                            continue to be a true Jerusalem to every good Believer, and a city of refuge for many a
                            sin-sick soul! The ground we have so rapidly sketched over is historic in the annals of
                            America, and in the history of Believers. Over yonder road traveled in hot haste Parson
                            Allen and the Pittsfield militia in 1778 to the help of their comrades at Bennington, which
                            lies 25 miles away at the foot of that blue mountain.<pb n="200" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> The chronicler
                            records how on that memorable day the parson, true to his calling advanced alone to the
                            fortifications which sheltered many tories whom he personally knew, and how he exhorted them
                            not to fight against their country and their brethren, to become loyal citizens, etc. But
                            his words were thrown away; for when they recognized him they cried, "Let's pop the parson
                            !" and fired upon him. Then the preacher's wrath waxed hot within him and he answered with
                            the same sort of an argument, firing the first shot on the American side. That many storied
                            hotel marks the site of Lebanon Springs, where Washington, Lafayette, and many other famous
                            ones tarried for health and rest. This old-fashioned mansion is the birth-place of Samuel J.
                            Tilden, Governor and almost President; his tomb is among the cypresses on yonder hill.
                            Stockbridge, Lenox, Barrington, hidden away in deep valleys, bring to mind the names of
                            Bryant, Holmes, Hawthorne, Sedgewick, Edwards, Warner, Field,�names known the world over.
                            How grand this view, bounded by the Green mountains, the Hoosac, the Catskills, the
                            Helderbergs, the Adirondack.? ! How beautiful the shimmering lakes, Pontoosuc, Onota,
                            Richmond, Queechy, Mackiuac! How lovely in this smiling month of June this expanse of hill
                            and valley, town and hamlet, lake and field, forest and meadow, all in green ! No wonder
                            they come from the cities and pitch their tents in the valleys and build costly mansions
                            upon the hilltops. But wandering over these Berkshire mountains one often comes across the
                            ruins of former habitations, overgrown orchards, gaping wells, broken-down walls, and, most
                            pathetic of all, perhaps some rudely sculptured marble slabs that mark the resting place of
                            decaying mortality. Where formerly many thrifty fields and pastures supported a large
                            population the land is now left to grow up to woods. There is as much good land to-day
                            unoccupied in Massachusetts as is included in Oklahoma; and it can be had very cheap too.
                            When the waste lands of the' west are once taken up and the restless spirits are compelled
                            to settle down, the now-despised hill-sides of Berkshire will be sought out again to be
                            forsaken no more. Meanwhile the land rests. And what a grand domain of fruitful land is in
                            psssession of Believers ! As that sweet singer of Israel, Benjamin Moorehouse, who now sings
                            tenor in the celestial choir, has it : "And yet to many thousands more We such a home could
                            give, If they would leave a carnal world, And learn for Christ to live." But that is what
                            they do not want to do. A tramp to whom every tree affords shelter and almost every house
                            food, infinitely prefers his independence to the abundance and comfort of a Christian
                            household where steady labor and orderly lives are required; and well-to-do people,
                            not-with-standing all the vexation and cares they are complaining about, prefer them to the
                            true liberty which is in Christ. How thankful we ought to be ! Blest a hundred-fold with
                            houses and lands and faithful Brethren and Sisters, with exceeding great care ought we to
                            preserve that precious gospel under whose life-giving influences Zion has grown and become
                            beautiful. Lord Beacons-<pb n="201" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> field sail that true progress consisted in
                            returning to first principles. When the first order : "Believers must not run in debt to the
                            world," was religiously kept, their temporal prosperity was very great: and when the chief
                            principle�a virgin life in a Christian community� was rigorously and without compromise
                            carried out, spiritual progress and growth in numbers were commensurate. The stream cannot
                            rise higher than its source ; the disciple is not wiser than the Master. Never were people
                            situated so favorably to practically realize the idea of the kingdom of heaven on earth.
                            With a glorious heritage in a fruitful laud, where mosquitos are not and malaria is unknown
                            ; with healthgiving breezes aud sparkling water from the hills ; where the choicest of
                            apples and the sweetest corn, the most perfect potatoes and the most delicious strawberries,
                            raspberries and currants, the toothsome bean and the fragrant onion, all unitedly testify of
                            kind nature's abundance ; with the invaluable experience of more than a century to guide and
                            direct ; with a free government in a free country ; with no one to molest or make afraid,
                            having only ourselves and our still unregenerated natures to contend with ; having the cause
                            of God for our own, and having heaven's daily blessing upon our-labors, how can we fail to
                            carry to a successful termination the work so nobly begun ! The eyes of the world are upon
                            us, and God will surely require his people to give an account of what use they have made of
                            their privileges. Let us be helpful to each other; don't pull one against another. If the
                            shell has grown too tight for comfort, learn of the clam, 0 fellow pilgrim ! and kick it

                            appearing, I therefore feel it my duty to bear witness to this gospel, and to the godly
                            character of those faithful witnesses of God from whom we first received it. A little sketch
                            of my former experience and exercises in religion, may serve to show the reader that I was
                            not a stranger to the operations of the Spirit of God, previous to my embracing this
                            testimony. In my early youth, even from childhood I had some convictions of sin. When about
                            twelve years of age, I was awakaned by hearing a preacher, in a religious revival, deliver a
                            powerful testimony against sin, and in favor of ho-<pb n="202" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> liness, which
                            wrought so forcibly upon my feelings, that it was as much as my youthful soul was able to
                            endure. I endeavored to reform my life ; but having no one to lead me in the way of
                            holiness, my convictions gradually wore away, though not without frequent awakenings which
                            caused me much tribulation. In this manner I grew up to manhood. In a revival of religion
                            which took place when I was about the age of twenty, 1 was again greatly awakened. I felt
                            myself separated from God by wicked works, and was convinced that, unless I could find the
                            mercy and favor of God, I must be forever lost. My trouble of mind and conviction of my lost
                            state increased upon me until I was borne down with the weight cf excessive tribulation of
                            soul. In my distress I betook myself to prayer, and made it my constant practice to go out
                            into the woods, near by, and there kneel down and pray to God in the best manner I was able.
                            I continued in this practice, and under this distress of soul, till my flesh wasted away,
                            and my bodily strength diminished so much, that I was at last obliged to take my bed, and
                            felt no strength nor heart to perform any business ; but spent one part of my time in the
                            woods, crying to God for his mercy, and the other part mourning and pining. I felt myself a
                            condemned sinner, unless 1 could obtain the mercy of God. But the great depth of my loss,
                            and the enmity of my fallen nature against God were still unknown to me. At length, while I
                            was one day engaged in prayer, I had a complete view of myself, and saw plainly what I was
                            in the sight of God ; and I found that there was nothing in me but what was as pointed
                            arrows agaiust God and against all good. This view of myself so affected my feelings that I
                            felt no confidence to look for mercy, or even to lift my eyes towards heaven. I therefore
                            went away dumb and unable to open my mouth. After suffering awhile in this state, under the
                            keenest anguish of soul, I again ventured to try what could be done by prayer. Accordingly I
                            continued to pray in the best manner I was able. One night, as I was praying, in great agony
                            of soul, I fell into a trance. Suddenly my senses were withdrawn from the things of this
                            world, and I was carried into the world of spirits, where I beheld an innumerable multitude
                            of people, praising God in the highest strains of glory. They were all of one heart and one
                            mind ; and I was allowed to join with them. It was Heaven itself. My soul was filled with
                            such love of God, and such transports of joy as I am not able to describe. How long I
                            continued in that situation I know not. This vision inspired me with hope. I believed that
                            God had visited me in mercy, and I resolved to maintain his cause, and devote myself wholly
                            to his service. I felt the burden of my sins taken away ; and such was my deliverance from
                            all sinful feelings at that time, that I thought I should never more fall into any known
                            sin. I related my experience to the professors of religion in that revival, and was
                            considered by them as a converted soul, and born of God. Upon their solicitation, I was
                            baptized and received into the Baptist church, at Stonington, in Connecticut, where I then
                            lived ; and I felt determined to walk uprightly, and be faithful in my Christian profession.
                            While I kept this resolution, I was<pb n="203" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> blessed with bright manifestations
                            of the goodness of God. 1 was often in secret prayer, and could find and feel the notice of
                            God in it. At one time, while kneeling before God, in secret, and in great tribulation,
                            fearing that God's spirit had departed from me, I saw myself entirely surrounded with a
                            glorious circle, which resembled the beautiful colors of the rainbow. This I considered as
                            an evident manifestation of the notice of God to me ; and thus my tribulation was taken
                            away, and my fears vanished. At another time, as I was sitting in an assembly on the
                            Sabbath, with my feelings looking to God, these words passed through my mind: klAnd the
                            angels are pitching their tents round about thee." Suddenly a mighty shock of the power of
                            God fell upon me, and in a moment all the things of time were struck from my senses. I then
                            saw the angels of God descending in white robes, and pitching their tents round about me. I
                            felt an inexpressible transport of joy, and my soul was filled with love and fervency in the
                            cause of God. Such were the notices of God to me, while under the veil of the flesh. Though
                            they were but temporary visitations of the Spirit of God; yet so long as I took up my cross
                            against sin, and did the best I knew, I was favored with these heavenly visitations. But
                            whenever I gave way to any known sin, then these bright visions were withdrawn from me, and
                            my soul was overwhelmed with darkness and tribulation. While I continued to walk in
                            uprightness, and experience the divine manifestations of the Spirit of God, I felt no
                            confidence in the flesh, and was free from all impure desires slw3. inclinations : but
                            through the carnal spirit uud influence of those who belonged to the same church, and whom I
                            considered as members in good standing, I was brought under the power and influence of the
                            same spirit. This, together with the darkening influence of my own fleshly nature, so
                            blinded my spiritual sight and sensation, that I concluded there was no other way iu this ;
                            world, but to live in those things, and i thus "fulfill the desires of the flesh and of the
                            mind." Eph. ii., 3. The more I turned my mind after carnal things, the more dim my spiritual
                            lamp became, and the more my darkness increased, till I lost all spiritual life out of my
                            soul. However, I still pursued my object, and entered into a matrimonial contract ; yet I
                            was not at ease in my conscience. I felt troubled ; something was not right, but what it was
                            I could not tell. I reasoned upon the subject. Other Christians marry and it is a common
                            practice among Christians. Why is it not right for me to marry ? Why should I feel troubled
                            about it? I went to enquire of the Lord to know his mind and will, and obtain his
                            approbation. But I could get no answer. I felt conscious that the Spirit of God had departed
                            from me. What could be the cause ? Why truly, I had taken my own way; and instead of
                            seeking, in humble submission, to know and do the will of God, I was acting for myself, and
                            doing my own will. I persisted and strove to take all the comfort I could in the marriage
                            state ; but to no purpose. My imaginary hopes of happiness were soon frustrated, and all my
                            enjoyments ended in disappointment. I had turned my heart from<pb n="204" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> God,
                            and sought happiness in the flesh ; God had forsaken me, and my soul was in trouble. After
                            having lived in the marriage state about a year and a half, my tribulation of soul increased
                            upon me to such a degree, that I knew not which way to turn, nor how to find deliverance. I
                            felt conscious that I had nothing that could save my soul, and knew not how to obtain
                            anything. I looked back to the comfort of my former experience ; but it afforded me no
                            relief. It was out of my reach. I could not recall it, because I could not recall the state
                            in which I stood when I enjoyed that comfort, and experienced those divine manifestations
                            which then produced it. I strove hard to obtain something that would afford me the means or
                            the hope of salvation, and ease my troubled soul; but nothing could I find ; and it appeared
                            to me, that under my then present state, I must be lost, for I could see no remedy. (TO BE

                            Christianity, if the spirit of Christ dwells in us. That manifests itself by living a better
                            and holier life. If we feel an anxious desire to grow pure and holy, living honestly the
                            principles and precepts of the gospel, according to the best of our understanding, and the
                            highest light we possess, we shall make no reserves. Christianity when it is received wholly
                            in truth and in reality, causes us to grow wiser and better ; to grow in virtue and to rise
                            above our surroundings which will have no influence over us to mar our spiritual natures,
                            but heavenly<pb n="205" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> inspirations will flow into out1 souls. When a person has
                            contracted bad habits which by long continued practice have grown strong and has bound the
                            soul as with iron bands, it becomes almost a second nature. lie realizes his lost condition,
                            and if he desires to break these iron bands, he must make a determined stand, and resolve to
                            conquer all his evil propensities. He must make a full saci'ifice of all that is near and
                            dear to him, if it is not owned of God. This also is the blessed fruit of Christianity. It
                            gives us power to overcome sin, and to turn away from all evil companions. This becomes
                            imperative if we desire to save our own souls and make ourselves able to help others. Very
                            truly hath the poet said :� "How shall I a habit break? As you did that habit make. As you
                            gathered you must unloose, As you yielded, now refuse. Thread by thread the strands we
                            twist, Till they bind us neck and wrist, Thread by thread the patient hand Must untwine ere
                            free we stand. As we builded stone by stone, We must toil, unhelped, alone, Till the wall is
                            overthrown." Every soul that struggles against his inbred foes, is helped by and receives
                            strength from God and from his angels. A protecting influence is thrown around him, so that
                            the evil one cannot touch him. Sonyea, N.

                                    World was singing a giddy song, And Mie Church a hymn sublime. "Come, give me your
                                    hand," cried the merry World, "And walk with me this way ;" But the good Church hid
                                    her snowy hands And solemnly answered " Nay, I will not give you my hand at all, And
                                    I will not walk with you; Your way is the way to endless death ; Your words are all
                                    untrue." "Nay, walk with me but a little space," Said the World with a kindly air:
                                    "The road I walk is a pleasant road, And the sun shines always there; Your path is
                                    thorny and rough and rud^, � And mine is broad and plain; My roaJ is paved with

                                    room enough for you and me To travel side by side." Half shyly the Church approached
                                    the World, And gave him her hand of snow. The old World grasped it, and walked
                                    along, Saying in accents low, "Your dress is too simple to please my taste ; I will
                                    give you pearls to wear, Eich relvetsand silks for your graceful form, And diamonds
                                    to deck your hair." The Church looked down at her plain white robes, And then at the
                                    dazzling World, And blushed as she saw his handsome lip With a smile contemptuous
                                    curled. "I will change my dress for a costlier one," Said the Church with a smile of
                                    grace; Then her pure white garments drifted away, And the World gave in their place
                                    Beautiful satins and shining silks,<pb n="206" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> And roses and gems and
                                    pearls; And over her forehead her bright hair fell, Crisped in a thousand curls.
                                    "Your house is too plain," said the proud old World; " I'll build you one like mine
                                    ; Carpets of brussels and curtains of lace, And furniture ever so fine." So he built
                                    her a costly and beautiful house; Splendid it was to behold ; Her beautiful
                                    daughters and sons dwelt there; Gleaming in purple and gold ; And fairs and shows in
                                    the halls were held, And the World and his children were there. And laughter and
                                    music and feasts were heard In the place that was meant for prayer. She had
                                    cushioned pews for the rich and great, To sit in their pomp and pride, While the
                                    poor folks, clad in their shabby suits, Sat meekly down outside. The Angel of Mercy
                                    flew over the Church, And whispered, " I know thy sin." Then the Church looked back
                                    with a sigh, and longed To gather her children in. But spme were off at the midnight
                                    ball, An(| some were off at the play, And s!ome were drinking in gay saloons, So she
                                    quietly went her way. Then the sly World gallantly said to her, "Ydur children mean
                                    no harm� Merely indulging in innocent sports." So she leaned on his proffered arm,
                                    And smiled and chatted and gathered flowers, Ab she walked along with the World;
                                    While millions and millions of priceless souls To the horrible gulf were hurled.
                                    "Your preachers are all too old and plain," Said the gay World with a sneer, "They
                                    frighten my children with dreadful tales, Which I like not for them to hear; They
                                    talk of brimstone and fire and pain, And horrors of endless night; They talk of a
                                    place, which should not be Mentioned to ears polite. I will send you some of the
                                    better stamp, Brilliant and gay and fast, Who will tell them that people may live as
                                    they list, And go to heaven at last. The Father is merciful, great, and good, Tender
                                    and true and kind ; Do you think He would take one child to heaven, And leave the
                                    rest behind? " So he filled her house with gay divines, Gifted and great and learned
                                    ; And the plain old men that preached the Cross Were out of her pulpits turned. "You
                                    give too much to the poor," said the World, "Far more than you ought to do ; If the
                                    poor need shelter and food and clothes, Why need it trouble you? Go take your money
                                    and buy rich robes, And horses and carriages fine, And pearls and jewels and dainty
                                    food, And the rarest and costliest wine ; My children, they dote on all such things,
                                    And if you their love would win, You must do as they do, and walk in the ways That
                                    they are walking in." Then the Church held tightly the strings of her purse, And
                                    gracefully lowered her head, And simpered, "I've given too much away; I'll do, sir,
                                    as you have said." So the poor were turned from her door in scorn, And she heard not
                                    the orphans' cry, And she drew her beautiful robes aside, As the widows went weeping
                                    by; And the sons of the World and the sons of the Church Walked closely hand and
                                    heart, And only the Master who knoweth all Could tell the two apart. Then the Church
                                    sat down at her ease, and said, "I am rich, and in goods increased; I have need of
                                    nothing, and naught to do But to laugh and dance and feast;" And the shy World heard
                                    her and laughed in his sleeve, And mockingly said aside, "The Church is fallen, the
                                    beautiful Church, And her shame is her boast and pride."<pb n="207" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> The
                                    angel drew near to the mercy-seat, And whispered in sighs her name, And the saints
                                    their anthems of rapture hushed. And covered their heads with shame ; And a voice
                                    came do^n through the hush of heaven From him who sat on the throne, "I know thy

                            power." The above song was sung mauy years agQ by earnest truth-loving souls. In looking
                            over the songs, and recalling to mind many sayings of those whom we term "The Old
                            Believers," we find this figure of speech often used, warfare, mighty battles against a
                            crafty and insidious enemy, while to-day we seldom use such expressions. Love, union, peace,
                            are more generally spoken of now. It is said that extremes balance each other. Our gospel
                            predecessors were intensely religious, ardent, enthusiastic and thoroughly sincere ; imbued
                            with ideas firmly impressed by their previous orthodox education, and intensified by the
                            soul struggle they had to go through in order, as pioneers in a newly advanced cause, to
                            break off old habits and leave old associations for the purpose of forming new and better
                            ones. And is there not still a necessity for earnest labor? and must we not still carry on
                            an .internal, relentless, individual I warfare in order to subdue in the heart ' those giant
                            evils, "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye aud the pride of life," with all their
                            concomitants, carnal thoughts and desires, vanity and frivolity, arrogance and selfishness?
                            These are not of the divine Father aud Mother and do not build up the new heavens, but
                            continually destroy the peace of society ; and not only to subdue, but to utterly destroy
                            them is the duty of every Christian ; this holy warfare we are called to engage in, aud all
                            who fight this good fight will Lot fail to find growing in the heart the principles of love,
                            union, peace, brotherly and sisterly linduess toward each other ; no longer will be heard
                            railing, backbiting and slander, but harmony and concord will abound. But it is a fact true
                            as truth. lliat the latter is never gained until the former is experienced. Yea I know of a
                            truth that to love my brother and sister with pure Christlike love, I must sever all carnal
                            fleshly, selfish ties, and this is the blessed privilege of each aud every one who enters
                            into the gospel desirous of becoming a follower of the blessed Savior. In my youth I vowed
                            to my God that I would consecrate my life to this cause and from time to time have renewed
                            my earlv vows aud boldly testify that I find comfort and happiness herein, and I1 am bound
                            to continue in this conflict, | not only in this life, but in the life be� yond, till I can

                            </head><p TEIform="p">If the simple assertion of belief could have any intrinsic value in its influence upon
                                the mind for good or ill, it would be an expeditious way to accomplish what might often
                                be anticipated as a much desired result. Conditions could readily be made to change "in
                                the twinkling of an eye," and any degree of exaltation reached that found a response in
                                the mind. Many consciences have been lulled into a morbid security by the teaching of a
                                false theology. Every form of crime as well as every degree of guilt fades
                                instantaneously before this magic charm. A life of dissipation and crime, in which the
                                "sins have been as scarlet" has now, under the wand of a theological magician, "become
                                as white as wool." A corresponding state might be experienced through the acceptance of
                                that word which is so thoroughly incorporated into the theology of the churches, and yet
                                so speculative in the form in which it is used. Faith according to the apostolic
                                definition is " an evidence of things not seen." It is a word of subtle meaning and
                                thousands are led by it into labyrinths where nothing permanent is ever reached. It
                                often serves as a cloak to cover the most absurd movements and to sanction almost any
                                anticipated project that may spring up in an excited mind. Faith in God, as taught in
                                the evangelism of Jesus, is inspirational and in its combination with the principles of
                                practical righteousness, forms the armor of God, through which no power of evil can
                                enter to do harm. St James, in his sermon before the church, does not hesitate to say
                                that Faith, unassisted by good works, is without life, and consequently, cannot impart
                                life to the soul. It was the living waters that were to "spring up unto everlasting
                                life," and not the water from the well in Samaria. It is the living faith in the
                                over-ruling Providence of God that inspires the soul to hope, to work and to endure to
                                the end of the Christian race. In acceptance of the cross of Christ we need so much,
                                this living faith in God, believing that he is the rewarder of those who diligently seek
                                Him. Here comes the place for the application of an inspirational faith that shall
                                illumine our pathway as we travel on toward the city of our G-od. A faith that shall
                                inspire us with confidence to<pb n="209" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> trust iii Him who has promised to be
                                our God, and also promised that we shall be his sons and daughters. To dwell in this
                                faith, is to dwell in an assurance that no obstacle can impede our progress, or deprive
                                us of the treasure of ^ present or a future spiritual kingdom. "We believe," said Peter,
                                while speaking of Jesus, "that thou hast the words of eternal life." If we so live in
                                the world and before the world, that to be called the sons and daughters of God, is not
                                arrogating to ourselves an unmerited title, we shall be baptized into the same spirit
                                and with the words of eternal life, build upon the same spiritual foundation. Nothing
                                short of this determined purpose, to put on the whole armor of God can be of any
                                permanent value. The neglect of any part, howrever trifling it may be, would expose us
                                to the snares and temptations of the adversary of souls. "Follow me," said Jesus, and in
                                following him, we are to be like him. As a son of God he was clad in this armor of God.
                                To be like him we must make the same preparation for the battles of life, if we
                                anticipate a victory over a worldly inheritance. In this spirit we enter the contest for
                                faith, and in faith, which will redeem the world and make its kingdoms the kingdoms of
                                our Lord, and also make his people a praise in the earth. Consecrated communities must
                                form the nucleus of such anticipated kingdoms. For God and for the peace, happiness and
                                prosperity of mankind must be the life object of his people. Anything less than this is
                                conservative of selfish interests, making mine and thine the idols of the heart and most
                                effectually closing the avenues which lead to the peaceful reign of the spirit of
                                Christ.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Eccentricities in diet" TEIform="index"/>ECCENTRICITIES IN DIET.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">"The preference of the Chinese for food [hat seems to our appetites

                                        one would think the stomach would rebel. It is not so, however, though, by a

                                        understand, either, how the inhabitants of the West Indies and the Pacific Coast
                                        can eat lizards' eggs with a relish; still less, how the eggs of the turtle and

                                        an enormous size. It is easy to pick up a handful of ants almost anywhere,

                            death-penalty, the State of Wisconsin in 1853 followed this laudable example of justice and
                            humanity, and so it has been in these states for about forty years. During the last sessions
                            of the Legislatures of Wisconsin and Michigan attempts were made to revive death-penalty,
                            but rejected by a large majority, proving beyond doubt the public sentiment against the
                            innovation proposed. In the last session of the Legislature of the State of New York, there
                            was appointed a commission for the purpose of finding out a djeath-penalty "more in
                            accordance with humanity" than hanging. This commission, which has for said purpose been
                            traveling in Europe, has reported recommending electricity.�-But is not the death-penalty in
                            itself an inhumanity, a cruelty and a barbarism, belonging to former dark ages? Is not each
                            and every mode of carrying out the deathpenalty, be it by hanging, decapitation, shooting,
                            garrotting, electricity, poison or any other way a wilful killing, a murder? Should not our
                            century, which has abolished the inhumanity and barbarism of slavery, following the example
                            of Rhode Island, Michigan and Wisconsin, abolish also the inhumanity and useless barbarism
                            of the death-penalty in all the other States of the Union, showing to the world by this
                            newstep forward, that the United States in every respect are at the head of civilization?
                            Let us consider this question in an unprejudiced way. The writer sincerely hopes, that his
                            arguments for abolition set forth in the following lines are so strong and indisputable,
                            that even those, who until now thought death-penalty indispensable, will come to another
                            conclusion. The Bible says "He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed "
                            But, on the other hand, the Bible also says : "Thou shalt not kill," and we find here two
                            passages 3iametrically opposed to each other, so that the advocates as well as the opponents
                            of the death-penalty can base their arguments on the Bible. Let us, therefore, treat the
                            question whether the death-penalty be just and fair from a purely human standpoint. The
                            penal code has several theories for the death-penalty�namely, determent, retaliation
                            (revenge) satisfaction for the state, and security for the state. The three latter have been
                            pretty well abandoned, and the justification of the death-penalty is now mainly based on the
                            theory of deterring by intimidation, insisting or supposing that an execution must be a
                            warning to other-* not to commit a similar crime. But the penal code recognizes still
                            another theory as the warrant for punishment in general, and that is the reformatory
                            theory�the only one which is morally justified, but which cannot be considered in the case
                            of a death-penalty; because, if a person be executed, there can be no intention of reforming
                            him, and if we hang a man we deprive him, through violence, of all possibility of
                            reformation; we rest satisfied with simply taking his life, murdering him. According1 to the
                            passage : "He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed," in the
                            death-penalty merely a remnant of "vendetta" is exercised. In the cours'e of time, a milder
                            practice has taken place even with regard to capital-punishment, horrible as it may be in
                            itself, inasmuch as the law has ceased to torture the condemned, contenting itself with
                            simply slaying them; the number of the crimes for which this punishment is prescribed has
                            also been diminished, and has been reduced in all countries to that of murder�a great
                            progress in comparison with the last century, when, in England, about a hundred different
                            crimes were punishable by death. Among<pb n="211" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> these was theft to the value of
                            forty shillings�truly, a contemptible price for a human life! How morally debased were th
                            opinions entertained at that time concerning punishment and the value of human life, is most
                            strikingly illustrated by the fact that even a man of the high position of Lord Chancellor
                            Eldon should have exclaimed, horror-stricken�on the occasion of a motion in Parliament for
                            the abolition of this forty shilling law�"Why, by this innovation all I possess would be
                            left entirely unprotected ! " All this has been changed. Murder alone receives the
                            death-penalty. Is it warranted even in this case? The celebrated authority of criminal law.
                            Temme, speaks in one of his works as follows concerning punishment by death : "Why do we
                            still have the death-penalty, which is no punishment, but a cruelty, a barbarity? They say,
                            to murder a human being, to annihilate a human life, is some thing so horrible, inhuman,
                            unnatural, that it can be expiated only by the severest punishment? And in what do they find
                            this severest punishment? They murder the murderer. They annihilate in cold blood his life,
                            a second one in addition to the first! And the second murder they call right, justice, and
                            for the murderer, who is to be murdered, special tortures have first to be created. The
                            death-sentence is announced to the murderer weeks beforehand, and it is said to him : 'Thou
                            shalt die a violent death. We will lead thee to the gallows, and there the servants of the
                            executioner will seize thee, strap thee, and then the executioner will come to thee, and
                            hang thee.' Thus the murderer will be murdered, after having had before his eyes for weeks
                            and months the picture of his approaching cruel death. 'But, after all' they say to him, 'it
                            is possible that you may be pardoned,' in order to make still more terrible, by the seconds
                            of hope, the weeks and months of deadly anguish! And this they call justice, even Christian
                            justice! " The first step of the abolition of deathpenalty was made in 1764, by the
                            celebrated Italian criminal lawyer Beccaria, the champion against capital punishment, by
                            proving that this penalty had nevcr deterred criminals from inflicting harm upon society.
                            But a long time elapsed before his endeavors bore the first fruits. In Tuscany the
                            deathpenalty was abolished in 1786, and in Austria 1797. It was, however, re-enacted in
                            Tuscany in 1852, but this roused such a storm of indignation, that the Government found
                            itself forced to annul it once more. In Austria it was also re-enacted. In Germany the
                            National Assembly of 1848 passed a resolution of abolition, which was put into effect in
                            Oldenburg, Bremen, Nassau, Anhalt, and the kingdom of Saxony, but not permanently; for, at
                            the establishment of the German Empire, when the reaction regained full power that
                            resolution of the National Assembly of 1848 was annulled; and, since that time, intelligent
                            Germany can again be proud of the fact, that in its domain murder will again be committed de
                            jure. In Switzerland the death-penalty has been abolished in several Cantons, but has been
                            re-enacted in some of them. In Holland it Mas abolished in 1870; and the same has been done
                            in Portugal, Belgium and Roumania. Among the states of the American Union it was abolished
                            in 1846 in Michigan, ' in 1852 by Rhode Island, and in 1853 by Wisconsin. The remaining
                            states and the remaining foreign countries have not yet been able to attain the moral
                            elevation requisite for this act of humanity, though in the States of Maine, Minnesota,
                            Indiana and Vermont the law prescribing the death-penalty must be considered a dead letter,
                            as no executions have taken place there for years. In 1887 the Central American States
                            Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Guatemala entered into negotiations for forming a
                            Union, similar to the United States, with the express condition, that the death-penalty in
                            those states should be abolished. That the death-penalty as a means of deterring from crime
                            is a complete mistake; that, on the contrary, the abolition of the death-penalty lessens the
                            number of the worst crimes, whilst executions increase them, is proved by the experience of
                            various countries. In Holland no parricide or matricide was committed in the ten years
                            following the abolition, whilst these crimes oc-<pb n="212" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> curred frequently in
                            the fifty years preceding the abolition. In Tuscany it was shown that the abolition of the
                            death-penalty led to no increase in the number of the crimes considered worthy of death; and
                            the same result has followed the abolition in States of the Union. In Wurtemberg no
                            death-sentence was executed under Karl Wilhelm : in (Jotha, none in fifty years, and in
                            Eussia, under the Empress Elizabeth, none in twenty years, without this being followed very
                            soon by further crimes punishable by death. An English prison-chaplain, who during his
                            official career prepared 167 criminals for execution, has testified that of these 1G7
                            persons, 161 had been proved to have witnessed executions. There is evidence that people who
                            had just seen an execution, only a few hours afterward, themselves committed murder. Can
                            one, in the face of such testimony claim any validity for the theory of deterring by
                            intimidation? Considering the frightful brutality in the intentional killing of a human
                            being, considering the profoundly demoralizing effect which executions entail, and, from
                            their very nature, must entail, one can indeed rot wonder that their result is not a
                            decrease, but an increase of heinous crimes.

First,
                                it contains a very interesting account of the Children of Israel, and second, because
                                the iravels and experiences of the twelve tribes, in journeying from Egypt to Canaan,
                                are typical of Christian progress from error to right, in this day. Many lessons given
                                to them by their leader Moses, are worthy of attention from professing Christians now.
                                The Ten Commandments embodying the Moral Law, is one of the wonderful revelations of
                                that period. The first one reads, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," and the
                                sicond emphasizes it, "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of
                                anything that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the
                                water under the earth," inducing the opinion that idolatry was one of the besetting sins
                                of the Children of Israel, and was therefore forbidden first by their divine teacher.
                                And so it afterward proved. Each time that the people were deprived of their leader, we
                                read that "they remembered not the Lord, but turned again<pb n="214" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> to
                                serving false gods." Judges viii., 33, 34. Some writers are of the opinion that the
                                journey of the Israelites through the Wilderness is but an allegory, portraying the
                                opposition of thf human heart then as now, to the divine hand that would direct and
                                guide to the spiritual Land of Promise. Whether taken in this light or otherwise, the
                                history of their strange wanderings is a wonderful lesson. The condition of society in
                                the days of the Children of Israel necessitated the commandment referred to ; but to-day
                                there is no need of its literal injunction, for civilization has done away with the
                                graven images and false gods of ancient days; but the words, "Thou shalt have no other
                                gods before me,"�are they not applicable to our lives? Where is our God, when fame,
                                wealth or intellectual attainments claim the first and last consideration? When we deem
                                ourselves and selfish interests, wherever centered, worthy of the best efforts of mind,
                                might and strength, are we not guilty of idolatry, and in its most degrading form? The
                                gods of the heathen, we think, are almost incomparable with the varied, yet none the
                                less adored gods of to-day, at whose shrines so many "bow down and worship." If we live
                                in conformity with the first of the ten commandments given so many years ago, we may
                                understand the words of Jesus, when he said, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with ail
                                thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength," for
                                this can be made a reality only where the soul is free from the sin of idolatry.

                                surroundings, I was led to think how silently the laws of God, governing Nature are
                                carried into effect, and how unlike the noise and bustle characterizing all of the works
                                of man! Only a few weeks ago, and we were anxiously watching for the seemingly tardy
                                growth of vegetation. How imperceptibly, as it were, the fair earth had been clad with
                                its many shades of green, and ah, how silently too has this marvelous growth been
                                fulfilled ! I mentally queried, "Is not the law which enhances the growth of the soul as
                                silently fulfilled? And is not one obscure worthy deed of far greater value to the
                                Christian than many performed merely to be seen by human eyes, or praised by human lips?
                                Too often we regret to find that the motives prompting our daily acts are hardly in
                                accordance with the dictates of conscience! I realize, more and more that the reward
                                arising from conscious integrity and the approval of "Him who seeth in secret" is rather
                                to be chosen than any words of human praise. * *.'.'* * Sober' Autumn having come again,
                                another lesson presents itself to my thought, for today, I perceive that by the same
                                silent forces noticed in Spring, Nature is being disrobed of her leafy mantle, and that
                                each plar.t and shrub will, ere long, be revealed in its true character, and while one
                                at our right may disclose an ill-shaped, uncomely figure, another at the left is
                                well-defined and symmetrical, and I see that each is presenting its individual outline,
                                revealing its undisguised merits and defects. Just so, I think, must every soul sometime
                                appear before the sunlight of truth. I involuntarily closed my eyes to the earthly scene
                                and the following questions seemed to be put to me audibly. "Are you willing to be
                                stripped of all false coverings and to lay aside your claim to a name, a profession of
                                religion, and to aught that appears well in the eyes of men? Are you willing to stand in
                                the light of God alone clothed in your just merits? What kind of a character have you
                                been forming, what degree of growth found in spiritual life? Are you willing to display
                                the treasure you honestly claim as yours, gained by the work of the heart or that of the
                                hands? " While pondering these weighty questions, the rays of an autumnal sun began to
                                gild the distant horizon, and gradually, yet surely rose above the hilltops, until I
                                could see the whole of its broad disk. Unwonted joy thrilled my being, for by the
                                accompanying impressions I was assured that the Intelligence which had questioned me so
                                closely, had also giv n<pb n="215" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> evidence that the rays of the San of
                                Righteousness had not only appeared upon the horizon of my soul's vision, but reassured
                                me that though apparently slow in its progress, it would yet rise above the mountains of
                                self-love, pride, vanity and other worldly influences, surrounding me, and finally
                                illumine my whole life, if faithful to my conscientious trust. Canterbury, N.

                                when the wicked first born of Adam slew his own brother. Oh! shocking deed. I seem to
                                see the children, Cain and Abel, in their childhood innocence, before sin had set its
                                seal upon the brow of Cain, and marked him as a fugitive in the earth. When they grew to
                                the estate of manhood thev chose different occupations, one tilling the soil, and the
                                other keeping sheep. I imagine with what delight Cain took Abel through his fields,
                                confiding every feeling to him as they went, and he in return would climb the mountain
                                heights to see the products of Abel's care. All seemed to be prosperous. In course of
                                time they desired to make an offering unto the Lord. Cain brought the first fruits of
                                the land, and Abel the firstlings of the flock. The Lord, it is said, had respect for
                                Abel's offering because he was righteous, but unto Cain and his offering he had not
                                respect. This stirred within Cain the feelings of anger and revenge, and when he saw his
                                brother he lifted up his hand and slew him. When the Lord asked him where Abel was, he
                                replied, "I know not; Ami my brother's keeper?" Thus he added falsehood to murder, and
                                justly deserved the punishment which was inflicted; and in his own conscience he felt,
                                no doubt, that he should have been his brother's keeper, but had proved most unworthy of
                                his trustWe are all each others keepers, and under the law of sympathy and dissimilarity
                                it is impossible to be otherwise. "It is the universal law of all that exists," says a
                                modern philosopher, "not to have in itself either the reason or the entire aim of own
                                existence " What is taken to supply life from is sure to be given back in some way, for
                                this world is built upon a vast system of exchange. It is utterly absurd for human
                                beings to style themselves independent. "No man, no class can be exclusive, each lives
                                by the help of all, and is bound up in the welfare of all, in one living, sympathetic
                                organization." We do not comprehend how much we rely upon others, how much we live in
                                them, nor how much we should miss them if suddenly taken from us. One has one gift or
                                power of adaptability which another has not, thus through our different individnal gifts
                                we become our brother's or our sister's keepers. '"So the carpenters encourage the
                                goldsmiths, and he that smooths with the hammer, he that smites the anvil. There are
                                other ways still in which we may be the keepers, guardians or friends of our associates.
                                When we see them sinking under infirmity, or overtaxed with weighty duties, or drooping
                                under discouragement, let us then remember that "a friend in need is a friend indeed."

united labor, Community homes, and equal
rights to all. It is published by the Mutual

THE WOMAN'S TKIBUNE,
in its sixth year of publication has a national scope as a representative of the woman
suffrage    movement.           Every      reader
should take a paper which accurately reports the facts connected with this measure,
both state and national, and which shows
the part women are taking in all matters of
public interest. The Woman's Tribune
is the lowest-priced, has the largest circulation, and the most able contributors of any
paper of the kind. The articles on the Indnstrial Subjection of Women, by Prof.
J. K. Ingalls, the well-known author of
works on Social Science, and the Reminiscences of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the president of t!ie National Association, who has
been for over forty years the leader in the
woman suffrage demand, give the paper a
value equal to any of the high-class magazines of the day, while its various departments make it interesting to all classes of
readers. Edited and published weekly at
Beatrice, Nebraska, by Clara Bewick Colby.
Price, $1 per year. Trial subsciiption, five
weeks for ten cents.
" I consider it  the   best  suffrage paper pub
