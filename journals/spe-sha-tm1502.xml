                            shaken has been going on in the world, and, with extraordinary results, and, from time to
                            time has been felt among the Shakers. Under the idea of progress, some individuals have
                            urged their ideas and conceptions, upon notice, tending, in some �cases to the subversion of
                            the normal and radical form of Government of the Christ Order. A true line of faith, as
                            taught by the Christ spirit, instructs that the work of Christ's Kingdom is the work of God,
                            and, that all true progress will proceed from Him, through the work itself, in those who are
                            subject to its order, and ��not in the line of mere human theories, and worldly
                            philosophies,�conceptions of progress in the intellect only; such conceptions, and a quiet
                            perseverance in self-denial to wrong and hurtful habits are quite distinct. It is truly
                            written "The invisible things of God," (to the carnal vision only) "are clearly seen and
                            known" (to the Christ enlightened vision) " by the things that are made, even His Kternal
                            Power and Godhead. " And, with safety we can add, that the visible things of creation aleo
                            clearly show that all normal growth, proceeds from central life ; and, that when any living
                            body sets up local action, not controllable by, central life, an abnormal growth, as a wen,
                            boil, or carbuncle is the result, which certainly tends to disorganization,�disease, which,
                            persisted in, results in death. If we look through the four grand divisions of animate
                            life,�the Radiate,<pb n="26" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> the Molusca, the Articulate, and all the various
                            forms of the vertebrate, up to man, we find central life predominating", and beneficently
                            presiding and harmonizing with the members of the body, and the members, with the central
                            controlling power ; and. when there is a delegation of central energy, as in the ganglionic
                            system in man, said system is strictly under central control. Central controlling life is a
                            leading, prominent, ever present manifestation of animate life ; and, what is truly
                            remarkable, the growth of each individual, from the lowest Radiate, up to Man, is
                            independent of the animal, in its inception, independent of its will, or volition ; Jesus
                            Christ saw this, hence he. says, " Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit to his
                            stature?" Those who speak lightly of the theocratic form of government of Christ's kingdom,
                            would act wisely to be still, and learn that God is in His Holy Temple, a redeeming and
                            creative power; redeeming us from the bondage of our degraded animal nature, its habits and
                            propensities, and creating us anew in the likeness of His own attributes. Even as our bodies
                            have their growth irrespective of our choice, so, also, will the work of God be irrespective
                            of our planuings, and devices. The best that souls can do, is to be faithful to obey the
                            appointed centre of life,�the Order and Authority in the Kingdom of Christ. To this our Lord
                            and Savior,�Christ, set us the example when he uttered, " Not my will, but thine, 0 God, be
                            done. " Let each one and all be true " to finish " (put an end to) u transgression " (of
                            God's laws :) " an end to sin ; make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in everlasting
                            righteousness. " Do so. and, in due time, every good and true desire in regard to
                            government, will befulfilled ; growth of stature iu Divine goodness, beauty of form, and
                            development of function will be completed. Again. Peace ! Be still. " The theories and;
                            philosophies of the natural man, are, at best, but disintegratingagents, when introduced
                            into the ideal of God's plan, and, in the nature of things, unstable, let them alone; they
                            are adapted for the worldly man, not for the members of Christ's body. "Let the wicked
                            forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord," *
                            * * "For my thoughts are not (as) your thoughts; neither are your ways (as) my ways saith
                            the Lord. " Isa." lv., 7, 8. There is such a thing as a seeming support and subjection to
                            central authority, which., in fact, is unreal! Let our support be from an undivided heart ;�
                            warm, and affectionate ; ever overflowing with thankfulness that we have a part and lot in a
                            work that confounds the wisdom of the natural man, and humbles in the dust all
                            self-exaltedness 1 Let us not forget, that, in the exercise of our free agency, we may gain,
                            by a wise use, our claim to an inheritance with the faithful; or, by an unwise use thereof
                            lose that inheritance ! If, in faith, we look for God in His Order, we shall find Him, as
                            lie has promised, He will meet us there ; and this, notwithstanding what may be. or seem to
                            be, the imperfectness of individual personage-, representiug the Order". "Why callest thou
                            me good?" said Jesus,. " There is none good, " (absolutely free from all imperfection) "but
                            God." If this Order of God is slighted, and counsel is taken of human nature's crooked
                            wills, where Christ is. such souls cannot come. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 20</p></div2><pb n="27" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Resignation" TEIform="index"/> RESIGNATION.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hampton, Oliver C." TEIform="persName"/>OLIVER C. HAMPTON.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Resignation is a peaceful and quiet surrender of the spirit to the inevitable trials and
                            sorrows of life. One of its indispensable elements is patience. We are so constructed that
                            we can fight with our inevitable fate, and in the process pass from unreasonable impatience,
                            to despair, from that to desperation and finally be forced to look toward the ghastly
                            portals of suicide. On the other hand by our efforts at complete resignation we may disarm
                            our trials and sorrows of a great part of their poignancy and sometimes even get released
                            from their entire weight of affliction in this way. I was once placed under so severe a
                            scene of suffering I scarcely knew how to bear it or what to do. It was suggested to my
                            mind, (doubtless by some wiser and holier intelligence than myself,) that this was a good
                            time to try what a spirit of resignation would d for me. In the words of the rapt poet, I
                            was minded to try " What consolation I might draw from hope ;�If not what resignation in
                            despair. " Under the inspiration of this good thought I sat down and composed the following
                            Stanzas. In perfect resignation, Unto thy just and holy way, O God of my salvation,� Still
                            help me travel day by day. Thy visible Anointed� In every thing I will obey, For this thou
                            hast appointed, To be the only saving way. Grant me thy holy .spirit, All opposition to put
                            down That peace I may inherit, And gain a bright, unfading crown. My journey is to Heaven,
                            Tho' wicked spirits should assail The pow'r of God is given� To stem the d:irk and stormy

                            borrow, I'll calmly bear what conies to me. Celestial hope shall cheer me� � Until I reach
                            that tranquil shore. Where grief shall come not near me. But peace be mine forever more.0
                            'tis a land of pleasure,� A land of everlasting rest, Where without weight or measure. Each
                            weary spirit shall be blest; Then in true resignation, I'll steer to that delightful shore
                            Where death makes no invasion,� Nor sorrow's dismal thunders roar. I labored with all the
                            power of my spirit to attain to a state of complete resignation to this severe trial which
                            was brought on me, as I felt, unjustly, and I realized in a short time the full influence of
                            this good spirit and became so fully resigned that all my sorrow fled away and was followed
                            by a "peace which passelh understanding. " 1 knew another experience precisely ]ike the one
                            above narrated, and the agonies of which produced the following lines under a sincere effort
                            to be wholly resigned. My soul approves the lovely way The gospel spirit shows, And as I
                            prove it day by day� t The more the blessing grows ; 0 who could bear the gal.ing load*
                            Accusing conscience brings, While on life's rough and weary Eeady The wicked feel her
                            stings. Then how ungrateful I should be To murmur on the way, And disrcgaul the charity, My
                            Elders show to me. 'Tis Order binds the carnal mind� And breaks the sullen will, ; Then to
                            its counsels I'm resigned,. In patience to be still. The same happy results followed thi*<pb n="28" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> effort on the part of the suffering brother, which was experienced in
                            my oA\n case, viz. Peace, tranquillity and contentment of mind. No effort should be spared
                            to shun all unnecessary sufferings both physiological and psychological, but when this has
                            been faithfully done, and there still remains a residuum iu the crucible of affliction which
                            cannot be parried by our best wisdom, resolution and forethought, it is wise and prudent to
                            make a strong effort to pass into the realm of sweet resignation at once, and there remain
                            in patience and prayer until we have become perfectly passive under the stroke of our
                            affliction. The consolations of the Holy Spirit are sure to rise up in time as a u well of
                            water springing up unto everlasting life. " Bv this calm discipline the scathing fires of
                            affliction are ..gradually assuaged and quenched by the waters of consolation until our
                            spirits learn to conquer the whole ground and come to inherit the regions of invulnerable
                            peace. And although as was foretold by the rapt prophet "The fruit of righteousness shall be
                            peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever " yet tlie same
                            inspired sage assures us. tfiat '"� lie that believeth shall not make haste. " The chafed
                            spirit is so impetuous under the agonies ot protracted trials and depressions, that it is
                            often tempted to rebel and as it were, iu the words of Job's wife to almost " curse God and
                            die. " But this is only a throe of undisciplined desperation, which would result in
                            consequences infinitely more excruciating and unendurable. Patience and prayer will
                            unfailingly furnish relief if only persevered iu. I do not want to be egotistic but as
                            little episodes of experience are more interesting and to the point, with me, than any other
                            mode of elucidation of a subject, I naturally infer they are to others, so 1 will give one
                            more short one. Being once under very heavy tribulation something seemed to say to me " You
                            cannot mahe all your sacrifice at once and you are not required to. If vou were ascending a
                            ladder and should let go with one hand before you had secured a hold with the other you
                            would fall and ruin yourself. So you must wait and get what little good you can out of your
                            present imperfections till you have time to secure your hold firmly on something better and
                            higher. You need not sacrifice any faster than you can find something better to sacrifice
                            for. Be more calm and less anxious." By the time these suggestions and inspired counsels
                            were closed. I was very peaceful and quiet and very much comforted and re-assured. So Dear
                            Brethren and Sisters it being a time of the Church's experience and travel, where much
                            waiting and great patience are especially in order, let us take hold of the gift and be
                            daily, nightly, and hourly exercised therein and pray not only for ourselves but for each
                            other, not only each other�but for our friends not of our order, not only for our friends
                            but for our enemies everywhere, for all saints and particularly for all sinners. Let our

Like a swift gliding meteor, like a fast
                            gliding cloud; Like a flash of the lightning, as a break in the wave, lie passes from life
                            to his rest in the grave. " The above are the opening lines of Abraham Lincoln's favorite
                            poem, which he often recited to his intimate friends, though he had reached the loftiest
                            heights of human greatness. An:1, why should any human being be proud? By what right,
                            inherent or acquired, can any one assume to look with disdain upon another ? All have the
                            same origin and the same destiny ; all are sprung from the same earth ; their
                            life-sustaining necessities are the same, and death gathers all in one common grave. But '
                            wherever civilization has established itself, there will the people divide themselves into
                            ranks and classes. There will be the high and low, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, the
                            refined and the brutal; there will be the moral and the vicious, the religious and the
                            profane. These distinctions are the result of individual action, limited and controlled by
                            social and natural conditions. But their existence would not justify the indulgence of
                            pride, since all are dependent upon each other ; and it is unwise and unreasonable, and a
                            prolific source of weakness. For he in whose heart it has entered loses the capacity of
                            properly judging his environment; as he magnifies himself he correspondingly belittles
                            others, and his plans are apt to be defeated. As long as Home was just and virtuous she was
                            great, but when pride and self-glorification became the ruling passion, her decline and fall
                            began. The history of the Jewish nation exhibits the most startling picture of self-defeated
                            pride and arrogance. Called to be the chosen people above all others, they willingly
                            accepted the call, but never, as a people, fulfilled the conditions upon which it was based.
                            They became<pb n="30" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>blinded in their self-importance. The Messiah was to be a
                            Jew who would thrash the nations round-about, and Jews were to be the rulers of the world.
                            Their utter contempt for other nations is Avell illustrated in the conversation Jesus had
                            with the Phoenician woman. ' The cutting irony with which he referred to the gentiles as '*
                            dogs, " evidently reflected not on his own personal feelings, but the national Jewish
                            aversion ; and his great heart instantly melted in compassion at the woman's answer. With
                            the rejection of the great truths promulgated by Jesus, they lost even that which they
                            had�their nationality and the protective power of the Mosaic law. The worst and most
                            inconsistent form of pride is that which shelters itself under the cloak of religion. Where
                            that .spirit exists it will kill the spiritual life of the soul as surely as it destroyed
                            the national life of the Jews. Was it not against religious pride that the keenest
                            iuvectives of-Jesus were directed? It stop* all progress. The proud heart is .satisfied with
                            itself. It worships self. Charity and Love, the cardinal virtues of the Christian religion,
                            have no dwelling-place there. We cannot love or sympathize with that for which we feel
                            contempt. Why should any one be proud? What have we to be proud of! Is it our personal
                            appearance? We know that ere many years have passed the iron iiuger of time will have traced
                            indelible lines in the fairest countenance ; and we also know that the smile of innocence
                            and the kindly eye of sympathy and good will can illumine the homeliest face with a beauty
                            which mere regularity of feature can never give. Js it knowledge and scientific love? Let us
                            remember how very little we know even of the things nearest to us and concerning us most.
                            Was it not but yesterday, as it were, that we discovered that the blood circulated in our
                            bodies? How few there are who can name the trees and plants, the birds, the insects and
                            rocks that are all around us ! Or who can solve the mighty mystery hidden in that sun that
                            daily shines upon us, upon which our very lives depend? Who can say what feeds those fires
                            that are forever burning and glowing? There are so many things connected with our lives that
                            are utterly inexplicable to the human understanding, there are such mighty evidences of
                            infinite power, compared to which the feeble efforts of man are almost unappreciable, that
                            pride appears to be absurd, grotesque and ridiculous. Yet there is one form of pride which
                            is not to be condemned, but rather to be commended. It is the pride of character,
                            self-respect and proper self-esteem. The possessor of that quality of mind� and no man's
                            character can be complete without a proper share of it�is careful of his reputation, he will
                            not stoop to low and ignoble acts because he would thereby lower himself in his own
                            estimation and in that of others. The philosopher Kant expresses that sentiment when he says
                            : tkI, in my own person, will not violate the dignity of humanity. " George Washington is
                            the type of such a character. But a false and sinful pride stands condemned by God and the
                            Christian religion. Jesus was the embodiment of self-respecting meekness, of
                            God-fearinghumility. The apostle John says that the pride of life is of the world and not of
                            the Father.<pb n="31" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>To what depths of crime, sin and suffering, pride has led !
                            It kindles the 1ires of ambition, the love of rule, the lust of power : it stops at no
                            obstacle, it overrides every consideration of religion and morality, of law and equity, to
                            satisfy its insatiate eraviugs. The great tyrants, those arch-criminals, that have cursed
                            mankind with tliaif existence, were both proud and ambitious. It is but a step from pride to
                            hate, and hate has its ultimate in murder. The climax, the very insanity of pride, is well
                            represented by Milton, who causes Satan to say : '� I would rather reign in hell than serve
                            in heaven." And with those words lie has discovered and laid bare the source of all pride ;
                            it is the unwillingness to serve, or to be subject to any power, whether it be of God or of
                            man. . The unrepentant sinner is a rebel who defies God ; lie rejects salvation because it
                            imposes restraint upon a lawless nature. Blinded by pride and self-love he refuses to submit
                            to him whose }Toke is easy and whose burden is light. He fails to see that after all the
                            only slavery, the only ignoble servitude, is subjection to sin, and that the only true
                            freedom and genuine liberty is found in the truth of God. From pride. 0 Lord ! deliver us.

                            satisfied. St. Peter, '"Forasmuch then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm
                            yourselves likewise with the same mind, for he that hath suffered in the flesh, hath ceased
                            from siu." After the baptism of Jesus, his work was so swift that in a<pb n="32" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>short time, comparatively he was able to say to his disciples, "Be of good cheer, I have
                            overcome the world," and to his Father, " I have finished the work Thou gavest me to do. "
                            The sacrifices which he made and which he requires us to make, to be one with him, even as
                            he is one with the Father. " All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of
                            the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father bnt is of the world. " 1 Jno.ii., 10,
                            and according to the words of Jesus Christ unless we inake this sacrifice, deny ourselves
                            daily and take up the cross, forsake all that we have and our own lives also and thus follow
                            him in the regeneration, we cannot be his disciples. This is the only at-one-ment, or
                            offering, or at-one-ment which God will accept. What doth it profit a man to believe that
                            Jesus overcame the world, that he prepared a gospel feast, that he has left us an example
                            that we should follow in his footsteps, if he does not partake of the gospel feast, if he
                            does not practically follow in his footsteps ? Why, his condition would be similar to two
                            hungry men seating themselves at a table with a good dinner. One of them partakes of the
                            food, the other does not. How can beholding the tother eat a good dinner benefit him? Or
                            suppose we see two jx&gt;eii, one of them a temperance man, the other a drunkard. What
                            salvation would it be to the drunkard to believe that his neighbor was a temperance man
                            while he continued his intemperate habits? "Faith without works is dead." Without a
                            sacrifice of his intemperate habits he has no at-one-ment with good society. But hold on,
                            some one says.�"Not of works lest any man should bonst. " We do think from St. Paul's
                            confession that he had no just cause for boasting, but rather to have bowed in humility
                            before God. If boasting must come, let it come from one who said. " My Father loves me for I
                            do always those things that please him. " Jesus seems to think works were of some
                            consequence, for he said, "The son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his
                            angels, then shall he reward every man according to his /corks." The Apostle John says, "The
                            hour is coming in the which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come
                            forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil
                            unto the resurrection of condemnation. " It seems in settling the final account, that good
                            works are of vital importance, and without them the soul is not clothed with the
                            righteousness of Christ, but is poor, wretched, blind and naked. Canterbury, N.

                            "The New Jerusalem has come down from God out of heaven; Christ has come the second time,
                            and if you want to be saved, you must confess your sins and take up rt full cross against
                            the lust of the world, the lust of the flesh and every sinful indulgence or you can never
                            enter the kingdom of heaven." The interview with James Jewett was then related, and the
                            guidance to the home of that good man, believed to be by the spirit of truth. John now
                            communicated all that he had seen and heard ; that he had confessed his sins, one by one, as
                            he had committed them, and when he had done that work honestly, he was filled with the gift
                            and power of God. John and Sarah Barnes were well prepared to receive this testimony, and it
                            entered deeply into their hearts, and John was led by the spirit to say,�"This is the woman
                            we read of in Revelation, clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet. " Be fore the
                            sun went down the next day John and Sarah had confessed their sins to God, before his
                            witnesses. John Cotton lost no time in conveying the joyful news to his New Light brethren,
                            and also to his neighbors and friend-, a few of whom received the glad tidings. By special
                            agreement between John Cotton and James Jewett some of the ministers from New Lebanon were
                            to come to this place as soon as convenient. John arrived home the iirst of June and the
                            iirst of July the trump of the Arch-angel was sounded by three messengers of God, who
                            .shouted with a loud voice, calling souls to " come to judgment, and confess your sins. "
                            This voice the whole neighborhood heard while yet afar off, and long before the messengers
                            could be seen. The people, however, know the meaning of the voice, and rushed from their
                            houses to meet the sacred messengers. These were found to be,� James Jewett of Enfield, N.
                            H. ; Ebenezer Cooley of New Lebanon, N. Y. and Eliphalet Comstock of Hancock. Mass. Such a
                            joyful meeting was never before known in this place. These ministers were received as the
                            ambassadors of Christ, and they were filled with the message of salvation, which they
                            communicated with a zeal, life and power. They also went from house to house, holding
                            meetings and preaching the word of God, so that many were converted, confessed their sins
                            ami received a baptism of purifying Jire. The family of Benjamin and Mary Barnes seemed ripe
                            for the harvest, and all accepted the faith. These three ministers, before mentioned, held
                            meetings with good effect in Alfred, Lyman, Waterborough, Gorham and Windham, accompanied by
                            John Cotton and John Barnes. Kbenezer Cooley was the leading spirit and a powerful preacher.
                            The Lord blessed their labors and the seed of faith that was sown took deep root in good
                            soil. In all these places which they visited were found many of the New Light Baptists who
                            were prepared for a higher and more progressive work. Finding the fields so promising in the
                            province of Maine, as it was then called, other ministers soon followed and held meetings,
                            and by the blessing of God, many able men and women were gathered into "the fold of Christ.
                            It would almost seem as though a line of I communication had been laid by spirit
                            intelligences from New Lebanon through Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire and Maine,
                            and then more particularly^ Alfred, Waterborough, Lyman, Gorham, Windham, New Gloucester,
                            (called Sabbath Day Pond,) Poland and Falmouth. The fire of truth which these messengers
                            kindled, flashed like lightning into all these places, and convicted many souls of the
                            necessity of living a higher life in the true Christ order. Individuals, from all the towns
                            named, were gathered into this Society, among whom may be named, Nathan Freeman, Joshua
                            Harding, Josiah and Aaron. Whitney; all of whom had families. In a younger class we find
                            Kobert McFarland, Ezekiel Hatch, Joseph Whitney, Elisha and James Pote. All the above were
                            from the town of Gorharo, <pb n="34" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>Gowen Wilson and family were from New
                            Gloucester. Eliphaz Ring and family from Poland, and Thomas Cushman and family from
                            Buckfield. Thomas Cushman was a wise, judicious man, and subsequently became a member in the
                            order of Ministry. Among the unmarried young women we find the names of Dana Thorns, Mary
                            Hatch, Abigail Cotton, Dorcas Cotton and Lois Kneeland. These were also residents of Gorham.
                            The head-quarters of the Believers in this section was at the house of Benjamin Barnes,
                            which occupied the place where the Sisters' shop, at the Second Family, formerly stood, and
                            his farm extended from the Massabesie Lake to the Bunganut pond. Benjamin was one of the
                            first to consecrate his property and this became a nucleus around which the domain grew to
                            the present extensive dimensions. The following account belongs more properly to the history
                            of New Gloucester, but it may with propriety be incorporated in the history of Alfred, as so
                            many, whose names are here given, were gathered to this Society. In the month of August
                            17S-4- a company from Gorham and Sabbath Day Pond, chartered a small vessel of Greenfield
                            Pote of Portland, called " 77te Shark. " The vessel was of twenty eight tons burden, and was
                            to be titted out to go to New York and up the Hudson river to Albany. The object was to make
                            a visit to Mother Ann and the Elders, who lived in Niskayuna. Samuel Brown was appointed to
                            act as captain and Enoch Wake as assistant skipper. Thirteen Brethren and twelve Sisters
                            formed the company for the pilgrimage. Eobert McFarland, Barnabas Bangs, Thomas Bangs,
                            Nathan Freeman sen., Samuel Brown, Moses Hanscom, Nathaniel Stevens, Ezekiel Hatch, James
                            Merrill sen., Nathan Merrill, Solomon Twombly, Gowen Wilson and Knoch Waite. Dana A. Thorns,
                            Lydia Freeman, Barbara Brown, Mary Hatch, Catharine Bangs, Betty Cotton, Hannah Whitney,
                            Betty Stevens, Molly Merrill, Rachel Merrill, Molly Wilson and Hannah Starbird. Several of
                            the Brethren were good sailors. The little craft was well manned ami amply supplied with
                            stores for the voyage out and to return. With a favoraUe wind they sailed pleasantly out of
                            the beautiful harbor of Portland and directed their course to New York. It was high tide
                            when they passed through Hurl or Hell gate. The sisters, particularly, had dreaded this
                            place, as the passage, at times, was extremely rough and very dangerous. The Sisters were
                            made quite happy when told that they had unconsciously passed the fearful place unharmed.
                            They waited in New York a short time for a favorable wind and tide to bear their little
                            craft lip the river to Albany. Barnabas Barnes would often relate the struggle they were
                            obliged to make, to stem the current before reaching Albany, and said he was amused to see
                            how adroitly the skippers would tack and beat against the tide. Those not immediately
                            engaged in manning the vessel did not remain idle. Their time was improved in catching fish
                            which they carefully packed, and of these were able to present several barrels to the little
                            family at Niskayuna. They also made presents of other stores which they carried from home
                            for that purpose. Several of the Brethren remained in Albany to care for the vessel, while
                            the others of the company walked to Niskayuna, a distance of seven miles. Mother Ann and
                            others saw this company, in vision, many days before their arrival, and requested that
                            preparation be made to receive them. Postal facilities were limited, and slow at that, and
                            the custom had not obtained in that day, as now, of writing letters to apprise friends of
                            expected arrival of company.

                            themselves of every evil indulgence. That is salvation. '' Jesus was risen early the first
                            day �of the week, and he appeared unto Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils.
                            " When she told those who had been with him, they believed not. Then he appeared in another
                            form to two of the disciples as they walked into the country. These told it to the rest.
                            Neither did they believe. Afterward he appeared unto the eleven disciples when they were all
                            together at meat, partaking of the Sacrament, and Jesus upbraided them for their unbelief
                            and lmrdness of heart. Then all of them believed. They believed they had seen a dead man who
                            was arisen from the dead, come to life again, as did Lazarus and the widow's son. De was the
                            first begotten from the dead, had broken the chains of death. In a word, the physical

                            scientifically true, yet a vast amount of good Avas done with it. lie appeared. What

                            disembodied spirits to do, to wit, create a temporary body that all persons present can see
                            and handle�-%a body that could eat, drink and talk with logical power and rational
                            understanding? The laws, under which, and the modus operand), by which this appearing was
                            effected, were not then mown and understood as at this present time. Belief was an act of
                            faith in, and obedience to authority, rather than of facts and demonstration. Now
                            Spiritualism is being reorganized and treated as a science, as Geology and Chemistrj are
                            treated. The secular scientific world attach to it nothing sacred or religious. And the
                            theological religiou.s world either deny it as a fact and denounce it as a fraud, or
                            admitting undeniable phenomena, outside of the possibilities of their encyclopedia of
                            sciences, they ascribe it to Satan and his invisible but powerful hosts. In the end each
                            party will learn to respect the other. The scientific will become religious and the
                            theologians will become religiously scientific. They will come together. Then the scientific
                            law will be put into their minds, be intellectually understood, and the religious law, of
                            love, will be written in their hearts. Religion and science will unite as one. Rational
                            understanding and religious spiritual faith, that lays firm hold of the invisible world of
                            intelligent beings, will unite to constitute a practical life motor. Then it will be evident
                            to all that some things can be done as well as others, and that the millions of spirits who
                            have hitherto walked the earth, unseen in Christendom�Babylon�and who have been regarded as
                            phantom Ghosts, or as Angels, making visits very few and centuries between, can now make
                            themselves appear in bodily form, to talk and act like other people ; as really as did
                            Moses, Elias and Jesus. Not ouly do they appear to souls hungry for scientific knowledge of
                            any kind, either mundane or spiritual, but also to those who hunger and thirst after
                            righteousness, making the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, that arc in the <pb n="36" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> Christ Spirit, subservient t� the one thing needful�to wit, that they sin not

                                    conditions, as persons can be made to see white to be red, and black to be white, to
                                    hear sounds Avhen none l'each the external ear, to taste food when none is present,
                                    to feel when no substance of matter is near. It is not strange that the simple are
                                    misled. No reason whatever is appealed to, to sustain the theory. Its devotees seem
                                    to rise on the wings of the wind and by imagination, and a love of the marvelous,
                                    and are carried away to the supersensuous and still find no solid resting place.
                                    That there is more than one substance, and not more thai) two in existence, I think,
                                    is self-evident. These are matter and spirit, and that one of these cannot become
                                    the other is also evident, but as others think differently, I propose to offer some
                                    reasons on the subject. First,�If there are two distinct substances they cannot be
                                    alike in any particular, else they would be but partially distiact�a inixture which
                                    would prove | them to be the same. Second,�If they are not alike in any particular,
                                    they are .contradictory. If they are- contradictory, it is impossible<pb n="37" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>for them to affiliate, or for one to become the other. Oh, nay ; this
                                    must be set down among the things which arc impossible. Two substances that are in
                                    no respect similar are neither interchangeable nor interblendable. The conditioned
                                    cannot become the unconditioned ; nor the extended the unextended, nor vice versa.
                                    To admit this would be equal to asserting that a thing could be made to exist, and
                                    not to exist at the same time, which with bowed head, I must say is impossible with
                                    God. Thus we cannot foil to perceive the impossibility of a spirit materialization ;
                                    but if one can become the other, the one substance theory is proven to be true.
                                    Hence we have no God but nature, and to nature only are we accountable. Shall we
                                    become Atheists? Locke reasons thus : " If matter were the external first cogitative
                                    being, there would not be one infinite cogitative being, but an infinite number of
                                    cogitative beings of limited force and distinct thoughts independent of each other.
                                    But unthinking particles of matter, however put together, can have nothing thereby
                                    added to- them but a new relation of position, which it is impossible should give
                                    thought and knowledge to them." Thus the two substances are proved to exist, which
                                    at the same time proves also the impossibility of spirit materialization. Then I
                                    would say let not the elect be deceived by the weird, phosphorescent, moonshine
                                    ghosts and hob-goblins manufactured by spirit tricksters and jugglers in both worlds
                                    to make money and deceive tho race. Just take away all the money from this spirit
                                    circus and it would die in a fortnight. I am asked if I would not believe were I to
                                    see them myself? I answer, not at all. It would1 be impossible for me to believe,
                                    until 1 should be first convinced of the truth of the one substance theory, and that
                                    God and the thinking principle within me were matter and that I was not possessed of
                                    a spirit substance distinct from matter. Prof. Mapes says the senses are unreliable.
                                    In order to make a spirit materialization possible its advocates are driven .to the
                                    point of denying spirit existence altogether, hence leaving no spirit to materialize
                                    ( !) and thus knock out their own underpinning. They make it only the disappearance
                                    and re-appearance of matter, as that of water and vapor, and seem too obtuse to know
                                    they have stultified themselves. When we take a rational view we know matter is
                                    unintelligent�we look into nature and find it not,�but continue our mental vision up
                                    "Through nature to nature's God." We behold the two substances in bold relief, and
                                    are compelled to exclaim, in spite of every effort at unbelief: ki Spirit exists
                                    distinct from and with power over matter." The exudation of. molecules of matter
                                    from the pores of a groaning medium, being spiritualized and becoming the spirit of
                                    one's deceased brother, sister, wife or child, is one o( the sheer humbugs and
                                    grandest impositions on human credulity with which the gullible can be gulled. Every
                                    one, or every thousand who see, hear, feel, taste or smell departed spirits, are
                                    abnormal and conditioned for the purpose. No person while in their normal condition
                                    ever saw a spirit, or ever will. Spirit seeth spirit,�matter seeth matter. We may
                                    become abnormal, and bv so conditioned by spirit38 the manifesto.<pb n="38" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> power as to see, hear, converse with, feel and handle them ; but on returning to
                                    our normal condition they disappear, and we know not whither they have fled. Some
                                    arc more easily conditioned than others, not that they are more worthy. Spirits
                                    choose those organs that are most easily conditioned. Not content with this the
                                    highest phase and most reliable spirit action, some in their great anxiety for the
                                    marvelous, visit worldly cabinets in the shades of even, and pay their money to be
                                    deceived, and get what they go for. We should return to the New Testament, with
                                    Christ Jesus and Mother Ann Lee for our pole star. Leave the world's reformers to
                                    work out their own problems, and "we preach Christ crucified to the world." We can
                                    easily defend the gospel work against ail religionists, dogmatists, scientists,
                                    spiritualists, materialists or infidels, with uo fears of a single defeat.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Shaker Theology" TEIform="index"/></bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="biography" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Issachar Bates no. 7" TEIform="index"/> ISSACHAR BATES.-N0. 7.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H.

                            discussed having reference to the final removal of the Believers from the settlement. The
                            malarial condition of the climate caused so much sickness, which in many cases resulted in
                            death that it seemed hazardous in the extreme to attempt the continuance of a community in
                            such a place. It had been proposed that the members of this Society should be received into
                            those now established in the states of Ohio an'd Ky. and this arrangement was accepted by
                            those who resided in Busro. Issachar has not entered into any details concerning the
                            departure from the Indiana Society but makes this simple statement. " The removal from Busro
                            took place in March 1827 and Oh what a trying day it was." After Issachar had closed his
                            visit in Busro, he sorrowfully bade it farewell, and made a journey on horseback to Pleasant
                            Hill. Ky. a distance of 100 miles. "Here we (Joshua Worley and himself) were gladly received
                            and kindly treated. " After a tarry in this place of five days they passed on to Union
                            Village, a distance of 140 miles, reaching the village on the fourth day. On the 10th Sept.
                            lie went onto Watervliet, Ohio. He remained at this Society till June 1st 1830 when he, in
                            company with Elder Solomon King, journeyed to Watervliet, N. Y. to see once more the friendi
                            of his first gospel home. Nearly twenty six years had passed since he was called to New
                            Lebanon and by the Ministry ot that place commissioned as a missionary to preach the gospel
                            of Jesus Christ in the then, great West. They made a call of a few days at North Union,
                            Ohio, and then at the settlement at Port Bay, and then on to Watervliet. They crossed Lake
                            Erie in a steamboat and then took the canal at Buffalo for Lyons and from Lyons to Albany,
                            N. Y. On their arrival at Watervliet. Issachar says. "The place of my former residence began
                            to feel like a new world to me. For ten days we feasted on love and good-will and on many
                            precious treasures. " They next visited New Lebanon, N. Y. and after a few days passed on to
                            Hancock, Mass. Deacon Daniel Goodrich accompanied them to Enfield, Ct. Keturning they again
                            call at Hancock, "where" as Issachar writes, " we were favored with every privilege we could
                            wish." They again call at New Lebanon "and their kindness and loveliness was one steady
                            stream. " And he says this of every place. They now return to Watervliet, N. Y. and after a
                            few days take a canal boat at Schenectady and in five days were again in North Union, Ohio a
                            distance of 500 miles. " In a few days we were again on board a canal boat bound for Newark,
                            Licking Co., then in a stage to Springfield, Clark Co., at this last place we have a
                            conveyance in a wagon to Watervliet Mont. Co., where we arrived Aug. 20, 1830. " In Mar. 26,
                            1832, Issachar was relieved from his official duties. Since Sept. 10th<pb n="39" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>1826 he had been an active and efficient Rider in the Society and was loved and honored by
                            all who knew him. In 1833 lie again visited South Union and Pleasant Hill at the request of
                            Elder Benjamin Youngs who was at this time, in the Ministry of South Union. He spent several
                            months in these Societies, and shared bountifully in the good gifts of a loving people. He
                            again visited Union Village on his way to Watervliet, reaching home in the early part of
                            Sept. The infirmities of old age were now making active inroads upon his health, and the
                            dear Brother certainly thought that his days would soon be numbered. He had even selected
                            the spot for his last resting place, and bid farewell to many dear friends. Many more days
                            however were to be added to his pilgrimage in time, more changes were to be made and more
                            crosses to be borne before the last fareAvell word could be said to all his gospel friends.
                            When Summer came a better degree of health was realized and he was able to do some light
                            work in the garden. In June 183-i the Ministry of New Lebanon sent an invitation to Brother
                            Issachar to visit them and also to make their home, his future home. Several other persons
                            were to accompany him on the journey, which added a little pleasure to the very great cross
                            which he now felt in leaving his western friends. He writes, � " Then I thought of my grave,
                            the place I had selected. But there was no way to get into it, and no one to help me ! And
                            as there is no discharge in this woe, I must go with the gift. " After many words of
                            blessing, many expressions of loving kindness and many genuine yet sorrowful farewells, he
                            left Watervliet on the 14th of May 183u. It had been just thirty years, four months and
                            fourteen days since he left New Lebanon as a missionary to the western world He now
                            writes.�" We went on our way like loving children, and although I was full of sorrow, yet I
                            could take comfort. I told our company that this was my retreat. I had played it on the fife
                            a great many times, but I had never had such a retreat as this one, and then composed the
                            following verses. THE RETREAT. Time is like a bubble Floating on the main; Puffed with joy

                            June, having made a short visit at North Union Ohio and Watervliet, N. Y. while on the way.
                            " On reaching my home in New Lebanon every Believer I met was full of .loving kindness and
                            tender compassion for me. This is a glorious place and the people all look glorious to me,
                            and they are lovely and altogether beautiful. Elder Issachar continued quite comfortable in
                            health till a short time before his death. After an illness of ten days he passed away on
                            the 19th of March, 1837, being nearly 80 years of age. " Issaehar Bates had a very
                            remarkable experience and passed through many trying scenes, lie was active and powerful,
                            devoted soul and body. He possessed an extraordinary talent for discoursing with persons of
                            all characters on religious subjects, whether for inquiry, argument or opposition, always
                            ready for an answer, and not afraid to meet any man or any subject whatever. He was a
                            battle-ax to a'll hypocritical professors and a thorn to wrong-doers. He was very plain in
                            his speech, rather humorous, generally setting off' his remarks with an anecdote or story.
                            His mind was a store-house of information and with him we part with a treasure of knowledge
                            and information. All his words and actions seemed calculated to inspire life and confidence
                            in God's work. Of thee beloved Elder Issachar may it be said, ' Well done good and faithful
                            servant, enter thou into the the joy of thy Lord.'

TEIform="persName"/>JAMES S. PRESCOTT.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Why do not the Shakers vote ? We answer briefly. For the same reason that Christ did not
                            vote. And they take Him for their example. Voting by the ballot for civil rulers is not a
                            Christian institution but a civil rite, and belongs exclusively to the children of this
                            world and not to Christ's kingdom. The '' ballot" is one of the best institutions the world
                            have to preserve order on the earth plane, where, the laws of voting, and the ballot box is
                            kept sacred, and not perverted to a wrong use. The world have a right to the "ballot, " it
                            is their privilege to vote, all who are recognized as citizens of the United States without
                            regard to nationality,� age�sex�or color�not excepting the women of our country, especially,
                            if they hold property, and are taxed ior it. They have a right to the "ballot, " and to use
                            it as a weapon of defence, in common with all other citizens, and to help vote down and out,
                            all tyranny and oppression, injustice and wrong, fraud and deception, chartered monopolies,
                            and monied aristocracies, which go to endanger the liberties of the American people, and to
                            hold in perpetual bondage, less favored classes. Such is the power of the "ballot," and this
                            power is in the hands of the American people, and it is left optional with every individual,
                            to use this power, by voting or to abstain from it. There is no law requiring every citizen
                            of the United States to vote, because he is a citizen, and it is right it should be so,
                            otherwise our country would not be a free country. And those who choose to vote have no
                            right to impose the ballot on those who have conscientious scruples against voting. If it
                            were not so, our country would not be a tree country. Father James Whittaker, in speaking on
                            this subject, said that those who allow themselves to feel for one political party more than
                            another, had no pai%t with him. Father James was one of the first founders of " Shakerism."
                            He had the spirit of Christ, and knew whereof he affirmed. We remember the time when one of
                            our Elders from Union Village, Ohio, a man of liberal education, and classical learning,
                            said, "Brethren! Are thereany parties among you? Tf so, I will tell you just which side I
                            will join. Neither ! Christ, is not divided. His people are called to be one people, of one
                            heart, and of one mind. " This timely warning from one of the faithful watchmen on the walls
                            of Zion, took effect. It put a quietus on a " party spirit, " antl we heard no more of
                            voting. It served to shut out, and keep out, a k'party spirit," from among us, from that
                            time, henceforth.

                            impor^tant, as with only a healthy body and a sound mind can a pure spirit be developed.

                            which will be manifested by the cultivation of good influences, the results of which will be
                            a pure external life. Then will be accomplished a grand work by those who receive and give
                            pure influences. Many will be resurrected from the sea of sin, a life of carnal pleasure,
                            and from false teachings. These will be brought under the rays of God's holy light where
                            they can see and know that life is not aimless, over which roll ciouds of darkness, but that
                            there are clouds lined with gold, agloAv with a sunshine of everlasting glory. Let those

                            those over whom you have cast your influence. This will aid in elevating them spiritually
                            and all will perceive the brilliant achievements, caused by your duty to God, which is well
                            spent employment. We know that worth will win, and that all the pure influences we give are
                            finely blended within the soul according to God's holy work. Let us cast these good and pure

                            except we walk in the way. It would be very absurd to say we wish to reach any particular
                            place and still continue to persistently walk in the opposite direction. Even so we must
                            walk in Christ, who declares himself to be the only way, which leads to Clod, the fountain
                            of all goodness, if we would obtain that oneness, which is both the right and the test of
                            the true disciple. By walking in Him we walk in the truth, as He is truth. We shall be
                            upright and honest in all things. Not only shall we speak the truth to our neighbor, but we
                            must deal it to our own souls, by condemning all wrong in ourselves, thus live the perfect
                            truth at all times and in all places. Christ is also the Life thereof; if we would walk in
                            the way and the truth, we must live the life. This calls for a renunciation of self and
                            selfish desires and appetites, even the laying down of our carnal lives that we may be able
                            to live by the same principles that he lived, thus following his example by walking in the
                            same self-denial and continually doing good to all, as far as lies in our power. In this way
                            we conquer and crucify self. When this is accomplished we have no inclination to follow any
                            other course. Then shall we be filled with all the fullness of love and inherit the reward
                            of sweet peace, when we have come to God our heavenly Father and Mother, not by believing
                            merely, but by actually living the " Way, the Truth, and the Life. " Canterbury, N.

Well, that is just what we wish to do.
                            For a great many years onr fathers and mothers have been engaged in this same cause and as
                            children of their spiritual care, we can do no better than to keep the work carefully before
                            our own souls, and no less faithfully before the children of this world. God has not called
                            us into a home of indifference, nor for a few days of faithfulness, but rather to a life of
                            stern selfdenial and the cross, and to a growing righteousness, ever and ever. We are still
                            in the morning of the New Year. A gift of divine love is before us. Watching and praying
                            will become one of our great spiritual opportunities. Already we have passed one month of
                            this new year, and have spoken and written and prayed and sung with each other of the good
                            things which God has reserved for those that love and serve him. Again we meet in the
                            conference and bring forward those gifts that have been wrought out by care and prayer or
                            that have been conferred upon us by some passing spirit. Whichever it may have been, we have
                            no doubt but that much good will be obtained by this spiritual interview. Elder Harvey L.
                            Eads, on the Unity of the Faith, strikes the key note of religious success. It is the pure
                            in heart that have the promise of entering the heavenly courts. With this we have a
                            certainty of the precious prize, while with an abundance of other good gifts, and tliis not
                            obtained, we are still wanderers in the wilderness. A community of spiritual people cannot
                            dwell too earnestly on the essentials of a religious life. We need to confer often with one
                            another. "Indeed, we ought to give more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest
                            at any time we let them slip. " No one could reasonably anticipate much hope of success who
                            spends his time in pruning his neighbors vines, to the neglect of his own. Very much depends
                            upon the union that is maintained, upon the concert of action by which to accomplish the
                            work for our own prosperity and for the salvation of those who may not be of our order. It
                            becomes us at the beginning of this year, to pray with the Apostle of Jesus Christ, and ask
                            for the wisdom that cometh from-above, which is pure and peaceable, and gentle, easy to be
                            envreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. (James.)
                            We should, with all diligence " Strive to enter in at the strait gate," and having entered
                            it can do no harm to brush up our armor. Moth and rust may have injured it more or less,
                            while we have been doubting. Indifference may have weakened it in some places, and
                            negligence allowed other places to become unsuitable for use. "Tothingshort of the whole
                            armor of God can warrant a sure protection against the sins of the world. Let us contend for
                            the faith. Purge out the leaven of the Sadducees and Pharisees, and so prepare our offerings
                            that they may be acceptable before God. </p></div2><pb n="43" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>SANITARY</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health maxims" TEIform="index"/> HEALTH MAXIMS.</head><p TEIform="p"> The object of the following maxims is to communicate some generally accepted principles

                                        child, who, the more he is helped the more he looks for it. The more medicine a
                                        man takes the more he will have to take, whether it be ano dyne, tonic or

                                        When alcohol was first introduced into the world in its concentrated form, about
                                        the year one thousand, it was called '' Aqua Vitac " the water of life, the
                                        great catholicon for human maladies, but it soon became the " Aqua Mortis, " the
                                        water of death, the source of mortal woes incalculable. Never sit or stand with
                                        the wind blowing on you for a single moment, for it speedily produces a chill,
                                        to be followed with a fevej and then a bad cold. If thrown into the water and
                                        the strength is failing, turn on the back with only the nose and toes out of the
                                        water, hands downward and clasped. This should be practiced while learning to
                                        swim, as a means of resting from great fatigue in swimming. Exercise to the
                                        extent of great fatigue, docs more harm than good. A hearty meal, taken while
                                        excessively fatigued, has often destroyed life. No rational mind can fail to see
                                        that it is a wisdom and a duty to guard against the causes and watch vigilantly
                                        against the indications of such diseases as dyspepsia, which often so influences
                                        the mind, as to subvert the whole character, making a wreck of happiness, heart

Reason's bright light kindled
                            by God's love is one of our choicest gifts. All men or women hi this wor*d or in the spirit
                            world are naturally attracted to the society of those like themselves. What is more
                            necessary in this life than the culture of a spiritual relation to those we are going to
                            unite ourselves with when done with mortality. Never despair; be always Brave; understand
                            the power of the spirit, which gives us soul strength. So the obstacles in our path of
                            progress.�Temptations which now overcome us,�Sorrows which now oppress us. Fears which are
                            only shadows of our dreams, will become exercise for our strength to nerve us up to show how
                            much real Christian fortitude of character we have in possession. Trials, what are they?
                            They are the gymnastics of a spiritual life ; what would the soul be without them to draw
                            out from the depths of the mind those precious and noble thoughts. My young friends do you
                            know how much good the present discipline is going to do you in future life? Do you know it
                            is the Dictionary that is going to open or unfold to you all the Knowledge you need to
                            secure that long looked for inheritance in the heavenly spheres? It is the link that is
                            going to weld you into the chain of union with your dearest and long loved friends who have
                            crossed over the river. Nerve up my young friends don't let the weakening spirit of
                            discouragement light upon you.�Keep it off if you can�run for your life when you see it
                            coming�clinch up anything to fight it� a club, a stick ; shake, war, do something to keep it
                            out into the cold from you. Anything is better for an associate than a discouraged spirit. ,
                            Look at the poor miserable creature, lank, lean and barren of any social life ; moping along
                            under the fears of some dreadful thing that is going to come upon society : He has no
                            friends, for no sensible person who feels for their character will ever listen to his or her
                            foolish harangue. When he comes to the table for a little of the sustenance of life to keep
                            soul and body together, which I fear will fall apart before long unless there is a decided
                            change soon, his eyes are" cast' around the Kitchen, knowing before many days he will be
                            deprived even cf these blessings. What then is going to become of the homestead? All the
                            older people have left the ranks and gone to report for higher promotion, and who is going
                            to support us? Poor miserable creature, how I pity you. If you would only go to work and
                            give up your whining, murmuring spirit and take hold of gospel liberty, you would soon see
                            who was going to keep the homestead. Have you put your hands to the gospel plough? Where are
                            your eyes? Certainly they are not looking ahead to the further end of the furrow. A good
                            ploughman never looks behind until the furrow is finished, and then he looks for the crooks
                            and bad places, to mend them the next time. Do you profess to be a follower of Christ? He
                            said, those who have put their hand to the plough and look back were not worthy of his
                                association.T<pb n="45" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/>He has gone too far, poor discouraged �creature ; he

                                    different questions ; and among others it was asked how the command to pray without
                                    ceasing could be complied with. Various suppositions were stated ; and at length one
                                    of the number was appointed to write an essay upon it and read it at the next
                                    meeting; which being overheard by a plain sensible girl she exclaimed, What! a whole
                                    month wanted to tell the meaning of that text, it is one of the easiest and best
                                    texts in the bible. Well said an old minister. Mary what can you say about it, let
                                    us know how you understand it, can you pray all the time. () yes sir. What when you

                                    Indeed! well Mary do let us know how it is. most people think otherwise. Well said
                                    the girl, when 1 first open my eyes in the morning I pray Lord open the eyes of my
                                    understanding. While I am dressing I pray that I may be clothed with the robe of
                                    righteousness and when I have washed me I ask for the washing of regeneration, and
                                    as I begin my work I pray that I may have strength according to my day. When I begin
                                    to kindle the fire, I pray that God's work may revive in my soul, and as I sweep the
                                    house, I pray that my heart may be cleansed from its impurities; and while preparing
                                    and partaking of breakfast, I desire to be fed with the hidden manna and the sincere
                                    milk of the word; and as I am busy with the children, I look up to God as my Father
                                    and pray for the spirit of adoption, that I may be his child ; and so on all through
                                    the day ; everything furnishes me with a thought for prayer. Enough! enough cried
                                    the divine, these things are revealed unto babes, and often hid from the wise and
                                    prudent. Go on Mary and pray without ceasing. The essay as a matter of course was

                                the Journal should have a wide circulation; and as a means of extending an interest in
                                the subject, the Fowler &amp; Wells Co., have prepared a new phrenological chart�a
                                handsome lithograph of a symbolical head. The relative location of eaeh organ being
                                shown by special designs, illustrating the function of each in the human mind. For
                                instance, secretiveness is shown by a picture of the cunning fox at te up ting to visit
                                a hen-roost; combativeness is represented by a scene in a lawyer's office ; the teller's
                                desk in a bank represents acquisitiveness; a butcher shop is made to stand for
                                destructiveness; the familiar scene of the " Good Samaritan" exhibits the influence of
                                benevolence; sublimity is pictured by a sketch of the grand scenery of Yosemite Valley.
                                Many of these pictures are little gems of artistic design and coloring in themselves*,
                                and will help the student to locate the faculties and to impress his mind with a correct
                                idea of their prime functions. The chart also contains a printed key giving the accepted
                                names of the different faculties ; the whole picture is ornamental; nothing like it for
                                design and finish being elsewhere procurable. It is mounted for hanging on the wall, and
                                will be appropriate for the home, office, library or school. The head itself is about 12
                                inches wide, beautifully lithographed in colors on heavy plate paper, about 19 by 24

                    VERTISJEMENTS, The Golden Rule is a weekly nonsectariaa, religious family paper, published in Boston
                    at two dollars a year, and is rated one of the best of its class. No paper in the country can excel
                    the Golden Rule in attractiveness and intrinsic value. It is the favorite family paper wherever
                    introduced. It has something for every member of the family, and is always pure, bright, helpful,
                    entertaining, and Pre-eminently readable. Whenever a fair trial has been given to the Golden Rule it
                    has almost always secured a permanent subscriber. It is on this ground that a new departure is made
                    in the history of newspaper enterprise. Read the following offer : To any reader of Tin: Manifesto,
                    not now a subscriber to the GOLDEN Rule, sending $1.00 in stamps or otherwise, the Golden Rule ivill
                    be sent one year from the tune the subscription is received,. Although this sum does not nearly
                    cover the actual expense of the paper thus sent, we know that it will be a good investment in the
                    end, as experience has shown that when the paper has once gained a foothold in a family, it is
                    almost sure to become a constant guest. Newspapers are like people ; it takes time to get acquainted
                    with them, but when once an attachment is formed it is hard to break. Write at once, enclosing
                    $1.00, and mention The Manifesto. You are sure of twice your money's worth, at least. Address, "THE

                    Fbakkiin is a town of four thousand inhabitants, situated eighteen miles from Concord on the Jine of
                    Northern Railroad and three miles from Tilton, on the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad.
                    It is divided into two villages with two Post Offices, viz. Franklin and Franklin Falls. The
                    Pemigevvasset and Winnipiseogee rivers flow through the town, the former dividing the two villages,
                    and unite a short distance below, forming the far-famed Merrimaek. Many important manufacturing
                    industries are losated here, including one large woolen and two hosiery mills. The Winnipiseogee

                    several pulp mills and many other concerns that are brought here by an excellent water power,
                    furnishing employment and making business active. The surrounding towns include Tilton, Sanbornton,
                    Hill, Andover, Salisbury, Boscawen, Noithfleld Danbury. Small villages have grown up in nearly all
                    of these places, but a majority of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits and Franklin
                    furnishes a ready market for farming products. The Franklin Transcript is devoted particularly to
                    the interests of local affairs, giving several columns each week of Franklin news, and employs
                    correspondents in all of the surrounding towns, who give reports of events as they transpire in the
                    different localities. A " Farm and Household" department contains much of interest to the farmers,
                    many contributing to it, and with state and general news items it is quite a readable sheet. It is
                    all printed at the home office. Subscription price one dollar a year. All correspondence relating to
                    any business connected with the paper will receive prompt attention. Yours truly, O. A. TOWNE. 8. H.

                    (including Canada) 50 States and Territories, and the first $1.00 subscription received by us from
                    each of these fifty sections of country will entitle each of the fifty lucky senders to a Gold Medal
                    by registered mail, also The Public Herald free, to the day of their death�be it one or one hundred
                    years�and membership to The Public Herald's "Roll of Honor." We hope the fifty fortunate subscribers
                    will reach us before Jan. 1st, 1885, in time to call the Roll in the first number of The Public
                    Herald. Annually, therecfter, on eacii birthday of The Public Herald, we shall, editorially, call
                    the " "Roll of Honor, " to see how many� like Napoleon's guard�still hold out. So hurry up the first
                    subscription from your State, and secure the Gold Medal and find a place on the " Roll of Honor "
                    and a life-long treat to good literature, as well as the lasting supreme satisfaction of having it
                    said, for a life-time, that you were the first in your State to recognize a good thing, and which no
                    money can purchase. And this idea has set us to wondering as to who the successful parties may be?
                    In what town or city does eacli now reside? How many will be males and how many mil be females?
                    AVhat their respective employments? How many born in this country? How many of the same surname? How
                    many married? How many single? How many will live to old age? How many die in their prime? How many,
                    after the first call of the " Roll of Honor, " will answer to their names? How long shall|we be able
                    to keep the list unbro"ken? How many marriages will it be our �pleasure to^record? Hew many will
                    reach high positions of honor and trust? Now, who shall have the honor of being first of all in
                    the-United States, and first on the " Eoll of Honor?" and who first of all from his or her
                    �individual State or Territory? At the call of the "Roll of Honor, " we shall publish the
                    likenesses, and record in brief whatever events of general.importance each member may furnish us
                    with, connected with Ms or her own personal history. The first number of The Public Herald1 will
                    appear January 1, 1885. The enormous edition of (500,000) half a million specimen copies will be
                    issued. No other paper is known to have ever issued so large an edition. (Advertisements of
                    responsible tirros only will appear in the pnper.) The cost of white paper alone for the first
                    number will exceed $5000.00. While The Public Hehald will be the same size as Harpers' Weekly, the
                    subscription price will be but #1.00 per annum; six months, 60 cents : three months, 30 cents ;
                    sample copies,. 10 cents. Every $1.00 subscriber will at least receive, The Public Herald one year
                    and a Christmas peesext worth at least 50 cents in the stores. The name of L. Lum Smith, editor and
                    proprietor Public Herald will be sufficient guarantee that the above promises will be strictly
                    adhered to, and that care, expense, originality, executive and editorial ability, will net be
                    lacking. The bright, polished and sparkling literary gems which are being carefully collected from
                    numerous rich mental minds, may be aptly compared to diamonds of the first water. Like our bodies
                    which grow by clean and nourishing food, so shall the minds of the readers of The Public Herald
                    grow. Pernicious and sensational journalism, frauds, and corrnpters of our youth, will be as
                    fearlessly fought and prosecuted by The Public Herald as they have been for eight years by The
                    Agents' Herald, and by its publisher, L. Lum Smith, from the lecture platform. The above unique and
                    original heading of the Public Herald will satisfy you that we are in earnest. Send in your
