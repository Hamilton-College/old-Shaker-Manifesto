                            Civil? did we say? Civil? when by their laws, the poor, unable to obtain land wherefrom to
                            extract the sustenance for life, and unable to obtain labor to win that sustenance from
                            those who have land, and its hoarded harvests, are driven to crime and desperation! But (so
                            called) Civil governments oppoint this day to celebrate the advent of the birth of Jesus,
                            the poor man's Friend, by the institution of a ceremony of the Romish Church worship,
                            nominally meaning, " The office of prayers rendered at the Lord's Supper,"" called " The
                            Eucharist," which Eomish theology teaches is consecrating the notable bread and wine, of the
                            memorable " last-supper" fame, so that it may become transubstantiated â€” changed into the
                            real body and blood of Jesus! This is the Romish theory of " Mass," and the purpose of the
                            appointed day of Christmas. But this institution is now, by nearly all sects of so-called
                            Christians, converted into a holiday, just as the French nation has now converted the
                            Sabbath into a gala day, substituting feasting and revelry for prayers and sacrifices,
                            originally instituted in imitation and commemoration of Jesus' giving His life a ransom for
                            sinners, as His death on the Jewish cross, by the hands of wicked men is interpreted to
                            mean, by the theology of most professedly Christian sects. But, 0 ye bright angels from the
                            heavenly spheres, tell us, while the poor by thousands are starving, does a feast of roast
                            turkey, terrapinsoup, plum-pudding, cranberry-jelly, and visiting of wealthy friends, at
                            whose convivial board the sparkling bowl is drained, by lips that utter not thanksgivings,
                            and where are hearts that seldom or never bowed in gratitude, symbolically commemorate the
                            self-sacrificing life of Jesus, which He lived in order to become the treasury of power
                            wherewith to baptize a sinning world into repentance? Ah, who shares of the Christmas feasts
                            ? Alas! not these unto whom Jesus said: " Behold I come to bring unto you glad tidings." 0,
                            nay, not the poor, the needy, and destitute, but those unto whom Jesus said : " Behold ye
                            have received your consolations." Ah, would to heaven we might have one universal Christmas,
                            characterizing the life of Jesus, breaking bread to the hungry, and, with a life's
                            sacrifice, pleading the cause of the poor and needy! A day in^which every heart <pb n="266" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 266 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. should be made glad and thoughtful, by being fed,
                            warmed, clothed and comforted with the remembrance of care and human kindness; a day wherein
                            all souls could be made to feel the hospitality of man to man, and that of brotherly and
                            sisterly interest, love and friendship. Brother, Sister, Christian ! I know these names ;
                            they speak to us of bliss; they ope the gates of heaven ; in their bosomed sweetness rests
                            the ark of peace; upon their brows is poised the laurel wreath of union; charity and
                            forgiveness reign supreme ; harmony is spoken from their eyes, and a crown of love pure as
                            the virgin snoiv, rests upon their heads; love so tender, so deep and soul-thrilling that it
                            will never permit hard feelings, hard words, nor unkind actions, to be thrust upon a
                            brother, sister, nor friend, to mar the union, nor abraid the peace! Thus to live, is
                            keeping Christmas; thus to live is celebrating the memory of the birth of Jesus into the
                            resurrection order, the New Creation; and the self-sacrificing life of Christ, not only on
                            the notable anniversary of Jesus' birth, one single day in three hundred and sixty-five, but
                            three hundred and sixty-five days in every year; converting the epoch of a life-time into
                            one vast Christmas, a feast day of rejoicing, bringing heaven to earth, and making one
                            glorious Jubilee of the Lord! Brethren, Sisters, Christians, shall we not thus keep
                            Christmas ; thus set out anew to make our home a Paradise; our house the Court of the Angels
                            of the heavenly land, with " none to hurt or destroy in all God's Holy Mountain," the soul
                            life-bond of union? Our meetings thus freed from the bitterness of hatred ; the wickedness
                            of malice ; the ruthless barbs of jealousy ; the mockeries of hypocrisy; the deceitfulness
                            of lies, and the painful bondage of the sins of private life, may then be the assemblies of
                            blessedness, where fountains gushing full and free with soul-life and heavenly love are
                            inviting and invigorating, and the river of eternal life rolls smoothly on, without a ripple
                            from the discordant waves of unholy passion. This is a Christmas of the Lord ; this a
                            monument to the blessed, consecrated life of Jesus Christ, firmer, purer than the diamond's
                            crystal base; more trenchant than its angular point upon the institutions of a woe-stricken
                            world! Gospel friends, be this our Christmas ; this harmonious relation our Christmas tree,
                            bearing upon its boughs the luscious fruits of heaven, garnering 'neath its bending limbs of
                            grace, all the gifts of a beneficent Father and a Heavenly Mother, bestowed upon the
                            children of their consecrated Zion Home. 0, friends, grant me to be a guest at the feast of
                            the Christian's Christmas !</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Jehovah" TEIform="index"/>JEHOVAH</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Basting, Louis" TEIform="persName"/>LOUIS BASTING</byline><p TEIform="p">In a former article I advanced some arguments showing the fallacy of the claims in support of
                            the Divine Inspiration of the Bible, spoken of as an entirety. While those arguments were
                            based mainly upoxi such technical grounds as mistranslation and interpolation, I now propose
                            to show from the unquestioned text itself that there exists further and still weightier
                            reasons that should lead us to reject it as a book of <pb n="267" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER
                            MANIFESTO. 267 supernatural origin and authority, spoken of as a whole. There is not a more
                            striking inconsistency exhibited in the whole system of orthodox theology than the
                            identification of the Jehovah of the Old Testament with the God of the universe. The most
                            enlightened men of all Christian denominations, men eminent for practical piety, and learned
                            in all the wisdom of this world, have united in ascribing to the Supreme Being all the most
                            exalted virtues the human mind is capable of conceiving; whose power is unlimited, in whom
                            mercy and justice are blended in harmonious grace ; they declare his eternal selfexistence ;
                            his omniscience ; his prescience ; his inconceivable mode of being ; his infinite wisdom
                            that cannot err ; his infinite goodness that can do nothing but what'is eternally just and
                            kind. Such are the attributes of the Deity, but how widely different is the character of the
                            God of the Jews ! It is unreasonable that God should create a race of human beings, endowed
                            with freedom of action, and, being enabled by prescience to foresee their career, that he
                            should " repent " of having made them, and to destroy them almost literally. Yet such is the
                            story of Genesis. It is absurd that a being of almighty power should not be able to overcome
                            a small tribe of men, " because they had chariots of iron," as we are told in the Book of
                            Judges. It is blasphemous to assert that the Eternal Fountain of Truth should " put a tying
                            spirit into the mouths of the prophets," as is stated in Chronicles. The God of the Universe
                            never gets angry at the children of his own creating ; he does not treat them as his enemies
                            ; he does not thirst for revenge ; he never required " eye for eye, tooth for tooth;" he
                            does not delight in war and bloodshed; and he never surrounded himself with such a murderous
                            class as Jehovah established. The conquest of Canaan, unjustifiable as it was, was
                            accompanied by atrocities which were never excelled in barbarity by any military chief,
                            ancient or modern ; yet they were all executed by the direct command of the Jewish war-god.
                            The portrait of Jehovah, as presented to us in the Old Testament, would undoubtedly
                            represent equally well the character of a sanguinary despot of Homeric times. But it has
                            been said, apologetically for those deeds which stand condemned by the criminal as well as
                            the moral code of our day, that they were done with a view of benefiting the Jewish people ;
                            that, considering their barbaric condition, it was the best mode of dealing with them, then
                            possible. Admitting that the argument appears plausible enough, it is in reality dangerous
                            and misleading sophistry; a miserable casuistry. The horrors of the medieval inquisition
                            were enacted with exactly the same end in viewâ€”to keep inviolate what was considered the
                            purity of the faith, and to save the souls of the people. It was this doctrine that the
                            means employed were justified by the end in view ; which justly or unjustly has been
                            attributed to the " Society of Jesus," which has been condemned by the moral sentiment of
                            all Christendom, and has made the name of '"Jesuit" odious throughout the world. There is
                            but one rule of action laid down for the guidance of all men : to do right according to the
                            light possessed ; and no possible contingency in human affairs can ever arise, which would
                            justify a departure from that rule. How inconceivably absurd, if not wicked, does it appear
                            then to attempt to explain away the barbarities and immoralities committed by the Jews at
                            the command of their God, as having been countenanced by that God whom we worship as the
                            embodiment of Truth and Love ! Murder is murder, lying is lying, sin is sin, whether
                            committed by man, by angels, or even the hoary Jehovah. The ways of Providence may often
                            appear mysterious and indefinable to human minds ; but we may rest assured that God
                            accomplishes his purposes by means which harm not one of his creatures. The anthropopathic
                            view of the Jewish Deity given in the Bible, is no doubt, in a large degree, the reflex of a
                            savage condition of society and of brutal minds, who ascribed every emanation from the
                            spirit world to God ; and spirituality and hope of immortality being almost unknown to them,
                            they worshipped their ruler with fear and trem- <pb n="268" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 268 THE SHAKES

                            terrible. Jehovah was to them indeed a terrible God! But are we who have learned to know God
                            as a loving Father and Mother, of ineffable mercy and goodness, who is never vindictive; who
                            never destroys; but who is ever ready to forgive and to bless every soul that turns Godward;
                            are we to regard him as one with the gory divinity of Jewry ? Itather let us accept the
                            revelation of our day and welcome the light of reason that rejects the traditions and
                            authority of antiquity whenever they conflict, or seek to compromise with what always has

                            must I speak of Christ. My love of Christ constrains me to speak of Him. My loyalty to Jesus
                            is my apology. If any other apology were needed, I would invite your attention to India's
                            earnest and impassioned solicitation. Most eagerly and most earnestly she asks : Who is
                            Christ ? On all sides there are indications and signs which clearly and unmistakably prove
                            that this question emanates from the very heart of the nation. It is no wonder that India
                            should ask this question. For is not a new and aggressive civilization winning its way day
                            after day, and year after year, into the very heart and soul of the people ? Are not
                            Christian ideas and institutions taking their root on all sides in the soil of India ? Has
                            not a Christian government taken possession of its cities, its provinces, its villages ;
                            with its hills and plains, its rivers and seas, its homes and hearths, its teeming millions
                            of men and women and children ? Yes, the advancing surges of a mighty revolution are
                            encompassing the land, and in the name of Christ strange innovations are penetrating the
                            very core of India's heart. Well may our fatherland sincerely and earnestly ask : Who is
                            this Christ ? Perhaps you will tell me that this question has been answered already. Look at
                            the flood of Christian literature that has swept over the length and breadth of the country.
                            There are heaps of books and numberless preachers and teachers around you, all endeavoring
                            to give a complete answer to the question before us. Doubtless, from these sources, India
                            has had some knowledge of Christ of Nazareth. Bat such knowledge has not given her complete
                            satisfaction. It is true, the people of India have been satisfied in some measure, but they
                            have been disappointed in a much greater measure. For England has sent unto us, after all, a
                            Western Christ. This is indeed to be regretted. Our countrymen find that in this Christ,
                            sent by England, there is something that is not quite congenial to the native mind, not
                            quite acceptable to the genius of the nation. It seems that the Christ that has come to us
                            is an Englishman, with English manners and customs about him, and with the temper and spirit
                            of an Englishman in him. Hence is it that the Hindoo people shrink back and say, " Who is
                            this revolutionary reformer who is trying to sap the very foundations of native society, and
                            bring about an outlandish faith and civilization quite incompatible with Oriental instincts
                            and ideas? Why must we submit to one who is of a different nationality ? Why must we bow
                            before a foreign prophet?" It is a fact which cannot be gainsaid that hundreds upon
                            hundreds, thousands upon thousands, even among the most intelligent in the land, stand back
                            in moral recoil from this picture of a foreign Christianity trying to invade and subvert
                            Hindoo society ; and this repugnance unquestionably hinders the progress of the true spirit
                            of Christianity in this country. But why should you Hindoos go to England to learn Jesus
                            Christ ? Is not Christ's native land nearer to India than England ? Are not Jesus and his
                            apostles and immediate followers more akin to Indian nationality than Englishmen ? Are not
                            the scenes enacted in the drama of the Christian dispensation altogether homely to us
                            Indians ? When we hear of the lily, and the sparrow, and the well, and a hundred other
                            things of Eastern countries, do we not feel we are quite at home in the Holy Land ? Why
                            should we then travel to a distant country like England in order to gather truths which are
                            to be found much nearer our homes ? Go to the rising sun in the East, not to the setting sun
                            in the West, if you wish to see Christ in the plentitude of his glory and the fulness and
                            freshness of the primitive dispensation. Why do I speak of Christ in England and Europe as
                            the setting sun ? Because there we find Apostolical Christianity almost gone; there we find
                            the life of Christ formulated into lifeless forms and antiquated symbols. But if you go to
                            the true Christ in the East, and his apostles, you are seized with inspiration. You find the
                            truths of Christianity all fresh and resplendent. Recall to your minds the true Asiatic <pb n="270" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 270 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. Christ, divested of all Western appendages,
                            carrying on the work of redemption among his own people. Behold, he cometh to us in his
                            loose-flowing garments, his dress and features altogether Oriental, a perfect Asiatic in
                            every thing. Watch his movements, and you will find genuine Orientalism in all his habits
                            and manners, his uprising and downsitting, his going forth and his coming in, his preaching
                            and ministryâ€”aye, in his very language, and style and tone. Indeed, while reading the
                            Gospel, we cannot but feel that we are quite at home when we are with Jesus, and that Jesus
                            is altogether one of us. He is our Christ. The outward Christ is certainly an Asiatic, and,
                            as such he comes to us, and rivets our national sympathies. But can we say the same thing of
                            the invisible Chriot, the spiritual Christ, the soul of Christ? Is that Oriental ? Can you,
                            as Asiatics, appreciate and accept the spirit of Christ? In the very outset of the inquiry,
                            we find the ethics of Christ asking us to accept it, and give it a place in our hearts. And
                            we readily acquiesce in it. The sublime and marvelous ethics of Christ, who can condemnâ€”who
                            will not honor ? The rules of forgiveness and love, meekness, humility, charity, justice,
                            sincerity, and simplicity,the rules of propriety, self-restraint, asceticism, constitute the
                            highest standard of true ethics, which must find acceptance in all parts of the world.
                            Though we are Hindoos, we cannot help admiring the superior and exalted ethics which Christ
                            brings to us. You cannot deny it; you cannot set it aside. It is from God. Your consciences
                            attest it. Ancient philosophy bows before it. A greater than Socrates has taught us this
                            lofty ethical code; and we are bound for truth's sake to accept this legacy from Christ. We
                            are all agreed, irrespective of differences of creed and caste, as to the supremacy of the
                            ethical law embodied in Christ's teachings and character. If you Indians hesitate or refuse
                            to accept Christ, it is not because you dislike Christ's ethics. It is not Christ's humanity
                            that is a stumbling-block in your way, but his socalled divinity. His heavenly spirituality,
                            not his human morality, stands in the way of your accepting him. It appears to me that
                            Christ believed earnestly and consistently in what 'I should, in the absence of a better
                            expression, call the doctrine of divine humanity. Christ not only believed this, but he
                            carried it, theoretically and practically, to the uttermost logical sequence. But what was
                            this doctrine? Christ struck the key-note of it when he announced his divinity before an
                            astonished and amazed world in these words: "land my Father are one." He lived, moved, and
                            had his being in God. Not a breath he drew, but it was from the Lord. Not a drop of
                            life-blood was there in him, but it came from the very fountain of life and vitality in
                            heaven. He said, he heard, he touched, as we see, hear and touch. but he always felt that
                            the root of his being was God himselfâ€”a fact of which we are not always conscious. He had
                            his life rooted in divinity. He felt always that the Lord was underlying his whole
                            existence. And, therefore, without equivocation, and with all the boldness and candor of
                            conscious'simplicity, he proclaimed unto the world that he was one with God. But he asserted
                            the doctrine of spiritual oneness, not only with reference to the Godhead, but also with
                            regard to those around him. He was present, not only in God, but also in the hearts of his
                            disciples. What was his prayer to his Father regarding his people before he allowed himself
                            to be crucified ? Some time before that event occurred, Christ went to his Father and said,
                            " As thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us." Thus, in
                            comprehensive unity, he sought to include God, himself, and all mankind. On the occasion of
                            his last supper, he. commended himself to his disciples and the world at large as mere bread
                            and wine, to be assimilated to the soul, as mere leaven, that in time leaveneth the whole
                            mass. Addressing those around him, Christ said : " He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my
                            blood dwelleth in me and I in him." The language is strange, indeed ! Christ's body should
                            enter into his disciples; his very <pb n="271" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 271 flesh
                            and his very blood should be tasted by his chosen and beloved disciples ! Those who loved
                            him were called upon to partake of his flesh and blood ! The thing seems absurd. How could
                            man eat Christ and drink his blood ? That was possible in one sense only. In the sense
                            already indicated of spiritual identification. All those who accept Jesus with thorough
                            fidelity are identified with him in truth, in love, in wisdom, and in purity of character.
                            As Christ was one with God, he wanted others also to be one with him and one with God, so
                            that all men might dwell together in the glory# of heaven, enjoying everlastingly a life of
                            purity and holiness and joy in God himself. That, indeed, was Christ's mission, that was the
                            great object of his life. He did not seek to place himself before his hearers as a dogma or
                            a doctrine or a theoretical truth. He wanted to live in them with all his ideas and feelings
                            and principles, his piety and godliness, his life of mystic absorption into the Deity. For
                            two thousand years men have been trying to find out the dead Christ under the stone. But the
                            Spirit of God has marveL ously rolled away the stone, and Christ is not there. Even for
                            three days Christ would not consent to live on earth as a dead Christ buried under the
                            stone. So the Lord took his Christ unto himself and has in all ages discomfited and
                            disappointed those that have searched for a dead Christ on earth. Where, then, is Christ
                            now? He is living in all Christian lives, and in all Christian influences at work around us.
                            Of the dead Christ I speak not. Of what use is a dead Christ to us or to our nation ? Put
                            the living spirit of Christ into your hearts and affections, your daily life and character.
                            Do you not see Christ existing throughout Christendom, like an all-pervading leaven,
                            mysteriously and imperceptibly leavening the bias of millions of men and women ? You cannot
                            resist his influence, you may deny his doctrine, you may even hate and repudiate his name,
                            but he goes straight into your hearts and leavens your lives. He does not care to inquire
                            what doctrine you believe, or what dogma you accept, nor even what sort of a life you lead.
                            You may be the basest of sinners. You may be intellectually opposed to many of his
                            doctrines. The truth that is in Christ will, perforce, overcome and penetrate your souls in
                            spite of your perverseness, and secretly influence your character. In all Christian
                            literature, laws and institutions, we see Christ's living influence as a reality. The Christ
                            that is advancing in all directions has touched India, and hence the question she asksâ€”-Who
                            is Christ? The genius of the nation has asked this question, and you are bound to answer it.
                            In the interests of the country, in the interests of truth, the question must be answered
                            one way or another, now or hereafter. To India's solemn and thrilling cry you must some day
                            return a response. Meanwhile I must beg your acceptance of the truly national solution of
                            the problem I have presented to you. You will find on reflection that the doctrine of divine
                            humanity is essentially a Hindoo doctrine, and the picture of Christ's life and character I
                            have drawn is altogether a picture of ideal Hindoo life. Surely, the idea of absorption and
                            immersion in the Deity is one of those ideas of Vedantic Hindooism which prevail extensively
                            in India. From the highest sage to the humblest peasant, millions of men in this land
                            believe in the Pantheistic doctrine of man's identity with the Godhead. The most illiterate
                            man is heard to say he and the Lord are one. The doctrine of absorption in the Deity is
                            India's creed, and, through this idea, I believe, India will reach Christ. Will he not
                            fulfill the Indian Scripture ? I am reminded of the passage in the Gospel in which he says:
                            "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." The Mosaic dispensation only? Perhaps the Hindoo
                            dispensation also. In India, he will fulfill the Hindoo dispensation. The religion of our
                            ancestors was Pantheism from beginning to the end, and what is Hindoo Pantheism?
                            Essentially, it is nothing but the identity of all things with God. I do not mean that you
                            should retain Pantheism as it exists in Indian books. Oh ! there are mischievous errors and
                            horrid ideas mixed up with it, which you must eschew. Christ's Pantheism is a Pantheism of a
                            lof- <pb n="272" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 272 THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. tier and more perfect type. It is the
                            conscious union of the human with the Divine Spirit in truth, love and joy. The Hindoo sage
                            realizes this union only during meditation, and he seeks unconscious absorption in his God,
                            with all his faults and shortcomings about him. But Christ's communion is active and
                            righteous ; it combines purity of character with devotion. Hindoo Pantheism in its worst
                            form is proud, being based upon the belief that man is God ; it is quietism and trance ;
                            Christ's Pantheism is the active self-surrender of the humble servant and the loving son. In
                            the midst of activity, Christ was absorbed in God. Eating or drinking, preaching or going
                            about doing good, his spirit was enjoying serene communion. There is no pride in him, for he
                            is dead to self. There is no dreamy mysticism in him, for he is ever doing the will of his
                            Father. In Christ you see true Pantheism. And, as the basis of early Hindooism is Pantheism,
                            you, my countrymen, cannot help accepting Christ in the spirit of your national scriptures.
                            You have already seen how, in his outward form and appearance, with his flowing garments, he
                            is acceptable to you. Now, you find that even the spirit of Christ draws you through your

                            Christ. Can you deny it? Behold, Christ cometh as an Asiatic in race, as a Hindoo in faith,
                            as a kinsman and a brother, and he demands your heart's affection. Will you deny it ? He
                            comes to fulfill and perfect that religion of communion for which India has been panting as
                            the hart panteth after the water-brooks. Let all people in this country who bear the
                            Christian name remember that it is not by presenting a Western Christ to our countrymen that
                            they will be able to regenerate India. If you like, present the English side of Cbrist's
                            many-sided character to the English nation. If you wish, present a German Christ to the
                            Germans, an American Christ to the American people. But if you wish to regenerate us
                            Hindoos, present Christ to us in his Hindoo character. When you bring Christ to us, do not
                            bring him to us as a civilized European, but as an Asiatic ascetic, whose wealth is
                            devotion, and whose riches are prayers. That horrid form of asceticism which prevails in
                            this country in the form of mere self-mortification is, indeed, most harmful and pernicious.
                            True asceticism, as indicated by Christ, means simply this : " Seek ye first the kingdom of
                            God and his righteousness, and all things shall be added unto you." One word more and I have
                            done. The time is coming, and now is, when India shall worship the Father in spirit and in
                            .truth. Say unto Christ as unto your best friends â€” Welcome ! I say, emphatically, and I say
                            before you all, that Christ is already present in you. lie is in you, even when you are
                            unconscious of his presence ; even if your lips deny Christ, your hearts secretly accept
                            him. For Christ is "the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world." If you
                            have in you the spirit of truth and filial devotion, self-sacrifice, that is Christ. Though
                            often defiled and persecuted by the world, I have found sweetness and joy unutterable in my
                            Master Jesus. Jesus is to me not a hard doctrine. He never was to me a doctrine. I am
                            thankful to say I never read any anti-Christian books with delight, and never had to wage
                            war with my Christ. The mighty artillery of his love he leveled against me, and I was
                            vanquished and fell at his feet, saying, Blessed Child of God, when shall others see the
                            light that is in thee ? Therefore, I say, countrymen, be not as the unbelievers are ; do not
                            throw yourselves into the vortex of materialism and scepticism. Christ, your friend, is
                            walking through the streets of this country, carrying the banner of God, the Most High. He
                            exhorts you to renounce self. My countrymen, throw off the scabbard then, unsheath the sword
                            and cut down this abominable self, and establish this kingdom of heaven in your lives.
                            Achieve the triumph and rejoice, for the Bridegroom cometh.</p></div2><div2 type="humor" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How beautiful the remark of a little girl..."

                            year. Each day we are nearing the closing scene. " Passing away" is written on Nature's
                            already sad countenance, and the forests even now wave to a mournful requiem. It would
                            almost seem to us that Mother Earth were mourning, so brown and sere has become her attire.
                            The light of much variety has gone out of her life, and she appears like one asking for
                            sympathy. Have we none to give ? Or shall we let this link in time's golden chain fall into
                            obscurity alone, unrequited, without even a farewell tribute â€” this year that has been so
                            much to us, contributing so largely to our comfort, hopes and happiness ? A year that has
                            grown us a harvest of plenty, and showered us with blessings so bountifully? This precious
                            year that has been all that time could be, that has given us opportunities, many and noble,
                            for the performance of Christian virtues; shall we bury this precious season in the grave of
                            forgetfulness ? Never ! This cannot be, for its feeble form still holds the germ of
                            rejuvenated life which the future claims for development. So its seeming decline leadeth not
                            unto death, but in reality unto a resurrection of life through all futurity. It ever remains
                            the living present, over which the past and future clasp their loving hands. Ah, yea ;
                            tender and true are the ties that hold us in the loving embrace of this season of seasons;
                            and though we are aware time tarries not for any, we would gladly stay the flying moments
                            for a brief period, even though we feel their progress is on to greater perfection. But such
                            is the course of events in the great cycles of time ; and thus it will ever be that one year
                            will follow another on through unnumbered ages in the unknown beyond. There will always be a
                            passing away of old life and an unfolding of the new. Growth and decay are stamped upon the
                            face of all existence. To-day we live in a material form; to-morrow our existence may be
                            elsewhere, we know not; but we do know the present holds friendship's magnet, and we trust
                            the future may retain the same, while the past holds the sunshine of happiness where
                            hallowed memory still loves to linger and grow warm in the reality of its pleasantness. And
                            if we are reminded that we have sometimes wandered where shadows have fallen and sorrows
                            come, tis pitiful ; but these we would quietly shroud in mourning, and bury where the
                            incoming tide of life cannot reach them. Thus we would preserve unto futurity only goodness
                            and joys of the past. And now we return with grateful hearts to our failing friend, the
                            dying year; or rather the old life that is passing away to make room for the new. We realize
                            that during its short existence we have been blessed <pb n="274" id="p154" TEIform="pb"/> 274 THE SHAKER

                            harvest; heaven's blessings have fallen upon us in many and various ways ; and now the
                            question arises, have these treasures invariably come to us for good? Have we so far
                            appreciated them as to adapt them to our needs only ? If so, what have we given in return ?

                            our having lived during this closing precious season ? We can hope so ; and in the peace

                            immortality of soul life is the fruit of obedience to Christian principles,â€” soul death the
                            fruit of sin. 2.â€”Probation continues in all stages of existence. 3.â€”The mercy of God is as
                            eternal as the existence of God. 4.â€”God is male and female. 5.â€”The Trinity, Atonement,

That a large
                            percentage of children come into the world laden with the iniquities of fathers,
                            grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and great-great-grandfathers, is truly lamentable. Such
                            unfortunates are justly entitled to much commiseration and tender sympathy. Any departure
                            from native innocence is a Fallâ€” requiring a corresponding Resurrection. Children and youth
                            are more exposed to fall down hill, than up. 'Twas so with the first little Adam. When he
                            came to that little tree, about half way down the gardenâ€” put there to be let alone â€” to try
                            his integrity â€” when he dabbled and dandled at that tree â€” he fell I Too many other little
                            Adams do so. To nominate all the falls, down and up, is not our vocation. Having passed
                            lightly over one doion hill fall, as off-set, we modestly mention one up hill fall, to wit:
                            Tobacco. To native innocence, tobacco is uniformly offensive. By indomitable effort, worthy
                            of better achievements, the habit of using it is acquired. It is a crime against nature, a
                            tremendous fall up hill. How many I have heard ejaculate thusly : " I wish I could quit
                            tobacco !" But stop right here. It has been said, " There is no great loss without some
                            small gain." If, to be a man among men, a boy, of any age, has fallen up hill, acquired the
                            tobacco disease, he has an opportunity nowâ€”a splendid opportunity â€” to give practical
                            demonstration to himself and to others, that he has a hone in Ids backâ€”-a forty-horse
                            will-powerâ€” that he believes " in the Resurrection of the body," resurrection from all that
                            does not accord with his divinest ideal of the true dignity of man in the likeness of God â€”
                            practical demonstration that in this individual, there is a Soul, and that the Soul, not the
                            body, rules the machine. [The writer of the above testimony has the right to speak that

                            the infallible truth of every sentence contained in the Old Testament, should put their
                            theologies to the test, and see if they do not indorse the same view of God's character

                            derangement of any one predisposed to and under temporary excitement ; but how forty
                            socalled rational men could be accessory to a deed so revolting, is hard to account for! And

                            sign of the consecration of his first born son to the service of his God. So of Jephtha, who
                            only consecrated his daughter to the service of the temple. We are prepared, however, to
                            excuse the worst barbarity of that age, in consideration that many of their customs, and
                            particularly their passion for bloody sacrifices was inherited from their ancestors. Never
                            more can we harbor the thought that God was pleased with these sacrifices nor took any part

                            â€¢'By this covenant we do solemnly and conscientiously dedicate, devote, consecrate and
                            give^up ourselves and services, together with all our temporal interest, to the service of

                            and charitable purposes as the Gospel may require." * * * And we do hereby solemnly agree to
                            support and maintain the true primitive faith and Christian princip * * * pertaining to the

                            acknowledge ourselves as members of one general community, possessing one faith, and subject
                            to one united parental and ministerial administration." It is quite plainly manifested that
                            there are two prominent worldly interests in which personal individual photographs play an
                            important part, first, conspicuous popularity, worldly ambition, pride and vanity ;
                            secondly, use in the police department for the detection of criminals. But, it is not so
                            manifest in what way the use of individual e personal photographs can be consecrated to th
                            service of God, the support and benefit of this community, and such other pious and
                            charitable purposes as the Gospel may require," according to the covenantal consecration
                            before mentioned. It is consequently to be anticipated that a personal vanity and ambition
                            for distinction and individual exaltation shall be swallowed up by that noble purpose, which
                            by consecrating all the powers, faculties and labors of the indiv idu covenant member to
                            swell the united capacity of the Chur Christ's Second Appearing, to set fore the world a
                            sacrifice of self-pride, ambition and interest for the manifestation of a character of
                            devotion to God's work so full and complete as to make of one brotherhood and sisterhood the
                            whole household of f aith, toiling together on the beautiful level of love, not each one
                            striving to be the greatest after the fashion of the children of this world. The procurement
                            and display of individual personal photographs which have been obtained by members of the
                            Shaker Community are, we believe, justly deemed to be' in contravention of the foregoing
                            covenantal principles, and of course, disapproved by the leading authorities of the Church

                                too much power to put into the grasp of any one individual, in a nation whose
                                Constitution is republican in principle, to make such individual censor of the mails,
                                and virtual arbiter of the character of our nation's circulating literature ; aye, even
                                more, of her conscientious rights ? If laws for the prevention of obscene literature
                                should exist, which we approve, should not the censorship of their supposed infractions
                                be delegated to a committee of at least five, or s6ven men, thus guarding against the
                                unjust and unchristian exercise of power, as in the Bennett case, of personal revenge ;
                                or, as in that of many other casesr manifest in the action of Comstock, as a means of
                                obtaining money by rewards for prosecution ? D. M. Bennett was reared among the Shakers,
                                was a goodly young man; left our ranks because he preferred a married life to virgin
                                celibacy. We have kept track of him since his exit from our society, and never have
                                learned of any wickedness or illegality in his conduct as judged by the moral law, since
                                he quit our ranks. Some heavy charges are recently published against him, concerning
                                which we know not the truth; but if true, they would not justly incarcerate him, unless
                                accompanied by many thousands and hundreds of thousands of others equally guilty. He is,
                                we believe, thoroughly infidel to the character of so-called Christianity, whose
                                theology makes the innocent Jesus to cruelly suffer death as a ransom from sufferingâ€”the
                                consequence of sinâ€”for all of those who should but believe in his mission, and so are
                                all the Shakers. If he is worthy of incarceration for this, so are all our people. We
                                understand he is also infidel to God ! the God character represented by a large class of
                                professed Christians who believe Jesus to be one of three Gods in oneâ€”the Father of
                                whom, and of which trio, demanded the death of this son God, by the hands of wicked men,
                                whom He proposes to punish for executing His will in killing Him ! If he is infidel to a
                                belief in a Spirit Being, the Creative Power, and All-wise Planner and Director of the
                                universe, in the attributes of male and female, as Father and Mother of heaven and
                                earth, and all the innumerable spheres of immensity, we do not know it, and do not
                                fellowship it. We do not approve of the spirit and sentiment of many of Dr. D. M.
                                Bennett's writings and publications, we think him too caustic and unwise, and, in some
                                instances, calculated to do harm by infidelity to Christ. But, that he has done great
                                good, we also know; and to err is human ; no one is perfect. But enough ; if the

                                personal revenge, clerical chicanery and judicial ring influence! We also solicit a

                            by the way-side. There was no wall nor fence near it, but still, well-bolted and barred, it
                            stood up strong and straight as though it was doing guard duty. There was no need now to
                            draw out the rusty bolts to admit the passer-by, as it was just as convenient to go around
                            as to pass through it. This reminded us of the ecclesiastical gate which has been so long
                            closed against women. It stands bolted and barred ; but the ecclesiastical fence is nearly
                            all down, and, at the command of the Master, Christian women may march into life's great

                                vast majority who deign to give Shakerisrn a moiety of their reflections. That the
                                Shakers are wonderfully blessed in basket and store, has drawn the envy of thousands who
                                wished this blessing for themselves, but who were unwilling to bear the Shaker cross to
                                possess it. To preserve for themselves the easements for the flesh which marriage
                                induces, the vast majority leave no text of the New Testament unturned which encourages
                                the thoughts that marriage may be classed as a Christian institution. To do this,
                                observe how the grand array of Pauline instructions are culled from his numerous
                                epistles to prove that marriage is Christian! AVe frankly admit, that were Paul the
                                founder and head of Christianity and not Jesus Christ, we should sit on the fence of
                                hesitancy, finding it difficult to decide which he approved most ofâ€”marriage or
                                celibacy. But acknowledging Jesus as Lord and Head of Christianity, there can be no
                                doubt about marriage being a worldly, not a Christian institution. "I am the
                                Resurrection and the Life," said Jesus Christ; and so far from representing the
                                Resurrection as being in a state of future existence, follows up the subject in that
                                "the children of the Resurrection"â€”my children, children of the Christ lifeâ€”"neither
                                marry nor are given in marriage." To save marriage and its worldly affections to
                                themselves, the children of the world, desirous of being called %ftitwci%X. <pb n="281" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. 281 Christians, put off the Resurrection until they
                                drop their earthly means of fleshly qualification and unchristian indulgences. But
                                "Follow Me;" "deny yourselves of what I have denied Myself !" are the ringing
                                instructions of Jesus Christ. Of Paul, who claimed, and did in his life "follow hard
                                after Jesus," we can only say that while many of his instructions were very favorable to
                                a Christian life, still he was erratic, and often instructed in a very unchristian
                                manner. How does Paul's assertions, " marriage is honorable in all," coincide with his
                                own life, and "I would that all men were like me ? " And Avhat shall we do with his
                                astounding assertions concerning those " who marry, caring how they may please each
                                other, and not how they may please the Lord; while a virgin life careth how it may
                                please the Lord?" It is reasonably stated that Jesus never forbade to marry and we
                                believe this, and any follower of Christ who forbids any who wish to marry from doing so
                                acts differently from Christ. For the Shakers, we boldly state that they never "forbade
                                to marry," to those who wished an honorable worldly life and not Christ's life. It must,
                                however, be admitted that Jesus selected for his disciples those who would " hate
                                husband and wife" relations, and even their worldly "lives" also. To hate these, did
                                not, does not necessitate the hating of men and women as virgin brethren and sisters in
                                Christ, as was Christ ; but to hate the husband and the wife while ive love the brother
                                and the sister. We accept the life of Christâ€”the resurrected life he exhibited above the
                                world, and wherein he was " lifted up "â€”to be the life for Christians to live. We admire
                                the success which Paul attained in so fully representing in his life the life of Jesus;
                                and we honor him for his radical Christian testimony favoring the life resurrected above
                                marriage to all, excepting "foolish G-alatians" and "carnal Corinthians," to whom he
                                gave instructions : " To avoid fornication and adultery;" to prevent burning in their
                                lusts. "Let every such man have a wife and every such woman a husband," for they are as
                                yet very unready to adopt the Christ life! That earnest thinker, Henry C. Wright, said:
                                " I do not see how any believer in the New Testament can come to any other conclusion
                                upon marriage than that to which the Shakers have arrived; nor do I see how any believer
                                in the Old Testament can come to any other conclusion than that of the Mormons!" And
                                then sums up the subject, and in which summing up he has a numerous sympathy, "' both
                                are monstrosities to me!" We have written sufficiently to arouse renewed thought upon
                                the subject, and will close with the valuable testimony of the Rev. Dr. Bolles, who in
                                his book, "Holy Matrimony, "after extolling the beauties of marriage as few others could
                                do or have ever done, sums up the subject thus admirably and acceptably; and in the face
                                of all human inclinations, none would write thus were it not true: " But is there not a
                                higher life revealed in the Scriptures than even the holy state of matrimonyâ€”a life by

                                which the love of the antitype may be ever so great as to banish from the mind all
                                thought of the typeâ€” concentrating all the affections of the soul vpon the reality of
                                the substanceâ€”a life so entirely free from the temporal, with all its joys, cares and
                                entanglements, as to see nothing, to think of nothing but the eternalâ€” Christ Himself
                                and the fruition of his glorious Godhead? How can it be denied that the scriptures do
                                reveal to us the possibility of such a life ? and that it is the life of the celibate "
                                for the kingdom of heaven's sake, â€”not the life of the mere unmarried, which in itself
                                considered is one of themost selfish of all lives, and which is not unfrequently chosen
                                for the sake of selfish and criminal indulgence, but the. life of the celibate ' for the
                                kingdom of heaven's sake.' Our blessed Lord said, indeed, ' all men cannot receive this
                                saying, save they to whom it is given ; but he that is able to receive it, let him

                                differently, apart from worldly fashion, fleshly lusts, and away, even from the
                                gratifications of much worldly good, we believe and know. At the beginning they dressed
                                as was the custom, and declined from principle to engage in the changing fashions of
                                following time. In this they were wise and truly religions. At several periods of
                                fashion's market, the dress of the world has very closely returned to " Shaker Styles."
                                We honor our forefathers and foremothers, not for any especially grotesque eccentricity
                                nor purposed oddity of dress, but for their inclination and persistence, even to
                                pertinacity to wear a, plain, comfortable, economical and comely divss. We hope all of
                                these points will be held closely to in the future, and we believe they will be fully as
                                operative in the years to come as in the past, even amid the many innovations now being
                                introduced in the way of dress. Oddity and eccentricity may be and will be cast out; but
                                the essentials, plainness and comeliness will be adhered to. But it must be seen that on
                                mere matters of dress, we are dealing with the comparatively non-essential features of a
                                peculiarly Christian life. Purity, extreme purity of life, with honesty of word and
                                manufactures must claim precedence always, and these must exceed the righteousness of
                                Methodist and Roman Catholics, or what, or wherein can there be a desired peculiarity ?

                                the advocates of the Tunker Church, and it has the following upon this "peculiar "
                                subject. While you read, brethren, think whether we, as a peculiar people, cannot be
                                reminded of a dutiful lesson : WE OUGHT TO BE A PECULIAR PEOPLE. It is said that the
                                Brethren are losing many of the peculiarities that formerly distinguished them from
                                other people, especially that of dress. Now while we believe that we should be
                                distinguished in this respect from the vain fashion worshiper, we also believe that we
                                should be a peculiar people in other things as well. We fear that we are losing our

                                homestead, where he spent his boyhood. His little sapling had become a large tree, and
                                was loaded with apples. During the night after his arrival at the homestead, there was a

                                read to our family of sixty people, your lecture in Brooklyn. I have never had the
                                pleasure of your acquaintance, personally, but know you by .my friend, and your friend,
                                Wickham, ex-mayor of New York. 1 have received, through him, a copy of your " Future
                                Life." Am much interested in it â€” still more interested in its author. We live in
                                stirring times. A Judgment day is upon Christendom. It began at the House of God, the
                                fountain of modern Spiritualism, the Shaker Order. I, too, once lived in New York. I was
                                a young man, but a confirmed materialist; also a communist. Humanity was all the God I
                                acknowledged. In 1830, visiting the Shakers, I found, in practical operation, principles
                                of equality and justice that we, as Infidels, had failed to actualize,â€”a Brotherhood and
                                Sisterhood, claiming to be the result of Spiritualism. By instruction from Spirits, a
                                woman, who could neither write nor read, established justice, where the wise and prudent
                                had failed. Ann Lee said she communed with five souls out of the body, where she did
                                with one in the earth-life. Two extremesâ€”credulity and incredulity, faith and unbelief,
                                Spiritualism and Materialism, met together. After being here a few days, I began to
                                receive Spiritual ministrations in evidence of Immortality, and of intercommunication of
                                souls in and out of the body. These continued until I became satisfied. Prom that time I
                                have been a Spiritualist. I have seen the old Babel system of Christendom gradually and
                                rapidly breaking up. The old heavens are passing away, and New Heavens are creating. Old
                                Church and State Government must come to an end. Zulu wars, Irish and English domestic
                                troubles, Indian wars and Russian barbarities are products of false theologies. " Behold
                                I create all things new, " good and true. Spiritualism is the disintegrating element
                                that will bring the old world to an end. Out of the material of the past, the future
                                will be organized. Religion will be the cementing bond of union, gathering all things in
                                heaven and earth into one. God is Male and Female, Wisdom and Love, combined. Love
                                worketh no ill to her neighbor. Live and let live; enjoy and let others enjoy life and
                                its blessings. Why not? Why should I seek happiness at the expense of others, who desire
                                happiness as I desire it ? Dear Friend, I hail you as one of nature's noblemen. Heaven
                                bless you in standing for the right. Come and visit Mt. Lebanon. Judge Edmunds and
                                Bishop Hughes came to see us. We had good times and the sweet communion of saints.
