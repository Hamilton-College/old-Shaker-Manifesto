HORACE Mann was not suffered to work
without opposition. Attacks upon the
Board and upon himself weie frequent.
His contests with the ''thirty-one" tire
famous. It is true that he was .somewhat
prone to poi sonify evil in his opponents.
He knew his own rectitude to he absolute,
and he believed firmly that his side of
the question was right; what then must
his opponents be but wrong, and fighting
for the wrong!
When he was traveling in Europe, the
number of ink-spots upon the walls of various rooms where Luther was reputed to
have thrown his inkstand at the devil
seemed particularly to strike him. It
was typical of himself; he was always
throwing a moral inkstand at the personified evil about him, and wherever he went
lie was certain to arouse opposition.
Whether or how much this is to be attributed to his personal characteristics, and
how much to the fact that a refoi m is almost never introduced without much opposition and bitter opposition, I do not
attempt to say.
There were in Mr. Mann two directly opposed sides of character: the lion-like
sternness   and   combativeness   which   he
showed towa �(] his enemies or theenemies
of the right, and the affectionate, tender
nature which he showed to his family and
dearest friends. When president., afterwards, of Antioch College, his students
felt these different aspects. He would
sometimes plead with them, melting even
to tears; sometimes turn upon them all
his old lawyer's logic, and pour out his
wrath in fiery sarcasm. In either case his
effect upon them was great.�From "Horace Mann," by Mary R. Keith, in New England Magazine for August, 1890.

                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 15.</head><p TEIform="p">BUTTONS. The making of buttons for the Brethren's garments was commenced in 1795. These were
                            made of the horns and hoofs of the cattle. They also made button molds of horn which were
                            covered with cloth. Since 1825 a small amount of business has been carried on in the
                            manufacture of bone and ivory buttons, but the pressure of other duties has prevented much
                            from being done in this line. BROOMS. The manufacture of brooms was at first, very light.
                            This was at the close of the last century. A small amount of broom corn was raised on our
                            home farm, and from this the brooms were made. The apparatus for tying the corn on the
                            handle was very simple, merely a wheel and shaft. The broom twine was wound around the
                            shaft. The rim of the wheel was arranged with pins, and operated by the feet. In a few years
                            machines were invented on which a man was able to make from six to eight dozen brooms per
                            day. These became an important item for sale, and the business has been extensively followed
                            by Believers in the several Societies. Common hand and fancy cora brushes have also been
                            made, but since 1845 the attention has been diverted to other forms of occupation. OVAL
                            BOXES. The manufacture of oval boxes began as early as 1800. Although not a very extensive
                            branch of business, it has been a source of small income from year to year. At first the
                            rims were cat from the log in a common saw mill, which did the work very imperfectly. The
                            heads were planed by hand. In 1830 a buzz saw did the work of cutting out the rims, and in
                            1832 a machine was brought into use, and from this date the rims were also planed by
                            machinery. HORSEWHIPS. These have been made in the Society from an early date, for home use
                            and for sale. The horse hides for the lashes were dressed at our tannery, and the lashes cut
                            and braided by the Brethren and boys. The whip stocks<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> were also made
                            and sold with the lashes. While the foregoing occupations were being largely conducted by
                            the Brethren, the Sisters were busily engaged in the many domestic duties that fell to their
                            charge. They were also engaged in the carding, spinning and weaving of cotton and woolen
                            cloth. The coloring of the cloth also claimed their attention. For several years the Sisters
                            did all the hatcheling of the flax. The spinning of the cotton and wool was performed by
                            hand on "great wheels" and the flax on "little foot-wheels." After the establishment of
                            cotton factories in this country, the cloth was largely purchased for the use of the
                            Community and by 1834 the weaving was wholly discontinued. Machines for the carding of wool
                            were introduced into this part of the country about the beginning of this century, and the
                            Brethren had their wool carded into rolls and the spinning done at home. In 1809 a carding
                            machine was built for the Society, with which they did their own carding. In 1812 a
                            spinning-jenny of twenty-four spindles was purchased, and from this date the "great wheels"
                            were laid aside. Since 1852 the cloth used by the Society has been purchased. For 'several
                            years the Sisters used a "Pleasant Spinner," on which to spin "worsted." BASKETS. In 1813
                            fancy baskets were made for sale. This business has largely increased, and other articles
                            have been added, such as palm leaf hats ; bonnets ; carriage, chair, pin and needle
                            cushions. A great variety of other fancy articles have also been added to the list. MEDICAL
                            DEPARTMENT. The Believers who formed the Society at the time of its origin, did not rely
                            much on outward remedies to remove diseases and infirmities, and a physician not of their
                            order was considered very needless and unprofitable in most cases. After several years it
                            was thought best to establish an order of physicians, two of each sex, and to these the
                            Brethren and Sisters were to apply. At first the apparatus, conveniences, books, &amp;c,
                            were very limited and simple ; but the accomodations have been enlarged from time to time
                            and medical books have been added to the library, till the advantages offered to the sick
                            are among the best. Since 1835 there has been but one physician in the order, while the
                            Sisters in attendance have received the title of "nurses." There has been a grc at variety
                            of opinion on the system of medical treatment of disease. Some retain a confidence in the
                            use of metallic drugs, while others would use only herbs. Another class prefer what
                            generally passes under the name of "Water Cure." A fourth class encourage the treatment that
                            passes under the name of "Eclectic." Many persons who are unfortunately made sick are again
                            healed by submitting to any of the above treatments, and it is quite likely they would have
                            been healed if they had consulted no one.<pb n="195" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE GATHERING OF HERBS. This
                            has been practiced from the first of the organization for the use of the physicians at home.
                            Very few were sold except for the purpose of purchasing medicine to be used instead of the
                            herbs. In 1820 the Believers began to prepare roots and herbs for sale. These were dried and
                            pressed and then put up in a nice compact form and a demand was soon created for a more
                            extended business. Up to this date the wild herbs only had been gathered, but the
                            cultivation of medicinal herbs was now accepted as a branch of business in order to meet the
                            yearly demand. The making of extracts was also added to the trade and in 1832 a large
                            building was demanded. As the trade increased, a larger number of persons were appointed to
                            assist in the business. To show the increase of this work, we will state that in 1831 about
                            4.000 lbs. of roots and herbs were sent to the market. In 1836, it had increased to 6000
                            lbs. and in 1849 to 16,500 lbs. In 1850 large additions were made to the buildings and to
                            the machinery. A steam boiler and a vacuum pan, with various apparatus connected. The amount
                            of herbs pressed in 1850 was not less than 21,000 lbs. and about 7000 lbs. of extract. In
                            1852 a new steam engine was purchased of twelve horse power, and also additional machinery.
                            In 1853 the amount of roots, herbs and barks that were pressed amounted to 42,000 lbs. while
                            the extracts reached to 7500 lbs. The business now requires, regularly, the labor of six
                            Brethren and about as many Sisters. A large number of persons were also hired to assist in
                            the work. Other help was, at times, demanded to take the goods to and from the Society, and
                            to make sales and then to collect the bills.

W." TEIform="persName"/> F. W. Evans.</byline><p TEIform="p">Of late, I have thought much of the resurrection order and sphere of humanity. Darwin speaks
                            of rudiments that indicate faculties once existing, no longer needed, they being supplanted
                            by higher powers and faculties, developed under the law of evolution. Is it not thus when
                            the soul rises from the generative order into the resurrection? "I am the resurrection."
                            What an expression to be made by a man two thousand years ago ! Is it a wonder that it is
                            said of him, "He trod the wine-press alone, and of the people there was not one with him?"
                            Any physical faculty or limb disused diminishes in power, be it an arm, or leg, or muscle ;
                            is it not the same with the mental and spiritual powers? The hidden, wonderful power that
                            enables a human being to die to the generative life of the natural man or woman, is a
                            "mystery of godliness" that is made known only by revelation. The mere natural, animal man
                            or woman�even when intellectually unfolded�discerneth not the resurrection, it is
                            foolishness to them. The gift of faith alone revealeth it. The prophets and prophetesses,
                            and Bibles<pb n="196" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> of all races and peoples continually refer to a resurrection
                            state, as being attainable, possible ; but they do it only "in part," aud as "through a
                            glass, darkly;" yet it is there. All men, consciously, or unconsciously, are
                            pressing�growing�towards the resurrection order. The generative is a rudimentary phase on
                            the journey, through which all men and women will pa�s on their way to the Christ
                            Heavens�the Heaven of Heavens. I am under the impression, from my knowledge of history, that
                            there are single nations aud races who have passed through all the degrees of progress,
                            which, now, the whole humt&gt;n race�all nations, races, kindreds, tongues, and peoples�are
                            making a united and tremendous effort to attain unto. Jesus, as an individual, became, as a
                            unit, a resurrected man. As such, he was a pattern of what other men could ' attain unto.
                            "Follow me. Be of good courage, for I have overcome the world" �the lust of generation, the
                            lust of private property possession; and the pride of rule, with the ambition of seeing who
                            should be the greatest. The Son of Man comes to minister, not to be ministered unto, to
                            serve, not to be served by others; to work for the Brotherhood and Sisterhood; to love God
                            supremely, and the Society more than self, lie taught, disciplined, rebuked, and'loved his
                            twelve disciples ; taught them to be as he was, resurrected souls. And we have no record of
                            any one of them, not even Judas, ever having been drawn down to earth by the tail of the
                            dragon, the lust of generation ; they all put their feet upon that head of the serpent of
                            sensuality�lust. Again, the twelve were to the primitive chu-ch what Jesus was to them�a
                            pattern. The principle was expanded. For three hundred years, the primitive Christian church
                            labored to be a resurrected church, in the midst of a corrupt Roman war government, find its
                            social system. Everything, within aud without, worked against the high standard of purity
                            that the church was striving to maintain. . The civil government looked upon it as inimical
                            to its own power and existence. Its celibacy would destroy population ; its non-resistance
                            wrould make Rome the prey of any petty nation practicing the war power, aud as Rome had
                            taken the sword against all nations, uniess she defended herself by the sword, the least of
                            them would come and take away her place and pow er. True Christianity, then, as exhibited in
                            Jesus, who did not render evil for evil, and his disciples, whom Jesus told to put up their
                            swords, otherwise they would perish in using them, and in the primitive church, which, not
                            being of this world, would not marry nor fight, was regarded by the Romans as destructive of
                            all civil government by extermination of the population. And by the testimony of Jesus
                            against war, and they treated it accordingly. It was assailed by outward persecution,
                            martyrdom, and by inward temptations, false doctrines aud corrupt leaders, until the
                            fifteenth bishop of Jerusalem was a Gentile and a married man. It was this corrupted,
                            perverted, adulterated Christianity that spread over the great Roman empire. The emperor,
                            Coustantine, became a Gentile Christian. He introduced both marriage and war into the
                            Gentile Christian churches, and there they remain to this day. Great churches, hundreds of

                            adhesion to church and state religion, that includes marriage, private property and war.
                            They aiv all k'turned to blood." They begin with the blood of Jesus, as being God, and enr!
                            with war and the inquisition, with becoming drunk with the blood of . aints and martyrs, and
                            being authors of all the blood shed upon earth. Anti-Christianity, Babylon the Great, the
                            mother of harlot denominations, is a cruel, bloody system that destroys the earth and
                            deforms the heavens. "�Let the saints of the Most High render unto her double ; according as
                            she has lived deliciously and comforted herself, so much sorrow and torment give her,"�the
                            pen and tongue are mightkr than swords. When the powers of evil were concentrated upon
                            Jesus, to his physical destruction, with vehement personal hatred crying ''Crucify him,
                            crucify him," it excited in Jesus a clear hatred and keen indignation, not against the
                            persons, but against the principle of war. "Do not I hate them that hate thee? I hate them
                            with a perfect hatred�with a hatred free from personality ; that is a. perfect hatred."
                            Hence, in the Christ spirit, Jesus could denounce the evil, and pray to his Father in
                            heaven, to forgive them personally, as not understanding what they were doing. When the
                            whole race of mankind come into the new earth and the new heavens�the Millennium�the
                            resurrection, "war will cease to the ends of the earth," and men will cease to do evil and
                            learn to do well, as natural men and women, and Christians�Shakers� will say, "I am the
                            resurrection and the life." The generative life and power of physical procreation will be
                            resurrected into a spiritual sexual relation, above the animal, propagative plane. The back
                            brain will go up into the intellectual, and the intellectual will go up into the spiritual
                            brain region. Private property acquisitiveness will be raised into pure communion, where
                            each one can seek anothers wealth and not their own, without becoming a "prey" to a wolfish
                            pack of self-seekers. And the war force and power will be "turned, as the battle to the
                            gate" against war itself, on the selfish plane ; where all are hateful and hating one
                            another. It will be resurrected into a "war in heaven, where Michael and his angels fought
                            and the dragon and his angels, until no place was found for them." As Jesus said, "The
                            prince of this world cometh and hath no part in me," no personality. Hating the flesh, was a
                            perfect hatred, that killed and made alive, and the reproved becomes the friend of whoso
                            punishes the evil and spares the individual, as a mau spareth his own son, he saves him by
                            correcting him. Thus, "whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth whomsoever he
                            receiveth," making even his enemies to be at peace with him and to eventually become his
                            friends. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hours" TEIform="index"/> THE HOURS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">[Contributed by Mary Johnston.] The hours are viewless angels, That still go

                            for each soul who is thirsting after righteousness. Yea, to my soul it is food and drink
                            indeed. May it prosper and be a guiding star to many who are yet in darkness and ultimately
                            lead them into the light of Christ's and Mother's gospel is my earnest prayer. In last
                            number of Manifesto in the article "Whither are we Drifting?" is a call for a reply from
                            some one. The subject under consideration is one that requires deep thought and is of
                            intense interest to all who desire the prosperity of Zion. Consecrated property of Believers
                            never should be desecrated by the deadly and poisonous influences of worldly-minded people.
                            The employing as hirelings those of the world, brings into our midst death and destruction
                            to the mind of the novitiate, and to the youth of our Societies an ignominious blight to
                            their young and plastic minds. Jesus says "I have called you out of the world" which
                            emphatically means away from all of its influences. Are we separated from the world when we
                            hire them among us. While I had the glorious privilege of being among Believers (but through
                            the fore of circumstances compelled to mingle with the world) I saw much and heard much,
                            which convinced me that the seeds of iniquity were constantly being sown in our midst by
                            those employed who are of the world. Each one of us carry with us an influence for good or
                            evil, and from us this will radiate in magnetic currents and thoroughly permeate all within
                            its reach. This being the case, what can we expect from those who live in sin and are the
                            daily victims of ungovernable lust. Often have I heard the expression "The Shakers are dying
                            out, and it will not be long before their property will pass into other hands." God forbid !
                            for I know it to be his work and cannot fail, yet we must do our duty, if we<pb n="199" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> expect his blessing. "Hands to work and hearts to God" being our motto, let
                            each rally to the work, that Zion may become free of all that defileth. Thine fraternally,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bellmire, William W."

                            Keniston. I would again ask the question, Are we drifting ? To admit the fact would imply
                            that the gospel ship that so many had sailed in so long and had carried so many cargoes of
                            human souls safely to that haven of rest, where away from the turmoil and strife of earth
                            they can unite with the poet and exclaim : "My weary heart hath found a resting place, My
                            feet no longer need to roam; For in the blessedness of perfect love I've a home, sweet
                            home." Had lost its helm, parted with its anchor, and been bereft of its sails, and become a
                            derelict. God forbid. Nay dear sister, we are not drifting. Though our gallant craft has
                            weathered many a gale and at present is passing through a storm period, yet, "Courage!
                            Brother, Sister, do not falter, Tho' thy path seem dark as night; There's a guide to lead us
                            onward, ' Trust in God and do the right." To admit that wTe are subject to circumstances
                            over which we have no power of control may in a limited measure be true but only limited.
                            Wage slavery is only one step removed from chattel slavery and some of the extenuating
                            circumstances in regard to the latter cannot be argued for the former. It is a curse, a
                            blight upon the spiritual growth of individuals and communities, and with that former relic
                            of a barbaric age it must be banished from the realm of social and economic life through a
                            higher conception of life, and the duty we owe to the cause. I quote from a letter from Br.
                            Daniel Offord "that to be an industrial slave holder has a mighty tendency to destroy the
                            spiritual brother and make him unfit to labor with Brethren." Individually we can say,
                            thanks to the sisterhood for holding the fort against the encroachments of that insidious
                            foe, wage slavery, and keeping it out from the realm of social life among them. Let it be
                            the rallying point among us, working for a new dispensation, and a more perfect realization
                            of the principles of Communistic life, where it can be said of each and every one, "Ye are
                            not servants but Brethren and Sisters." Sonyea, N.

                            thoughts and actions, do much towards forming our characters ; therefore how diligently we
                            should strive to so cultivate our hearts, and curb the impetuosity of our dispositions, that
                            our exterior deportment shall prove the refinement of our spirits. "Our life is centered in
                            the sphere of common duties,"�how true this is. Then why not adorn our daily lives, with the
                            best things our hearts possess, and make our homes attractive with the sunshine of kindness
                            and gentleness of manner. While we admire integrity, arid that sterling worth of character
                            that makes a true man and woman, and are assiduously engaged in maintaining these admirable
                            qualities in our own lives, yet I think there are some things that truly belong to the
                            Christian faith that we are quite negligent of ; that is, the common courtesies of life. We
                            would not countenance superfluities and meaningless forms of politeness, that are naught but
                            vanity and empty show ; true politeness never springs from these, it has its source in an
                            entire forgetfulness of self, and a tender regard for the feelings of others. Upon meeting a
                            stranger or a dear friend, it appears to require no effort to assume the apparel of
                            politeness, to be affable in our manners and extend our heartfelt affections, but those who
                            are truly dearest to our hearts, those with whom we are called to live and labor, to enjoy
                            the blessings of life, and bear its trials and burdens ; when brought in close contact with
                            one another, how apt we are to grow indifferent to their tender feelings, and frequently
                            speak and act in an uncourteous way. "Life and death are in the power of the tongue ;"�how
                            careful we should be to guard that member, that we utter nothing that wounds. There is a
                            very common habit I fear many of us possess ; that is, saying unkind words one of another.
                            We would not be guilty of defaming another's character, yet so natural is it to let some
                            careless remark pass our lips, that we would be quite ashamed for the person spoken of to
                            hear; how much better if we cannot find anything good to say, to speak not at all. I have
                            heard of a society called the Speak-no-Evil Society. Its members are required before
                            speaking evil of any one to ask themselves three questions ;�Is it true ? Is it kind? Is it
                            necessary? Before speaking against another, if we should stop and consider these things, how
                            seldom we should find it in our hearts to speak of evil; I think it would be well for us all
                            to form ourselves members of this association. The Scriptures commend those who are of a
                            meek and quiet spirit. Well cultivated persons will be gentle in all their movements, and
                            upon entering a room, will open and close the door quietly, and will never speak in a rude
                            noisy manner; in conversation they will not be obtrusive and usurp all the time in talking
                            as though they were superior and wished to be heard, but<pb n="201" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> will be
                            considerate of others and give them their just privileges. There are many things we might
                            mention, such as manners at the table, a willingness to wait upon others ; a greedy
                            disposition and an over anxiousness to begin before our .superiors is very unbecoming ; but
                            it is to be hoped that none of us have been so neglected that we will commit any gross
                            mistakes. So liable are we to grow indifferent to our deportment, that it requires constant
                            effort and frequently persistent energy to smooth down the angular corners of our
                            characters. None of us admire a blunt manner or tone of utterance ; even if our own decorum
                            is not perfect, our sensibilities are always wounded by such. The courteous address ; the
                            pleasant good morning, that sends a thrill of joy through our hearts, and gives us courage
                            to perform the duties of the dixy ; the sweet good night breathed from loving lips that
                            seems to place us neath the angels' care through the hours of slumber; the tender smile, the
                            gentle manner, the word of kindness and the obliging spirit; can these spring from any other
                            fountain but a good heart ? we think not; therefore let us cultivate these more and more. We
                            see in nature that everything is improved by culture ; and what is the rough block of marble
                            without the sculptor's art upon it ? how he chisels and works until it presents the beauty
                            and symmetry of a perfect form; and what is the diamond taken from its rocky bed, covered
                            with dirt; what is it compared with the polished stone, flashing with brilliancy? we can all
                            draw illustrations from these. Just here I am reminded of an incident related of George
                            Herbert the distinguished poet of England :�in one of his walks to join a musical society,
                            he saw a poor man with a poorer horse, that had fallen beneath his load. Putting off his
                            canonical coat he helped him to unload, and afterward to load his horse ; and so like the
                            good Samaritan was he, that he also gave him money by which to refresh himself. So coming to
                            his musical friends thej^ began to wonder why George Herbert should appear in their company
                            so soiled and discomposed. But he told them the reason ; and one of them said he had
                            disgraced himself by so mean an employment. His answer was ; he thought that what he had
                            done would prove music to him at midnight, and that the omission of it, would have made
                            discords in his conscience whenever he should pass by that place. We all have it in our
                            power to perform little kindnesses, let us seek to help others in the true spirit of
                            Christian courtesy ; let us tune the hearts we come in contact with to the music of love,
                            then will no harsh discords of ill-will sadden our lives. We find ourselves placed in this
                            world with surroundings that not only affect ourselves, but those with whom we are
                            associated; not only our outward actions, but our interior thoughts have sounds that vibrate
                            on the electric currents of feeling, and wing their way from heart to heart; therefore, let
                            us admire all that is good, and fill our souls with the same ; then will refinement of heart
                            glow in our countenances and our deportment will be Christ-like and courteous. Mt. Lebanon,

He was taken quite sick.
                            The custom of the time was to let out blood until the most of the fever and poison had run
                            away in the red stream. Luther was a man of prayer In this particular he perhaps equaled any
                            of the moderns. But he was also a wonderful student of human f.acts and nature's facts, and
                            he came to the conclusion that cutting off food fir a few days would lessen the quantity of
                            blood active and pure; so when the sixteenth century physician came with lancet ami ba-in
                            Luther sent hin back unused as being less effective than fasting and lung walk-;. Luther
                            says: "I went without food and took long walks and got well " Thus science cured Luther.
                            When over with the attack no doubt the grand man thanked the Heavenly Father for such simple
                            and beautiful laws of health. In our day the prayer of thousands should indeed be offered in
                            the incipient stages of illness, but the burden of that prayer should be for grace and sense
                            enough to be temper-rite in food and take a Lutheran walk every day.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Swing, D." TEIform="persName"/>Prof D.

                            always being and doing just as near what you know to be right as possible. Every deviation

                            you form upright characters. Follow the path of duty through good and evil report, when you

                                interesting hints. It says : "A strip of flannel or a napkin folded lengthwise and
                                dipped into hot water, and wrung out and then applied around the neck of a child that
                                has the croup, will usually bring relief in ten minutes. A towel folded several times
                                and dipped in hot water and quickly wrung and applied over the seat of the pain in
                                toothache and neuralgia, will generally afford prompt relief. This treatment in colic
                                works almost like magic. I have seen cases that have resisted other treatment for hours,
                                yield to this in ten minutes. There is nothing that will so promptly cut short a
                                congestion of the lungs, sore throat, or rheumatism as hot water when applied promptly
                                and thoroughly. Pieces of cotton batting dipped in hot water and kept applied to old
                                sores, or new cuts, bruises and sprains, is the treatment now generally adopted in
                                hospitals. I have seen a sprained ankle cured in an hour by showering it with hot water
                                poured from a height of three feet. Headache almost always yields to the simultaneous
                                application of hoi water to the fret and back of the neck. A goblet of hot water, hot as
                                one can drink it, taken half an hour before bedtime or twenty minutes before breakfast,
                                or both, is the best of cathartics in the case of constipation, while it has the most
                                soothing effect on the stomach and bowels. This treatment continued for a few months,
                                with proper attention to diet, will cure any curable case of dyspepsia, and it will give
                                relief almost from the first glass. Try it and you will never regret having done so.</p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Tubercular animals are frequently killed for food..."

                                earth and good-will to all mankind. As a messenger to herald these glad tidings, it will
                                ever help to fulfill the beautiful prophecy, when the knowledge of the Lord will cover
                                the land. It is this knowledge of God, this reign of peace, this season of universal
                                rejoicing to which all are looking forward with an anxious hope. That it will come: that
                                it is now coming to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear; and that it has already
                                come to many precious souls who have denied themselves of all ungodliness, are spiritual
                                truths of which multitudes of Christian witnesses love to speak. To the worldly-wise and
                                ignorant, like many other things, it is quite beyond their full conception, and they put
                                the day of God's power into the distant future. It may be after the great judgment day;
                                it may be wThen Christ shall come in the clouds of heaven. To them, as to the priests of
                                Baal, there may be no God to hear. One class, however, have the precious promise of
                                seeing God and that at as early a date as they may choose to be ready for his coming.
                                This becomes the special privilege of "the pure in heart," and on this race every one
                                can enter his name, and by faithful perseverance, certainly, win the prize. Those who
                                anticipate the millennium of God's love on the earth, must be actively engaged in the
                                preparatory stages, or the fulness can never be realized. So long as there is confusion
                                and strife, so long there will be slavery and cruelty. So long as nations shall war
                                against nations, and in their mad career destroy even the bread that should feed the
                                poor, the gospel testimony of God's witnesses, so prophetic of the "last days," will be
                                heard only faintly and be received with many misgivings. However strange this may be,
                                the history of the ages teaches us that divine truth makes but slow progress in the
                                minds of those who are so<pb n="207" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> fully absorbed in the life of this
                                world. The blessings of a United Inheritance which dwell in a Christian Community, will
                                close out the narrow, selfish relations of the children of this world, and open an
                                avenue to a more blissful abode. It was a high conception of spiritual truth that filled
                                the soul of Jesus when he prayed,�" Thy kingdom come," God's heavenly kingdom in which
                                all would become peacemakers, and as anxiously seek to forgive others, as they would
                                wish to be forgiven. If we believe in the testimony of Christ and enter in at the strait
                                gate, all this is to be realized while we live on the earth. It is in the Christian
                                Community in God's kingdom of Fathers and Mothers, Brothers and Sisters. A people who
                                are learning to do the will of God, in its new revelation to their souls. The ideal of a
                                Christian home has always been in a Community where "God's people shall dwell in
                                peaceable habitations, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places." Jesus
                                anticipated this spiritual home where "Brethren and Sisters could dwell together in
                                unity," and faithfully devoted his life to its fulfillment. He prayed for God's home to
                                come upon the earth, as it was already in the heavens. All who had the least idea of a
                                spiritual relation, believed that God's children would be gathered to a habitation where
                                there would be no rich nor poor; where all who were led by the spirit of God, would
                                become the Sons and Daughters of God, and share, alike, the blessings of the heavenly
                                kingdom on earth. The first lessons to be impressed upon the minds of the disciples was
                                that of the common brotherhood in which God was to be the Father of all who accepted
                                this new ministration. The selfish relations in which they had lived were to give place
                                to something better, and make of them a spiritual family, in which God's will, instead
                                of man's will would be done as it was done in heaven. "Except a man forsake all that he
                                hath he cannot be my disciple." This decisive word was placed before every one who
                                wished to enter the brotherhood with Jesus. That some who were wealthy should turn away,
                                sorrowfully, as did the young man, or question the propriety of forsaking all to follow
                                Christ, as did Peter, is not at all surprising, for the same trial still exists among
                                men. Blinded by the god of this world, they are led into his selfish relations without
                                the least resistance, and to that extent that the Revelator exclaims, "The whole world
                                wondered after the Beast !" Jesus and his disciples gave the first lessons for the peace
                                and prosperity of a Christian Community. The Church must be consecrated to God and his
                                people ; a part cannot be reserved for self and selfish purposes. Peter's admonition to
                                    Ana-<pb n="208" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> nias may be timely for all who enter the Church of
                                Christ. "Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Spirit, and to keep back
                                part of the price of the land? While it remained, was it not thine own ? and after it
                                was sold, was it not in thine own power? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."
                                These burning words, and those in the 5th chap, of Matt, represent the permanent basis
                                upon which Jesus established his church. "Other foundation can no man lay than that is
                                laid, which is Jesus Christ." I Cor. III., 11. That can secure to any one the reward of
                                the Christian in this life, or assure him of eternal life in the world to come. This
                                Christian Community was to be separate from the selfish and grasping life of the world,
                                and its people were expected to love righteousness and truth above all things. In this
                                was to be found a new life, spiritual, even as the angels of God in heaven. A Christian
                                Community, even at this late date needs an inspirational care of consecrated souls, to
                                raise it above the elements of a worldly life. Much has yet to be learned to secure a
                                growing prosperity, which must make of our home the kingdom of God upon the earth,
                                wherein righteousness shall be the ruling spirit, and where nothing shall harm or hurt
                                in all God's holy mountain.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I sing the joy of sins forgiven" TEIform="index"/>

                                strength and honor be Of an untold weight from heaven." Our visiting company are all at
                                home, having enjoyed a very profitable season with gospel kindred in seven different
                                Societies. We could but notice that in every Society and family they had something
                                different from every other. A peculiar manifestation of the beautiful spirit of love; a
                                special spiritual gift and ministration; and when these meet together in the spirit and
                                testimony of Mother's gospel we have the music of the spheres. One feature of our
                                journey was specially interesting to me; and that was the graveyards ; they show real
                                progress of spirit, and a gradual growth of understanding. This may not have come about
                                from our designing, but it has come. The disposing of the mortal remains of our loved
                                ones, has in times past, and is now, calling forth a good deal of exercise of mind. In
                                passing by our burying places, and also many which did not belong to our order, I felt
                                as though we might make the institution called death very interesting and profitable to
                                the living. Instead of costly attire, expensive caskets and monuments of stone ; or
                                wooden marks and tall weeds and briers, neither of which have a savory effect upon the
                                living or upon the departed loved ones, 1 would like to set apart a room in which to
                                place the shadow of the person who has just passed through the vail, with name and age,
                                when they came among Believers, and any points of their history that would be of
                                interest to the rising generations. Take, for instance, the aged saint, Elder Timothy
                                Eandlett, sitting in his chair, patiently waiting the boatman's call; his countenance
                                full of goodness and love; what pleasant thoughts and feelings it would excite to go
                                into a room adorned with such shadows. A grave-yard is to me a place of sadness, and if

                                ground and keep a record and plan of the same, but do not put up costly marble slabs, or
                                anything else. The angels set us an example in the disposing of the body of Jesus. Let

                                have cut over 300 tons of hay, and some 50 acres of grain. Rye and wheat were excellent;
                                oats generally light. If our machines and tools are all put away in good order, it will

                                there are some things rather scarce, we have enough to fill every reasonable heart with
                                gratitude and thankfulness, and to exercise ourselves in kindly Christian love towards
                                everybody. D. Offord. Soutli ITa/mily. Dear Editor :�Not long since we told how many
                                potatoes we had planted; now we must tell how wonderfully they have yielded. We do not
                                find any nicer ones in market. We got fifteen very large ones in one hill, and if other
                                crops have failed us, the potatoes have not. I think we have gathered two bushels of
                                blueberries while we usually have three times two bushels. We will be twice glad to
                                resort to the New Hampsnire syrup this year as that was not a failure. Since our last
                                shower we have not been too warm. Those who have trouble with table salt should try
                                putting in one cup of corn starch, in eight cups of salt. The people of Mt. Lebanon have
                                proved it and like the way as the moisture is done away with. We have not been obliged
                                to stay at home one Sabbath day this season on account of the rain. We are quite
                                fortunate, as all meetings are together one day in seven which seems like the proper
                                thing to do, some of the speaking and singing is excellent as it tends to union; "we
                                must dwell together in unity." S. A.

We always hail with gladness the arrival of the precious messenger,

                                August No. contains several most interesting articles. Letter from Dr. Carl,
                                Instrumental Music, and the beautiful sentences in "Our Lord's Prayer" so ably treated,
                                are, in our opinion, super-excellent. Notes about home we find very pleasant reading and
                                always turn with avidity to them, for we are anxious to know how the dear friends in
                                other portions of God's vineyard are prospering. Observing the absence of notes from our
                                beautiful home in June and July numbers, and knowing that vacations were in order in
                                these days of excessive heat we fancied that our note-collector might be enjoying a
                                vacation. But lo! on receiving Aug. No. we were agreeably surprised to fiivl that one
                                writer at least, still remained at home. Produce from our vegetable garden is abundant.
                                Green peas and new Irish potatoes headed the list of esculents that covered our dinner

                                successful. He was wonderfully prospered in raising a large fluck of chickens until they
                                became quite sizable, when a large number of them disappeared, having been destroyed by
                                some rapacious anim.il. Most kinds of fruit are unpromising this season. Pears are a
                                total failure. Apples lew. Plum trees altogether fruith.-s. Small fruits not plenty
                                excepting the blackberry which seems to yield well. Looking from our window we can see
                                busy hands engaged in gathering this variety of berry from a nice little briar patch
                                that was planted two years ago last spring by our venerable father, Elder Albert, and
                                has been mostly cared for by him since. Should he live until the coining October he will

                                of making a permanent settlement. They belong to the class that a son of Erin once
                                described as having a hot fut, (foot.) At present they appear inoffensive and if left
                                undisturbed, will, we trust, remain quite peaceable. They have reared quite a structure
                                for themselves and we think are well satisfied with their location. They may have
                                emigrated from Norway as they have selected a Norway Spruce in which to build their
                                residence. Is this an omen, and if so, is it for good or ill? can you tell us? Before
                                closing our note we must tell you how displeased we are with your change of position,
                                for we greatly fear that duty will not call you in the direction of our home as

                                live as though they believed it not, and never find out how true it is,. Still, it takes
                                most of us a good many years to learn the "time to every purpose," and the "season for
                                everything." The sooner we learn to apply this God-given principle in our daily lives,
                                and make it our rule to be systematic in our daily occupations, the better it will be

                                well. Japanese buckwheat looks strong and vigorous. Jumbo strawberries were large and
                                good, vines healthy. Tobacco dust when used liberally in hen's nests will free them from
                                vermin. Nests that are mo'veable are convenient and quickly cleaned. Nothing is better

We begin to realize our loss by the long drought. For seven long weeks
                                through the hay season and before, the blessing of rain was withheld from mother earth,
                                and right in the time our potato crop needed it the most. We Khali realize from our late
                                potatoes a reasonable crop. But early ones are very small. Apples are scarce. Corn is
                                looking beautiful and the largest crop planted for many years. The hay crop was
                                harvested without a drop of rain which makes it of excellent quality. Garden vegetables
                                are good. Onions will be an excellent crop. This sums up the temporalities. Our dear
                                Elder John Whiteley started for England, the home of his boyhood, on Saturday the 9th of
                                August. He is to be gone two months and we pray he may have a happy time. Our prayers

                                enjoy since we wrote you last, is the visit of Brothers Daniel Offord and Charles
                                Greaves, with four sister companions from the North Family at Mt. Lebanon, who were at
                                Canterbury from July 29 to August 5. It was only too good to last, as the children say,
                                and so at the latter date they left us for a brief tarry at Shaker Station, as they
                                journeyed homeward. It was not hard in their presence to believe that "the pure in heart
                                see God." We blessed each other, as only the loyal who know the worth of loyalty can
                                bless. How sweet the comfort of spiritual gifts and how blest the interchange. Bro.
                                Daniel Offord spoke to us on the Sabbath, as a brother speaks to his friends where no
                                cloaks are worn. One of our Brethren said in appreciation that he had heard many persons
                                strike each side of the nail and in fact all around it, but never so squarely on the
                                head as Bro. Daniel had done or did, upon the subject of "Our United Inheritance." Shall
                                we send inquiry for Bro. Alonzo Hollister, who we hear is to journey this way? Rain fell
                                nearly all day on Sat. July 26. On Thurs. July 31, took place the thunder shower and
                                wind squall which did so much damage north of us. Two slight rainfalls only within the
                                last two months. Hay is of extraordinary quality and stored in the barns in excellent
                                condition. Corn is growing fast; sweet corn already ripe and White Rice pop corn eight
                                feet tall. The pear and apple crops are light. Bro. George Clark speaks of "a full crop
                                of peaches" which we hope to realize. Blackberries plenteous and gatherers busy. We have
                                little cause for complaint at any season, and are only desirous to forget earthly
                                selfish interests and send out our sympathies in kindly solicitude for the relief of
                                those who suffer and for the welfare of all mankind. We are thinking especially just now
                                of the "blessings in disguise" attending our dear western friends at Union Vill ge, Ohio
                                In the death of one of their ablest leaders, we remember them in more than words, but
                                whether we sorrow or rejoice, let us often sing "To-day, though the vintage may fail,
                                And answer to prayer seem to wait, Still let thy faith cheer thee to-day, God's

                                their absence. Words can never tell the amount of good such angel visits accomplish, and
                                every time we are thus blessed, we question afresh, why must they be so "few and far
                                between?" On Aug 1st. we had the nearest approach to a cyclone, which the people in

                                Childs, had spread before the kitchen piazza fo dry, were the only things that were
                                lifted bodily, we were perfectly satisfied, not to experience a full blown one: clouds

                                unreliable form of weather prevails out this way. During the spring and early summer
                                rain storms visited here daily, the most prominent feature of the mornings was rain,
                                noons were the same, and nights were a repetition of both. But those rainy days, those
                                rainy days, Have now all disappeared; A scorching sun with withered grass, Predicts a
                                drouth 'tis feared. The five past weeks have been noted for excessive heat and dryness,
                                only a few light showers and those but a trifle more than a sprinkle found their way
                                here. Perhaps the rain-clouds that covered the sky for the first half of the year have
                                sailed across the Continent to give the inhabitants there a spray from the mighty sea
                                above. Now if some of them would return and favor us with a dashing and splashing once
                                or twice each week, we would thankfully send our thanks skyward. The harvesting of hay
                                and grain is the daily occupation of farmers, and is proving a successful success. The
                                song of the reaper and mower is heard from morn till eve, making music pleasing to hear,
                                giving evidence that industry and enterprise reigns, and that the Earth with its
                                fullness of fruitage, Declareth God's wondrous skill, His goodness forever surrounds us
                                And ever, forever it will. The delegation that left here on a bright June morning

                                been secured and preserved for winter comfort, while occasionally a breakfast or dinner
                                has been decorated with the delicious fruit which is ever healthful and refreshing.
                                Easpberries and currants have grown luxuriantly, but the English sparrows too well know
                                Where the best of all fruits grow; Plucking first the ripened cherries, Then to currants

Family. Aug. 1890. Well here I am again for the month of August I must have
                                something to write about our home, must say we are shining up pretty well here. We have
                                been white-washing the fence along the highway and painting the gates, some a bright red
                                and others a light blue. I have been painting our laundry engine, so it looks like a new
                                one again. We have had our cistern fixed in the front yard, it had caved in last spring,
                                so we are getting things fixed pretty nicely. We have started in the sheep business
                                again, with a start of twelve head of very fine sheep all young frora one to four years.
                                The weather has been very hot for the past week. We are selling off some of our cows and
                                investing the money in the sheep. We are taking care of the cows ourselves now, we used
                                to pay a man $ 18. per month. We have but one hired man at this family. We are also
                                working our road tax and have about four days to work. Our home begins to look very
                                nice. We also put up forty-four rods of combination fence. We will have very short crops
                                of corn here if it does not rain soon. It is very dry. The center family have been
                                taking sugar melons to market. They get from $2.50 to $3 and $3.50 per bushel for them.
                                They have also been in the rabbit business for the past year, they have what they call
                                the german or scotch hares, they have some that would weigh about eight or ten pounds.
                                They have about fifteen young ones and five old ones. They are a fine sight to see,
                                every body admires them. People in this section are plowing for wheat. The center family
                                bought a new creamery witli a crank to raise all of the cans at one time out of the box.
                                Their herdsman has been fixing the cowbarn floor lie is taking out the board floor and

                                Eldress Anna White hit the nail square on the head. Elder O. C Hampton's "Soliloquy" was
                                good. The Editorial, and in fact I might name them all, are good. From a wheat field
                                that was fertilized they obtained 19 bushels per acre, while from one without this extra
                                care they obtained 8 bu. pr. acre and from another 10 bushels, so the fertilizing paid
                                well. This has been a great fly year and a fruitful year for rabbits. In the evening the
