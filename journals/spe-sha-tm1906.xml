�"The Bank Tragedy" is the title of a
serial story of great power, written by Mrs.
Hatch, author of "The Upland Mystery,"
which was published in the Transcript two
years ago, which has since then had a sale of
about 100,000 copies in book form. The new
serial is a detective story, the plot of which
is constructed with remarkable skill. It will
exercise the ingenuity of those who are experts in guessing the plots of half-read novels. The scene is laid in northern New
Hampshire, but some of the tragic and romantic incidents of a recent famous bank
case in Maine are worked into it. The story
is being published in the Portland Transcript, beginning Jan. 2d. The publishers
offer several premiums for the best guesses
at the plot sent in by subscribers before Feb.
20th. Subscriptions, $2.00 a yr. 6 months, $1.

                            Beloved Elder Henry ;�We were quite pleased on the receipt of your interesting letter. If
                            kind friends impart messages of joy, it brings them very near, to allow us to share the
                            blessing with them. If at times we feel overborne, we know by experience that we can look to
                            no better source for consolation than to those who are traveling the same course, and
                            bearing up under the weary toils of the same journey. You speak kindly of our former
                            letters. We certainly thank you for your encouragiog words, for we had almost concluded that
                            we had written so many long letters, that perhaps they had become tedious. If they have been
                            of any benefit we are pleased to have it so. You say that when "I am full to overflowing you
                            would be pleased to have me write." We think we had better not wait to be transported into
                            that happy condition. We fear you would have to wait quite too long for an answer to your
                            last, although in such cases we have always noticed, during our pilgrimage among Believers,
                            that if any soar too high toward heaven, they soon light upon the earth again when they feel
                            their own state roll back upon them. All who set out on the Believer's, journey, may as well
                            prepare their hearts for sorrow as for joy and their souls for temptation as well as
                            victory, if our experience teaches right. But it is all right. Deep, painful, heartfelt
                            experience, is an unerring, truthful teacher. We are a heavy debtor to our true friends, who
                            have kindly endorsed for us when our funds of strength were low aud our social poverty
                            notorious. When we have been burdened with many cares aud tried with, failures at home and
                            afar off, with few strong hearts to tender support, and vexation and perplexity was our
                            portion, we have suddenly received a line from some old and tried friend and have had our
                            soul moved within us while perusing it. We have then sat down and read it, and re-read it,
                            and then read it again, feeling cheered by the inspiration it imparted. Dr. Johnson entered
                            London, youno-, friendless and penniless, with his pack on his back, intending to gain
                            distinction by his pen. It was a bold undertaking to seek notoriety among many thousands of
                            scribes. A great political question soon agitated the metropolis and Johnson wrote on the
                            popular side, which attracted the attention of an in-<pb n="122" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> fluential Lord,
                            who spoke in flattering terms of the unknown author, which bi ought him to light and favor.
                            Through life he used to say, 'kI have undying love for that great man, because he praised me
                            when I needed to be praised." In this we are all much alike. A little friendship, praise or
                            good-will, is to us the most precious when we really need it ; and in these days of
                            upheaving, that time comes quite often. While passing through the trial, give us a few
                            friends, the more, the better, who stand firm with faith unshaken, stand in the light and
                            bow to government, and I prize them higher than ministering angels. Of the indifference of
                            the world to the gospel call, we are too well posted. All old stereotyped religious teaching
                            presents to men a tyrannical angry God and no probation beyond time. The fears and terrors
                            aroused by holding up these theories produces an agitation called conviction. When many
                            honest souls enter the gospel, it is more labor to get them out of their false zeal and
                            creeds, than it is their sins. Then if they stand in the way of the next gospel increase,
                            should not sucli errors and all the convictions which grow out of them be swept away? TO BE

TEIform="persName"/>George M. Wickersham.</byline><p TEIform="p">Can it be true that our young people, those upon whom we have set our hearts, to save them
                            from the sins and follies of the world, those for whom we have spent weary hours of toil to
                            serve, and to make life enjoyable, and to educate them for virtue and usefulness, we ask,
                            can it be possible that they leave us because they are driven away from us? If so, who, or
                            what is it that drives them? If we drive them away, why does the memory of their experience
                            here haunt them like a dream of Paradise towards which they frequently turn, hoping,
                            sometime when the fetters of their exile are brok.n, to be allowed to return even to a lower
                            statica than the one fro.a wh'ch they went. If they are driven out by unreasonable
                            treatment, we say, why do the brightest and best behaved delight to come back and call up
                            old memories, associatio is which must bring back the recollections of ill-treatment, so
                            much greater than the benefits, as to have forced them to depart; if that was the case. Or,
                            why do others under the samo treatment, abide with us? It appears to us, that the cause of
                            leaving is not co much in being driven away by others, as it is by being enticed away by
                            natural and uugoverned propensities. The same as the first pair were driven or more properly
                            enticed from a state of purity in Eden. It has been the policy and practice of our leaders
                            to concede many thiags to yonug people, and overlook many -Indiscretions in order to hold
                            them, hoping that as the/ grew in knowledge, and understanding themselves, they would see
                            the propriety of the greater restriction, and come to it voluntarily. It will not do to
                            yield to all the wants of young people ; for that would be to surrender all government and
                            ail regulation to the unskillful notions of inexperience. The uugoverned child is ungrateful
                            and unhappy ; even though it is sheer affection that indulges it. It is a slave to its own
                            passionate impulses, and is tormented with their restless and ceaseless demands. Only the
                            governed child knows how to appre-<pb n="123" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> date kindness ; only those who are
                            disciplined by love have much to be thankful for. Only such can be held by obligation, or
                            heed the call of duty. The ungoverned child on arriving at the youthful period, is impatient
                            of all restraint but that of caution and seeretiveuess. and is driven by his masterpassions
                            and impulses to all sorts of expedients, tricks, and rogueries to accomplish their desires,
                            till finally they drive him from order-loving society to repeat his exploits elsewhere. This
                            is an extreme character, but there is a mixture of every grade from the governed to the not
                            governed. And it is the mixture of ungoverned and undisciplined elements of character which
                            causes all the trouble disaster and ruin. Many seeds of the world have germinated in the
                            heart of the child before it is given into our charge. These are nourished and others spring
                            up as the opportunities of the child enlarge by continual communication and contact with
                            worldly elemeuts and conditions, kept up by frequent communication with outside friends or
                            relations, and their exchanges by letters, presents, and social visits, both ways. Most
                            young people in these days are readers of books and story-papers, newspapers and magazines,
                            which are charged with influences foul or fair. Those coming from the world convey knowledge
                            of the world, both its truth, and falsehood, good and evil, selfish and unselfish, clean and
                            filthy, wise and foolish from which the reader's mind attracts and assimilates as food,
                            consciously and unconsciously, whatever agrees most with its leading impulses and desires.
                            For the heart is a magnet, and as sure as magnet draws steel, it attracts to itself whatever
                            it most desires, or else it finally draws to it; if the desire be not given up or exchanged
                            for another. T lis is the law of all growth in life. The unavoidable frequent contact with
                            hirelings and strangers, increases the number of avenues by which the great outside world
                            flows into the youthful mind to nourish aud claim its own, planted there in its beginning.
                            The mind of a child having such a start, all these feeders grow into a compound that thinks
                            happiness consists in the attraction of pictures that are excitable, useless games that if
                            indulged in lead to gambling, and trying to bring in many things contrary to the feelings
                            and judgment of the officers of Society. Loving to think only on the agreeable part of the
                            pictures photographed on his mental atmosphere ; he is dazzled by surface glitter and
                            display, and lives in an unreal world created by the imaginations of his own heart. To some
                            the world appears as a vast play-house, and it seems to be enjoying a holiday. Others look
                            upon it as an open market where most things sought by young people are supposed purchasable
                            with brains, muscles, or money. All these things operate like magnets upon the youthful mind
                            to weaken the sense of obligation aud of duty in serving ; and to lessen in its esteem the
                            value of moral law, and the necessity of daily faithful service to Society as an essential
                            ingredient of happiness, because these interrupt its dreams of pleasure and bring it face to
                            face with sober realities. Outside, idle ease and fancied freedom, or pleasure and selfish
                            gain invite; inside, is toil, crucifixion, and restraint. The former attracts, the latter
                            repels. The former appeals whol-<pb n="124" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> ly to what is external and transitory,
                            the latter builds up the internal, and enduring, and aids growth by exercise of faculty. To
                            counteract these is needed, First, a sense of duty arising from a proper cultivation of
                            conscience, a principle to do right because it is right. Any one who has not this principle
                            enthroned within, is not prepared for happiness in this world or auy other. If we cannot
                            succeed in planting or unfolding it in those who regard it not, they will be like thorns in
                            the side of their friends and neighbors, and very unsuitable material for our Society.
                            Second, youthful minds should be allowed such innocent pleasures as do not interfere with
                            proper discipline and the performance of necessary duties.' We think, good judges will agree
                            that children and young people should never be spoken to in anger, or crossed unnecessarily.
                            For certainly the faithful performance of all life's duties brings crosses and burdens
                            enough to perfect discipline without inventing any extra ones. Third, it is necessary to
                            cultivate Spirituality in the young mind, to teach it the value and importance of the life
                            after this, and how our conduct here will determine our conditions there. If we obey our
                            best light and understanding, and heed the monitious of conscience, and the teachings of our
                            superiors who have had experience, renouncing present pleasure for future good, our
                            condition hereafter will be happifying and all that we can desire, far beyond anything we
                            can conceive while here. Such as neglect duty�disregard conscience, disobej teachers and
                            guardians in a careless, self-willed, headstrong way, unless they repent of such ways and
                            change their course, thev are heds-iner ud their own way, and are gathering fuel for their
                            own destruction ; are making work for future repentance before thev ca"3 gain that degree of
                            happiness which gives peace and comfort to the soul. Our bodies contain appetites and
                            passions which are self-impelling forces, and if we do not acquire complete dominion and
                            perfect control over them, by obedience to the highest light given us through understanding,
                            and the moral and reasoning faculties, and thus obtain our relation and union with the order
                            of rational, spiritual beings above us, they will acquire dominion over us, and cut us off
                            from associating with higher intelligences, and degrade us to the level of the animal
                            creation, holding such relation to the universe as animals hold, without their peaceful,
                            restful state, because out of our true order and relationship to the superior Intelligences.

                            society. Despite all our boasted progress in art, science, literature and refinement, these
                            vices are attaining hideous proportions, destroying the fair image of God that should be
                            enstamped on the form and visage of all his creatures. These great evils differently affect
                            several classes of people ; namely, the pleasure-seeker, the remunerated, the victimized and
                            the humanitarian. Those who love their alcohol, their nicotine and carnal indulgence, and
                            those who buy the bodies and souls of men and women through immoral traffic, would hush the
                            voice, and quell the agitation, that arouse the community to a seuse of duty in regard to
                            their suppression ; because self-interest is at stake, and conscience is lulled to sleep.
                            Thousands of suffering spirits could tell a tale of agony and woe, for there are few
                            households that have not one or all of these cancerous spots, eating out its very heart ot
                            joy ; making sorrowful and desolate what might have been a happy circle. From many who
                            realize the situation, a war cry has gone forth against destructive beverages and narcotic
                            poisons ; but when shall a prophet arise to confront Agag�the king of evil�the lust of the
                            flesh, which must be utterly destroyed before peace and happiness shall reign among men ?
                            Drinking saloons are but the glittering entrances to dens of infamy and hell, where souls
                            barter their virtue for gold, and ruin stamps its victims of both sexes by the thousands
                            annually. "Dew-drop Inn"�literally meaning Do Drop in�was the attractive sign hung out by
                            one of the gilded and illumined halls, where the young, the gay and thoughtless flocked to
                            quaff from the sparkling goblet, what they deemed a little harmless beverage ; but the door
                            was opened to the spider's parlor, and many a silly fly through vain<pb n="126" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>
                            flattery was trapped in the intricate meshes of sin. There are individuals who know somewhat
                            of the ravages of that most seductive and destructive vice, the Social Evil ; and their very
                            souls are filled with horror and indignation ; but few dare speak the truth, lest they be
                            silenced or persecuted by the bold champions of lust, whose infamous debauchery knows no
                            bounds, and whose ill-gotten gains can license or bribe any form of evil they cherish. Every
                            civilized commuoity was shocked by the startling news of London's venal sin ; but what of
                            our own great cities, towns, villages, schools and homes? We need but lift the thin veil of
                            secrecy to behold the social Molech in all its revolting hideousness. The sacred laws of God
                            in nature wantonly disregarded in the relations of life, result in dwarfed and undeveloped
                            specimens of humanity, whose distorted forms and facial expression, bears the stamp of
                            demoralization and degradation, and whose innate inclinations lead the downward course. Our
                            reformatories, hospitals and asylums,�vastly on the increase�are filled with mental,
                            physical and moral wrecks, fruits of our hot-bed civilization, the very sight of which would
                            make the simple children of nature, untutored and unspoiled, blush for shame. Our charities
                            are boundless, and we may provide ad infinitum, but if we do not strike at the root of the
                            evil tree, there will be no end to its productions. One of our modern philosophers truly
                            says, u In all past time there has been no ethical system potent to establish a perfectly
                            harmonious social state, and no system of education competent to lift society to a higher
                            life. Education as it has been, brightens life with literature and art but does not elevate
                            it. The same old element of poverty, misery, disease, crime and insanity, march on hand in
                            hand with the hunting and warring barbarians of the past; and the dull blunted conscience of
                            our time, lulled by the softly solemn platitudes of the pulpit, and the soulless system of
                            education, rebels not against the old social order." Rebellion and insubordination in
                            children, so marked in the present age, are but the result of passional indulgence ; and
                            when parents lose all control over them�without tracing the consequences to the cause�they
                            are ready to devise means of ridding themselves of the burden ; and seek to place them in
                            some charitable institution or spiritual community, where they soon prove past reclaiming by
                            any reasonable or moral means, and must be cast forth upon society, to become its vagrants,
                            criminals aud anarchists, often ending their days in prison or on the gallows. The most
                            facile pen could draw but a faint delineation of the evils resulting from the practice of a
                            vice, which proves a thousand times more destructive to human beings than liquor, or the
                            many narcotics that craze and stupify the brain, or wreck the nervous system ; because, it
                            pollutes the very fountains of life, and entails untold miseries upon future generations.
                            God speed the good work that some noble individuals have commenced in the field of moral
                            reform, this is the stepping stone to all true progress. Not until humanity rise in the
                            scale of morality, can Christian communism hope for an increase of souls ; for the<pb n="127" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> pleasure-loving world cliug to their cherished idols, and waive all
                            thought of future good, in the vain hope of attaining happiness that is only the result of
                            virtue, self-denial and a life consecrated to the service of God and the good of humanity.

                            our dearest friends; Those to whom our souls cling closest, Those on whom our hope depends.
                            Tender are the sacred voices, Those we know, whose love is true; Lightly tread the willing
                            footsteps That bring joy and pleasure too. Gentle are the hands that hasten Love's own

                            Isaiahs zii., 5. Yea indeed, and unthankful and unholy are they who know it not. God has
                            been good to all the generations of the earth through all ages. His lovingkindness and
                            unceasing abundance of good things have filled the earth to its uttermost parts; never has
                            the sun ceased to shine for a day, nor the stars to light the ebon shades of night; nor
                            vegetation to bloom and bear fruit; nor the waters to rise and fall in due time and
                            appropriate season. Never has God forsaken the hearts of mankind, nor has his providence
                            ceased to control their destinies. Deeply has truth in the soul been hidden beneath sin's
                            heavy cloud, and man-made creeds and conceptions fashioned into hideous forms his holy and

                            the penitent heart, and even the persistent evil-doer He will not cast aside but with
                            forbearance seeks to lead and help. Glory to God in the highest, let us worship and bow
                            down. Let us kneel j before the Lord our Maker, for He hath done excellent things, this is

                            wagons on one line, and each wagon contained a family and possibly all they possessed of
                            this world's goods. They were moving on to their anticipated Laud of Promise, to a new land.
                            They are decidedly in earnest to improve their fortunes. They mean business, the acquisition
                            of wealth, and all other matters are of secondary importance. They had moved off from their
                            old earth territory, had in fact pulled up stakes, and were determined to occupy a new
                            place. Are we who profess to be Christians as earnest in seeking the kingdom of heaven ? It

                            the worth of this love ; not only did he love those who were kind to him but those who

                                    shadows. Lying on the dewy grass, While 'tis only birds of Eden Justin mercy
                                    flitting past? If we knew the silent story Quivering through the heart of pain,
                                    Would our manhood dare to doom it Back to haunts of vice and shame? Life has many a
                                    tangled crossing, Joy has many a break of woe, And the cheeks tear-washed are
                                    whitest, And the blessed angels know. Let us reach within our bosoms For the key to
                                    other lives, And with love to erring nature, Cherish good that still survives; So
                                    that when our disrobed spirits Soar to realms of light again, We may say "Dear

                                home. A source of comfort and joy as month after month we grasp each number and eagerly
                                feast on the good things therein, kindly bestowed upon us by dear, beloved, gospel
                                friends from the several Societies. The Editorials are able, instructive and highly
                                entertaining. Personally, I have found encouragement and strength, and oftentimes much
                                comfort in the perusal. I was much pleased with the March Number. It came replete with
                                goodness and blessing, illumined with bright hope bearing tidings of good cheer to all.
                                The letter from our Sister, A. C. Stickney is a model of kindliness and true-hearted
                                Christianity, and the doubting heart may well be strengthened after<pb n="130" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 
                                perusing the article from the pen of Br. Louis Basting. To sum it all, there is the
                                deep, Fatherly wisdom, sweet Motherly love and counsel, the sturdy compaoionship of
                                youth combined with the precious utterances of childhood, to be found in the March
                                Manifesto. For twelve years or more, I have been an interested reader of the beautiful
                                and encouraging articles from Br. Daniel Orcutt, and long ago anticipated sending a word
                                of thanks for the same. But oh! procrastination, the thief of time, stole away the
                                opportunity, and lo ! in the March No., I find a kind and appreciative soul has heartily
                                responded. I gladly join with my unknown Sister in far away Kentucky in t! e tribute of
                                love and thanks for the good Brother's untiring zeal in behalf of the youth. Dear
                                Manifesto, may your light ever continue to shine brighter and brighter. I believe the
                                ties of brother-hood and sister-hood are strengthened through your pages and can be more
                                and more. There are those in every Community that I love and most eagerly are the
                                articles read when a familiar name is attached, and when there is no signature we feel
                                that it comes from some beloved co-worker in the field of action. The other day I asked
                                a Brother, "have you read a certain article in the Manifesto ?' He answered, "1 have not
                                yet come to it. I always begin at the beginning and go through it." May this interest in
                                the Manifesto increase. With the new year came new hopes, and new promises, and one of
                                my resolutions was to cheerfully perform every duty that presented itself. I felt that
                                it was my duty and indeed a pleasure to address these few lines to you, dear Manifesto,
                                and will conclude in the words of a song. "Oh praise ye the Lord And rejoice in his
                                goodness, Bright, living souls who in Righteous works abound, 'Tis your right to be
                                joyful And sing holy praises, And glorify Him For the prize you have found. Oh sing

                                lately been favored with the perusal of a very interesting and pleasant communication,
                                from your ready pen, addressed to the traveling ministerial delegation who have, and
                                will pass a limited sojourn at every Society in the west and south. Elder Giles
                                forwarded said notice for the edification and attention of the remaining half, who "are
                                now at home," in the midst of surrounding Brethren and Sisters. We are indeed made very
                                happy and comfortable in the full knowledge of charitable considerations extended to us.
                                As the stiff right hand of your aged Brother can only hold or move the pen with much
                                difficulty, we trust that charity may pass over an indefinite multitude of ill-shapen
                                pen-marks. It is only uni-<pb n="131" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> versal, interested gospel love that
                                causes the pen to move at the present time. After imparting the special love, kind
                                thanks, and affectionate remembrance of Kldress Ann, to all the dear souls at
                                Canterbury, the remainder of this small sheet may be more personal. This day, the second
                                of May, is the birthday of your Brother of 85 years ; being born in the year 1804, in
                                Logan County, Ky., you will perceive that the count is correct. In taking a
                                retrospective view of the past, I am led to reflect on what has been well done, with
                                pleasure ; but some good things that have been left undone, cause a little uneasiness.
                                In my declining years I have received numerous tokens of love and respect from various
                                loved Brethren and Sisters. May these pen-marks give evidence that all of them have been
                                fully appreciated, and now, heart-felt thauks are here presented to every ISister and
                                Brother at loved Canterbury. Even a highly prized letter written by request, (and a very
                                good sample by the way,) was duly and thankfully received, but not responded to. Many
                                thanks and kindest love, is hereby extended to the writer thereof. We left Mt. Lebanon on
                                the 24th ult. Left Societv at that place, in common health, and busily engaged in making
                                or earning money, cleaning house and door-yard. Farming and gardening nearly a month
                                more forward than usual. Here at our valley home, we find usual health, but do not
                                realize sickness to be a very "strange" or uncommon thing. Vegetation at this place more
                                forward than at the Mount; cherry and plum trees in full bloom. Of late we have been
                                favored with a lovely rain, which makes us still more thankful, as the rain was much
                                needed. Now good Elder Henry, we tender to you, and kind Sisters of the printing

                                the unknown country from whence no traveler returns. After her death, I had no easy
                                time, as my father was poor, yet he strove honestly and faithfully to support a large
                                family of children and of course when our mother was taken it was with us like sheep
                                without a shepherd. We were scattered. I chanced to get with a man who promised to pay
                                me five dollars per. month. He worked me in the field, aud at everything that came
                                along, but ten dollars was all I ever l'eceived for my time. After leaving him, I worked
                                for a man by the name of G. A. Brown. This good man was very kind, and advised me to go
                                to Pleasant Hill, Ky., and join the Shakers. This good man also had a son, who is now
                                Elder Napoleon D. Brown, of Pleasant Hill, Ky. On, or about the fifteenth of February,
                                one day at ten o'clock, I started for Pleasant Hill, a distance of twenty eight miles,
                                but before reaching the place it was late in the night. In the afternoon it began to
                                rain and soon darkness was spread over the earth. I tried long before dark to secure
                                shelter and something to eat, as j<pb n="132" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> had fasted since early in the
                                morning. I was refused at every place, and when asked where I was going, they would say,
                                "Oh, you can soon get there, it is ouly two or three miles." Some of them would advise
                                me not to go there, although they refused me a crust of bread. The last house at which I
                                stopped after being refused, I tried to hire the man to let me come in and rest on his
                                floor. I told him I had no money but would give him all my school-books, which consisted
                                of several readers, a geography, slates and such things, but he told me some member of
                                his house was sick and he could not let me stay. He showed me the lights, and said,
                                "There is where you want to go." After asking how far it was, he said, "three miles." It
                                was then very dark. I started on, for though I had been denied charity from the children
                                of this world, I felt sure that when I reached Pleasant Hill, I should find friends.
                                After climbing over many high cliffs, and deep ravines, I reached, in safety, the street
                                in front of the East House. Although it was late, some of the good Sisters were up
                                sewing and knitting, and just about that time the clouds parted and the full moon shone
                                out brightly over the beautiful city of God's chosen people. Most of them were
                                slumbering in peace. As I stood there viewing the place, I exclaimed aloud, "Praise God
                                for this beautiful home, the blessings of which I can so freely enjoy." I intended going
                                to the Central House, but as I knocked at the front door of East House one of the
                                Sisters was coming to bar the door for the night, she asked, "Who comes there?" I said,
                                we, and she thought I was one of their own boys, but on opening the door she found who I
                                was. I was invited to walk in. Refreshments were given me, and it reminded me of
                                Christian when on his heavenward journey, as he stopped at the house of the Interpreter.
                                Since then, nor before, have I had such kindness shown me. I wish 'o have it known, that
                                although I departed from the place, I hold the people in kindest remembrance. The
                                Shakers have done more good than they will ever know on this earth. The contrast between
                                the Christian, and those who are not interested to do good, I have tried to show in this
                                piece. The Shakers are doing more now towards educating children than when I was a boy.
                                At that time public school was not taught there, and I did not have the chance that many
                                others have now. I have obtained my education as best I could, and that is not much. I
                                now tender my thanks, and pray the blessings of a merciful God to rest and abide with
                                the Shakers wherever they ma;y be.

                            world. He may be as a prince among them, and like a sovereign as to his power over others ;
                            indeed, he may revel in all the pleasures of sensuality; surround himself with every earthly
                            luxury, and deny himself of nothing which wealth and power can command ; but, at last, the
                            evening of life is closing around him and he is forced to face the reality of death. The
                            grandeur of his success which before had been his joy and pride, now fails to awaken any
                            pleasing emotion in his breast, for this alas, is fleeting, mutable and unsatisfactory.
                            Groping in his despair for one solid rock to stand upon, in his extremity, he now recalls
                            all those he rejected and cast out. Sacrificed were the principles of integrity, charity and
                            purity for his greed for the mammon of unrighteousness. It is not possible for all to
                            acquire worldly wealth, power or fame, but it is within the power of the humbJest of God's
                            people to make daily investments of the true riches in the banks of sure compensation. This
                            may be accomplished by taking up the daily cross of self-denial; by making ourselves useful
                            to the world; by bringing joy to the sad, and by making some one's burden lighter by
                            striving to render the grief of the unfortunate more endurable. And though it may require
                            the sacrifice of some selfish consideration, the reward will be sufficient even at the
                            present to well repay the cost, and when at the end of our journey we look over our past
                            lives and behold the good deeds we have done, the kind words we have spoken, the peaceful
                            spirit we have carried with us, the degree of patience we have exercised, the fidelity with
                            which we have stood by the principles of justice, purity, love and progress ; the memory of
                            these things and the possession of that up rightness of spirit to which we shall have
                            attained, will constitute a fund of true riches. This can never be destroyed and will insure
                            to us the continual approbation of our Heavenly Parents and the love of the followers of
                            Christ.

                            the Manifesto, the discussion concerning theosophy, will prove most valuable. I refer not
                            only to the rapid dissemination of theosophical literature and organization of theosophical
                            societies generally, in this country, but especially to the criticism of Dr. J. R. Buchanan
                            who, as is well known, stands in the foremost rank of the spiritual writers of the day, and
                            the very able and exhaustive reply of E. I. K. Noyes Esq. F. T. S. published in the
                            ReligeoPhilosophical Journal of Chicago, in its issue of Apr. 2. 1889. I would that time and
                            space permitted quoting the latter article entire, in lieu of being content with a few
                            excerpts. Bro. Noyes in his article says:� " Theo-Sophia or Theosophy from two Greek words
                            meaning Divine Wisdom, is a very comprehensive term. It means Divine Wisdom, the absolute
                            sum of all knowledge, whether relating to the field of research we call science, or to the
                            other and spiritual side of nature which has been claimed by The-<pb n="134" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>
                            ology us its special field, yet which must be in reality just as much under the rule of
                            absolute law, and as scientific as the physical side of nature." * * * " It was under this
                            definition of theosophist that the Theosophical Society was founded by a few sincere seekers
                            after truth, and has grown and prospered up to the present time. It is not a religious
                            society in the ordinary sense of that term, as it has not a set creed, requires assent to no
                            dogmas, and has no prescribed theology." * * * "It numbers among its members, people of all
                            beliefs, Buddhists, Brahmins, Hindus, Parsees, Mohamedans, Liberal Christians, Spiritualists
                            and Agnostics, each studying from his own standpoint, and allowing full liberty to others,
                            to do the same, recoguizing that no one observer has, or can have, the whole truth." * * *
                            "The objects of the Society are as follows : 1. To form the nucleus of a universal
                            Brotherhood of Humanity without distinction of race, creed or color. 2. To promote the study
                            of Aryan and other Eastern literatures, religions and sciences. 3. To investigate
                            unexplained laws of nature and the Physchical powers of man. " The principle object of the
                            society is the first, not simply in order but in importance. We believe that the inculcation
                            of the principle of brotherhood and the essential unity of the race spiritually, is of the
                            utmost importance at the present time, and that the carrying out of the principles of love
                            and brotherhood, not simply in theory but in practical life, is the only remedy for the
                            present ominous and uneasy condition of the working classes, (so called) and necessary to
                            prevent the catastrophe, which must come as the logical and inevitable result of a
                            civilization, which is purely selfish in its aim, putting every man against his neighbor in
                            the struggle for material aggrandizement, instead oi' looking to the advancement of the
                            community as a whole. We believe that mankind are one in their higher spiritual aspect, and
                            that all true progress spiritually or materially, must be made as a race through the
                            inculcation of the principle of love, and help of our fellow men ; that it is as impossible
                            to really progress spiritually through the present selfish rules of life, where each strives
                            to rise at the expense of his neighbor, as it would be for one to nourish one finger at the
                            expense of the other fingers." "To aid in an humble way, the future spiritual growth of
                            humanity through the inculcation and practice of the principle of brotherhood and love, and
                            by unselfish impersonal work for humanity. Personally by striving to kill out selfishness in
                            ourselves, forgetting self in work for others and as a society, by spreading these ideas as
                            widely as possible and trying to bring their truth home to as many individuals as we can."
                            It will readily be discerned by our Shaker friends that the Theosophical society is an arant
                            courier in disseminating the very doctrines and principles which are fundamental in all
                            Shaker Societies. North Cambridge, Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="As Churches from the creedal and numerical point of view..." TEIform="index"/>

                            thousand of dollars to this or that charity, usually stipulating that his name be in some
                            way attached to the funds, we are lead to ask the question, "Did that man acquire his wealth
                            by dishonest means, and is he now seeking to ease a guilty conscience, and buy a place in
                            heaven ? Or is love of fame the impelling motive?" Does it seem compatible with the
                            injunction, "�Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth." In the parable of the
                            sheep and goats, we do not find any mention made of such high-sounding benevolence, as
                            influencing the balance of a just reward. But the simple duties of life faithfully performed
                            or otherwise guide the decision. The word is, "In-as-much as ye have or have not done unto
                            the least of these my brethren." Who are these brethren? Not the self-exalted, with many,
                            high-sounding titles which please the ear. They are the "Last." Their names may not be
                            registered on any church book, because the Master lieholds the heart. Every deed of kindness
                            done to the suffering poor of earth, however obscurely performed, will be sure to bring its
                            own reward to the soul. How many have passed through life with scarcely a recognition ! They
                            are so quiet and unobtrusive in their mauuers, neither looking nor asking for any other
                            reward, than the pleasure of bestowing comfort and happiness upon others. We think there
                            will be two disappointed classes ; the one, those who have lauded their own merits, and
                            recieved the applause of mortals. These will expect a joyful greeting on the other shore.
                            Jesus says, "Verily I say unto you, they have their reward." The other class are those who,
                            as we have said before, pass unnoticed through life and expect nothing hereafter but the
                            quiet and peace in their own souls resulting from "Little acts of kindness and little deeds
                            of love." These will hear the welcome sound of "In-as-much as ye have done it unto these ye
                            have done it unto me." Which shall we choose? Canterbury, N.

                            on the shoulder of a young monk, said: "Brother, let us go down into the town and preach."
                            So they went forth, the venerable father and the young man, conversing as they went. They

                            </head><p TEIform="p">Although religionists, above all others, seem to enjoy a satisfaction while being
                                enshrouded in some form of mystery, and in making that mystery an essential point in the
                                scheme of salvation from sin, there cannot be the least necessity for pursuing any such
                                course. The gospel work of our divine Teacher, Jesus Christ, is so plainly and
                                beautifully marked out that no one need mistake the road which leads on toward God. It
                                must be those who walk in darkness, having eyes but see not, who change the simplicity
                                of the way of truth into one of mystery. It may be readily conceded that their theology
                                is obscure, and possibly their lives may be questionable. "Wisdom's ways," when we find
                                them, "are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace," and if our minds are
                                attuned in harmony with the way, we need have no fear of being lost from God. If we
                                retain the wanderings from the truth and from the light of revelation and also the
                                innovations introduced into the Christian church by a class of selfish, quarrelsome men
                                who have been styled Egyptian doctors or philosophers they will be quite certain to make
                                us like themselves, children of this world. The life of Christ is light; and to be like
                                him we must walk in the light. His life is truth, and to be like him we must abide in
                                the truth. His life is in God, full of mercy, righteousness and love, and to be like
                                him, we must have our life in God and abound in the same gospel fruits. Failing to
                                secure these good gifts which must come by a living, growing testimony for God and
                                against the elements of the world, individuals, churches and communities, ultimately
                                become like the church of Laodicea and must fade away like the mist before the morning
                                sun. The nearer any body of religionists walk by the side of the world the more
                                obscurely will these states be presented, and should they unfortunately fall to the same
                                level as the world, then the difference between the two orders will be known only by the
                                names which they may bear. Jesus as he walked among his brethren and instructed them in
                                a life of righteousness, he was a model of simplicity. His lessons, delivered often in
                                parables, were remarkable in their<pb n="137" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> gentle application to the
                                truth. His care was as that of the shepherd over his flock. Jesus wanted all who would
                                accept the truth to enter with him into the kingdom of God, and to enjoy this privilege
                                while upon the earth. As he was anxious to do the will of God, so was he anxious that
                                his followers should learn to do the same. Give all to God and then the solving of every
                                spiritual difficulty was by a very simple process. Ask, Seek. A pilgrim on the way need
                                not travel in doubt, He has only to ask and the information will be given to him. He can
                                have no excuse for remaining in ignorance and wasting away precious time. If a little
                                more effort is needed to insure a positive success, the advice from Jesus is to seek and
                                he promises the assurance that the desired object will be found. This will require an
                                increase of zeal and any Christian who is determined to make his calling sure, must keep
                                his eyes open and his mind active or he may fail to find the strait gate which is so
                                essential to his happiness. Having found it, we must be sure to keep within it. Jesus
                                calls this life of righteousness a "narrow way" because those who walk in it must deny
                                themselves of all ungodliness. He has told us quite distinctly of some things that will
                                not be admitted in this new and narrow way, but the broad way takes in the whole world
                                and those who attempt to follow in the footsteps of the world, will, most assuredly,
                                find themselves in this way which Jesus says leads to destruction. All this is
                                remarkably simple and without any system of theology, without any churchal creed and
                                without any forms or ceremonies. The righteous and unrighteous must each reap the reward
                                of their own labors. No qualifications attained unto in any earthly order can warrant a
                                protective passage on this heavenly highway, unless it has for its foundation an
                                exceeding righteousness. To bear good fruits which may readily be seen and known of all
                                men, there must be a growing vitality, and this life must come from God.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">[Articles published in the Manifesto must be referred to the authors for any explanation that

                                        scientific fact, yet sensible people speak of malaria arising from rivers and
                                        lakes. Why! Bless everybody, were it not for the absorbing powers of water, man
                                        would not long survive. He would soon die of the accumulated waste and
                                        defilement of his own body. Water is a reservoir for the impure emanations of
                                        man and animals. Large cities are never built only near large bodies of water;
                                        either a large running river, where the water is being constantly renewed, or
                                        near a large lake, sea or gulf, where the waves are dashing and the water is
                                        kept constantly in commotion. By the motion of the water, the impurities it
                                        gathers are precipitated to the earth beneath ; there they are decomposed,
                                        returned to earth conditions. The water receives the impurities, carries them to
                                        the earth and by its soluble influence, aids in their decomposition. The
                                        evaporation of water by artificial means, or by the sun's rays, carries no
                                        impurities with it; and when condensed the water thus produced is always pure.

                            countenance is no taint of evil passion, no sign of bitterness, but with its radiant and
                            divinely illumined presence ever pointing and lifting men upward and ever upward to that
                            rift in the clouds of sin and misery through which streams forever a ray from the
                            everlasting light and peace of heaven. What is it then that taints the fair name and
                            reputation of that which should be above all reproach or suspicion, what is it that permits
                            the scoffer or the skeptic to pronounce the holy name of religion with a sneer of ridicule
                            and contempt? It is this monster theology that has all along clung to its garments
                            surrounding it with all the hideous distortions of human passion and error. It is theology
                            that has burnt heretics at the stake; it is theology that has led armies forth to scenes of
                            blood and carnage, shamefully forging the sacred name of religion to inscribe it on their
                            brutal banners ; it is theology that in all the ages have made men narrow, hard and cruel,
                            and if anywhere in religion past or present there has been anything lowering, weakening or
                            degrading to human life it can be traced back to this destructive parasite of doctrine and
                            creed which has all along well-' igh strangled all life and fruitfulness out of this
                            delicate and tender plant rooted as it is in the finer elements of the human soul. Oh
                            theology what crimes against religion hast thou committed, what terrible wrong and injury
                            hast thou done to this divinely sent messenger that would fain lift men up from their small
                            and sluggish ways of living I I have seen it crush all the religion out of a soul that
                            otherwise might have been religious. I have seen conversions which were nothing but
                            conversions to a peculiar belief or dogma produce a change for the worse and not for the
                            better. I have seen it transform a natural hearty and buoyant life into an artificial,
                            sanctimonious socalled professor of religion. Instead of making the soul broader and larger,
                            more open and receptive to truth and goodness wherever found, theology narrows and darkens
                            the mind, and fosters only distrust and enmity toward anything not labeled with its own
                            little petty creed and profession. Theology again is skilful and cunning in its power to
                            counterfeit religion. It permits a person to live thirty, forty or fifty years under the
                            delusion that he is living a religious life, when there is nothing of religion about him.
                            Forty years of religion, what would that mean? Why, it would mean forty years of
                            uninterrupted growth and progress toward divinity. It would mean forty years every day of
                            which would make the heart more tender, loving and generous; the temper sweeter and more
                            subdued, the spirit quickened and alive to holier influences, the very countenance
                            transfigured with love to God and man. Why, I believe that if there was among us to-day one
                            single soul that for forty years had professed religion pure and undefiled that soul would
                            be fitted to the homage and worship of man as was Christ himself. We should flock around
                            that soul as did sinners of old around the Master. We should strive to gain one touch of his
                            garment, to hear on� gracious word from his lips, to catch one glimpse of his face. And from
                            that vision of a life made divine as from a vision of the Father we should turn to take up
                            our cross and follow in his footsteps. Why do we not see something like that as a result of
                            Christian discipleship? Why, because there has never yet been a life-time consecrated to
                            pure and undefiled religion. There have been lives consecrated to theology usurping the
                            sacred name of religion. It has been a belief, a dogma that through all those years has led
                            and governed the life. For that dry, hard doctrine they have lived and fought and contended
                            ; for that they have hated and denounced as heretics all those who did not agree with them;
                            on account of that belief they have congratulated themselves upon securing God's grace and
                            salvation; on account of that profession of the one true creed they have looked forward to
                            some sort of a heaven that awaits them hereafter. Theology has driven out religion, the
                            letter has driven out the spirit, the form has dried up the very fountains of life. And it
                            is only by. and by in that great day when all scales shall fall from the eyes and the
                                soul<pb n="140" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> shall stand clear and full before the eternal light, when it
                            shall be seen that God judges not by what a man believes but by what he is, it will then be
                            seen how utterly useless and contemptible is all the theology that the world contains in
                            comparison with one single spark of pure and undented religion.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Macdonald, L. B." TEIform="persName"/>Rev. L. B.

                                    among pupils of the "iron clad" one method school. It takes a great deal more than
                                    we find in vocal ''methods" to make a good singer, as every experienced teacher
                                    knows. The management of the breath, the attitude, gesture, pronunciation, the mouth
                                    generally most of all, and the thousand and various suggestions which a competent
                                    teacher finds it constantly necessary to give. But now what is understood as
                                    "expression" in singing, which may be called the most vital part of all; as without
                                    it singing is dead. If expression is spontaneous, so much the better, provided it is
                                    accompanied by good judgment and sense; as in the painting of a landscape we might
                                    make the skies green and the trees blue, an incongruity readily perceived. The
                                    experience of the writer leads him to believe that the practice of tasteful,
                                    classical sacred music, makes the best ground-work for true and genuine expression
                                    (which with some gifted persons comes almost intuitively.) Even children should
                                    learn to sing the best class of sacred music, and be taught to love it, as well as
                                    to avoid all merely "namby pamby" music, and especially songs of a "slangy" style,
                                    or with words of doubtful purity, as depraving to the taste and to the divine
                                    mission of music. Adoration and gratitude to Almighty God, tears for sin, sorrow for
                                    the suffering Savior, love for his unbounded and unmeasurable love to us are surely
                                    themes to draw forth our most soul-exciting emotions. Words are not brought to
                                    music, but music to words, to enhance, diversify and beautify their expression,
                                    therefore the words should be the first consideration. Good and tasteful ballads,
                                    also other compositions of merit, are of course available. I rather sympathize with
                                    those with words "kind, sweet and true." The canzonets of Haydn and many fine old
                                    English compositions make good help for expression. It is always best to use songs
                                    in one's own language in order to improve in expression, as you think and feel in
                                    it. When in a tongue you do not understand your attempts at expression are merely
                                    imitation, and meretricious. The Italian language is* easier and pleasanter for the
                                    voice than some others. The vocal methods of Garcio, Panseron Gavosscohe, Panofka,
                                    Damereuer, and Marchesi, are all good in themselves, but how to make a right use of
                                    them and not misuse them is an important matter.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Philadelphia musical journal" TEIform="index"/>Phil.

[Contributed by Elder G. B.
                                    Avery.]I was seventeen years old when I left the country store I had tended for
                                    three years, and came to Boston in search of a place. Anxious, of course, to appear
                                    to the best advantage, I spent an unusual amount of<pb n="141" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> time and
                                    solicitude upon my toilet, and when it was completed, I surveyed my reflection in
                                    the glass with no little satisfaction, glancing lastly and most approvingly upon a
                                    seal ring which embellished my little finger, and my cane, a very fine affair, which
                                    I purchased with direct reference to this occasion. My first day's experience was
                                    not encouraging; I traversed street after street�up on one side and down on the
                                    other�without success. I fancied, toward the last, the clerks all knew my business
                                    the moment I entered the door, and they winked ill-naturedly at my discomfiture as I
                                    passed out. But nature endowed me with a good degree of persistency, and the next
                                    day I started again. Toward noon I entered a store where an elderly gentleman stood
                                    talking with a lady by the door. I waited till the visitor had left, and then stated
                                    my errand. "No, sir," was the answer, given in a peculiarly crisp and decided
                                    manner. Possibly I looked the discouragement I began to feel; for he added, in a
                                    kindlier tone, "Are you good at taking a hint?" ;'I don't know," I answered, while
                                    my face flashed painfully. "What I wish to say is this," said he, smiling at my
                                    embarrassment; "if I were in want of a clerk, I would not engage a young man who
                                    came seeking employment with a flashy ring on his finger and swinging a fancy cane."
                                    For a moment, mortified vanity struggled against common sense, but sense gained the
                                    victory, and I replied�with rather a shaky voice, I am afiaid�"I'm very much obliged
                                    to you," and then beat a hasty retreat. As soon as I got out of sight, I slipped the
                                    ring into my pocket, and walking rapidly to the Worcester depot, I left the cane in
                                    charge of the baggage master "until called for." It is there now, for aught I know.
                                    At any rate I never called for it. That afternoon I obtained a situation with the
                                    firm of which I am now a partner. How much my unfortunate finery had injured my
                                    prospects the previous day I shall never know, but I never think of the old
                                    gentleman and his plain dealing, without feeling as I told him at the time, very
                                    much obliged to him.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Learning elicits the innate powers of the mind" TEIform="index"/>

                                    Nobody, therefore, liked to go in or out of it. One day I oiled its hinges, and it
                                    has been constantly used by everybody ever since." "Then you think I am like a

                            144. It may be said that Br. Peter has lived among Believers during a period of 82 yrs., as
                            his parents believed and united with the Society a short time before he was born. The writer
                            has been intimately acquainted with the deceased for about 54 years, and a more genial
                            fair-minded upright man he never saw. Years and years may take their silent flight across
                            the horizon of our Western Zion ere we shall look upon his like again. When I think of his
                            truly glorious career, I am filled with the aspiration of the rapt seer of old "Let me die
                            the deatli of the righteous and let my last end be like his." He has filled with honor and
                            unimpeachable integrity the highest and most sacred Offices of trust and responsibility for
                            years and years which were within the gift and patronage of the Church, and has uniformly
                            vacated the same when requested so to do, with the same cheerfulness and tranquility with
                            which he assumed them. His modesty was above all praise and. his kindness and humanity to
                            mankind and even all creatures susceptible to pain was simply unbounded. When asked if poor
                            and homeless persons should be lodged over night and fed, his uniform answer was, The Order,
                            and also Mother said, "You should not turn the poor and needy from your doors." When some
                            were about to sell to the world two faithful old horses, he sent them an indignant interdict
                            and stopped the sale. I heard him say he had care of cows for seven years, and had treated
                            them with care and tenderness in weaning the calves. It is safe to say that no one has ever
                            lived at Union Village who has enjoyed the esteem and confidence of all both inside and
                            outside of Zion far and rear and on all sides to a greater extent than good Bro. Peter. And
                            yet so altogether unassuming was he, that although acquainted with the Higher Mathematics
                            and Astronomy, equal to constructing Logarithms and calculating Eclipses, yet made so little
                            parade of the same that one would never discover it only by inquiring of him The solemn
                            inference from all which is, Let us all go and do likewise and we shall depart hence in

                                    wonderful book. For reasons best known to the early translators, great latitude was
                                    allowed. For instance the Hebrew "Elohirn" a plural proper name, in the first
                                    chapter of Genesis, is translated "God." Now the English word God, is but another
                                    form of the old Scandinavian Odin, from which eminent scholars claim it originated.
                                    Again in the second chapter of Genesis, the creating power "Yahveh"is rendered "Lord
                                    God;" a strictly correct but concise translation of which into English is "Will." In
                                    the religion of the Hebrews, Yahveh represented the external world impersonated as a
                                    wild, and not the personal God worshiped by the Christian churches of to-day. The
                                    Bible is as yet a sealed book, and will so remain so long as its interpretation is
                                    warped to cover some dogma. It undoubtedly contains unfathomed oceans of truth,
                                    which can only be sounded by translators of both spiritual and intellectual
