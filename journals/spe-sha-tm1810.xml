                            good from a nebulous globe, till it reaches a state, when plant and animal life is possible.
                            Turning to creations of a higher order, the moral and the divine, we find from* the
                            ''Burning Bush" on Mount Horeb, to the giving of the Law from that mountain, that every
                            intermediate step led to that event�to an Epoch, within which, an orderly, personal, and
                            social life became possible. All outside of said life, is heathenism. What are the
                            essentials of an orderly life? " Do no harm to yourself through lust. Do no harm to others."
                            In other words, keep hygienic and moral law. These two requirements run through the Old
                            Testament. The glories of the " Latter Day" of which the prophets sung, were predicated on
                            the actualization in human life and conduct, of but these two ideas. They constituted the
                            "First Dispensation." There had been minor revelations, but this was the most inclusive. It
                            embodied the whole circle of duties incumbent on the Adamic man. It left not a single human
                            animal emotion unregulated. Hence the "Law was a schoolmaster," teaching the elements of
                            self-denial. The second step, or Dispensation, was the Revelation of the Christ in Jesus of
                            J^azareth�of a divine human life ! constituting him the son of man, and the Sou of God�the
                            first born of many brethren. Here the inquiry arises, Where is the first born of many
                            sisters? The importance of the "First Dispensation"�the revelation of a true hygienic, and
                            moral life, specifically defined, has not yet been duly estimated, nor duly opened in our
                            day. The present conditions of society, show it to be wholly out of joint. Those who are the
                            most industrious, and the main creators of wealth, are poor, ill-housed and fed. On the
                            other hand, those who do the least for themselves, and for society, are the best provided
                            for. Hygienieally, the rich and the poor, oppress themselves with bodily ailments. Humanity
                            groans under ages of wrong living, and wrong-doing. To correct and prevent the existence of
                            these evils the First Dispensation was given. Its requirements were brief and definite.
                            Hygienieally, " Do not eat of the product of the dairy, and animal foods at the same meal."
                                Avoid<pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> animal fats, and the flesh of ravenous beasts. Be clean in
                            person, and in surroundings ; cover up, or burn every unclean thing. Morally, be just and
                            kind. In the fullness of the Third Dispensation, all animal foods will disappear, the divine
                            man and woman, will not kill and eat; but will be at peace with the beasts of the field.
                            Morally, a just form of social life was given. Every family had access to land�to the
                            elements of subsistence. Hence no Jew was under the necessity, " To beg a fellow worm To
                            give him leave to toil, " As is largely the case to-day. Usury being forbidden, the rich Jew
                            had to get his last dollar, as he got his first, by labor. Rich men in heathen life�the
                            world at large ; their dollars, grow dollars of themselves, and the more of them they have,
                            the more of the products of human toil they can get without any personal exertion. Hence in
                            the Epoch of the "First Dispensation," human evils were reduced to their minimum. In heathen
                            life, men and women eat as they list, and diseases are multiplied unto them. Socially, a
                            similar course is pursued, and social troubles threaten society with destructive upheavals.
                            In all coming dispensations, not a jot of these essentials of the Law .should pass away.
                            Should the Alphabet pass away, where would literature be? The idea that we of heathen origin
                            and descent, can pass into, and remain in Christian life, and retain heathen habits,
                            personal and moral, is a mistake. To be purged from every thing that loveth, or maketh a
                            lie, is a great blessing. The fulfillment of all human duties are included in, "I and my
                            Father are one." All the relationships^ of life, hygienic, moral and divine, are included in
                            that affirmation. In this Oneness, all human troubles are obviated. The object of all the
                            Dispensations is? two-fold. First, '"to put an end to sin, and finish trausgressions."
                            ^ecoud, "to bring in everlasting righteousness." Jesus took the first step, and went to John
                            to be baptized as a righteous Jew. Here he presents himself as a keeper of hygienic, and of
                            moral law. Standing on this God given step, he was called to assume the Messiah^hip. To
                            manifest Angelic life ; aud to die to the Adamic, the lower emotional life, and to its
                            relationships ; and thus be enabled to lay the foundations of "the New Creation" �the divine
                            form of human life�the kingdom of heaven. The subjects of which, make it the business of
                            their lives to unfold the God-element in themselves and in humanity ; ever keeping in view,
                            that the lower life embraces the selfish, the sensual aud the devilish. Jesus, feeling the
                            great burden laid upon him of introducing heaven to men, and of manifesting in himself the
                            spirit of divine life�the Christ of the ages, retired to consider the solemn
                            responsibilities to be borne, and also to feel and endure the repuguance, the Adamic man and
                            woman has to die to self, to animal emotions, and to the ties of earthly relationships, and
                            to be tempted most searchingly in all points like unto his brethren whom he came to redeem.
                            Finally, the inquiry arose withiu him whether he would be obedient to the divine call.
                            First, to be baptized by fire, destroying within himself, not only the outgrowths of animal
                                emotions,<pb n="219" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> but the life also, from whence they spring. To be
                            unearthed�to be born again ! Second, thereby be prepared to be baptized by the Holy Spirit,
                            which creates all things anew. Resolving to be one with the Fathers, Jesus left the
                            wilderness and went home to Nazareth. Little did his family and the native villagers know
                            that upon that young man the spirit of God was poured without measure. He entered the
                            synagogue as was his wont, and opened his mission. "The spirit of the Lord is upon me,
                            because he hath anointed me to preach deliverance &amp;c." And said, "this day is this
                            scripture fulfilled." The eyes of his hearers were set upon him as he opened to them the way
                            of the "Higher Life," and of course, the hollowness of theirs. Then arose a storm of
                            feelings, and a clash of words. "Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother with us
                            ? Humph ! His friends and companions would not receive him; they became enraged, and led him
                            out to a steep place near which Nazareth stands, with the intent to throw him down headlong,
                            and put an end to him and his mission. He quietly walked away from the mob. A few days
                            afterwards, he uttered that memorable sermon�"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
                            see G-od. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God." "Bless
                            them that curse you. Pray for them which despitely use you" &amp;c. In Christ there is
                            no political dodging, no shirking of responsibilities. He goes unerringly to the work
                            allotted him. The leading emotion of his spirit, is to be beneficently useful. He cures the
                            sick, gives sight to the blind, and cleanses the leper. His fame goes abroad, the common
                            people hear him gladly. Herod desires to see him ; he does not stoop to gain his favor. A
                            ruler of note seeks an interview : he comes by night. Such words are uttered as never before
                            entered a ruler's ear. "Except ye be born agaiu"�be unearthed, "ye cannot enter the kingdom
                            of heaven." To the ruler, there is no change of attitude. The simple dignity of a son of God
                            is maintained. On entering his mission, Jesus drew upon himself the hostility of the
                            villagers of Nazareth, those with whom he had been on friendly terms. Their lower self-hoods
                            became stirred up with murderous intents. In the further fulfillment of his work, he also
                            met the hostility of the priestly class, and of the upper portion of Jewish society
                            generally. The same murderous spirit was found in them. He told the priests, as was his duty
                            ; "ye make the Law of God of none effect through your traditions." "Ye have taken away the
                            key of knowledge ; ye entered not in yourselves, nor suffered others to enter." That they
                            were whitewashed sepulchers, fair outside, but within, iull of rottenness. In his disciples,
                            he also found a murderous spirit. "Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil."
                            Another wanted fire to come down and consume his enemies. Two of them had no objections to
                            have choice seats in his kingdom. The spirit of who would be the greatest, had a place among
                            them as it has among men to-day. To destroy the works of the devil, it is necessary they
                            first be made manifest. The Jews were an intense people. Their priests, scribes and
                            pharisees were essentially no worse than the same class of men are to-day. The presence of
                            Jesus Christ<pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> stirred up, and brought to the surface, a life and its
                            emotions, common to us all. Showing plainly, that if we will stand on solid ground ; be able
                            to manifest God to one another, we have got to die to self, to lust, to revenge and to "�who
                            shall be the greatest." No halfway work will answer. There is no safety for any of us,
                            except in newness of spirit. He or she who in the least degree seeks to save their lower
                            selfhoods, seeks to save the whole of that life ; and most certainly will be unable to
                            unfold the life of God, and of heaven, the germs of which are within us. The failure of the
                            many attempts to live, having goods in common, are due to the action of said lower life. The
                            lower and higher lives, are organically antagonistic. Were it not so, it would be impossible
                            for a man to be able to choose to be a son of God. The dignity of manhood and womanhood, is
                            in bearing a daily cross. The extraordinary works, and the divine teachings of the man of
                            Nazareth ; his denunciations of the leaders of the Jewish people, and his driving the
                            traders from the Temple, fixed the eyes of all Israel upon him, and gave significance to all
                            he did or said. He emphatically declared, "My kingdom is not of this world." The kingdoms of
                            this world are the kingdoms of "the Beast;" they operate by force, therefore, his kingdom
                            must be that of the higher�the divine life in man. In that kingdom, "No work is menial,
                            and no state is low. No talk is ever heard of mine and thine, For everything is every body's
                            there." Such a state of things with Jesus Christ was not a flash of transcendental ideas
                            from some "Summer School of Philosophy," but an even daily life. With his disciples he lived
                            in common, and personally cared for them. Hence he was able to say, "Blessed are your eyes
                            for they see, and your ears for they hear." &amp;c. As the labors of Jesus Christ were
                            drawing to a close, he reviewed them saying, "I have finished the work my Father hath given
                            me to do." Without a trace of ill-feeling towards those who sought to entrap and destroy
                            him; he exclaimed, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem ! how often would I have gathered thy children
                            together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! " Here we
                            find in Jesus the Christ, the express image of the Father�a divine man, the first-born of
                            many Brethren, the First Appearance of Christ on our planet. The inquiry arises, where is
                            the first-born of many Sisters?�the first Divine Woman. Has She yet appeared? Let us look
                            for Her. "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nest-, but the Son of Man hath
                            not whert to lay his head." In the nature of things, his work was introductory, and
                            necessitated a Second Appearance, wherein that prophecy would be fulfilled; My people shall
                            dwell in sure habitations, and in quiet resting places. And also the prayer, "Give us this
                            day our daily bread." &amp;c. The Revelation of the Christ in woman, will fulfill that
                            prophecy, and answer that prayer. In the homes created by Ann Lee, that prophecy, and all
                            the essentials of that prayer are answered. Deliverance from temptation. Trespasses are
                            forgiven, and daily bread is equally supplied to all. In Her, and in her Institu-<pb n="221" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> tions, is thy Revelation of the Second Appearance of Christ, the first-born of
                            many Sisters. As such, She stands the Mother, as does Jesus Christ, the Father of the New

                            Mother-hood in Deity. It is the woman, not the man, who organizes human homes. Christ was
                            despised and rejected of men�the stone the builders rejected. Yet he, through faithfulness
                            is to-day the head of the corner. The builders in our day, reject Ann Lee with contempt. Yet
                            she through faithfulness in bearing a full cross against all the emotions of her lower
                            self-hood, as did Jesus, is to-day, the cap-stone of the highest form of social life on this
                            earth. "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit saith the Lord," has she brought forth
                            the cap-stone of the New Creation. All who are able, may say, "Grace, Grace unto it." In Ann
                            Lee there is no myth. All women may be divine as she is. The noblest of minds will yet do
                            her justice. Before those who know her, she stands " The Avoman clothed with the Sun"�divine
                            light. "A crown of twelve stars upon her head"�the Christian virtues. "The moon under her
                            feet"�all secondary things, the philosophies of earth, and all man-made systems in abeyance.

                            of creation, who can fail to recognize the gifts of a be � neficent Creator? And who can
                            fail to be admonished when considering how unfavorably compare the conditions of human
                            society, intended as the crowning of all God's handiwork? Nothing is left unmarred which
                            mankind has power to molest. But this will not always be. Humanity has made steady advance,
                            and will continue to progress to still higher summits of righteousness. Mighty earthquakes
                            will shake to their foundations, the now existing structures of society. The black impending
                            clouds of conflict, and the tremendous agitation of the elements which is now being felt
                            over the whole civilized world, are but premonitions oi' those upheavals and overturnings,
                            which must be realized before governments can be so organized as to cause the land to become
                            birthright iuheritance to every human being, and to annihilate the custom of usury, and
                            render all monopolies impossible. The acknowledgement of a God is the central idea of all
                            government, and before these changes can be wrought, the Motherhood in D^ity must be more
                            generally recognized ; then, as man has long sought to frame earthly institutions on his
                            idea of an exclusively masculine God, so, the dual,�parental idea in the God-head, which so
                            readily appeals to both the intellect and affections, will bear a potent influence in the
                            formation of correct, civil governments, social and educational systems, in which woman<pb n="222" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> will act her noble part, co-operating with man, in the various offices
                            of Church and kState. But, for her to successfully attain and fill these positions, will
                            involve a thorough reconstruction of the educational systems for both males and females. The
                            causes of the terrible commotions by which society is being convulsed, are at once traceable
                            to that inborn sentimeut which asserts itself as never before ;�that "All men are created
                            free and equal;"�the innate love of liberty and justice which long has smouldered, now
                            bursting into flame, as the breezes astir from a higher world, find access to those who have
                            long dwelt in the dark caverns of ignorance and oppression. The warming sunbeams which fall
                            upon the frozen earth, unsealing her fountains, and quickening into growth the myriad forms
                            of life which weave the beauteous robes of spring, also bring the wild beasts from their
                            lairs, the serpents from their lurking places, and renew to activity all those lower forms
                            of life which are but expressions of corresponding, undeveloped and inharmonious conditions
                            in humanity, as are also the fierce havoc of the elements in earthquake, tornado, and other
                            merciless destruction by land and sea; and when, after a long period of seeming inertia, the
                            finger of an all-wise Providence points to the time on that dial-plate which marks the
                            progress of cycles, when the vernal spring of a new era shall gladden the earth, those rays
                            of celestial radiance which act upon the diviner nature in man, will also wake to life all
                            the lower antagonistic forces of his being. While present conditions of society fulfill
                            almost identically many of the ancient prophecies, to-day the over-arching sky is aglow with
                            inspiration which gleams through the rifts of the tempest clouds below. Brave prophet hearts
                            catch its gleams, and in their light behold the grand triumph of truth over error, which
                            shall evolve order from chaos in the establishment of a universal, international government
                            based upon the inherent rights of man, which will secure to every individual, male and
                            fema'e, just representation and recompense for toil. Thus will the whole fabric of society
                            be reconstructed. Civil law will no longer protect capital and tax-labor, nor the idler
                            gi'ow richer while the honest toiler is excluded from the means of existence by the
                            wonderful achievements of science, in labor-saving machinery. None will need suffer from
                            over-work or from the want of interesting aud rational occupation. Inventors, after being
                            liberally rewarded by the government, will see the benefits of their discoveries and
                            improvements redound to the advancement of humanity ; and, like the postal system, the
                            telegraph, telephone, and all public conveyance by land and sea, will be controlled by a
                            government of the people and for the people,�purely democratic. Conditions will then be in
                            every way more favorable to the manifestation of the higher sentiments in humanity, and a
                            much larger proportion than at present, will be ripened for the harvest sickle of the
                            Resurrection Order, removing the necessity for war, famine and pestilence, and unmentionable
                            evils now tolerated for the purpose of regulating population. Therefore, the wild confusion
                            and disintegration so wide spread among all classes and phases of society, rather than
                            discouraging, are the most assuring to-<pb n="223" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> kens that the "Spirit of the

                            Beloyed Ministry :�Sweet, balmy, beautiful spring has come. All the spring birds are here
                            and make the air vocal with the music of grateful praises. We have kept the Blue Jay, the
                            Wren, the Bluebird, the Crow, the Yellow-Hammer, the Buzzard, the Robin, the Mocking-bird,
                            the Dove and some others, with us all winter, but their little pipes were occasionally
                            frozen, or so chilled, that we had no music outside, only the howling winds through the tops
                            of the pinetrees. Now mild spring is clothing nature in her vernal dress and outside of the
                            doings of man, all is "charming, sweet and lovely." Happy birds, happy all things which
                            violate not the laws of God. With these ideas floating through my mind, I try to poise
                            myself sufficiently to answer your most beautiful, excellent and welcome letter which
                            arrived safely. What a miracle it was that it got through so soon. We have had no mail for
                            so long, some good spirit must have induced the Post-master at Bowling Green to send it
                            down. It met both our wants and feelings, but you almost made us envy you in your quiet,
                            happy retreat, blest with the spirit power and gift of God. We have no mails yet, from want
                            of agreement between the P. O. Department and the agents of the railroad, but we can get a
                            letter sent by taking it to Bowling Green a distance of fifteen miles. How I should be
                            pleased if I could continue my letter t*ud wind up as you have done on some pleasing and
                            encouraging theme; some pleasant edifyiug topic. Alas! this is denied me. The New Year has
                            rolled in with the Western Hemisphere baptized in blood and the surging waves pass and
                            repass alternately over our otherwise peaceful domain. Soldiers ^lad in the habiliments and
                            paraphernalia of war, continually pass throng]) our streets in companips of from 5 to 500 at
                            a time. Some exciting scene is continually transpiring in our immediate vicinity, as the
                            familiar phrase goes, "a little blood letting in a legal way," or arson, robbery or murder.
                            How would you feel, to have a company of soldiers quartered on your premises to protect you,
                            and then say, you feel glad that they are with you? This nearly approaches our present case.
                            About the time you would see the whirling, lurid flames licking up buildings and devouring
                            property on your borders, it would almost cause some to pray, "Lord send us protection by
                            the hand of whomsoever thou wilt." You have doubtless seen a notice in the papers of the
                            burning of our depot three fourths of a mile south-west of our Village with its stores of
                            grain. The corn burned brightly and cast a glare of light on our buildings for twenty four
                            hours after the torch was applied. On being informed that the guerrillas had fired our
                            depot, and not having, at this time, the fear of man before, my eyes, I with another brother
                            hastened to the scene. We found two young men there who had been detained and sworn, at the
                            peril of their lives, to do nothing<pb n="224" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> towards extinguishing the flames.
                            The young men were true to their oaths, and did nothing, though both were interested, as
                            their fathers had property there. We found the depot in flames, and three government cars on
                            the switch, loaded with stores also burning ; dry rails burning on the cow pit of the main
                            track. Our first business was to destroy the fire here so the train could pass up to Bowling
                            Green. This we soon succeeded in doing. Three large rail pens of corn, a few rods from the
                            depot, we also saved by throwing water on them. By this time a good many neighbors had
                            arrived and a few more Brethren ventured out. We pushed the burning cars apart and saved one
                            of them with its cargo of wheat, and with considerable labor, saved the main track of the
                            railroad. We have some buildings on the north of the railroad. The Confederates broke in one
                            of the windows when the captain asked the young men, "To whom do those buildings belong?"
                            They said, " The Shakers." He remarked, "I do not wish to destroy the Shakers' property,"
                            and forbid their being burned. He and his company, leisurely rode away, and were just out of
                            sight when we arrived at the fire. Since then, they have probably learned through the papers
                            that the Shakers aided in saving government store and property. Since the burning of our
                            djpot, the Confederates have burned twenty one cars freighted with mules, mostly, at
                            Woodburn eight miles south-east from here, driving off a part of them and burning some in
                            the cars. A short time since they robbed a near neighbor of ours of six hundred dollars.
                            Some six or eight surrounded his house, two went in with a pistol in each hand and made
                            Barnett, the neighbor, get out of bed and get the money for them. After they had got all
                            they could, they asked Baruett if there was a rope about the house that would answer to hang
                            him with? He said he thought there was one that would answer. They did not tarry for this
                            purpose but made good their escape with their booty. One or two of the robbers were caught
                            and one killed in trying to make his escape, but no money obtained from them. A sad casualty
                            befell some scouting Federals, three or four miles south-west of us. Capt. Owen, with a
                            small party, called at the house of a Confederate and while they were there, an unknown
                            individual, informed Capt. Johnson, (also Federal) that there was a company of Confederates
                            at the house aforesaid, whereupon, Johnson and party made a dash upon the house, shooting
                            and killing Capt. Owen and wounding one of his men before the mistake was discovered. So you
                            see we are surrounded, environed on all sides by blood and fire, as it were on the verge of
                            a volcano, which may momentarily be expected to give way. To all human appearance, some
                            future sufferings await us. What its shape may be, we can fear, but cannot conjecture.
                            Trusting in God, we calmly wait its development, hoping, nay believing, that we shall not
                            have to suffer more than we are able to bear, or than what will be for our ultimate good. As
                            it is now some demoralization attends us, and as the prayers of the righteous avail much, we
                            trust you will not fail to remember us when you make your offerings, sometimes, in the holy
                            sanctuary. We thank you from our hearts for the prayers already offered in our behalf, and
                            for your love and bless-<pb n="225" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> ing. You have by inspiration, or otherwise
                            got into the merits, or rather the comprehension of my case. You have depicted it truly. It
                            is a wonder how you could do it so well without absolute experience. There is nothing that
                            can break and obliterate the ties of early lite. Here were all my joys and sorrows until I
                            reached the top of the hill of life or very nearly so. At the same time there is a tearing
                            up and a planting process to pass through. Oue hardly knows, until they have the trial, that
                            they could be in love with poor hills, knobs, stones, trees, broeks, ponds, and other
                            natural things, let alone our own kind. Later things do not take quite so deep a hold ou the
                            affections. The one is vernal, the other autumnal and last of all comes hoary winter. One is
                            strawberry time with sweet singing birds, purling brooks, green fields, sweet-scented
                            flowers, aud spicy groves ; the other L-&gt; nutting time, autumnal leaves, hallowed breezes,
                            and lastly grave-yards. Then again a brighter era beyond, for all who are faithful, but a
                            dismal region of woe for the unfaithful. It is some singular to hear of a mild winter with
                            the mercury at fifteen degrees below zero. Our winter has not been so mild as the previous
                            one. We have had two extraordinary snow storms. One fell to the depth of eleven inches and
                            it was eight or nine days before it all disappeared. One very cold night the mercury fell to
                            zero. So we were enabled to get some snow-ice nearly three inches thick. The other deep snow
                            was about five inches. Otherwise we have had mild weather, and very bad, yea shockingly bad
                            roads of slush and mud. How we all did wish Br. David Parker had made his way through the
                            lines to this place. Could I only have known when he would reach Louisville I could have
                            piloted him down here, aud back again. It seems his sainted presence at the city of Babel
                            did not have the effect of preventing the passage (if the papers are to be credited) of a
                            conscription act including Shakers aud Quakers. The New York Herald now calls upon the
                            Shakers, to " right about face." Shoulder Arms ! or else pay three hundred dollars for
                            substitute. I think some little difficulty will attend the carrying this into effective
                            operation. You hope we have passed the liugeriug deatli to which we have been subjected. I
                            have still thought our greatest trials and sufferings were yet future. The carrying out of
                            what is termed the emancipation proclamation will create an effervescence in Ky., the like
                            of which has not been seen, but we say, the Lord's will be done though the heavens fall.

Priestcraft, superstition and sectarian dogmas have in a
                            great measure lost their power over the minds of intelligent people. They want to see an
                            exemplary, pure and holy life. They are getting disgusted with preaching. They begin to
                            believe more in good works, than an outward profession of religion. If there is only "Oue
                            Lord, one faith and one baptism," it must be admitted, that those who live the most godly,
                            righteous and upright lives are truly in possession of it; for " not every one<pb n="226" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he
                            that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven," Matt, vii., 21, and every one shall be
                            judged and receive according to his works, not to what he believes. Therefore it is so
                            difficult to convert the Hindoos and Chinese to the Christian religion. They canuot see it,
                            that by the cruel death of one man all transgressors could be cleared from the penalty of
                            sis by merelv believing on him. They expect a compensation or reward to the good and
                            righteous, and a retribution, remorse and punishment to the wicked and evil doer. The
                            Buddhists number about 400 millions ; one third of the inhabitants of the earth. What a
                            libel to a just and impartial God, to consign them all to eternal perdition, considering
                            that he is "No respecter of persons ; but in every nation, he tliatfeareth him and worketh
                            righteousness is accepted with Him." Every rational person must come to the conclusion, that
                            all those who were not favored with Christ's teachings on earth will have an offer of them
                            in the spirit world, aud they have to accept or reject them, the same as those in this
                            mundane sphere. The Shakers do not believe in a great outward show of sanctity, much
                            preaching aud boasting, not in the wind, earthquake and fire, but in the still small voice.
                            1 Kiugs, xix., 11. They consider themselves to be�the little flock, whose Father's good
                            pleasure it was to give them the kingdom. Luke,xii., 32. They glory in the cross of Christ,
                            by which the world is crucified to them, and they to the world. Gal. vi., 14. They believe
                            that nothing short of a life of strict chasti'y, humiliation, self-denial, love and charity,
                            will ever save them. The Shakers are established in the United States more than 100 [years,
                            and wherever they have settlements, or Societies, those who are acquainted with them,
                            generally honor and respect them very much, on account of their honesty, uprightness,
                            sobriety and fair dealings, charity and benevolence. If the tree is known by its fruit, and
                            the true people of God by their works, all intelligent men and women must come to the
                            conclusion, that the � Shakers are not so much in the dark, and out of the way as they
                            formerly thought they were, and many who despised them, have now become their best friends
                            and well-wishers ; but, like Nicodemus, for fear of losing their great name and standing in
                            the world do not openly acknowledge it.

                            whose voice was music to the ear, Whose raiment was like angels', white and clear. A
                            beauteous circle met my wondering eyes, But soon a sound, far distant, seemed to rise, And
                            ere I knew, I heard a deep-toned bell, And loudly, clearly, did its message swell. One word
                            it spoke�but one�yet awful, sweet! The heavenly courts intoned its import deep. "Watch,"
                            chimed the bell, the message seemed for me "Watch," for ye know not when thy time will be.
                            It was the heavenly time-piece, I was told, Striking the hour of one, with tongue of gold, I
                            hid the solemn watchword in my heart, And pledged to God it never should depart. Time passed
                            away, and soon an hour rolled by, Then from the bell-tower, O so tenderly, The Savior's
                            words, a couplet precious, came, 'Twas "Follow Me! " it rang in measures plain. Once more
                            the message of the bell I heard, Once more my soul by loving music stirred; This time, the
                            hour of three was softly chimed, And from it came the words of old, sublime :<pb n="227" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> "Faith, Hope, Charity,"it seemed to say, And angel voices echoed far away,
                            "But greatest, and the hest of all the three,� The fair and lovely grace of Charity." The d-
                            earn has gone!�but ah! those tones remain, In memory's golden casket graven plain, Those
                            lessons three, are traced with "finest gold," In deeds of righteousness their worth unfold.
                            Had I remained until the close of day, I might have learned what more the bell would say,
                            "Sufficient for the day," the lessons three, And pure the Gospel truth they brought to me.

                            doubt give pleasure to many of our readers. Ed.] HAND LABOR INTRODUCED INTO THE MOST WEALTHY
                            GENTILE CHURCH. When Paul came to Corinth he was impressed by the Holy Spirit to tarry
                            there, sow the seed of faith and reap a harvest of souls in rudimental Church Order. It was
                            not his first business to seek out some palace of ease in some Metropolitan Hotel, but true
                            to his Christian faith and instruction, he sought out some humble workshop where he could
                            make arrangement to labor with his hands. "When Paul came to Corinth, he found a certain Jew
                            named Aquila with his wife Priscilla and he came to them ; and because he was of the same
                            craft he abode with them and worked, for by their occupation they were tent makers." Paul
                            had now entered his field of labor right, "hands to work and heart to God." He stood up like
                            a man on praying ground for others. He toiled through the labors of the week, "and he
                            reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day;" and being in the way the Lord met him. He was
                            miraculously delivered from persecution. "Crlspus the chief Ruler of the synagogue with all
                            his house, aud many of the Corinthians hearing believed aud were baptized." Paul was now
                            proving the blessing of his own obedience. The promises which the Holy Spirit had made to
                            him were rapidly fulfilling. He had been uncertain about gathering souls in this rich,
                            wicked city, but all was suddenly made plain to his understanding. For, "then spoke the Lord
                            to Paul in the night by a vision, be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace, for I am
                            with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee. for I have much people in this city."
                            His field of labor now widened to that degree that "He continued there a year and six months
                            teaching the word of God among them." Acts xviii., 11. By following strictly the example and
                            testimony of Jesus and working hand labor faithfully into his theological instructions, Paul
                            placed his Christian character in such a light that all were bound to respect it. He stood
                            independent in uprightness before the Church and was clothed with great power among his
                            followers. Paul saw that the Corinthians were worldly and wealthy, and were sunk deeply in
                            the prevailing sins of the Gentiles. This city is said to have been the richest and most
                            corrupt of any at that age where the gospel was preached, in that quarter of the world.
                            Therefore he never compromised his religious principles with their riches. He walked among
                            them with more than usual circumspection, self-denial and charity. As the Apostle feared God
                            so he<pb n="228" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> seems to have feared to become entangled with Corinthian gold
                            and silver, for when his spiritual labors became so great that his own hands failed to
                            supply his wants he arranged matters in the following order. He would receive no kind of aid
                            from that church, but nought h 'lp from another quarter, as appears from the following : On
                            a certain occasion he said to them, "When I was present with you and wanted I was chargeable
                            to no man : for that which was lacking to me, the brethren which came from Macedonia
                            supplied." 2 Cor. xx., 9. When the rich man came to Jesus inquiring, "What shall I do that I
                            may inherit eternal life?" Mark, x., 17. He pointed him to his own law and found he had
                            observed it strictly. Jesus saw his condition and loved him. He then said, "�Go thy way,
                            sell what thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come
                            take up thy cross and follow me ; and he went away grieved for he had great possessions."
                            Jesus here invited him to come down from a life of wealth and ease to a life of dependence
                            and labor. He seized this occasion when the rich man went away sorrowing, to teach the
                            twelve what they and we have long since proved. Jesus said, "how hardly shall they that have
                            riches enter into the kingdom of God." And the disciples were astonished asking who then can
                            be saved? "But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children how hard it is for them
                            that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God." 23, 24. As they advanced with their
                            ministry they were taught by Ananias, his wife and others, thoroughly, the meaning of his
                            word. They saw that none could be fully consecrated who held on to riches ; or come into
                            gospel equality and be saved from ease and indulgence who trust in gold and silver. Paul
                            clearly saw all this and washed his hands clean from the riches of the Corinthians. ACTIVITY
                            IN BUSINESS RECOMMENDED AS A FOUNDATION FOR GOSPEL CHARITY. Paul's theologj- on labor was
                            universal. He wrote to the Roman brotherhood recommending them to untiring zeal in business,
                            clothed with the authority of the word of God. As a father he thus warned them, "Be kindly
                            affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another ; not
                            slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Distributing to the necessity of
                            saints, given to hospitality." Rom. xii., 10, 11, 18. Paul here places activity in business
                            before fervency of spirit in the service of God, the same as Mother Ann placed hands to work
                            before hearts to God. He well understood then, what we as well understand now, that a slack,
                            indolent being in temporal labors, is the last man that can be roused up to fervency of
                            spirit in serving God. Paul carries the idea clear that he who will not labor for his own
                            bread, when able, will never labor for the true bread that cometh down from heaven ; simply
                            because Christ taught his first little flock that hand labor to supply our earthly wants is
                            a foundation gift in serving God. But the beauty of this passage lies in showing the need of
                            honest, faithful Christian diligence in raising the means to supply the necessities of the
                            saints and to extend hospitality to strangers. Can the tyrant who grasps the toil of the
                            bond-man do this ? Can the stock gambler or crafty speculator perform this Christ-like
                            liberality? He<pb n="229" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> who steals, and with prodigality gives the labors of
                            another, or scatters with a liberal hand what is wrung from the down-trodden, the widow and
                            the fatherless, performs no charity iu the sight of heaven. But whoever bestowed liberal
                            donations from the fruits of his own honest labor that did not find it was more blessed to
                            give than it ever was to receive? The fruits of such liberality is beautifully expressed by
                            Job, '-When I went out to the gate through the city, the young men saw me and hid themselves
                            ; and the aged arose and stood up. The princes refrained talking, the nobles held their
                            peace. When the ear heard me it blessed me, and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me.
                            Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless and him that had none to help
                            him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and 1 caused the widow's
                            heart to sing for joy." Job xxix., 7, 13. Let calamity or great losses overtake such friends
                            of humanity and they will feel like the kind-hearted old philosopher who when reduced to
                            poverty wept and said, "I thank God I have saved all I have given to the needy." A child can
                            see that honest industry underlies all Christian generosity and liberality. It is the solid
                            basis on which it rests. It stands l:ke a great balance wheel to carry steadily and
                            powerfully all Christian charities that extend out from spirits rendered kind-hearted and
                            liberal by the spirit of God. THE GENTILE CHURCHES COMMANDED TO SECURE MEANS BY LABOR TO
                            STAND INDEPENDENT OF THOSE WITHOUT AND TO SECURE ALL EARTHLY COMFORTS. VTheu Paul wrote to
                            the Thessalonians, his testimony, respecting the daily toils and business of life was as
                            simple as the teaching of Mother Ann. He says, "We beseech you Brethren that ye increase
                            more and more. And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own busiuess, and to work with
                            your own hands as we commanded you. That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without,
                            and that ye nay have lack of nothing." 1 Thess. iv.. 11. 12. Paul exhorts his followers '.o
                            labor diligently in some honest employment and gather means to enable them to stand free and
                            out of debt with the world. That they must do a cash business. The simple truth here
                            preached by Paul is part of the very testimony brought out by Mother Ann. She said, "Do not
                            over-reach in trade, right all wrongs, pay all just debts." Paul said work with your own
                            hands that by a life of honest industry you may abound iu plenty and lack nothing. While
                            Mother Ann said, "By industry and frugality you will be blessed in your basket and in your
                            store." Jesus said to the Jews, ''The word that I have spoken the same shall judge him ia
                            the last day." The Elders brought out the same truths uttered by Jesus and the Christian
                            teachers under him eighteen centuries ago. They are all embodied in this testimony for the
                            judgment of the world. Now we make excellent theology out of the virgin life, the confession
                            of sin and united inheritance, as taught by them, then why not make as good theology out of
                            hand labor on which all these principles rest, and which cannot exist without it. All who
                            follow out strictly the rule of life here practiced and laid down by Jesus and his first
                            followers find themselves under the blessing of<pb n="230" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> their own obedience.
                            All who deviate soon find themselves under the curse of their own disobedience. They find
                            that God has ordained that an earthly inheritance or the honest labors of the saints once
                            consecrated to God must never again coin under the power of the world or the worldly minded,
                            to bring the true heirs of the kingdom into worldly bondage. paul's closing scene with some
                            of the gentile churches. The time finally arrived when Paul was to take his last farewell on
                            earth of the Elders and people of certain of the Gentile Churches. He was followed by many
                            leading Elders and others to a certain landing-place, where he was to take passage and bid
                            them a last adieu. In this interesting, closing scene, "He sent to Ephesus and called the
                            Elders of the Church." Acts xx., 17. These men stood as pillars to the Churches they
                            represented. They had seen Paul from the beginning of his labors in those quarters. They
                            honored him as their father in God. They were witnesses of his untiring zeal, his patience
                            in persecution, endurance in trials among the false-hearted, and his long-suffering among
                            the weaker members of his flock. He met them at a celebrated ancient city called Miletus. It
                            had been the birthplace of several ancient eminent men. It lay about twelve or fifteen
                            leagues from Ephesus. Here in solemn counsel and many warnings he stated the great
                            probability that after his return to Jerusalem "They would see his face no more." Acts xx.,
                            25. This upright leader was in the very state to present to his gospel heirs the spiritual
                            light and his fields of labor. For, he said, "I have coveted no man's silver or gold or
                            apparel. Ye yourselves know tb 1 these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them
                            that were with me. I have showed you all things how that sojaboring ye ought to support the
                            weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said it is more blessed to give
                            than to receive." 33 to 35. Paul was in an enviable condition to balance accounts with these
                            Gentile brethren. It could be said of him that he committed to them the gospel without money
                            0" price. When they saw him dividing equally his slender earnings with those who sojourned
                            with him, like Jesus with the twelve, he taught by example as well as precept that the
                            family of Christ was and is one, and that the strong should bear the infirmities of the
                            weak. Paul's honorable poverty, and his hand labor beautifully blended with his gospel life
                            and ministry, clothed him in raiment "clean and white." His character will shine through all
                            ages as a star rising upward toward the new heavens of exceeding brightness. If any man in
                            early ages could stand erect and present a Christ-like specimen of self-denial and
                            consecration and feel the dignity, it was Paul at Miletus in this closing scene with his
                            Gentile brethren. How sacred must have been the spot where this good old, well-tried Apostle
                            kneeled for the last time with his brethren ? How tender and solemn must have been their
                            parting with this man of God when "They all wept sore and fell on Paul's neck and kissed
                            him. Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no
                            more." Acts xx., 37, 38. Remembering his labors to plant the seed of faith, his labors to
                            sow peace in their churches, and his toils for Ms daily bread, this scene<pb n="231" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> would bring back to their recollection what he said : '-Though ye have ten
                            thousand instructors in Christ yet have ye not many Fathers." 1 Cor. iv., 15. Scenes like
                            this we have all witnessed when a true-hearted leader or member has been called suddenly
                            away. Their diligent toil associated with Christ-like virtues have so long proved the
                            sincerity of the absent one that like Paul's Gentile brethren we have sorrowed most of all
                            that we should see their faces uo more and should miss their bright examples. The honorable
                            course of Paul in matters spiritual and temporal did much for (he up-building of Christ's
                            kingdom in his period. The primitive church laid a foundation in their age for us ; and the
                            witnesses brought down that spirit through racks and fiery torture to us. But to us is
                            entrusted the golden opportunity to do far more. A Believer consecrates a whole life of the
                            most disinterested labor spiritually and temporally for himself his Brethren and Sisters and
                            for the gospel cause. However few may be our numbers at times ; however dark the period
                            through which we pass : however the new heaven and earth may seem to be remodeled, our
                            labors will count and our works will be known. What the primitive Church did scatter in
                            individual capacity stands to their account. What we do in collective order as one joint
                            body of Christ however severe the trial will stand through eternity. Your Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Leonard, William" TEIform="persName"/>Wm.

                            regulated family of Believers should have a fixed hour set on the Lord's day to gather
                            together the children, youth, and all others of the family, who may wish to attend a Bible
                            School where the Scriptures may be taught in simplicity and purity ; that these may ever be
                            as a lamp to their feet, guiding them in the way of life and bringing out God's plan of
                            salvation to all mankind. Indeed, is this not our duty, "To train up a child in the way he
                            should go :" and how can we do so without God's word for our guide ? Our interest should be
                            for the future of Zion and the Gospel, as given to us by our Fathers and Mothers. And I
                            trust every Brother and Sister, who is truly such in the Gospel, will come up to this
                            important work, and let us pray and labor and look for good to come out of such, and not get
                            off behind self and look for evil to come. Surely then, there must be evil in the heart and
                            no love for God's word to prosper among his people ; and wheu we come together let us
                            remember here is an assembly of persons not so hardened iu transgressions as to make the
                            effort put forth, fruitless. They are here to be taught, sincerity, confidence and love. It
                            is the high and holy privilege of the teacher to stamp indelibly the glorious seal of God's
                            truth upon these waiting hearts. When a teacher with a proper sense of the importance of
                            this work sees before him a class of thinking, reasoning, immortal beings, and truly
                            realizes the relation which he sus-<pb n="232" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> tains to them and to God, he is
                            forced to exclaim with Paul, "Who is sufficient for these things?"-�and then rest only in
                            the God given assurance,�"My grace is sufficient for thee." True, prayerful preparation of
                            the heart is the only requisite for a successful teacher. Without this all else is in vain.
                            One whose soul is overflowing with God's love, will accomplish vastly more for the Gospel
                            than a score whose talents consist entirely of intellectual accomplishments. A great many
                            wellmeaning persons fail because they are not fully impressed with the fact that this is not
                            only laying the corner-stone, but the whole foundation of the grand and responsible v/ork.
                            It is not only for the future in the life of the pupil, but for the Gospel work. If they
                            desire with an ardent longing, to learn the great secret of leading souls to Christ, let
                            them remember the words spoken by our great Teacher, "He that abideth in me and I in him,

                            a hiding-place for Mother Ann. Many visitors to Shirley from the other Societies have sought
                            the opportunity thus to realize the trials of that day, and many is the memento of a
                            splinter of wood taken from the rough boards which form the interior of this lonely
                            apartment�not with superstitious reverence, but as loving memorials of the sufferings of
                            Mother and the Elders. The dimensions of the closet admit only of a sitting posture. It was
                            secured from observation by a bureau standing before it. In a manuscript collection of items
                            from the experience of the primitive Shakers I find the following taken from the lips of
                            Jemima Blanchard, i most devoted disciple of Mother. "At the time the mob, that whipped
                            Father James, was at Shirley, Mother sent for some of the Harvard people to come to her. I
                            went in company with several others on foot, (a distance of about six miles.) Soon after we
                            started we were joined by some Brethreu on horseback from N. EL, who were going to see
                            Mother. While on our way we were met by a messenger from M' ther, who said that none must go
                            but those who were willing to give up their lives. The men turned off another way, but the
                            company I was in went fearlessly on feeling that it would be a privilege to give up our
                            lives for Mother. We found the house densely surrounded by a mob, but we passed straight
                            through it, the mob giving way, it seemed involuntarily. We found Mother cheerful and
                            undismayed. Soon after the mob departed with the Elders, Mother said, w I feel that there
                            will be blood shed,' and having given us some bread and cheese, which we ate in great haste,
                            she said, �Now run home.' We started on the run and ran most of the way without feeling in
                            the least fatigued. When near home we were hailed by some young women, (not Shakers) who
                            were weeping. They said 'We are afraid they have killed your Elders.' The relief was
                            inexpressible on learning that it was not so ; but our hearts were still filled with grief
                            for the iuhuman abuse of Father James."<pb n="233" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mother's closet" TEIform="index"/> MOTHER'S CLOSET.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">And this is the place* which was Mother's dark prison, All one dreary night when

                                    the wilderness, glittering with dew. The history told me has oft been repeated, But
                                    now its impression is painfully mine; A dreadful imprisonment�though it defeated The

                                    suffocation, To such narrow limits consigned, for the night, The rioters
                                    threatening, with fierce indignation; It surely presents us a heart-chilling sight.
                                    We think with regret on the painful inaction; But dear was the life which they
                                    sought to protect; Yet have we not looked with undue satisfaction, On that
                                    self-possession which thus should direct? How different the mansion which she was

                                    voice was declaring, Good news of salvation, "glad tidings of joy." What manner of
                                    men with pretensions to honor Could this peaceful cottage the whole night surround;

                                    been,�not a few. The story I've heard as all parties have told it, (On both sides at
                                    least it is just to remark,) So painful the scene, should you chance to unfold it,
                                    You scarcely can draw the sad picture too dark, But let me forbear as we leave to
                                    the reader, The sad contemplation of good Elder James; The call was then made
                                    "William Lee the chief leader," And thus to the multitude Father proclaims : "I will
                                    not be bound to that tree like my brother, But kneel down and suffer what God lets
                                    you do," Which done, they commence, just the same as the other, And all were
                                    expecting the same would go through. The Brethren and Sisters were held by that
                                    party, For each claimed a preference in sharing the blows; Such ardent affection, so
                                    pure and so hearty, From true Christian feeling undoubtedly flows. Though faint from

                                    friend. "Not satisfied yet," says the Court-martial teacher, "Another such lesson
                                    your fashions will mend." This generous adventure throws all in commotion, The
                                    angels of mercy appear in the cloud, And now a young Sister with equal devotion,<pb n="234" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> Escapes at this moment the grasp of the crowd. On him, as the
                                    merciless blows are repeating, Her person she throws at the risk of her lifePermit
                                    me, to fancy the demons retreating, And leaving those men to continue the strife.
                                    She instantly meets, for this prompt interference, A blow in the face from that
                                    powerful arm; The blood gushes freely, which makes her appearance, The object of
                                    sudden and painful alarm. A voice from the crowd, and by Wisdom's direction, At this
                                    fearful moment is now heard to say, 'The man who is pledged for that woman's
                                    protection Will make you repent of the deeds of this day." Thus viewing the medium
                                    of vengeance so clearly, The man with the scourge is alarmed for the first, Or they
                                    might have finished their lives, very nearly, That noble young convert prevented the
                                    worst. Wherever this gospel is preached to the nations, This act a memorial shall be
                                    to her name;* While warriors, and heroes, and men of high station, Descend to

                                    sealing, Which must in the cause of humanity tell. Well might she rejoice at
                                    dispersing the riot, From these worthy Fathers averting the blowt; 'Twas her happy

                                    serenely declare. At close of this day of severe persecution, (A day and a night was
                                    their life in the deep,) They gather together, at this Institution, Recounting the
                                    scenes at which angels might weep. Says Mother, "Well, James, you were cruelly
                                    treated But you must forgive them who did you the wrong." "Forgive them, my God,"
                                    was the prayer he repeated When Mother resumes her melodious song. All join in the
                                    chorus of praise, for protection, To Mother extended in that fearful night; What
                                    spirit could give this pacific direction, To hearcs thus oppressed, without justice

                                    not at a loss, In all we discover the one thing essential, The power of salvation,

                            approval or vice versa. l'One coin out of a little," says St. Ambrose, ''is better than a
                            treasure, out of much." The narrative concern ing the dropping of the two mites into the
                            treasury of the Lord, is rendered doubly interesting by facts of equal importance connected
                            therewith. We learn from history that it occurred at the time of the Savior's last visit to
                            the Temple. Fora brief interval of rest and retirement he had sought the Court, known as the
                            Court oi the Women. In this Court were thirteen chests, each shaped like a trumpet,
                            broadening downward from the aperture. Into these were cast the contributions which helped
                            to furnish the Temple with its magnificent wealth. The multitude were dropping their gifts
                            into the treasury ; conspicuous among them was the wealthy class offering freely of their
                            abundance. Jesus with divine penetration comprehended the entire scene at a glance.
                            Following the wealthy train, came a poor woman, who, timidly advancing, dropped into the
                            Receiver two mites or prutahs, the smallest of coins. A prutah is a trifle less 'than half a
                            farthing. How sensitively she must have shrunk from giving so little among the rich who
                            could lavish their gold upon any desirable object; but the loving heart of the Savior, at
                            once recognized and blest the purely unselfish motive that prompted the offering of all that
                            she possessed. Like healing balm to the sorrow stricken spirit must have been the words from
                            one who never spoke in vain. "Of a<pb n="235" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> truth, I say unto you that this
                            poor widow hath cast in more than they all." Very brief the narrative ; four verses of
                            Scripture complete the entire story ; but how extended has been its power for good! How
                            valuable the lesson it presents to all, who would really imitate the Pattern, to value the
                            motive, rather than the greatness of the act performed. Canterbury, N.

                            the love of the merely worldly-minded. It must ever flow from fountains pure and clothe the

                            Christ should, above all others, show forth this likeness of the divine,�be ever ready to
                            forgive as we would be forgiven. Though we may suffer wrong we should not wrong ourselves by
                            any malice or hard feelings. "We must set aside all of selfish, personal trials, and seek to

                                increased in wisdom, and in favor with God and man." Baptized into the inspirational
                                spirit he became the anointed Savior. What is said of Jesus, in this respect, could be
                                said of no other man. There may have been wise men and good men, but they belonged to an
                                entirely different order, and while they built on the philosophy of a worldly mind for a
                                foundation, Jesus built on Truth. In this comes the crucial test of a Christian life. It
                                is one thing to speak or write of this divine excellence and quite another to walk as he
                                walked, and to consecrate our lives as he consecrated his life to the will of his
                                Heavenly Father. Mutilated as the Scriptures may have been at the hands of designing
                                religionists, there still remains so much that is pleasant to read, and profitable to
                                accept into the mind, that we sometimes wonder why the non-professors do not make it a
                                subject of greater interest The doctrines set forth, although having more or less of a
                                local reference, and in fact, belonging exclusively to the order for whom they were
                                published, yet they may be studied by all with great profit. The moral truths, as taught
                                in the Scriptures, are such as bear upon our lives at all times and under all
                                circumstances; while the more exalted exhortations of spirituality are what the world so
                                much need for its crucifixion of the lusts of the flesh and of the mind. We are not
                                surprised that many throw away the book. They do not know its value. Had they accepted
                                its admonitions in the spirit in which they were given, thanksgiving and praise might
                                have filled their souls. If those who hold that the Book is the inspired word of God,
                                the only rule of faith, remain ignorant of its teachings and fail to represent it in
                                their lives, it by no means follows that the Book is less valuable, any more than it
                                would make an unabridged Dictionary less valuable because it had fallen into the hands
                                of the simple-minded. It would seem that the work is not appreciated as it should be.
                                Because a few pseudo Christians have laid claim to it as a speciality, in favor of their
                                order of living, and because they are so skillful in their manipulations of the texts as
                                to make them change their meaning as often and as suddenly as does the chameleon his
                                color, this gives no evidence why those who seek for<pb n="237" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> light from on
                                high, and a comforting assurance of the presence of the Holy Spirit, snould not read its
                                inspirational word, enjoy it and make its life, their life, whether they are or are not
                                in fellowship with any church. Search the Scriptures, more particularly the teachings of
                                Jesus Christ. Compare your life with his life and learn of him to be meek and lowly in
                                heart. It is one of the easiest things to denounce or to prejudge that of which we have
                                only a very limited or no correct knowledge. The unspiritual, the indifferent and the
                                ignorant of mature years may allow themselves in all this, while the younger minds catch
                                the same strain and follow on to destruction. In our order, especially, the sayings of
                                Christ are used with an emphasis which is unmistakable, because we have chosen to be as
                                he was, separated from the world. We are well persuaded that serve two masters. "Ye God
                                and Mammon." In the effort that has been made by those who have assumed to be
                                Christians, and who still hold tenaciously to the Adamic order, we find a singular
                                combination of relationship. A forced attempt to amalgamate the spirit with the flesh.
                                Elements as marked in their separation as fire and water. The old relation, the vine of
                                the earth, which has passed from the garden of Eden to every habitable part of the globe
                                &gt; which has received its blessings and benedictions from kings, bishops and priests, is
                                at this time held at a discount and a new relationship is proclaimed. Sameness of flesh
                                and blood made Cain and Abel brothers ; one of the easiest forms of demonstration of a
                                fact that need be made. Marital deno man can cannot serve scent determined at ouce who
                                stood as father and mother, brother and sister. But in the new order, in the kingdom of
                                God upon earth, the relationship is to be tested by the spiritual teaching of Jesus,
                                "Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother and sister and mother." It
                                by no means argues less respect or less iuterest in the prosperity or happiness of
                                parents and kindred, but it stands as positive proof of 4he essential difference which
                                these orders should occupy in derstand the mind, that what It gives us to unis born
                                after the flesh, belongs to the rlesh, and that which is born of the spirit as clearly
                                belongs to the spirit. Jesus could have made no remark to the Jews, whose family
                                relations stood superlatively in their minds and whose tables of genealogy were traced
                                to a nicety through a long line of generations, that would have been more distasteful,
                                or more at variance with their religious views. It was a severe blow at their titled
                                right of being the sons of God through the iaheritance of the flesh. The woman who did
                                the will of God was his mother and the man who did the will of God was his brother. To
                                the Jews, a Canaanite, a Syrian or an Egyptian was as a dog; something to be shunned.
                                They were not permitted even to eat at the same table and to hate them or to exterminate
                                them was a commendable religious obligation. They could not believe that a Canaanite was
                                capable of doing the will of God. Possibly there may be at this late day, a little of
                                the old Jewish leaven in our veins. We can see dogs where we should see men and women.
                                We are interested that justice, in its full meas-<pb n="238" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> ure. should be
                                measured to those who do uot accept the truth as we see it. The pattern of
                                righteousness, however, will teach us the heavenly lesson of loving each other and of
                                doing good to all men</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our foes in the air" TEIform="index"/>OUR FOES IN THE AIR.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">It is a wonderful fact that the air we breathe contains foes as deadly and
                                        invisible as the malignant spirits with which ancient opinion peopled it. Most
                                        epidemics are due to these unseen enemies. To be sure, it is probable that the
                                        earth and organic bodies on the earth, and not the air, generate them. They are
                                        taken up as dust, and, being little heavier than air, are long suspended in it.
                                        They are known by the general name of microbes�microscopic forms of life. Only a
                                        few of the many classes of microbes are harmful, just as only a few of the
                                        millions of species of larger vegetable growth are poisonous. In 1833, an
                                        epidemic fever, characterized by great depression, inflammation of the bronchial
                                        tubes and lungs, and by an incessant cough, swept over the world from east to
                                        west. Its advent was sudden, and in most cases the person was well again in less
                                        than a fortnight. It was quite fatal, however, to the aged and weak. This was
                                        the famous influenza. The same malady has repeated its ravages �sometimes over
                                        extensive tracts of country, sometimes only locally�many times since the Middle
                                        Ages. If it is of microbic origin,� as is probable,�what inconceivable swarms of
                                        microbes must have filled the air! Of course, no precaution could avail, except
                                        the habitual maintenance of high health and good hygienic conditions. Malaria is
                                        due to microbes which reach their victims either from the air, by inhalation, or
                                        from drinking water which has absorbed them. Boil the water, avoid the night
                                        air, sleep in the higher rooms of the house and guard against all excesses.
                                        Typhoid fever is caused by microbes from the discharges of a previous patient
                                        which either have found access to drinking water, or have been taken up dried
                                        into the air. Microbes flourish in all kinds of moist filth. The chief safeguard
                                        is general cleanliness, the boiling of all suspected water, and ample
                                        ventilation and sunshine. Diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough and measles
                                        are due to microbes given off from the skin or breath of the patient. They
                                        either float in the air of the room, or become attached to the furniture, walls
                                        and bedding. Avoid infected rooms and persons. Attendants should keep their
                                        stomachs in an active condition with digestible food, but should not overload
                                        them. Most microbes are digested and rendered harmless by a vigorous stomach.
                                        The surest prophylactics�as preventives are called�are high health, cleanliness,
                                        abundance of air and sunshine, the boiling of water and milk, and the avoidance
                                        of whatever depresses the physical system�loss of sleep, protracted watching and
                                        all excesses, and cheerful courage. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Youth's companion" TEIform="index"/>Youth's Companion.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="True man" TEIform="index"/>A TRUE MAN.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">Oh! for a man that will stand up and say, I want to be good, honest, virtuous and

THE MANIFESTO.
FIFTY YEARS AT THE FRONT.
For nearly 50 years the recognized authority the world over on all agricultural
matters, always abreast of the times, and always spending lavishly for the best
talent and experience, the
American Agriculturist
begins 1888 with new contributors, now artists and new type, and the editorial staff.
which has made this Periodical a power in both hemispheres, reinforced with fresh blood
and brains, thereby combining the experience . ud erudition of years with the
vigor and freshness" of youth. The American Agriculturist keeps pace with the
growing interest in agriculture largely brought abou: through its teaching?, and
continues today, after absorbing twenty four other agricultur.il papers, to furnish
