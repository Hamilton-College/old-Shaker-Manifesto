For The Benefit of Those Who Advertise,
- - - - - - - - - - - - -?- - - - - - - - - - - - - -Fbanklin is a town of four thousand inhabitants,
situated eighteen miles from Concord on the line of
Northern Railroad and three miles from Tilton, on
the Boston, Concord &� Montreal Railroad. It is divided into two villages with two Post Offices, viz.
Franklin and Franklin Falls. The Pemigewasset
and Winmpiseogee rivers flow through the town, the
former dividing the two villages, and unite a short
distance below, forming   the far-famed Merrimack.
Many important manufacturing industries are located here, including one large woolen and two
hosiery mills. The Wir.nipiseogee Paper Co., run
two mills night and day, having a weekly pay roll
amounting to $2000. There are several pulp mills
and many other concerns that are brought here by
an excellent water power, furnishing employment
and making business active.
The surrounding towns include Tilton, Sanbornton, Hill, Andover, Salisbury, Boscawen, Northfield
Danbury. Small villages have grown up in nearly
all of these places, hut a majority of the inhabitants
are engaged in agricultural pursuits and Franklin
furnishes a ready market for farming products.
The Franklin Transcript is devoted particularly to the interests of local affairs, giving several columns each week of Franklin news, and employs
correspondents in all of the surrounding towns, who
give reports of events as they transpire in the different localities. A " Farm and Household " department contains much of interest to the farmers, many
contributing to it, and with state and general news
items it is quite a readable sheet. It is all printed at
the home office. Subscription price one dollar a
year. All correspondence relating to any business
connected with the paper will receive prompt attention.   Yours truly,
o.a. townk.

                            still with hope look up, While hands and feet their task obey; Eor well I know that all

                            life, as taught, and lived by him.<pb n="50" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>In recognition of the revelation to
                            Peter, of the fatherhood of God, and the Sonship of man, he replies, I say also unto thee,
                            that thou art, Peter, the Christ the Son of God etc. " True Saviors they may well be
                            called�All those who teach us how To save ourselves the quickest way, Stop sinning1, stop it
                            now. " From the consequences of sin�of violated law, there is do savior, mediator, no
                            vicarious cancellation. We are related to universal laws which cannot be broken, though we
                            may injure ourselves in the attempt; loss and suffering is the penalty. Knowledge and
                            obedience are the true saviors. Admonition, counsel, chastening of experience, and the torch
                            of an enlightened conscience are helps ; 'but salvation obtains only on ones own fidelity to
                            duty, to light and reason. Those who have ascended nearest the apex of human possibilities,
                            are saviors, inasmuch as they draw such as make all needful sacrifices, and bear a daily
                            cross against those passions and appetites which lead downward until they become fledged,
                            and the cross becomes wings on which to rise into superior pleasures. Happiness, joy,
                            heaven. Salvation rests not on the merits or authority of any one, it is patent to all. What
                            one has done another can do. We have a splendid example in the drviuely inspired, and heroic
                            Hebrew youth, of the angelic life, and true man ; the then, highest mortal standard of the
                            divine. But in no sense a celestial aborigine�an exotic transplanted to earth. Whatever
                            might have been his advantages of birth, he was a human mortal, like his brethren, and in
                            the same school of experience. "Was he a man like us? Ah.! let us try, if we, then, too, may
                            be such men as he." Dependence on pattern saints and saviors, has ever been an incubus on
                            human advancement. Orphan children clinging to the garments of their ancestors long ago
                            departed, hoping to extract life from what once covered the living, accepting embalmed
                            virtue for living bread, can never progress to manly stature, aggressive against the citadel
                            of error, pnd sin. They are yet eating manna with their fathers in the wilderness. They do
                            not carry the torch of truth in their own hands, and overcome the world, and reject its
                            substitutions by walking in the way the truth and the life. We cannot serve God, and Jesus,
                            in the way we can serve our fellow-beings. Our praises confer no benefit on them. But we can
                            stimulate and encourage our fellow-beings, and so by our influence and support help to save
                            those who will help themselves. We may practice sanctimonious foolishness in remembrance
                            that our worthy ancestors drove the wild beasts away, felled the forests, and went into
                            partnei*ship with the willing earth forthem^ans of subsistence. But this will not bring corn
                            to us, unless we fulfill our part of the contract. There are many saviors to-day, those who
                            have been raised up, and are drawing others up, bidding them take courage, and work for the
                            growth of their souls�the Christ within�yea, and do the greater works, for God is not
                            exhausted, nor the fount of inspiration dried up. Christ is on earth to-day calling through
                            many a medium ; " Come unto me, all ye who are heavy laden." Humanity requires something
                                more<pb n="51" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>than the dry bones of historic theology, Christ is the medium
                            to-day, through which God pours light into the world, developing mediums�saviors for time's
                            use ; leading into brotherly and sisterly unity, and that pathway will be strewn with the
                            bright blossoming efforts to save every sinner, by giving to him or her a drink from the
                            fountain of love, and sweetly expressed hope. It has been the effort of professed
                            Christianity to convert its heroes, its pattern saints, into fetich idols. Instead of
                            lighting by their torch, and passing it from hand to hand, they have interposed their dead
                            bodies to shut put the light. Like many another savior Jesus manifested Christ. "But do not
                            call him God, while all can scan Page after page that prove him but a man; Yea rather call
                            him by his chosen name, The Son of man. Yet let us strive in all that's good and great, His
                            noble life of love to imitate; And tho' he was a man of favored birth, A mortal light-house
                            on this darkened earth. Yet he like other men was once a boy, A helpless babe, his parents
                            hope and joy; Which is the path which angels all have trod, While we, thro' Christ, with him
                            are Sons of God." Harvard, 3Iass.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shaker problem" TEIform="index"/> THE SHAKER PROBLEM.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B."

                            suggestions of the Shaker's responses, were directed almost wholly to the exoteric and
                            tempora1 status of the community�to those points most interesting to the worldly side o: the
                            Shaker problem�the numbers professing the Shaker name, and the fina disposition of the
                            Shaker's property, when the last Shaker may have been entombed. The vital subject of
                            Shakerism appears not to have received even a passing hint; and the Shaker's state of mind
                            reminds a brother Shaker of the feelings of Peter at the eve of the judgment for the
                            execution of Jesus. But, " man is not keyed to the temporal alone, but to the eternal. "
                            Shakerism, though an hundred years old, is yet in its infancy, and struggling in its
                            swaddling clothes, as did its foster father Church eighteen hundred years ago ! That which
                            dignifiedly concerns the world relatively to Shakerism is its province, function, or
                            business�the part providentially assigned it to act in man's career of salvation and
                            redemption. Its humble origin, like that of its Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, who was the
                            first great Shaker, has, in like manner, environed it during its advent of introduction,
                            with neglect, and draped it in great obscurity, so that even those who, like John the
                            baptist, are seeking the advent of the Kingdom of Heaven, and peering into the horoscope of
                            God's future providences for man's elevation, look toward Shakerism as John did toward
                            Jesus, and ask, " Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another, " and, the Shaker
                            agency for man's salvation and regeneration, to the worldly eye, looks so meagre, the world
                            is still looking for another ; and that other, in the world's estimation, must be some theme
                            or project, consonant with worldly conceptions of greatness and grandeur ; and, withal, a
                            system of religion that shall cater to man's worldly pleasiires, and minister to the
                            gratification of his sensual appetites ; this is the charac-<pb n="52" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>ter of the
                            new religion that the agnostic, worldly element of society is clamoring for. But through
                            inspired media, God hath declared that He " hath chosen the foolish things of the world to
                            confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty.
                            * * * And things despised hath God chosen, yea, and things that are not [in the propositions
                            of the worldly mind,] to bring to naught things that are." "That no flesh should glory in
                            His presence. " But all sinless followers of " the Lamb on Mount Zion,'' who follow Him by
                            ceasing from all the sins and practices of a worldly life, as Jesus did, thus crucifying the
                            world in themselves aud overcoming it, shall become subjects of the Kingdom of Heaven, to go
                            no more out, and, eventually, heirs of the Kingdom of God�the society of the redeemed in
                            Heaven, and heirs of its bounteous heavenly inheritance. If such souls can be found among
                            Shakers, Quakers, Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Catholics, or any
                            other of the multitudinous cognomens of those professing religion, or those making no
                            religious profession, such really are Shakers of worldly elements, principles and
                            institutions ; they are the laboring agents whom God hath declared, by the mouth of His
                            prophet Haggai, should shake the world and its old heavens of pleasure in unrighteousness.
                            Thus, "yet once it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea,
                            and the dry laud ; and I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come;
                            aud I will fill this ''[Shaker]house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts." See Haggai, ii,
                            6th and 7th. A recent historian declares to the world that '' there is an universal
                            decadence of all religions (so-called) among all people throughout the world, " for we are
                            living in an inquisitive and skeptical age, and, as all mankind are affinitively connected
                            sympathetically, Shakers, as well as all other professors of religion, must feel the
                            throbbings of the pulse of the status of religious life in the human family; and, as its
                            blood at present flows languidly, and the religion of Shakerism requires the utmost fervor
                            of religious life, even that degree of thirst for heaven that shall cause souls to cry out,
                            "Lord, what shall I do to be saved, " not in Ingersolic sarcasm, but, in sorrowing
                            necessity, therefore, Shakerism waits the progressed state of Society, or a portion thereof
                            for the season of its advent. The work of Shakerism is the climatic process of man's strife
                            for the Kingdom of Heaven; that state of happiness which all mankind are desiring, though
                            millions so blindly, foolishly, and ignorantly seek it, abnormally struggling to purchase
                            Heaven without paying therefore the legal price, as speculators in Wall street, New York,
                            seek to gain wealth by lottery. Shakerism, while it recognizes and accepts all the
                            revelations of God's will and purposes for man's elevation, salvation and redemption, in all
                            the four grand dispensations of His grace to man,�those manifest to Noah to make man perfect
                            in his generations ; those to Abraham, to separate him from the broad plane of a mere
                            worldly life to become a nation of priests aud examplers ; those to Moseo, to introduce his
                            church as scholars preparatory to the Christ order; those to Jesus, to inaugurate the<pb n="53" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>Kingdom of Heaven upon earth; and those which should be manifest at the
                            second coming of the Christ spirit, which should ''harvest" the earth� reap man from the
                            earthly order, and fit him for the Kingdom of Heaven while yet upon the earth ; yet, it does
                            not, in one Babylonish mixture, mingle the ordinances which were the laws of progress for
                            man while under the ministration of each of these distinct and different dispensations, as
                            do many �nan made theologies and creeds. And thougk at present the numbers progressing in
                            this prophetic shaking dispensation are small, and for a time and times may decrease, yet
                            the genuine Shaker's faith is consonant with the prophet's declaration : "'The desire of all
                            nations"�the Kingdom of Heaven�'' shall come " upon earth, (through the shaking, sifting
                            process) and " God will fill" (this prophetic Shaker house) " with glory. " The work of
                            Shakerism is the work prophesied of that should come in the ''last days" of the progress of
                            God's plan of redemption for humanity ; and of these days' works, God, through the mouth of
                            His prophet, hath said, "And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of
                            the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted
                            above the hills, and nations shall flow unto it; and many people shall go to the mountain of
                            the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we
                            will walk in His paths ; for out of Zion shall go forth the '� Law" and the "Word of the
                            Lord" from Jerusalem. " The spiritual Zion of God is composed of souls " who follow the Lamb
                            whithersoever He goeth. " These will all be Shakers of all ungodly worldly systems. The
                            present phase of "Shaker" experience with regard to numbers professing the Shaker faith, as
                            well as the experience of the other denominations of religious profession, is merely a halt
                            in the march of religious progress. The true Shaker idea is : The march will be renewed ere
                            long ; then, those who seek eternal joys and durable riches in God's Kingdom, will come out
                            from the world and be followers of the Lamb on Mount Zion, for " All creeds and forms shall
                            pass for naught, When man is quickened by God's thought." When names, and sects, and parties
                            shall have passed away, true Shakers will be found to possess a kingdom eternal, while the
                            world, and its elements, will be burned up by the fire of truth. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            word. Use pood language,�pure, gentle, simple, modest,�with no slang phrases. As a
                            wellspring to this good language cherish pure thoughts and feelings, harbor none others. Be
                            polite and graceful in conversation, in manners and movements,� sitting, standing or
                            walking. Avoid foiling on furniture, window sill, or against the wall of a room or doorcase,
                            especially in the apartments of superiors and seniors. This advice may be thought out of
                            date and unnecessary, with the great advantages and much teaching of the present day ; but I
                            have occasion to think that more regard to ihese lessons will not be amiss. Mother Ann
                            taught that a reprimand or correction for an error should be heeded when once given, and
                            never be needed a second time. In this way progress is made and spiritual life, with
                            happiness and contentment obtained. Persons who allow themselves to be indifferent and
                            careless, neglecting to amend when shown a fault or awkwardness, with the slipshod return,
                            "I forgot it"�"I don't think of it, "�ilI haven't thought of it since," are not happy, not
                            vigorous and growing in grace, certainly not beautiful and lovely. Advantages for good
                            education are abundant, improve them aright, as they are presented ; not sluggishly wait to
                            be urged, driven to use energy and brain ; use strengthens brain as well as muscle. Nay,
                            don't be indifferent and loth to exert yourself to mental or physical usefulness, and in the
                            future have to regret your stupidity and wish somebody had obliged you to learn when you
                            were young. Bestir yourself of your own accord, from an ambition to be equal in talent and
                            goodness to the best of your class. Come up to the mark, improve every advantage in your
                            means, in union and by approval of your kind teachers and advisers ; thus keep up wi:,h the

                            to say it leaves me quite Avell, also my family. Since my visit to Mt. Lebanon last winter,
                            I have often, yea very often thought of the great kindness I received from the Brethren and
                            Sisters of the North Family, and I have often wished that I might speak so it could be
                            understood how much I appreciate the same, for surely the seeds of love and truth that were
                            sown in my heart at that time, have taken root; I feel a growing desire to thank all who
                            have in any way taught me to be a better man. I often ask myself, how it is that every one
                            is so good to me, and that go where I will, I find friends. I wish it was so that I could
                            leave my business again and compare notes of experience with friends at Mt. Lebanon. I say
                            with friends, because I have a particular feeling of love for, and confidence in those
                            friends ; knowing I am better understood by them than others elsewhere. Then, there is
                            another thing I find welling up in my heart. It is that I am lonesome almost all the time.
                            Now, I have just aa good a home as I could<pb n="55" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> wish for, botli in New
                            Hampshire where my family live, and in Lowell, Mass. where I spend most of my time. I am
                            �surrounded in my business relations and �elsewhere with persons who are ever ready to help
                            in time of need, yet for all this, I feel a desire to fly away from �everything to the
                            place, where for the last twelve years I have felt I would like to call home. I am very
                            sorry I did not spend a little more time with my friends at the North Family, as I would
                            like to have them know more about me, and I think I could have learned much that would "now
                            be a help to me in many ways ; but the truth is I felt heart sick, and knowing I must return
                            to Lowell, made me feel very sad indeed. When I left my good brother, Elder Frederic, I
                            fully expected to see him again next day, but after leaving him I began to feel so very
                            lonesome that I made up my mind that if I stayed much longer I should not be fit to leave at
                            all, as it was it was hard to breah away, and I suffered much for months after I got back to
                            Lowell, and having no one to whom I could tell my feelings, made me feel dreadful; but �such
                            is life. If I had an opportunity I would like to tell you of my home in England, and the
                            reason of my leaving it. I have seen some trying times in my life, that is, for one of my
                            nature, others possessing different temperaments may have felt otherwise. I was 53 years of
                            age the 27th of last February, and when I look back as it were over my past life, I can but
                            feel to thank God with my whole heart for a something within me that tells me there is such
                            a thing as love and truth. I have heard some say there is no such thing as love. Now I think
                            that is false, and I can prove it, to my own satisfaction, for I feel the happy effects ot
                            it in my own heart. I oftea think of those younger sisters I saw in the sewing room, and
                            speak of them to my friends, how far better off they are than those of the same age that are
                            in the Mills. I have a number that work with me, and they are quite good girls ; but they
                            look very different from those happy young sisters I saw at Mt. Lebanon. My little girls
                            have pale, blue faces, and I fear in these hard times many of them are often hungry. How
                            thankful I am to know that some have their needs supplied, and kind loving friends to care
                            for them. I wish I knew enough to express to you how I feel in regard to the word duty. I am
                            often told by one and another what is my duty as a Christian. For years back I have
                            eudeavored to follow the wise counsel given as far as I could, though that was precious
                            little. I was troubled, and came to the conclusion that I must consider the matter for
                            myself. I then began to question what was my duty, as I really wanted to do right. The first
                            duty I found Avas to look after the interest of Hie Company for whom I work; made a duty
                            because they paid me so many hundred dollars a year. I admit that is my duty. The next, what
                            is my duty to the Church? After thus thinking, I began to feel ashamed, and ask myself
                            another question. Is there any duty I owe to the Church? The answer came in this wise. God
                            forbid that I should ever feel as a duty anything 1 can do for the Church, for my family or
                            for the good of my fellow man.<pb n="56" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>Since then, I have seemed to live in a
                            different climate. Siuce then, I have been working because I have the privilege to work.
                            Yea, I thank God I have a privilege to do right, to love the Church, to love the Brethren
                            anc! Sisters to love my family and the privilege of helping my fellow man. I am not tired
                            now, I can work because I love to work, and I get well paid for it in more ways than one ;
                            and I believe if we live to our high privilege as Christians we may enjoy much that is in
                            store for the faithful. I have very pleasant recollections of good Eldress Antoinette ; her
                            autobiography I have enjoyed reading, and so have others. I find many of my own feelings
                            expressed therein, better than I could express them myself. Of course you know that business
                            all over the 'country is very dull. The question I hear asked over and over again, how do
                            the times look? My answer is, they look bright. My experience teaches that after clouds,
                            there will be sunshine. Those who are cleai -sighted may see the signs of the times, and
                            profit thereby. I often think that it is possible for us to be too well off in this world's
                            goods. I must now begin to close, and as I do, I remember with much love the Brethren and
                            Sisters with whom I exchanged friendly greetings, and indeed, my love flows to all whose
                            object is to live for truth and right. If I have presumed too much in writing to you I hope
                            you will forgive me. 1 felt that I must speak to some one. I now feel better than when I
                            commenced, and if you can make out in part how I feel, I shall be thankful. 1 have received
                            the December number of " The Manifesto ;" have noticed page i.84 and thank you for it.
                            Please remember me to all my kind friends at Mt. Lebanon. I wish them to accept my
                            everlasting love. Yours for truth and right.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="G., J. W." TEIform="persName"/>j. w. G., Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            believing the sentiments therein expressed were the outcome of sincere and good feeling;
                            for, " Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. " and " From a pure fountain
                            floweth sweet waters. " The love that you hold for Believers, and your attraction to their
                            faith and principles, will eventually gather you to them ; if not in this world, most
                            certainly in the next. " For where the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered
                            together." "And where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. " Only the noblest and
                            purest motives, prompt souls to forsake all for Christ's sake and the gospel, and to form
                            those higher relationships that are angelic and enduring. Jesus gave his disciples the
                            key-note to heavenly harmony when he said, " Seek first the kingdom of heaven and its
                            righteousness, and all needful things will be added thereto. " The things of earth perish
                            with the using, but the treasures of the spirit are eternal; and while mankind bury
                            themselves in the material elements, giving their entire thought and concern to the
                            accumulation of that which only sustains the physical part; they will, sooner or later, find
                            themselves devoid of the substance that perisheth not. <pb n="57" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> When man shall
                            be disrobed of the mortal, and shall enter the world of spiritual realities ; he will not be
                            asked what riches he has laid up on earth ; what fame he has reached ; what honors he has
                            shared ; or, what reputation he has held among men. But, Avhat good deeds has he sent before
                            him ; what of real virtue does his soul possess that will recommend him to the society of
                            the good and just. We should consider our latter end and be wise, living each day in
                            reference to the future. Our young people are indeed favorably situated, both as to their
                            physical, moral and spiritual welfare ; having rare opportunities for the development and
                            unfoldment of all that is good, beautiful and true. Surrounded by influences that fend to
                            mold them in the Christ-like pattern of innocence, truth and love ; the virtues on which jou
                            dwell with so much feeling. Surely, the foundations of the earthly order are out of course,
                            oj there would not exist such conditions of misery and woe as we see in society at large.
                            The great monopolies in business absorb the rights and privileges of all, and reduce the
                            poor to a state of servitude, as abject as that of the Israelites to their Egyptian
                            Cask-masters. There is but little chance for the lower classes to rise in the social scale.
                            The one great cause of want is a lack of the God-given right to ownership in land. If every
                            poor man had a little homestead of his own ; he would have something to fall back upon when
                            manufacture failed to supply him with the meagre necessaries of life. Ignorance and crime
                            are the result of idleness, and listless automatic slavework ; and there is a terrible
                            volcano gathering its forces in the heart of society. There must sooner or later be a
                            convulsion, an upheaval, a mighty struggle between capital ;md labor, that1 shall result in
                            a different order of things. The poet sings �"And ever the right comes uppermost, And ever
                            is justice done. " O that man would learn to do justice and love mercy ! rising above
                            cupidity and selfishness, on a broader plane of philanthropic action. Love to God and to the
                            neighbor, is the law that should govern mankind in all their transactions with one another.
                            I like your definition of the word duty. When one feels it a privilege to do good, they have
                            opened that deep well of living waters in their souls, that shall flow forth to make the
                            desert smile and the waste places blossom. Such souls are inspired with noble
                            self-sacrificing devotion in the cause of- truth and right. It was just this heavenly
                            enthusiasm that warmed the hearts, and quickened the souls of the great and good founders of
                            our order ; and gave them the power to build on the basis of enduring principles, a church
                            that has stood in its integrity over a century; while many attempts at organization, and
                            communism have failed, because men lacked the higher impulse, the religious element, that
                            has given stability to our institution. I wonder sometimes, why there are not more, who,
                            like Mary of old seek the better part that cannot be taken from them. Then I am reminded of
                            the words of Jesus, " Strait is the gate and narrow the way that leadeth unto life, and few
                            there be that find it." Human nature does not like restraint; and thousands would rather
                            live in poverty; than to cast away the tattered "rarments<pb n="58" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>of sin ; and
                            share the fulfillment of the glorious promises, that compensate the faithful cross-bearer in
                            the kingdom of Christ. Beloved Elder Frederic, good Eldress Antoinette, Sister Anna and
                            others of whom you speak ; send kindly greetings to you. You have an interest in our prayers
                            and good feelings, as have all who show any disposition to obey the call " to come up
                            higher" into a better and purer life. I am glad that you were pleased with the little story;
                            it so impressed itself on my mind, that I wrote it out as simply as you told it. With well
                            wishes for your prosperity, and with an earnest desire that your faith may increase and be
                            unto you as a shining light, growing brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. I close

New Li^lit Baptists, called Merry Dancers Come-outers,
                            etc.They, therefore, marched in upon the Community, very unceremoniously, except through the
                            medium before named, which was a common occurrence. In this case the party were met at the
                            door with a hearty,� "Welcome here, we were expecting you, Mother saw you several days ago
                            and bade us prepare to receive you, Come right in. " They all felt that they really had
                            arrived home to their Mother's house, indeed, and were not strangers to each other, although
                            they had never before met face to face. Mother Ann at that date was very feeble in body, but
                            she told her attendants that those people that had taken so much pains to come such a long
                            distance to see her and the Eiders, must all have the privilege to do e-o. James Merrill was
                            over seventy years of age. His flowing locks were as white as thesnow. Mother Ann had for
                            James a.special gift of blessing, because one so aged should undertake such a long tedious
                            journey, to seehis gospel friends. The brethren that remained in charge of the vessel, were
                            relieved by those who went first to Niskeyuna, and every one of the company enjoyed the
                            satisfaction of seeing Mother and the Elders, and receiving from them, such counsel as
                            fitted their condition, with a full assurance of the hundred fold blessing if they were
                            faithful to bear the cross of Christ, and yield a willing obedience to the gift of God
                            through a visible lead. One day while this company from Main� were at Niskeyuna, another
                            large company came that wanted to see Mother Ann. They were from different parts of the
                            country, but her attendants deemed it imprudent, in her feeble state, to favor them with a
                            personal interview. Mother Ann, however, realized how disappointed they would be, and
                            supported by the sisters she walked out on the piazza, and spoke a few encouraging wordsto
                            them. The company from Maine while with the Elders, attended many gifted, religious
                            meetings, and received much good counsel. Their faith was strengthened and they were blest
                            with many divine gifts. The Brethren and. Sisters returned to their vessel at Alban}- and
                            were soon sailing down the Hudson, anxious to return home as soon as possible. In the
                            evening of Sept. 7th. after they had left N. Y. they encountered ;v terrible storm. The
                            winds and high waves rocked their little craft so severely that they were, every moment, in
                            imminent danger of going to the bottom. This fearful storm continued all night, and nearly
                            everyone on board gave up all hope of ever again reaching the land. Ezekiel Hatch that brave
                            old revolutionary hero who had for seven years fearlessly faced the foe on many a bloody
                            battle field, sat down and braced � his feet, to keep from being thrown about, became as
                            pale as a corpse, and said he expected every time a wave struck the vessel, that they should
                            be wrecked. On the morning of the 8th, when their fears were intense, Dana Thorns, saw,
                                in<pb n="59" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>vision, Mother Ann who looked calm and smilingly upon her and
                            with uplifted hands breathed peace to the troubled sea and from that moment all fear was
                            taken away. She communicated her vision to the company which inspired them with fresh hope
                            and courage, calling forcibly to their minds the account given in the fourth chapter of
                            Mark, where the presence of Jesus saved the ship, and by his prayer and command, calmed the
                            fierce winds and turbulent waves. Inspired frith this new courage each one did his duty
                            faithfully, the storm subsided, the sea became calm and they soon expressed their joy and
                            thanksgiving in songs and in prayer. They sailed safely into Portland harbor early on Sunday
                            morning and landed at the wharf, in season for all to leave at sunrise for Falmouth. After
                            travelling about three miles they arrived at the residence of Edmund Merrill, where they all
                            took breakfast. It was but a short time after their arrival home that the sad intelligence
                            reached them that Mother Ann's work on earth was finished and her spirit had gone to the
                            land of souls. Noting the time of her death and the time that sister Dana saw her, was about
                            six hours after her demise. In Sept. 1784 a company of ten Brethren and Sisters left Alfred
                            to visit Mother Ann and the Elders at Niskeyuna. This journey was made in the saddle. On
                            reaching Albany, they heard the painful news of the death of Mother Ann. , Before reaching
                            Niskeyuna they met Father James and others who were on their way to New Lebanon, Father
                            James was very glad to meet the friends from Alfred, and expressed much sorrow at the great
                            disappointment it would be to them to be deprived r&gt;f the privilege of seeing the
                            visible form of Mother Ann. As soon as he spoke the name of Mother, he began to weep, and
                            immediately alighting from his horse, dropped upon his knees in prayer. As soon as the
                            horses could be secured, the whole company were on their knees in prayer with Father James.
                            It had been said of Father, and very truly, that when he wept the stoutest hearts would melt
                            in tears of sympathy with him. Father James made a most fervent and heart felt prayer,
                            imploring every one, who had received faith, to continue steadfast iiji the way of well
                            doing, and to keep themselves pure and unspotted from the world, and from everything that
                            defiles the spirit or brings condemnation upon the soul. "My two friends are gone, " said
                            he, " O pray for me, that I may have strength to bear the bun den now resting upon me, to
                            nourish and strengthen every precious soul committed to my charge, that the least child may
                            not suffer loss through my unfaithfulness." Father James then blessed the company from
                            Alfred, and each proceeded on their way. After visiting Niskeyuna cr Watervliet, they went
                            to New Lebanon, N. Y. and returned by the way of Harvard, Mass. In the summer of 1785 Father
                            James made his first and only visit into the state or Province of Maine. He was accompanied
                            by Elders, Henry Clough, Job Bishop, EleazeF Rand and Ebenezer Co.oley. Father James went as
                            far east as Gorham where he held meetings and preached to large audiences. At one service
                            his text was taken from the 87th Psalm. 37th verse. " Mark the perfect man and behold the
                            upright, for the end of that man is peace." From this he delivered an able discourse. He
                            gave a clear and plain explanation of the Scripture, and of the work of God through Jesus
                            Christ; that a new revelation of God was now made known through Mother Ann, and that the ax
                            was laid at the root of the forbidden tree. Father James, in some of his testimonies was
                            very plain and pointed against every sin, especially the carnal indulgences of the nature of
                            the flesh. This sometimes aroused a spirit of opposition, and at one time Richard Edwards
                            created some disturbance by interrupting Father James, several times, while speaking, much
                            to the annoyance of a large majority present. John Stevenson of Gorham, a brave old sea
                            captain could bear it no longer, and commanded Edwards to sit down, "Sit down" said he, "
                            and hold your tongue and let this man preach. You know how to make a plough, and an ox yoke,

                            missionary to Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Ed.] " On our arrival at Busro we met with some
                            enemies of the cross and suffered much persecution at their hands. We met one man, a
                            preacher, by the name of Devan. His home was at Patoka creek in Pike Co., He had a
                            congregation at that place. His zeal against the Shakers was certainly very active even if
                            sadly misplaced. At one time he preached a long sermon to his people, warning them to beware
                            of "them Shakers, " and of their cruel orders. It so happened that I passed through that
                            settlement, in company with one of the Brethren, and called at the house of one Humphreys,
                            to warm us. Humphrey informed us that he had joined the church, and had been baptized. We
                            said we were glad of the change, and he might need to be baptized aeain. On our return
                            Humphrey came out to meet us and invited us to call at his house as a great meeting was to
                            be held in the place and three preachers would be present. If we would stop he would take
                            the best care of our horses. We told him we would attend if we could leave the meeting just
                            when we pleased without giving offence. He said we might have that liberty. Soon after our
                            arrival quite a company collected to see and hear .the Shakers. H. "Well, I don't know but
                            we shall all have to go up to Busro and get our sins pardoned ; we understand that you can
                            forgive sins. " I. Yea, we can, said I. Can you not do it here? H. " No, " said he, " we
                            don't attempt sr.ch a thing." I. Well, I had no expectation that there was charity enough
                            among such Christians to forgive sins. How do you expect to be forgiven, if you do not
                            forgive one another? Eead the Lord's prayer and read what he has said about the forgiveness
                            of sin. Devan did not like this illustration and when the meeting was opened he took for a
                            text:�"Who is on the Lord's side?" First he explained it negatively, to show who was not on
                            the Lord's side and he rejected every honest soul on the earth. Now, said he, we come to the
                            positive. Who is on the Lord's side? I will tell you. It is that man or that woman who has
                            set out to serve God, and after a while slips back and after their time of back sliding, and
                            when the Lord calls them back again, this is positive evidence that they are on the Lord's
                            side. At the close of his speaking he opened a wide door for any one to speak and to correct
                            his errors. With such liberty I had a feeling to speak my mind, for I never before heard
                            that God esteemed a backslider before a good, honest hearted soul, that stands fast, but
                            that he has always cursed them ever since the fall of Adam, and I believed all that the
                            speaker had said was wrong end foremost. Devan rose again, in haste and said. I move that
                            this Shaker man and I have a talk together before you all instead of brother McKoy's
                            preaching. Voted and agreed. After we had been engaged but a short time some of the people
                            cried out. Reconsider that vote and let brother McKoy preach. They did so. Now, said Devan,
                            I am determined to talk with this man and all who have a mind to hoar brother McKoy preach
                            may stay, and the rest follow me, and out he went, and the people all followed, save four.
                            We sat on an old block shed and began our talk. After some plain remarks on both sides,
                            Devan says, I). Well your doctrine is more wholesome than I thought it was, but I shall ask
                            you one question, which I know will sting you. I. AVell never mind that. D. I shall ask it
                            then but I know it will sting you. I. You need not be afraid, as I have no fear of your
                            sting. D. He proceeded. Don't you have ten thousand wicked thoughts in a day? Now what do
                            you do with these thoughts? I. Shall I answer yon in Scripture language? D. That is the best
                            of all. I. The weapons of our warfare are mighty through God to the bringing down of the<pb n="61" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>Gl strong holds ; casting down imaginations and every high thing that
                            exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringeth into captivity every thought to

                            you have not received the gospel. 1). Well, we will shake hands in good will. After this all
                            the people came and shook hands with us very kindly and peacefully.

                            the word went forth for judgment and mercy to all who would listen from for and near. We

                            Yet how liable we are to fall into this habit. The Gospel, however, is a home work. The
                            tongue is a very unruly member but let us bring it into subjection. It is very pleasant for
                            us to live harmoniously together to speak a kind word to our companions or to meet them with
                            the blessing<pb n="63" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> of God's love. We should look on the bright side and not
                            allow ourselves because a brother or sifter makes a mistake to speak of it and thus magnify
                            into a sin or fault that which was perhaps an oversight or misunderstanding. This would show
                            a great lack of the beautiful Christian virtue of Charity and a need of home work. Let us

                            peace that would brighten our journey through life. If we strive to live rightly, laboring
                            to correct our own errors we shall see more clearly the good in those with whom we
                            associate, and let us remember the wise adage, " If we cannot speak well of others it were
                            better not to speak at all. " If another halt or stumble, Be not thine the lips: to chide;

                            with pointing finger All her weakness to betray. For while thou art idly telling All her
                            faults and errors o'er, She in deep contrition, bowing, These same errors may deplore. If in

                            outcry, That shall all attention call. But 'neath Charity's broad mantle, Strive the wrong
                            and sin to hide : And with earnestjkind entreaty, Back to right thy brother guide. And if
                            thou art ever tempted, 111 to speak of those who've erred ; May the still, small voice of

                            disciples. Matt. iv. This is preliminary to the most impressive chapter throughout the
                            Bible. What better conception could we have of the character of our Savior, than is given
                            through evidence of his triumph over the tempter. We read that he was led by the spirit into
                            the wilderness to be tempted of the evil one. There he was requested to do a miracle that
                            would prove whether or not his mission was ordained of God. The tempter said to him, " If
                            thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread. " Hence, the wisdom of his
                            answer. "It is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
                            proceedeth out of the mouth of God. " Next, he Avas taken into the holy city and seated on a
                            pinnacle of the temple, where the tempter said, " If thou art the Son of God cast thyself
                            down, for it is written. He shall give His angels charge concerning thee ; and in their
                            hands they bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." Then Jesus
                            said to him, "It is written again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." Again, he was
                            taken up an exceedingly high mountain and shown all the kingdoms of the world and the glory
                            of them. All of these were promised him if he would fall down and, <pb n="64" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/>
                            worship the tempter ; but the spirit of good rose triumphant, and a conquest over the enemy
                            was won. Thus Jesus said, "Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written thou shalt worship the

HOLLISTER.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Max Mlller Prof, of Oriental languages in Oxford University, and translator of the sacred
                            literature of the Eastern nations, into English, classifies the six leading religions of the
                            world as missionary and non-missionary. The former he pronounces alive and the latter, dying
                            or dead. Any religion or system that is self propagating, or is making new conquests through
                            the zeal and activity of its votaries, cannot be absolutely dead, though it may contain
                            never so much error. And any system which makes religion to cousist in a profession of
                            belief, and the practice of ceremonies which effect nothing toward destroying the natui'e of
                            � in in the heart, is far from perfect good, unmixed with error. In the second class, are
                            Judaism, Brahmanism, and Zoroastrianism. The subjects of these are represented as wishing to
                            confine the benefits of their religion to people of their own blood, whom they esteemed as a
                            peculiarly privileged and favored class, or caste. For example UA Jew must be of the seed of
                            Abraham. And when in later times they admitted strangers to some of their privileges, they
                            looked upon them not as souls who had been gained to God, saved, born into a new
                            brotherhood, but as strangers, or proselytes. That is, men who had come to them as aliens,
                            not to be trusted as their saying was until the twenty fourth generation. A similar feeling
                            prevented the Brahmins from attempting to proselyte those who did not by birth, belong to
                            the aristocracy of their country. They went so far as to punish those who happened) to be
                            near enough to hear the sound of their prayers, or witness their sacrifices. The Par si,
                            [ZoroastrianJ too, does not wish for converts. He is proud of his faith as of his blood. And
                            though he believes in the final victory of truth and light, and says to every man Be bright
                            as the sun and pure as the moon, he does very little to drive away spiritual darkness, by
                            letting his light shine before the world. The missionary religions, are Buddhism,
                            Mohammedanism, and Christianity. However they may differ in their doctrines, they all have
                            faith in themselves, they have life and vigor, they want to convince, they mean to conquer.
                            From the earliest dawn of their existence, these three religions were missionary. Their
                            founders and first apostles, recognized the duty of spreading the truth, of refuting error,
                            of bringing the whole world to acknowledge the paramount, if not the Divine authority of
                            their doctrines. We know very little of the origin and earliest growth of Buddhism. But the
                            presiding Elder of their great Council, held at Patilipatra 246 B. C. an old<pb n="65" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> man, too weak to travel by land, and conveyed to the Council in a boat, and
                            after the Council was over, began to reflect on the future, and found the time had come to
                            establish the religion of Buddha in foreign countries. He therefore dispatched some of the
                            most eminent priests to distant cities and countries, East, West, North and South. When
                            threatened by infuriated crowds, one of those missionaries said Even if the gods fdeities of
                            the elements,] were united with men, they would not frighten me away. And when he had
                            brought the people to listen, he dismissed them with the simple prayer, "Do not hereafter
                            give way to pride and anger. Care for the happiness of all living beings, and abstain from
                            violence. Extend your good will to all mankind. Let there be peace among the dwellers on
                            earth." The fact that missionaries were sent out to convert the vworld, represents to us
                            what at that time was a new thought� new not only in the history of India, but of the [whole
                            world, says Muller. The Koran does not invite, but rather compels the world to come in. Yet
                            there are passages which show that Mohammed had realized the idea of a religion of humanity
                            ; that he first wished to unite his own with that of the Jews and Christians, comprehending
                            all under the common name Islam, which originally meant humility or devotion. All who
                            humblefl themselves before God and were filled with reverence, were called Moslem. The
                            Islam, says Mohammed, is the true worship of God. When'men dispute you, say, "lam a Moslem."
                            Ask those who have sacred books, and ask the heathen ; Are you a Moslem ? If they are, they
                            are on the right path. But if they turn away, then you have no other task but to preach to
                            them the Islam. Islam also means to satisfy or pacify by forbearance. It also means simply
                            subjection. As to Christianity, its very soul is missionary, progressive, world embracing.
                            It would cease to exist if it ceased to be missionary. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Prayer for the dead" TEIform="index"/>PRAYER FOR THE DEAD

                            illustrating the operations of the work of God among men. He had learned that it was to be,
                            forever, a new work, a continual increase in the manifestations of power and glory. The
                            external ceremonies in sacrifices and washings, so long used and so reverently regarded, had
                            lost their vitality in proportion as the principle of obedience became better understood and
                            appreciated. The rudimental lessons in religion were as necessary to be learned and as
                            essential to those to whom they were given as were those of a more advanced order. "Learn of
                            me, " said Jesus, " Take my yoke upon you, and ye shall h'nd rest to your souls. " A
                            religion that helps man to work out what he preaches, that inspires him with a growing
                            toward God and an interest in the happiness and prosperity of his brethren readily appeals
                            to our common understanding and we soon see the necessity for its general cultivation. In
                            this Jesus the Christ is our lovin o example. He taught that it was necessary to love and
                            even to.pray for those whom we denominated our enemies. To do this was to do quite different
                            from the impulse of a revengeful miud: it was the crucifixion of selfish love and a good
                            test of Christian discipleship. Pilgrim's Talkative could discuss this point to a nicety
                            while at the same time he 'had no special interest in making any sacrifice that would cut
                            him from his relations with the world. "Why what difference " said he, ' ^ is there between
                            crying out against and abhorring sin ? " Talkative is not without his followers., and they
                            are far more ready to discuss passages of scripture,, the meaning of which they never
                            understood, than to. give heed to one of the least commandments. Such persons can make
                            longprayers and quote largely from the prophets and Bible teachers to prove some pet hobby
                            in their religious belief while therecord of their daily lives would prove very
                            objectionable. Talkative had religion but it was largely of words and not of deeds. We busy
                            ourselves, sometimes, over the trifles of life while the weightier matters we pass by
                            carelessly. It is of but little consequence so far as uur present happiness or salvation is
                            concerned whether Abraham was a better soldier than Melchisedec or whether Daniel's lions
                            were men or beasts, but it is of the utmost importance that our life is one of discipline in
                            peace and righteousness. Kindness, carefulness and neatness are in daily demand whether
                            alone or in company. A Christian must be sadly in want of his marks of felloAvship if either
                            of these qualities of the mind have been neglected. Religion that has its foundation in the
                            heart will not carelessly turn from these much to be desired conditions, of the mind.
                            Communities in which brotherly love and gospel affection are carefully cultivated, making
                            the anxiety and burdens of others, in pleasant harmony with those of our own mind, cannot
                            fail to encourage and establish a living interest in every gospel grace and make our home on
                            the earth, the Paradise of God<pb n="67" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> In man's; care for man, we have
                            presented to us, at times, some remarkable instances of self-sacrifice. Down trodden
                            humanity need an order of saviors that can preach to them the gospel of good news, and lead
                            them from their low estates into the paths of peace a;:d righteousness. The example
                            presented by two young men who have solicited the privilege to give their lives for the
                            benefit of some of the lowest classes that are found in the great city, is unprecedented,
                            heroic, and truly wonderful. They say of themselves .� "If we arc to reach these people, we
                            must, first of all, live among them. It will not answer to have a home and interests
                            elsewhere, and then to walk over to the mission chapel, and go about among the tenementhouse
                            population three or four times a week. If we are to get close to their hearts, we must get
                            close to their lives. If we are to do this work, we must strip like the gladiator for the
                            fight. We must be disencumbered of every tie and interest that can hinder or embarrass us.
                            We must be willing to be poor, to live alone, to obey a fixed rule (or regimen) of life,
                            that so we may give ourselves wholly to this work. There was a time when our Master said, '
                            Carry neither purse nor scrip.' There was a time when his apostle said, ' He that is
                            unmarried careth for the things of the Lord that he may please the Lord; and again, ' Obey
                            them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves. ' There was a time, in a word,
                            when, in a special exigency, men voluntarily took on them the soldier life and the soldier
                            rule, turning their backs on home and gain and a self-directed life. It is such a time and
                            such a.n exigency that confront us today. We do not want the help of a brotherhood to
                            retreat from the world, merely to coddle our own selfish souls, and call it sainthood : we
                            want a rule and bond that shall bind us to a hard task under sanctions the most august and
                            urgent. " Whatever efficacy there may be in religion, it is certain that the acceptance of
                            such a ministration in Glod's name must bring its commensurate reward. Willing to live
                            alone, willing to be poor and abstaining from the selfish pleasures of the world, the more
                            effectually to do good. They have learned one phase of the divine Teacher's mission, so
                            essential to their spiritual success. " He that is unmarried careth for the things of the
                            Lord, how he may please the Lord." Untrammelled by the cares of a worldly life, they have
                            gone out to work for God. In this, they have our sympathy and earnest prayers.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Arresting diphtheria" TEIform="index"/>ARRESTING DIPHTHERIA

                                        the first of such observances should be vigorous attention to every drain,
                                        sewer, and vault in the neighborhood where the disease appears, family safety
                                        and the public good alike require this ; and there should be no delay, and no
                                        courteous hesitancy about emptying and purifying such places. Copperas dissolved
                                        in water, at the rate of one pound to the gallon, is the cheapest and most
                                        suitable disinfectant for these uses, and should be employed liberally A patient
                                        seized with diphtheria should be separated rigidly from the family, and no one
                                        permitted to enter the room but the nurses; and the nurses should not
                                        communicate with the other children, nor handle them. The sick-room should have
                                        all needless articles removed from it, be kept well and constantly ventilated^
                                        and have sunlight. All discharges from the mouth and nose of the patient should
                                        be caught in vessels containing copperas solution, or upon rags and burned
                                        immediately. Evacuations from the bowels and kidneys should also be disinfected,
                                        and promptly disposed of. Clothing and towels about the patient should be put at
                                        once into hot water, containing four ounces of white vitriol and two ounces of
                                        salt to the gallon, and then taken from the room. Nurses must keep themselves
                                        and their patients scrupulously clean, washing their hands frequently with a
                                        iittle chlorinated soda in warm water. A diphtheritic patient should be kept
                                        apart until recovery has been complete, and until the house and clothing have
                                        been disinfected. In mild cases this is a trifling matter; but where the malady
                                        has been malignant it will require pretty vigorous fumigation with burning
                                        sulphur effectually to destroy the contagion. Sometimes this contagion seems to
                                        retain a power for miscHef after many weeks, the malady seizing others who
                                        played with those who had been sick; but this is not likely to occur unless the
                                        rules of sanitary cleanliness have been disregarded, or imperfectly applied.
                                        Children who have had diphtheria should not be permitted to return to school for
                                        many weeks.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="The Healthside" TEIform="index"/>The Healthside.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Eyes" TEIform="index"/>THE EYES

TEIform="persName"/>ODILON B. ELKINS.</byline><p TEIform="p"> The occasion upon which we have met this morning, has. no doubt, been the subject of much
                            pleasant anticipation. To those of immature years it must necessarily appear, simply as an
                            opportunity for mirth and pleasure. To the mature it appears as an occasion for mirth and
                            pleasure, and for profit as well. And every such gathering is, and should be, productive of
                            both, to old and young. Doubtless, the expectative, and preparative, preceding any meeting
                            of this kind, the discipline of writing something original, or commiting to memory a chapter
                            or a verse, fraught with wisdom, and love, is a source of no less �benefit and happiness ;
                            nor will we depreciate the pleasures of the table, the preparing with thoughtful care, and
                            partaking gratefully of the fruits of our industry, under the favor of God. These pleasures
                            are as legitimate, and proper as those of a spiritual, or mental character. Neither should
                            be suffered to encroach upon the other. Let all be done to the glory, and praises of God.
                            When we partake of the bounties which a loving Father has provided for our physical needs,
                            let us not be like the quadruped, which, the proverb says, never looks up at him who
                            thrashes down the acorns, but with thankful hearts, look up to our Maker, and reverently
                            acknowledge our indebtedness. Then, when we seek at His hand, that Immortal bread which
                            keeps the soul alive we need not go away empty. It is said that the injunction of our
                            founder was, "Eat heartily, work heartily, and figrht asrainst sin heartily. " No reserve
                            can be pleasing to God that has no heart in it. When thanksgiving day approaches, many are
                            moved to turn their attention to the far past, to learn, from old rcords when, where, and
                            how, the custom of celebrating this anniversary had its rise. This may be an interesting
                            theme, but it is of more vi'.al importance that we bear in mind the favors and gifts which
                            our Creator still continues to grant to His children. It is important to consider whether we
                            are as devotedly thankful for our day and grace, as our ancestors, the Pilgrim Fathers were,
                            or as were our forefathers in Christ. Whether the first Thanksgiving was kept upon Plymouth
                            rock, or aboard the May-flower, whether early in the seventeenth century, or towards the
                            close, does not materially concern us, nor are we specially interested in the minor
                            circumstances, the particular reason why, or the exact manner how, it was observed. Accounts
                            differ on these inferior points, but that the custom was introduced by the Pilgrim Fathers,
                            is perhaps beyond dispute. No doubt they were thankful for the security of the asylum they
                            had found, from the persecutions of their native land, and it would seem that the
                            intolerance that had compelled them to seek a refuge in the wilderness, might have taught
                            them a lesson of toleration and forbearance toward their inferiors. Somebody has said that
                            when they first landed they fell upon their knees, but presently they fell u~on the
                            aborigines. There is, perhaps, as much truth in the latter part of the statement as in the
                            former. It has been remarked that every day ought to be Thanksgiving day. To make it so
                            would be to live in conform<pb n="70" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/> ity to the teaching and practice of the
                            first preachers of our faith, whose life was praise and thanksgiving to God, regardless of
                            adverse circumstances, regardless of even cruel persecutions. To be unthankful, is to be
                            unholy. Let us cultivate thankful hearts, whether our duty leads us along pleasant, and
                            agreeable paths, or through unattractive, repellant scenes. We are all in the hollow of His
                            hand, who is our Father and Mother. His love is over us, and beneath us, and all about us.
                            Xo depth of human depravity is able to sink a soul where His love does not rcrch. Bat our
                            sinful lives may, and do, make us blind to that parental tenderness, which is slow to auger
                            and quick to forgive. And sometimes in looking back upon trying scenes, where we have had
                            everything, seemingly, but the last feather to bear up under, we have traced through it all
                            the designs of a wise and tender Parent. We have learned the lesson which His loving care
                            placed before us, and have seen that it was His hand that sustained us all through the
                            chastening, which made us more fully and tangibly His children. Enfield, N.

                            Though the days fleet on toward the change. There's a voice in the soul Commands the control

INFORMATION TOE INQUIEERS.
For the better understanding of those who
wish to know of the rules and regulations of
our religious home, we have prepared the following brief summary. Further information
may be obtained by addressing any member
of the order.
1.  The form of government in the Society is adapted to the different orders of
which it is composed :  its powers and authorities growing out of the mutual faith.
love and confidence of the members.
2.  No one is excluded from the privilege of becoming a member^on  account
of poverty ; nor will   they be accepted
because of wealth.
3.  Plain and explicit facts will be laid
before the  investigator.     To   become a
member, is a voluntary concession of the
individual.
4.  Those who  accept the privilege to
reside with us, as well as those who visit the Society as inquirers, are expected
to regard the rules of the family where
they are entertained.
5.  By the  principles   of this Society,
no believing husband or wife is allowed
to separate from an unbelieving partner,
except by mutual or legal r.greement.
G. Parents that become members are
not required to give up their children :
but they will be requested to see that the
children keep the rules of the family.
Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by
the request or consent of those who have
the lawful right over them.
7.  No corporal punishment is approved   lu   the  government of the   Society,
nor any external violence exercised on
any rational person.
8.  It is expected that the children admitted into the Society, will receive an
education suitable for the general management of business.
9.  Probationary members may retain
the lawful oAvnership of their property,
but the interest accruing therefrom will
be devoted to the benefit of the Society,
until by their own free will, and the consent of the   Trustees,  they shall conseerate said property to the support of the
family where they reside.
10.  The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to the time of their membership.
11.   Those who dispose of their property   to   relations   in   the worldly order,
should remain with those relations.
12.  A person�wishing  to   become  a
member of the Society,   must rectify all
his wrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims.
13.  Those   who   ask for admission to
our Home   are   supposed to be in search
of more truth   and light,   hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church,
is the confession   of sin to   God,   in the
presence of a witness.
14.  Those who have dedicated  their
property, and afterward withdraw from
the   Society,�according to the law of
justice and equity, there can be no ground
for retraction.
15.  To live   as  Brethren and Sisters
in the gospel of Christ, we can hold no
private correspondence.     All communications sent   from or received into   the
family,  whether printed or written, will
be subject to the examination and advice
of the Elders of the family.
1G. The leading authority of the Society is vested in a Ministry, consisting
of two Brother^ and two Sisters. Elders
and Trustees are also appointed. These
orders constitute the general government,
of the Society, in all of its branches.A D VER TISEMEN TS.
The Golden Rule is a weekly nonsectarian, religious family paper, published in Boston at two dollars a year,
and is rated one of the best of its class.
No paper in the country can excel
the Golden Rule in attractiveness and
intrinsic value. It is the favorite family paper wherever introduced.
It has something for every member
of the family, and is always pure, bright,
helpful, entertaining, and Pre-eminently
readable. Whenever a fair trial has
been given to the Goudex Rile it has
almost always secured a permanent subscriber. It is on this ground that a
new departure is made in the history of
newspaper enterprise.
Read the following offer :
To any reader of The Manifesto.
not now a, subscriber to the Golden
Rule, sending $1.00 in stamps or otherwise, the Golden Rule will be sent one
year from the time the subscription is received.
Although this sum does not nearly
cover the actual expense of the paper
thus sent, we know that it will be a
good investment in the end, as experience has shown that when the paper
has once gained a foothold in a family,
it is almost sure to become a constant
guest. Newspapers are like people ; it
takes time to get acquainted with them,
but when once an attachment is formed
it is hard to break.
Write at once, enclosing $1.00, and
mention The Manifesto. You are
sure of twice your money's worth, at
least.    Address,
