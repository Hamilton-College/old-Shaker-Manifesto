THE MANIFESTO.
THE STANDARD DIOTIONAKY.
New loork published by
FUNK  &�   WAGNAIL.
The literary world has become enriched
by the recent accession to its time-honored
ranks of a "Millionaire" work on the study
of words; the first volume of The Standard Dictionary, published by Funk &
Wagnall, New York, by subscription only.
The second volume will be ready in about
three months and it will complete the
work. The publishers state that the cost
of the work will be a round million dollars, and that it will contain three times
the number of words to be found in Worcester, more than double the number contained in Webster's new edition,�which
cost the publisher of it one third of a
million dollars,�and about fifty thousand
more words than are contained in the six
volumes of the Century complete  edition.
To complete the work, nearly three
hundred office editors and specialists with
assistant experts from Australia, India,
Natal, and the Cape, have been engaged
for the last four years, in introducing every known addition to all previous lexicons hitherto published, and so to build
the latest critical improvements upon both
the older and the most recent dictionaries
of the English language. This numerous
editorial staff has been selected from the
front rank of American, Canadian, and
English scholars, and from the schools of
science, literature, and art, including experts from every trade and handicraft. Its
pages thus reflect the completeness of all
the publications of the past, and of the
criticism and scholarship of the present
age. As an indication of the care bestowed upon the work, the author's corrections
and alterations, were five and a half times
the original cost for type composition.
The dictionary was granted the award of
a diploma and medal at the World's Fair
at Chicago, and it was the only class of
awards given.    We have made numerous
references both to the volume before us
and also to the specimen pages of what
will duly appear in the second volume.
Most of them were crucial references by
comparison, and were all read and thought
out very slowly. The result of the prolonged investigation is, that we feel justified in stating our belief that the book
contains the requisite fundamentals for
every man of letters engaged in the study
and practice of the evolutionized English
Language of to-day. The constructive
character of the work has been carried
forward upon original plans throughout;
indirectly, by giving iconoclastic attention
to the debris of the past, and directly, by
introducing all originally acquired material likely in the smallest degree to add to
the completeness of the undertaking. It
is altogether beyond our limits, and our
scope of review, to give a notice commensurate with the importance of the book,
and we therefore can only allude briefly to
a few of its distinctive features.
The printing of the work has been
looked at from an original and scientific
standpoint for which there exists no precedent from the pens hitherto employed in
furnishing lexicographer's "copy." Every
word selected for explanation is printed�
as it should be, when one comes to think
of its "plebeian" ancestry,�with a small
initial letter; except proper nouns and
their derivatives, whose "Royal" presence
is duly announced in its characteristic
"Capital" letter from typo's "upper case"
sanctum.
Facility of reference has been carefully
thought out, with the result, that an instantaneous look, either at the outside, or
at any part of the book, as it lies upon
the desk, open or closed, and a single
movement of the hand, is all that is necessary to lead either the hurried or nervous
student to the desired letter in any part
of the book, without the least possibility
of halt. All the illustrations are to be
found in their proper places in the body
of the work, and not bound separately at
the end of the volume. A new device is
the use of the German double hyphen for
compound words, leaving the  single hy-
<pb n="" id="p4"/>
THE MANIFESTO.
phen for the mere division of  words into
parts.    The principles  of spelling reform
adopted by the American Philological Association  are utilized with a pronounced,
bold and vigorous hand.    Chemical terms
have been  made   the   subject   of   much
thought and investigation.    The changed
form of many words relating thereto, have
been adopted  principally at the desire of
the chemical section of the American Association for the advancement  of science.
The terms peculiar  to  any  church   have
been edited by a representative of the par.
ticular  church  or  organization to which
those words respectively belong, giving to
the definitions thus obtained a satisfactory
and an authoritative character.   A new interest is given to the list of  synonyms  by
the addition of their antithetics, the Antonym. The quotations have received a thorough attention some of  them  being unusually interesting.    Under the  word beef
is the following note: uIt is curious to observe that the names of almost all animals,
so long as they are alive, are Saxon, but
�when dressed and prepared for food, they
thus became Norman, for the Saxon  hind
had the charge and labor of attending and
feeding  them  but   only  that they might
appear on the table of  his  Norman  lord.
Thus ox, steer, cow, are Saxon, but  beef
Norman; calf is Saxon, but veal Norman;
sheep  is  Saxon,   but  mutton   Norman."
From a few test searches, it will be  easy
to discover the skilful pen of the editorial
expert, both in breadth of treatment, and
depth of investigation.    For instance, the
word  gem  is  treated with an illustrated
page  of  82 exquisitely colored gems and
precious stones, numbered and tabulated
from the editorial pen of G. F. Kunz, the
gem expert of  Tiffany & Co., New  York,
who was a honorary special agent at the
World's   Columbian    Exhibition.      With
these colored gems is included the breast
plate of the Jewish High Priest; and to
produce this correctly in every detail, the
services of Rabbi  Gottheili were secured.
The word coin is treated by a four and a
half column table of the principal current
and obsolete coins of the world, with their
approximate values.     There is also a full
page plate, giving the facsimiles of 36  remarkable  ancient  coins,  amongst  which
we soon observed the-pictorial of that tiny
gift to the treasury of the  Temple, which
became emblazoned in the page of sacred
history as  The   Widow's  Mite.    The  engraving  of this notable coin was from an
original coin in the possession  of Professor Chas. E. West, Brooklyn, N. Y. There
is also a full page explanation of the plates.
The  spectrum will include   the   exact
definition of  the   six  primary colors, and
they will be accompanied by a table giving the analysis of several hundred shades
and  tints  now  before  the public.    This
will be the work of the  physical  department of Columbia College.    Such a valuable  application  of   science  to every day
life will enable any shade  to   be matched
exactly in any part of  the world,    Prussian Blue, for instance, consists of 4 parts
standard  red, 9 parts   standard green, 45
parts   standard ultramarine, and 42 paits
black; and Vermillion consists of 77 parts
standard red, and 23 parts of standard orange.    Most valuable  scientific  information this, to find its way into any  dictionary.    To go to an altogether different subject, the movements of the horse will be
illustrated with  full  definitions  of  each
movement, whether the animal walks, ambles, paces, canters, trots or gallops, and
these movements covering as they do all
the degrees of speed are fully dealt with
by Eadweard Muybridge of  Philadelphia;
the Standard Authority of the science of animal locomotion.    All these various movements will be further  illustrated by a full
page of 72 instantaneous photographic outlines   under   the  same  able  supervision.
Slang!  is  also  dealt  with  in   the   same
thorough, and let us hope  discreet, treatment that technical terms have received.
This has been on the broad principle that
the  book is made a recorder of use, and
that many of the slang words of  one  age,
become the recognized literary words of a
succeeding age.    Guided  by this acceptable principle, the editors have "scooped"
up from the colloquial slums of the past a
"submerged tenth"   of the unrecordable
whims and eccentricities of the unbridled

                            letter of to-day we respectfully refer you to our publication in the Russellville Herald of
                            the 16th inst. Respectfully, John N. Rankin. U. E. Johns. In 1861 there was great excitement
                            in the southern states, on account of the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidential
                            Office, and as a matter of course the Believers of South Union became very anxious about
                            their home, in case there should be any extended trouble between the North and South. This
                            subject has for many years, been discussed by the South, and has arisen because of the
                            institution of slavery. [The slave states anticipated the possibility of forming an
                            independent government, and counted on the large number of northerners who were indirectly
                            interested in slavery, and accumulating riches through slave labor. Ed.] In January, 1861,
                            the dwelling of the West Family was burned to the ground. The Brethren had been burning out
                            the chimneys and had all left the place for other occupations, so that it was never known,
                            correctly, how the fire originated. A part of the property that was in the house was
                            fortunately saved. This calamity deprived the family of their dwelling, and the Brethren and
                            Sisters were received in other homes of their gospel friends. APRIL, 1894.<pb n="78" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 78 THE MANIFESTO. In 1860, Elder Harvey L. Eads wrote the following prophetic words:� "I
                            have long believed that the present state of things would come to pass. It has come a little
                            sooner than I anticipated, yet, I think that if the Cotton or Gulf states do not fire the
                            first gun, a civil war may be averted, hut if they do burn povsder against the government,
                            then twenty millions at the North will be arranged against ten millions from the South, and
                            such havoc and slaughter as there will be, can scarce find a parallel in the annuls of the
                            world! One shudders at the thought! ! The result of a war will be, it seems to me, the
                            freedom of every slave that may be left alive in the United States." [But the South fired
                            the first gun; the war came; the havoc and carnage followed for both North, and South, and
                            then came the emancipation of slavery. Ed.] The Believers at South Union suffered a great
                            deal of annoyance during the time of the civil war. The Southern soldiers on their march
                            from Russellville to Bowling Green, as well as in going the other way, made it convenient to
                            pitch their tents near the Shakers, and demand of them food for the men and forage for the
                            horses. Sometimes these companies amounted to six or eight hundred. They came at all hours
                            of the day and night and their orders must be regarded. For some things the Shakers received
                            compensation, but hundreds of meals were given away. Their fences were burned, their hay and
                            oats carried off and their horses and wagons "pressed" into the service of the army. Tramps
                            were also prowling around the buildings, and acting in the capacity of sneak thieves. These
                            were a constant annoyance. Near the close of the war the Federal soldiers made it convenient
                            to stop at South Union to obtain food and shelter, yet one instance only is recorded when
                            any form of a fight occurred on the consecrated soil of the Believers, of which we shall
                            speak later. At this time, 1861, the Believers at South Union, Ky., seem to be in the "midst
                            of war and rumors of wars." Our once United States are divided and the North and South are
                            fiercely engaged in the act of destroying each other. The savagery of warfare fills the air
                            and men made fierce with prejudice and hate and infuriated with rum, are running wildly from
                            place to place, determined to rule or ruin. The doctrine of state rights and the maintenance
                            of slavery in the southern states is the bone of contention. As singular as it may seem,
                            nearly all the ministers of the several denominations in the southern states, were for the
                            continuance of that horrible system of human slavery, and were preaching to their
                            congregations, that it was sanctioned by the word of God, in the Bible. Large numbers of
                            cotton manufacturers, as well as hundreds of political aspirants who had an eye to the
                            southern vote, were in sympathy with the South, and were willing to work for slavery in
                            order to increase tiieir own chances for the schemes of political selfishness.<pb n="79" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 79 This influential encouragement, no doubt, was an effective
                            stimulus to the slave oligarchy to threaten what would be done, unless they could peaceably
                            be let alone. But slavery was destined to go, and the prayers of the hireling priests were
                            spent on the air, and although it demanded a great sacrifice of both the North and the
                            South, in the destruction of property and in the loss of life, victory was on the side of
                            humanity. The Believers living in the state of Kentucky were subjected to much unpleasant
                            treatment, and to a great loss of property, although occupying a neutral position, and
                            prevented from taking an active part with either the North or South, as this would be a
                            violation of their religious principles. They were obliged to use the utmost care in
                            conversation, and in their actions, lest they should give offence to their military
                            visitors, who were alternately with them from the northern and southern armies. [That they
                            were made able to meet the many and absolute demands of an excited army, and still be so
                            wonderfully protected, is a miracle of God's love and care. Ed.] In April, 1861, we hear
                            that Fort Sumter has been fired upon by the South. The war is now raging. The ball is set in
                            motion and who can predict the end? The first speck of war that was made visible to us was
                            on the 15th of August when a company of cavalry, numbering about eighty-six persons, under
                            the command of the rebel Colonel Forest, reached our village from the north. Little flags
                            from the Confederacy were fastened near the ears of the horses for ornamentation. They moved
                            on very civilly till they reached the mill pond, a short distance beyond our dwellings,
                            where they encamped for the night. We provided them with food for supper and also for
                            breakfast' and the Brethren gave them, without charge, a supply of apples and peaches. They
                            obtained some corn of Bluitt, who is the station agent, and some oats of Yost, who lived
                            about one mile west of our Village. Colonel Forest formerly resided in Memphis, Tenn., and
                            had come into Kentucky to muster in this company, which he intended to take to Camp Boone in
                            Tennessee for drill, and then to return them to Kentucky, for use in the southern army. In
                            the morning the Col. addressed his men, and informed them that if any present wished to
                            return to their homes they would please walk to the left of the company, as this was their
                            last and only chance for dismissal. At the close of his remarks, six of the volunteers
                            stepped aside from the body of men, and for the acceptance of this offer, the Col. traduced
                            them, in the worst of the King's English; and the Shaker Brethren who heard the language,
                            were surprised at the good conduct of those who received it. These poor fellows, however,
                            had by their short and sad experience, become sufficiently enlightened to see the pit into
                            which they had fallen, and held with tenacity to their good resolution and returned to their
                                homes.<pb n="80" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 80 THE MANIFESTO. As the Col. had furnished no blankets, the
                            soldiers were obliged to lie on the bare ground at night, and but few would be able to
                            endure that hardship. This company made a raid upon our cabbage bed and carried off a few
                            heads, and then upon the garden of melons, with the same results. In this they showed an
                            independence of character, even without fighting. In all other respects the soldiers behaved
                            as well as one could expect, under these circumstances. Sept. 17. The Confederate General,

                            and then seized all the stock belonging to the railroad that passed between Bowling Green,
                            Ky., and C larks ville, Tenn., which closed all correspondence between South Union and any
                            place in the northern or loyal States. Sept. 23. Brother Urban Johns, who was the senior
                            trustee at South Union, had received some Confederate bank bills and wished to make a
                            journey to Pleasant Hill and then to the banks in Louisville to exchange them for specie.
                            These bills were worth about fifty or seventy-five cents on a dollar. He returned about the
                            first of October. We were now having a new experience, and learning what it was to be shut
                            up and in bondage. Not one word can we send to any of our friends out of the State, until it
                            passes the examination of those who assume the military control of those now in authority,
                            who were neither friends to us nor to our profession. What an awl'ul condition we are placed
                            in at this time; not a newspaper could be obtained from the northern states and only
                            occasionally one from any of the Confederate States. Oct. 29. Generals Johnson and Buckner
                            sent agents to take our horses and wagons by force, which force they delicately term
                            "pressing." Some of our unkind neighbors came with the soldiers to point out the property to
                            be pressed, and as "might is right" in this case we are forced to abide the result. Fifty
                            yards of blanket cloth were taken from the factory, valued at sixty dollars. The horses and
                            wagons were valued at $1250.00 for which we received $680.00 One of our neighbors,
                            accompanied by his wife, made himself very officious in pointing out to these armed men the
                            places where our horses and wagons could be found. A Dr. Rhea also did what he could to
                            assist the soldiers in taking our property. After they had selected a wagon, Rhea induced
                            them to exchange for a new one belonging to Br. George Rankin. Of course the exchange was
                            soon made. They selected six wagons and as many harnesses, and then ordered the Brethren to
                            bring forward eleven horses, and having an extra horse which they had taken by force, they
                            were harnessed and attached to the wagons. The Brethren did not think it wise to disregard
                            the orders, but made the teams ready and started that evening for Bowling Green. The

                            accosted Br. Urban with a sarcastic smile,�"Well, Urban, if you had been as good a southern
                            rents' man as I am, you could have kept all your horses." Br. Urban's only reply was,�"I did

                                    six sisters and three brothers from Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., who spoke on the "Shaker
                                    Organization and its History." The fu-st speaker was KL-.ler Daniel Offord, who said
                                    it gave him great pleasure to have the kind invitation of your pastor and to meet
                                    our friends in Pittsfield. When we look upon the Christian system it is the widest
                                    and most liberal in the world. It is like the beautiful sun rays or the showers of
                                    rain that descend upon the just and the unjust and upon the evil and the good. It is
                                    one of the principles laid down by our order that we should be what we seem to be,
                                    and seem to be what we are. And so we come to you just as we are, not as orators. We
                                    have lived the truth as we have received it. [He came to the Shakers when he was
                                    thirteen years old, and has been with them thirty-seven years, therefore, he ought
                                    to know something about them.], Our name came through derision, and we accepted it.
                                    Although we call ourselves disciples of the second coming of Christ, we do sometimes
                                    shake, therefore, we are Shakers. The Shakers were founded by a woman, Ann Lee, who
                                    was born in Manchester, England, in 1736. She was of poor parents, and could neither
                                    read nor write, but that was nothing uncommon in those days, as poor children did
                                    not have the opportunity of attending school as they do now and with compulsory
                                    school laws in many places. She became acquainted with the Quaker order, and while
                                    in it she became convicted of sin and the evils that were prevailing at that time
                                    especially among the women, and she received some wonderful revelations from God. It
                                    must be remembered that the women of the eighteenth century in England occupied much
                                    the same position as the colored race in America in the nineteenth century. She was
                                    merely the slave of man, and he was at liberty to beat her with a broomstick if he
                                    wanted. If she married, all her property went to her husband and she had no control
                                    of it whatever. Ann Lee saw these outrages and publicly denounced them<pb n="82" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 82 THE MANIFESTO. and spoke her revelation. She was persecuted and
                                    driven from place to place, and finally in 1774 with eight of her followers, she
                                    came to America after an eventful passage across the water. They came here where
                                    they could worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. They were
                                    carrying out their belief on shipboard and the captain becnm &gt; very angry and was
                                    going to throw them overboard. A big wave came and washed up a plank of the vessel
                                    and the captain said they were all going to drown. She said they were not going to
                                    drown and told them to get at the pumps, when another wave came and drove the plank
                                    back to its place. This is not a fable, but a fact. They settled near Albany, N. Y.,
                                    and they began a revival in New Lebanon, and Rev. Joseph Meacham of the Baptist
                                    faith was one of the first converts. They wanted to start a church there, but they
                                    could not without a woman as they must have equal rights. Then came Lucy Wright of
                                    this city among the first converts and they together started a church, and
                                    established the Shaker organization. Among other early converts was Joseph Darrow,
                                    who owned considerable property, and dedicated it all to the society. We do not
                                    accept one because he is rich, or reject one on account of poverty, and any who come
                                    to us and live as we do, is a brother or sister on equality. God raised up these
                                    Societies to supply a human net d. John Wesley and Methodism were raised up to
                                    supply a great need of the time and was similar to the Salvation Army of the present
                                    day. They operated upon the fears of mankind and preached hell and damnation. It was
                                    right as it was then needed. So it is with the Shakers. They came to humanity
                                    because of humanity's need, and it is needed now every day. Shakers believe in the
                                    second coming of Christ. The inspiration of Ann Lee led her to learn the cause and
                                    apply the remedy for human depravity; and who could do it better than a woman ? Then
                                    was revealed the two orders of the Society, the natural and the spiritual. The
                                    children of this world are married and given in marriage. You are all aware that
                                    Shakers do not marry. The natural order is all right if they obey the law. The end
                                    will come when the harvest comes and the harvest will come when we stop generating.
                                    They want war to depopulate the world but this was not the Shaker way. The Christian
                                    way was to stop raising children and live as brothers and sisters. This is a
                                    merciful way and by all living so, the harvest would soon come. The natural law is
                                    the animal law. God said, "Love your enemies." This law is the eternal truth of God.
                                    Do not take it for granted that we condemn marriage, for we do not. Ann Lee revealed
                                    the motherhood of God, the emancipation of woman on a level with man. It is a wonder
                                    to us that people can not see that there can not be a father without a mother. The
                                    image of God is male and female. This revelation of the Deity is what gave Ann Lee
                                    power to rise above lust. Our order is straight as straightness and<pb n="83" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 83 pure as the heavens. When our lives conform with
                                    Christ, we find the true treasure hid in Christ. The next speaker was Eldress Anna
                                    White, who said, we have one Lord, one faith and one baptism. When we think of
                                    Pittsfield forty years ago, a quaint little town, with twro or three churches and a
                                    school, and remember those with whom we wrere acquainted, and see the progress that
                                    it has made, with many gone to their reward and others in their places, we are
                                    reminded that this earth is not our abiding place. Christ was a baptized Jew, a
                                    mediator of the new covenant. He could not receive the fire of baptism until he had
                                    passed through the fire. Jesus was a progressive man from beginning to end. His life
                                    was pre-eminently beautiful, and wh^n baptized with thi Christ-like spirit He spake
                                    as never man spake. It was said that the seed of the woman should bruise the
                                    serpent's head. The serpent's head is the lust of the flesh. Virgin purity is our
                                    corner stone, and a Christ-like spirit, a true love of God and mankind is our
                                    cap-stone. There are sixteen Societies in existence. The chain can never be broken,
                                    as it is of divine origin. The children that have been taken into our orders number
                                    thousands, who have had instilled in their minds virtue, truth and purity. We are in
                                    the world with you, but not of the world. There are many in the world who are
                                    fighting the battle of life alone and such have our sympathy. We may be very remote
                                    from each other and still be more united than near neighbors. Truth is a unit and of
                                    God. It is said that the Shakers would run the world out, but it is those who live
                                    in their lusts in the world that will run it out. We are egotistical. We know we
                                    have the truth revealed. "Come and let us reason together." Then Catherine Allen
                                    spoke briefly on "The Self-Improvement Society." "Not slothful in business, fervent
                                    in spirit," our people have not been neglectful of that higher culture. Our young
                                    people have instruction in instrumental and vocal music. For some years our monthly
                                    magazine has contained some of our best thoughts in printed form. We have the
                                    "Floral Ethical Society," at Canaan. The boys have each taken the name of some tree,
                                    and the girls the name of some flower. Our society meets each week. We seek the
                                    truth. Each member is bound not to make any sarcastic remarks of another or use any
                                    slang or profane words. Each one is expected to read an original verse of poetry,
                                    prose, or an essay. The fruit of our meetings has been very gratifying, and the
                                    young study more about our order and the various reforms of the day. Charles Greaves
                                    then spoke briefly. He said this is a new thing. Either you are traveling toward the
                                    Shakers or the Shakers are traveling toward you. I think it is a little of both, as
                                    we are all Shakers of some kind, for you here in Pittsfield have shaken off the
                                    saloons, but look out that they do not come back. We are a little peculiar as a
                                    people and dress peculiarly, but that is only external. We have no creed, but we are
                                    full of reforms. Wo-<pb n="84" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 84 THE MANIFESTO. man's rights started
                                    among the Shakers. Any body that shakes off a bad habit is a Shaker. We need to come
                                    together and see each other eye to eye. Marriage is at the bottom of all evils.
                                    Those who are out of work can come to us and we will find employment for them.
                                    Cecelia DeVere was the last speaker. She said her heart goes out to the beautiful
                                    women of Pittsfield. She found nothing in the churches to suit her life, when she
                                    came to the Shakers she found all. May not these Berkshire hills be the field of
                                    great achievements. There is no freedom for the man who can not honestly make a
                                    living. We have our home. She found the heavenly motherhood in the Shakers. The
                                    speaking was interspersed by singing by the Shakers of several hymns entitled,
                                    "Conquering Legions," "The Savior's Promise," "Weary nut, Christian Pilgrim," and
                                    "Christian World." Although the Shakers have been in Mt. Lebanon one hundred and
                                    twenty years, this was their first invitation to speak in Pittsfield.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Berkshire County  Eagle" TEIform="index"/>Berkshire County Eagle.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Suggestion" TEIform="index"/>A SUGGESTION.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Dowe, Arthur W."

                            the knowledge and resources gained by a century of labor anu experience, in not only
                            ministering to the present needs of those who are suffering the effects of sin and
                            ignorance, but in bringing to birth a system that will prevent a repetition of the same
                            state of affairs in the age to come. Certainly no one who has recognized the Divine
                            compassion manifested in the humanity of Jesus the Christ, and who possesses a grain of the
                            virtue of Charity, will contend that the misery surrounding him on all sides is none of his
                            affair; nor will he be likely to repeat the question of the murderous Cain, "Am I my
                            brother's keeper?" On the contrary, the mere fact that fellow beings "made of one flesh and
                            blood to dwell together upon the face of the earth," are, through wrong thinking and doing
                            on the part of themselves or others, suffering for the simplest necessities of food,
                            shelter, and clothing, ought to call forth a fellow-feeling in the hearts of all, and one
                            that will be practically manifested in deeds of tender mercy and loving kindness, and not
                            merely in words and empty prayers. To Believers, who have become dead to the world and alive
                            unto God through the example and teaching of Christ and Mother and who now rejoice<pb n="85" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 85 in the calling of ministering angels of light and love, the
                            responsibility of acting quickly and wisely becomes most pressing. Will it not be well for
                            us as a body, to beware lest some one take our crown? Brethren and Sisters, the Lord God of
                            Mother Ann calls us to work, "The harvest is ripe, the laborers few." Action is life.
                            Stagnation is death. Statistics show that there are several millions of idle and destitute
                            persons in this United States, the majority of whom, when asked the question "Why stand ye
                            here all the day idle?" would respond "because no man has hired us." Now, while it is true
                            that Believers are not overburdened with wealth, they can at least contribute their "Widow's
                            mite" in doing all that they are able to do; and the inventive genius, so long developed in
                            them through quietness and meditation, surely ought to be able to evolve some scheme of
                            practice, that will bring a measure of peace and comfort to many of the "unemployed." Will
                            you permit a suggestion, that, if properly carried out, may in a great degree, prove a
                            lasting benefit to many a poor soul, as well as a joy and crown to faithful Believers ? Many
                            of the Societies are at present encumbered with more land than they can practically utilize
                            ; large tracts, upon which heavy taxes have to be paid are lying idle for want of hands to
                            cultivate them ; extensive improvements that might be made are obliged to be abandoned,
                            because the whole of the time and attention of the Society is demanded elsewhere. The hardy
                            workers of yore are rapidly passing away and there is very little influx of new life and
                            muscle to take their places. Mills, shops and other branches of industry closed either from
                            a lack of laborers, or from outside competition. In many of our Villages, large and
                            expensive buildings fitted with all necessary articles of comfort with scores of unoccupied
                            rooms are patiently waiting for tenants to come in and enjoy their hospitable shelter. STow
                            what excuse have we to offer before God, if, while millions are in need, and are perishing
                            for the lack of these things, we who profess to love our neighbor as ourselves, keep from
                            them those things which we ourselves can not use? It would seem, with the light that Mother
                            has given us, we ought to see a way by which we can be a blessing to those outside of the
                            fold, and thus reap a blessing for ourselves. Why not at once call for a report from the
                            different Societies, as to the amount of land, buildings etc., that could be made available
                            and thus utilized ; then compute the number of persons who could be employed and supported.
                            As soon as this is done let the Societies make their kind invitation public through the
                            newspapers or otherwise, under proper restrictions, and there is little doubt that the offer
                            would attract the attention of many good people,<pb n="86" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> 86 THE MANIFESTO. who
                            have the welfare of humanity at heart who would provide the necessary transportation to
                            those in need. Persons thus coming in to fill the demand, could then be grouped and
                            organized for service according to sex and occupation. Every thing needed by them, should if
                            possible, be made by their own labor as soon as circumstances would admit. Fair living wages
                            should be paid for their labor, with a margin to provide for old age or sickness, but these
                            wages should not be in money but in time or labor checks that would be receivable at the
                            Society store for goods, rents, board, etc. All of which should be furnished at as nearly
                            first cost as possible, the end in view being to benefit the needy ones, and not to make
                            profit out of their necessities. Having gathered them into working order, and supplied their
                            temporal wants, the gospel should then be given to them as they are able to bear it, and in
                            neighborly acts and words of kindness, its great object lessons taught by living example,
                            letting the light of the Divine life shine upon them: providing a healthy outlet for the
                            exercise of the spiritual gifts and graces of Believers as well as uplifting those who are
                            wandering and falling in darkness. Rules and regulations, firm but kind, would of course be
                            established and the first principles of obedience thoroughly inculcated. By the abolishing
                            of money as a medium of exchange, among those employed, and holding the base of supplies in
                            their own hands for wise and proper use, Believers would be able to thoroughly eradicate the
                            evils of drunkenness, gambling and other kindred vices, thus prepare a good soil for gospel
                            seed. There is but little doubt that by these means many precious souls might be eventually
                            won for Christ and gathered into his kingdom. There are doubtless many difficulties that
                            would arise, but who are better prepared or more able to meet and overcome every obstacle,
                            than men and women filled with the love and power of God? The above is offered as a
                            suggestion, without details, as space in our precious Manifesto is limited, but it is
                            sincerely prayed that it may be the means of awakening much earnest thought on the subject
                            which will eventually bring forth fruit unto the glory of our God and his

                            Word," he knew quite well the necessity of the constant presentation of the testimony of
                            righteousness. Paul was himself an active worker in the cause of Christ and had been
                            earnestly contending for the faith as it was delivered to the saints. Preaching the word was
                            a manifestation of the life of the church. It gave the best evidence that living witnesses
                            were still unflinchingly engaged in diffusing light from God, and in establishing a kingdom
                            of peace among men. They had already learned the fact, that "Faith comes by hearing," and
                            that faith in God is essential for those who would walk successfully in that life which the
                            divine Teacher so clearly illustrated. A wave of thought from the same source pleasantly
                            passed over the consecrated home of the dear friends of Mt. Lebanon and they cheerfully
                            responded. Possibly the Believers had been reading the charge that was given to Timothy, and
                            as they read they acted upon the force of its inspiration and kindly and lovingly carried
                            the word of God into the presence of those who listened with pleasure. It was the one visit
                            of a century, and yet its influence for good may extend over the space of another century.
                            If in the good providence of God, a multiplied interest should be extended and the hymns and
                            psalms and words of Christian kindness be sung or spoken, who can say what the spiritual
                            outcome of it may be to the city and to the individual listeners. "God moves in a mysterious
                            way His wonders to perform." Others may take heart and become interested in gathering the
                            latent good that is in our communal homes and present it as a token of joy that now is, as
                            well as of that eternal treasure which is to come. As we enter into the fruitfulness of the
                            work of Christ, we shall be inclined to exalt the Lord our God, and with no uncertain sound
                            proclaim, "Behold, now is the accepted time ; now is the day of salvation," instead of
                            looking into the distant future for what should be at our own door. The good Book is
                            emphatic on this subject, and awards the blessing to those who give, in preference to those
                            who receive, and establishes the progressive life of the race of man. Give as God gives. He
                            sends his rain upon the lands of the just and the unjust. He makes his sun to shine upon the
                            evil as upon the good. "Go ye into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye
                            receive." And just here comes the necessity of giving information, as best<pb n="88" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 88 THE MANIFESTO. we may, where the vineyard of the Lord may be found. "Seek
                            and ye shall find." It is beyond the strait gate and on either side of the King's highway.
                            It is where God has established his name for righteousness. Where good seed is sown that
                            will bring forth some thirty, some sixty and some an hundred fold. Where good vines are
                            planted and are known, without doubt, that they will yield abundant good fruit. Laborers are
                            already there and actively engaged in their allotted work of redeeming the world from sin,
                            and resting assured that they shall receive a full reward for all their labors. There may be
                            some who are yet standing idle, or are not engaged in any profitable work. These need to be
                            better informed. The Lord's vineyard under the care of his laborers should be a beautiful
                            place, and the workmen should be interested in its protection and prosperity. Those who work
                            far a day and are expecting the compensation of one or two pennies, may do more or less good
                            for God and his people. To be able to work for God and the good of humanity, even for one
                            day will not fail to bring its reward, but a faithful continuance in well-doing is the only
                            safe road to final success. To stand idle, whether in the vineyard or on the corners of the
                            streets, is a clear representation of a class of minds that are quite alike in their
                            interests. Called of God for active work in the establishing of righteousness among men, it
                            is sad that so many grow lukewarm, as did the church of Laodicea, and even with greater
                            light and more extended privileges, can not otherwise than meet a corresponding fate. As God
                            is good, so all that flows from that source must bear the impress of his goodness. No class
                            of people can absorb the whole. All are finite and all are quite sure that there may be more
                            or less iniquity in the birth or that has reached the soul since that date. It is an
                            inheritance that we are forced to accept without qualification. To overcome this inheritance
                            in part or to a fullness, is the effort of every man and woman who appreciates a better
                            state of society while on the earth. It is not that all men should see alike or believe
                            alike, unless they are specially organized for that purpose, but that all who love
                            righteousness and hate iniquity, should work in the interest of that which will make this
                            earth a more pleasant dwelling place for men and women. And what of our own religious
                            profession ? We know that it is an exalted work; that it is sacred, and we as readily say,
                            it is of God. It is clearly presented to the world for inspection. If we are as faithful as
                            the profession demands, we may possibly hear the voice of the good angels as they sing,
                            "well done ;" while on the other hand if unfaithful to the light which God has given, we are
                            quite sure of the unpleasant result.</p></div2><pb n="89" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="God our trust" TEIform="index"/>GOD OUR TRUST.</head><p TEIform="p">" Thou art my hope, O Lord, God; thou art my trust from my youth.

                                to lodegrees below zero, still we know that "Spring is somewhere in the land For we hear
                                the bluebirds sing," and we wish, if we dare not hope, that our cold weather which has
                                come to us in such "huge lumps" during the past two months, has spent itself.
                                Nevertheless we shall not mind if there is "more to follow" as we dare not trust an
                                early spring in these uncertain latitudes. We best like the close covering of winter;
                                until it is ready to make its final bow. Since our last notes we have been somewhat
                                afflicted with an epidemic, borne to us either by ill winds or defective drains. If by
                                the former we must study to keep the blood so pure, that the seeds of disease may not
                                germinate in the system. If by the latter we should remember, that "God is the safety of
                                his people, but we tempt Providence, if we do not use the necessary means for our
                                preservation." Still in every evil there is a good, and when affliction comes we learn
                                the real worth of true friends, whose religion has banished all thought of self, and
                                whose loving hearts speak of the angel within. Our loved Ministry left Lebanon, the 7th

                                snows will melt, and the blossoms fall, ere they return permanently to their central
                                home. We miss their loving ministrations, but strengthened by the good received, we ask
                                the blessings of heaven to supply the fountain from which so many draw. Our dear mother
                                Eldress Ann is still permitted to be one of earth's angels, active and happy as ever;
                                and we wonder as we cling to her with tender affection, if these filial cords have not
                                an influence to hold her still with us. Brother Frederic Sizer, now released from his
                                many years of burden, is another blessing we hold and prize. A good brother remarked
                                this morning, "I wonder if when I am eighty-seven, I shall be moving about as rapidly as
                                brother Frederic." We do not like to feel that our blessings are like birds of gay
                                plumage, best seen when flying away. We intend to prize them while they are ours, and
                                thus enhance their present and future value. Amelia J. Calver. Center Family. Mar. 1894.
                                Writing for The Manifesto seems to be kept up with as much interest and zeal by our
                                Brethren and Sisters of different Societies, as in former years. The weather for a few
                                days past has been remarkably good for March. Our Brethren are very busy sawing,
                                splitting and storing wood for future use. Our dairy is in a splendid condition. We have
                                at this place some of the best Jersey and Guernsey cows in the village, a fact of which
                                we are justly proud. Our dairy sister, Florinda Sears, also understands her part to
                                perfection. Some of our Sisters are doing a little sale-work, trying to make a few
                                "mighty dollars." Our school will soon close, we are sorry to say, as school is the
                                means of keeping the children out of mischief as well as fitting them for the future
                                battles of life. . . . . Esther Marion Scott. North. Family. Mar. 1894. We have had a
                                spell of spring-like weather for a week past. Have taken full advantage of it trimming
                                fruit trees and preparing for spring work. We are ready to plant some 137 pear and 24
                                plum trees, 150 currant and 750 raspberry sets when the land is ready to plow. They were
                                secured last fall and buried in the earth. We bought them, thinking we were more likely
                                to get what we wanted and of better stock than by ordering in the spring when nurserymen
                                are usually pushed. Fruit raising is the most agreeable and profitable part of our
                                business. We are aiming to develop and improve this branch. The future is with the fruit
                                grower. More fruit and fewer animals. This is in the line of physical and moral
                                evolution. It has been said that he who plants a tree is a benefactor to his race. We
                                are under a deep debt of gratitude to those who have gone before us for the legacies of
                                well stocked and fruitful orchards bequeathed to us. We are under obligations to do our
                                part for those who will follow us. "Seed time and harvest shall never fail." Now is the
                                time to plant and to sow. Conditions look gloomy, but prospects will brighten, and they
                                who have prepared the ground and put in the good seed will reap the harvest. As in the
                                physical, so in the spiritual, sow with a broad and liberal hand; never doubting. Be
                                encouraged, beloved companions, the hearts of the people are stirred. Gospel testimonies
                                were never listened to with more respect and appreciation than at the present time. The
                                "old heavens and the old earth are passing away." Tiie people are anxiously listening
                                for the heralds of the new. The article sent by us to the Congress of Keligions is

                                humanity, is very changeable and prone to go to extremes. The thermometer ranging from
                                60 above to 18 and 20 below zero. We have had some sleighing the past month and we have

                                periodical coming to our table is read with more pleasure than the "World's Advance
                                Thought and Universal Republic," published by Lucy A. Mallory, Portland, Ore. It is
                                brimful of sound testimonies that are needed to awaken the consciences of men and women
                                and bring them to a realization of what is necessary to lift from human society the
                                incubus that is hanging like a death pall over our nineteenth century civilization. We
                                have perused with pleasure the report of the proceedings of the "World's Congress of
                                Religions," and it brings joy to our spirit to know that ministering angels are at work
                                with humanity and that the divine Brother and Sisterhood of the race is a possibility.
                                An essay was delivered by Frances E. Willard, on "Social Purity," which is the testimony
                                of eternal truth and it has gone forth into the world bringing them to judgment in the
                                natural order and Believers can send forth a fervent prayer that the testimony may be
                                sustained as it will prepare them for the higher life. Besides our Society meetings and
                                singing meetings we have Saturday evening meetings and Sabbath evening singing schools
                                for our own family. It keeps an interest awakened on spiritual and social subjects which
                                can not fail to be beneficial. By the time these notes appear, your humble contributor
                                will be actively engaged, as far as the weather will permit, in the occupation of
                                preparing the family garden, and our earnest prayer is that all of our Brethren and
                                Sisters may have a prosperous year and that the tillers of the soil may have occasion to

Oue present environments are mud and water. March took his temporary position
                                as chief ruler, in a most bland and pleasing manner. Hope he may continue in this
                                agreeable mood and display none of his capricious habits. The sun's golden rays, and the
                                mild breezes that now fan the earth are fast diminishing the once lofty banks of snow.
                                Should the present fine weather continue, Br. Charles Prescott, the racy writer, may
                                soon be favored with an opportunity of resuming his rather forced occupation of tilling
                                the soil. As mutation however is stamped on all things terrestrial, we know that changes
                                are inevitable and must be met. A blizzard or cyclone may be next in order. What a happy

We are counseled to make our calling and election sure. Not only to be called
                                but to be Christians. The labor is great and unceasing, but the reward is also great.
                                The requirements for the work are to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit, which is
                                peace, purity, meekness, love, and other virtues. Those who are true cross-bearers have
                                the assurance that "neither things present nor things to come shall separate them from
                                the love of God." We should let the sunshine of peace, virtue, and earnest endeavor
                                brighten all our days. Our spiritual atmosphere must be very cold when we can not find
                                sunshine anywhere. It is well to pray but better still to watch. That is our work. Are

                                day to spray fruit trees to destroy blight and noxious insects. In a few years it will
                                be as common to spray fruit trees as it is now to eat the fruit. We could send some
                                recipes, for spraying fruit trees if acceptable, but we will report the result of
                                spraying in the fall if considered desirable. Our wood is all housed ready for use. We
                                have been dealing off old, worthless apple trees and think by taking better care of the

                                keep the shoots cut back. These last two items are considered the secret of peach

                                being invented. Dynamite is a pretty plaything for anarchists, I saw lately that it is
                                intended in case of war to send a ship, loaded with dynamite, into an enemy's squadron
                                and explode it in the midst, thus annihilating a whole fleet at one time; a seaport city
                                can be destroyed in the same manner. Surely war will soon become so horrible that
                                civilized men will shrink from it. We see indications of a desire to settle disputes by
                                arbitration among powerful nations. We may well bless every good thought. We have to
                                chronicle among other home improvements a cold storage room, one of the greatest

The 9th day of March and little snow to be seen. The patches of green grass

                                make a summer," we may have a good deal of winter yet. Our Brethren say it has been the
                                most favorable winter for lumbering known for years. 200 M. of pine and 40 M. of oak
                                delivered at the mill tell the story of part of their winter's work. Now the hum of the
                                saw as the fire-wood is being prepared for the coming year is not unpleasant music to
                                the farmer's ear. The Creamery Association that purchases the cream not needed for home
                                use, pays for it this year according to the fat shown in it by the Babcock test. We find
                                there is as much difference in creams as in any other food supplies. The last monthly
                                test showed 27 per cent of butter fat in the cream purchased of us and no more than half
                                that amount in some of the other creams tested. Our little Society has been blest with
                                fairly good health all winter. We do not forget to remember with thankful hearts the
                                many blessings we enjoy and would gladly share our home comforts with other souls who
                                may be willing to bring their minds into accord with the holy spirit which purified the

After a long silence I am once more writing an item for The Manifesto. We have
                                had cold weather, but it has frozen neither heart nor hand. Our hearts are as devoted as
                                ever and our hands know no idle moments. We have had plenty to do this winter fighting
                                the enemy La Grippe, who was an unwelcome visitor, yet he entered and tarried. We hope
                                he is now dislodged, and that he may never revisit this place. The time for our
                                Centennial is nearing. This Society was organized one hundred years ago the 19th and
                                20th days of April. Our fathers and mothers on those days made a verbal consecration to
                                God in the presence of each other of all they possessed, with every faculty of soul and
                                body. These vows they maintained to the end of their days. We can not celebrate the
                                anniversary in a grand way but hope to have grateful hearts to appreciate the good that
                                has come to us through their noble and devoted lives. May we live in such a way that
                                they can call us their children. The Brethren have been manufacturing metric dry

                                found smoke pouring out of the building in which our workmen lodge. Soon we had the hose
                                in readiness to test the efficiency of the new hydrants, but before the water was turned
                                on, the welcome crj came: "All out." Upon investigation, it was found that a former
                                workman had carelessly left some old quilts and papers near a stove pipe extending from
                                the room below. Little damage was clone however, beyond burning a large place on the
                                floor and damaging a robe or two. It would have been quite a loss to us in these "hard
                                times" even if we could hav^ confined the flames to this one building. We are grateful
                                that it was not more serious and we count it as one of God's blessings that we were
                                spared a conflagration. Spring has made us an early call. Our wood supply is being
                                sawed, and the buzz of the saw in the air sounds decidedly like April. Our Ministry
                                arrived on the 1st inst. and are now blessing us with their presence. On the 5 th we

                                Bluebirds were reported on the 8th, but not a sign of a robin as yet. The "sugar makers"

                                commencement of our notes than a quotation from Elder Andrew Barrett's essay on
                                "Cultivation" in our March number: "Make home life interesting;" that is, call into

                                lives. The saying, Man can not live by bread alone, embodies a volume of suggestive
                                thought. Knowledge of Christian duties teaches that all inspirations from literature,
                                meditation, or the loveliness of nature are divine sources i'rom which to be benefited
                                and those having a life mission of purity and doing good to humanity, realize that
                                "there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them

                                harvest of fruit with some solicitude; for we have had no fruit of any kind to speak of
                                for two years. But right here one of the gravest questions of life presents itself to
                                me, how much does happiness consist of, and depend on, what we eat, drink and wear?
                                According to the teaching of our Savior there was almost nothing at all in eating,
                                drinking and wearing to make one permanently happy. Indeed, though they are animal
                                pleasures, how very soon they pall! how soon they pass away, their remembrance is
                                scarcely worth calling up. Hundreds of thousands of English, Irish, Germans and French
                                live on two or three varieties of plain, simple food, and among them may he found some
                                of the most happy, contented and cheerful people on earth. I suppose heaven is a
                                condition of happiness, but Jesus said it did not consist in eating and drinking, but in
                                "Righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." These elements emanate from, and are
                                the attributes of the Eternal; and when permanently possessed they are an eternal
                                treasure, one that can never fail. For instance; suppose I was in possession of these
                                elements permanently, (and I think that is about the region I hail from,) then along
                                comes the frost and kills all my fruit. What do I care? there are other things I can
                                eat. Next the cattle die in the stall. Still there are bread and vegetables. These are
                                quite sufficient to support animal life and that is all I need them for. But, suppose I
                                am euchred out of my farm, houses and all I possessed, then what? Why I must become a
                                town charge and eat very coarse food sufficient to keep soul and body together, and wear
                                coarse clothes. What now? In such extremity will those elements of "Righteousness, peace
                                and joy in the Holy Spirit" still uphold me, and furnish serenity and contentment of
                                mind and satisfied at-one-ment with God? If they will not, I am utterly undone, for all
                                temporal and earthly resources have failed me. If they will not, then the Savior's words
                                are not true and he has deceived me, broken his promise and left me in suicidal despair.
                                I believe as much as I believe that the sun will rise to-morrow, that though these
                                calamities should overtake me, I could meet them with content- * ment and Christ-like
                                resignation and enjoy all that peace and happiness our Holy Savior promised and which he
                                called the kingdom of heaven. As this kingdom emanates from the eternal source of all
                                good, it is so plenteous in power and such perpetual duration, that no such outward
                                adversities should or could shake it to pieces. I have labored long and seriously on
                                this subject, because I found myself in days gone by placing my interest in the
                                enjoyment of what was good to eat, drink and wear; an elegant home and plenty of every
                                thing even to luxury. I suddenly waked up to the utterly fugitive character of all
                                earthly treasures even "wealth like London Bank;" seeing that cyclone, cataclysm or
                                holocaust might sweep them away at any time in a moment. Then where would I be if my
                                heart was set upon them to the exclusion of my higher interests? All day after our
                                fearful cyclone in 1886, I sat viewing and pondering over the solemn desolation spread
                                around and it was a very momentous lesson to me of what fugitive materials, houses,
                                lands, eating and drinking were on which to build for happiness. When our South Building
                                went up in fire and smoke, the painful lesson was repeated with agonizing emphasis.
                                These things all forced me to seek first, last, and all the time "the kingdom of heaven
                                within" and the Shekina of that God who sits enthroned thereon. I have found it and am
                                ready for any thing that may come. We visited South Union on Jan. 30th and returned Feb.

                                Your well-fraught little messenger The Manifesto, is anxiously looked for and eagerly
                                perused each month. Now, I come to Canterbury and find you and co-laborers toiling to
                                have it in readiness. I stop and wonder if I could cast a mite that would shed a faint
                                ray of joy or encouragement to any of its thousands of readers. We may not be able to
                                name all the planets nor to describe their swift motion, but we can endorse a life of
                                consecration to God, by striving to aid each other in climbing the rugged hill of Hie. A
                                word kindly spoken, a smile, or a small act of charity or mercy has started many a poor
                                wanderer on the highway to true felicity, who otherwise might have sunk beneath a weight
                                of sin and discouragement. When I look through the Manifesto and find nothing in it from
                                Pleasant Hill, an indescribable feeli#ig steals over me. Yet it seems that little more
                                can be said; but I think it strengthens our union, and removes clouds of discouragement,
                                making us feel more like one great household of faith. We have had one of the mildest
                                winters since my earliest recollection. We had ice about two and one half inches thick,

                                had but little snow. On the 12th inst. we had a frightful wind storm tearing down
                                fences^ boughs from the trees, breaking panes of glass, and taking a portion of the tin
                                roofing from the brick Office. Some were badly frightened but no damage was done. We
                                feel thankful for our preservation, and sorrow for those who have been less fortunate.
                                We have warm, comfortable homes; bountiful supplies of food and raiment; and as a

                            in regard to our good Father Henry. With him it is well. Prayerful, thoughtful, reverential
                            feelings are ours. When congenial friends leave us, it is hard to sever the tie that must be
                            broken, as we lay these forms away. But "Every hour that passes slowly, Has its task to do
                            and bear, Luminous the crown and holy, When each gem is set with care." The spirit of the
                            Lord rested upon our brother; he was in truth, godly. The life of Christ exemplified itself
                            in him. Tlie early Believers bestowed on him a mantle that could never fade. His continuance
                            in well-doing brought to him glory, honor, and immoi'tality. Our brother's name was given to
                            his ancestors in the old world, as they were an order of officers of William the Conqueror.
                            These officers wore mantles. In the old and new world these mantles of fidelity have been
                            faithfully worn though viewed in different aspects. It is well with our brother as his last
                            days were joyful, his hope of the future grand. We have met to adore him for his good<pb n="98" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/> 98 THE MANIFESTO. works and to commemorate his virtues. To bless his
                            beautiful spirit, to reverence and extol his name; also the blessed temple though it must
                            return to dust. A wise, peaceful spirit dwelt within this house of clay, a cultured mind
                            adorned it. Through his long life of eighty-four years he was governed, guided and led by
                            the Christ spirit. All through his early life he was associated with the noble ones of earth
                            who have long since passed away. The glory of heaven was revealed to him even in childhood.
                            We must remember the thoughtful, studious youth he once was, the religious man and the wise
                            veteran who rejoiced in a "green old age." We have lost a prize, have lost a scholar, but
                            let us hold fast to his good examples. Let them ever be before us. Be humble, meek, mild and
                            forgiving as he was; love true religion, repel infidelity; carefully watch and fervently
                            pray. He was loved at home and to him there was no place like home. His ideas were liberal,
                            his principles good, but with care he kept out the party spirit that would tend to
                            confusion; ever holding fast to his early teaching. He was a wise and prudent leader, and
                            his career has been a successful one; in some respects unparalleled. "Greater are those who
                            govern themselves than those who rule nations." If we can compete with his good example in
                            this we shall not be found wanting. What we thoroughly learn we shall surely remember. It is
                            well with Father Henry; his life was well spent, his pilgrimage on earth prolonged. The time
                            came for him to go; being aware of this he said,�"I don't think I shall ever feel well again
                            now, I want to go right along, just step over." His prayer was answered, his mission
                            fulfilled. The few days of confinement that were his were quiet and subdued; no struggle, no
                            excitement; peace reigned, a beautiful sleep followed. "Homeward serenely he soared with
                            God's benediction upon him." Reluctantly we lay him away and with a sad satisfaction bid him
                            adieu. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Tribute to our sister Adah Z. Potter" TEIform="index"/>To our Sister Adah Z.

                            is none so interesting, so important and so indispensable to his necessities as agriculture.
                            Some may think this a strong assertion, but nevertheless it is true. Let us for one moment
                            consider its intrinsic worth, the progress that has been made regarding it, and the terrible
                            consequences that would ensue if there were no more farmers. What could the miner, the
                            mechanic, the manufacturer, the lawyer, doctor, and a host of other professional men do, if
                            somebody did not provide them with something to live on. Every body must eat in order to

                            land, that is, in civilized society, so that every body no matter what position they may
                            occupy, or what high sounding titles they may bear, M. D., M. A., F. R. S., may be attached
                            to their names, still the farmer is king for all that. All in reality are subordinate to,
                            and dependent upon his labor; without which all must starve. In man's primitive condition
                            farming must have been his principle occupation, for he thought of little else than to
                            procure something for his subsistence, and a hard time he had of it too; for the work was
                            all done by hand. However, this developed a strong muscular system and so far was a little
                            benefit to him; but as one generation has succeeded another, machines have been invented,
                            and improvements made, till at the present time one man is able to perform the amount of
                            work which once required several hands to do. A field of grain that usually required ten
                            strong men to reap, may now be done by a mere boy, provided he knows how to drive a team,
                            and has developed that invaluable qualification which, (I regret to say) is generally so
                            rare among boys known as caution. The thrashing too was once done with a. flail, a very hard
                            and tedious job. Now one man with a good machine, and steampower will thrash five hundred
                            bushels in a day. In addition to these, there is the steam-plow, mower, hay-tedder,
                            cultivator, horse-hoe, besides many more that might be mentioned, which have been brought
                            forth within the last fifty years, so that farm work may be done much easier and better than
                            it was half a century ago. If all the time, strength and expense that is now used in
                            building immense war ships, constructing huge engines, and other death producing apparatus,
                            were spent in devising ways and means to work out a more perfect system of agriculture,
                            there would be no more barbarism, very much less misery and suffering and a great deal more
                            morality and pure religion in the world. I believe this will be the case in the future. When
                            man acknowledges woman as his equal and co-laborer, and not only gives her the opportunity,
                            but aids and encourages her in cultivating and making use of her God-given faculties, then
                            will wars and fightings cease, and through the triumph of peace the honest tiller of the
                            soil will rise to the position he so justly deserves. He will no longer be looked down upon
                            by his dependent dignitaries, but will be respected by them, and be well paid for his
                            arduous and unremitting services. Then will many young men willingly become farmers who now
                            through pride, often seek business for which they are entirely inadequate, popular sentiment
                            driving them thereto. Then there will be no more hungry children heard wailing for a crust
                            of bread. Some people complain of the incessant hard work to be done on a farm, of the great
                            liability to loss by bad weather, but show me an industry, if you can, in which there are no
                            losses, no liabilities, and no responsibilities, and in consideration of all this, I will
                            raise both hands, and am ready to exclaim, all honor, glory and success to the patient,
                            industrious, honest and indefatigable farmer! His business is first, and last, and of all
                            trades the most important. Canaan, N.

                                installment appreciative sketches of several great inventors and other eminently
                                successful men. The high opinions Horace Mann held of phrenology and his personal
                                intimacy with George Combe are brought out in an enter taining manner by Mrs. Charlotte

                                the usual variety of matter. The editor comprehensively reviews the career and character
                                of George W. Childs, and in the Personal column character sketches are given of the Hon.

                                Unique Reference Work. A work that is really new, and unlike any other, is The Nutshell
                                Cyclopedia. It is not intended to take the place of any other general cyclopedia, but to
                                supplement every other, and whatever you have you will probably want the Nutshell, and
                                if you have no other you will surely want it. It treats only live subjects, the facts
                                concerning which are constantly changing, and the latest information concerning which is
                                important. Probably threefourths of its contents will be found in no other cyclopedia,
                                because the occurrences, and the facts, described are of later date than the publication
                                of any other cyclopedia. Though the entire work will comprise probably 2,500 pages, it
                                is sold at a price so low that any one can afford it, ranging from $1.75 for the
                                complete work in Monthly Parts, to $3.20 for the same in four volumes, half morocco
                                binding. The issue before us covers such important subjects as Coinage, Colorado,
                                Columbian Celebration and Expositions, Commerce and Crops, bringing statistics down to
                                1894 (mostly a year later than to be found in any of the annuals) Congress, with list of
                                the members, Connecticut, and so on. For sample Monthly Part send 4 cents postage to

                                tongue. And so this "residue of the tenth" receives a tacit promise of literary life for
                                a future generation. Thus rises slowly, our dear mother tongue from her original sin of
                                slang to a sort of "ticket of leave" existence until, perhaps by some imperceptible
                                evolution, such elements are borne upward to comparative popularity. Such is the record
                                of usage, and thus a dictionary becomes the language builder of the world. We do not
                                regard the work so much as the sum total of four years labor, with its consequent
                                speculative outlay of a million dollars, as that it is really the epitome of the world's
                                scholarship, an encyclopedic microcosm, and as the practical development of the science
                                of analysis, illustration and investigation, focussed and brought into line by the
                                skill, experience and wonderful intuition of that modern personality, the Managing
                                Editor. We believe every man of letters will give the work a hearty approval and

TEIform="persName"/>By Alonzo G. Hollister.</byline><p TEIform="p">I HAD a revelation this morning. It is, that the mark of the Beast in the forehead and in the
                            right hand, is self. This is a concentrated definition, and is not so stiff nor uncertain in
                            its application, especially when applied by the individual solely to his ego, and not to
                            some foreign, and in nowise related object, past or present. I have suffered during the year
                            past, from that slavery to selfish interests into which I voluntarily entered and now
                            earnestly desire to cast off. Hence the sight is given and conviction is complete. It has
                            one more merit,�this definition provokes no argument, nor offense. According to St. John,
                            Christ is a substance with quality that can be heard, seen, and handled. Therefore, as he
                            came to manifest obedience as the fulfilling of the law, and as obedience is perfect only
                            where love prompts it, Jesus Christ was the esse of obedience. Therefore Obedience is the
                            end in view, the Pearl of great price, for which he gave all himself to establish in place
                            of disobedience, which was the first sin, and sin every time. Adam was disobedience ; Christ
                            was obedience. This may be old and not very ingenious, but it is healthy to see it that way,
                            if one is strongly attracted by the character of Jesus or of Ann Lee. It does not lead the
                            mind off into speculation and intellectual madness. When a man begins to bear his cross
                            against his animal propensities, he has an increased flow of blood to his head, and
                            consequently greater intellectual activity. What is there to prevent madness, or a return to
                            animal propensity, unless he can make the blood course powerfully through his heart and near
                            the seat of life, until his heart becomes enlarged, and actively compassionate ? Again, how
                            can the mind apprehend, or the hand convey light, or truth, or the fruits of suffering that
                            it has not seen nor experienced? Who shall set himself up as a leader, who never learned to
                            serve, or as a Messiah, who is not at peace with his own conscience ? I am writing with a
                            certain periodical under my note paper, which may account in part for this current of
                            thought. At one time I was inclined to subscribe, but the spirit of contention was palpable
                            all over and through it, as against every thing beneath God Himself. The energy was spread
                            over so vast a field, it would almost make a man forget that he had a vine or figtree of his
                            own to cultivate. Neither have I been able to discover the little child that was to lead or
                            subdue all those ugly beasts. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Let not any one say..." TEIform="index"/>Let not any one say...
