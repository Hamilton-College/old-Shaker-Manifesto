CANADA'S DESTINY.
COMMERCIAL    UNION    INVOLVES     POLITICAL
UNION�FREE TRADE WOULD FORCE   CANADA
INTO SUICIDE OR ANNEXATION.
It is clear that no two countries in such
close natural juxtaposition, interlocked
by lakes, railroads and canals, could become commercially aunit, and still remain
politically separate and distinct. Politics
and commerce are indissolubly linked together, though often divorced by politicians who make a commerce of politics. A
country cannot present a, commercial attitude to the world different from its political attitude.
If the tariff wall was removed from
across the continent, and internal free
trade adopted, it is not supposable that
in the consideration, or adoption of commercial treaties with foreign nations, either Canada or the United States could long
act independently of the other. As a commercial unit they would be compelled to
be a political unit. Taere is not very much
doubt in the minds of many sane men in
Canada, that once the Dominion has succeeded in throwing off the sentimental tie
to Great Britain, annexation must quickly follow on the heels of independence and
free trade with the United States. One
thing is incontrovertible: if the United
States declared itself in favor of free trade
to-morrow, and threw its markets open to
the world, as Great Britain has done,
unless the people of Canada were desirous of committing commercial suicide,
they would at once seek admission to the
Union. Canada can hold her own fairly
well, with an enormous national debt, as
long as the Congress of the United States
continues a. policy of protection; but Canada could not manage at all with a great
Jree trade nation of sixty-five millions on
her southern border.�From "A Brief for
Continental Unity," by Walter Blackburn Harte, in New England Magazine

Published in Albany, JS/~. T., in 1808. No. 8. Concerning the New
                            Lights, Continued. It was agreed on all hands, that God was unchangeable and needed not the
                            sufferings and death of his Son, to render him propitious to the soul of any ; that it was
                            through love that he sent his Son into the world, that sin is the only thing in the universe
                            that he hates, that he would have all men saved from it, and that to effect this, Christ
                            made his appearance in the world. That innocence and love could not suffer and die in the
                            room and stead of guilt and enmity. Nor could the imputation of innocence and purity to the
                            guilty and vile, render them happy in the presence of heavenly beings of a contrary nature.
                            From these premises it was concluded and taught by some, that man by departing from God,
                            lost the true knowledge of his character and fell into a gross mistake, in concluding that
                            he was their enemy ; that Christ came to reveal the true character of God in order to
                            convince sinners of their mistake, and prove to them that God was their friend; that he had
                            sufficiently established this point by submitting to be killed by them, rather than oppose
                            or hurt them. Upon this hypothesis the Savior was supposed to die in the room and stead of
                            the wicked, in a seuse, somewhat different from the former. Inasmuch as the parties must
                            meet, and the sinner looked upon God as his enemy, and was determined either to kill or be
                            killed. The love of Christ to the wicked was so great, that he chose to be killed rather
                            than kill, and this was supposed to constitute the gospel, the glad tidings ; that although
                            sinners killed their best friend through a mistake yet he freely forgave them. When any
                            believe this they repent and are reconciled to God as their friend, whom before they thought
                            to be their enemy. This gospel method of salvation was however, by no means established as a
                            matter of common faith. The generality still believed mankind to be under a deeper disorder,
                            than such a mistake. "For after that they knew God, they glorified him not as God. And did
                            not love to retain God in their<pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> knowledge." Besides, if there is such
                            implacable enmity between the sinner and God, that one or other must die, and if the enmity
                            is found in the sinner, he must certainly be in the wrong ; therefore unless the Deity
                            sacrifice his law and justice as well as his life, out of love to the sinner, death and
                            suffering must inevitably seize upon him that is in the wrong. If the sinner is at enmity
                            against God whatever the cause be, if God is reconciled to him in that state, he must be at
                            enmity against himself. Upon this principle, should the sinner conclude that God was
                            reconciled to him, had nothing against him, overlooked his enmity and disobedience, the last
                            error must be worse than the first. From the propositions laid down, another conclusion was
                            drawn more consistent and which was more universally embraced ; that the coming of Christ
                            into the world was to make an end of sin, and unless we are wholly delivered from it, we can
                            never see the face of God in peace. Pursuant to this conclusion, the first of those new
                            satellites, (Malcham Worley,) which the Presbytery of Springfield had recommended as a light
                            to the churches, began to shine out in the month of June, 1804 ; and from the effulgence of
                            the great luminary, around whose centre the Schismatic body revolved, proposed to obviate
                            every difficulty that had been attached to those intricate subjects, and lay open the whole
                            matter plain to the weakest capacity. However plain and obvious the new diving might have
                            appeared to him or to others at the time it was divulged, certain it is, that none but
                            Schismatics, or such as unequivocally maintain the sacred rights of conscience, could ever
                            have admitted the opening of sentiments so singular, with impunity. Under the auspicious
                            wings of the American Eagle, which shades the honest enquirer after truth from the rage of
                            popes and despots, the reader may calmly peruse those singular propositions which were so
                            generally ascribed to a disorder in the brain, in which the following ideas were included.
                            "Man was at first created in the nature and image of God, but being tempted, the nature of
                            the serpent was begotten in him, which is an earthly, sensual nature, directly opposed to
                            God. This diabolical nature however contrary to the divine in which man was created, could
                            not overcome nor extinguish it; hence, there remained in the same person two natures, at
                            enmity and war the one against the other ; the one denominated the seed of the woman, the
                            other the seed of the serpent." "Adam begat a son in his own likeness, a double-minded man,
                            and in this situation the whole human race were propagated, and thus they remained till
                            Christ made his appearance and began the work of redemption." "Jesus Christ, the redeemer,
                            assumed in the body of his flesh the same nature, which was in all other men, was made in
                            all points like unto his brethren whom he came to redeem, had two distinct and opposite
                            natures residing in his one body. This nature which worked in the man, and not some being
                            outwardly visible, tried and tempted him to seek temporal riches and honors, to convert the
                            stones into<pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> bread, and cast himself down from the pinnacle of the
                            temple, in order that he might be acknowledged and adored, as the coming Messiah. This
                            wicked nature being denied of all its demands, crossed in all its crav ings, gave him up for
                            a season to the ministry of angels, but afterwards rallied its vanquished powrers, and
                            struggled for life and victory against the Son of God, but was again overcome and held to
                            the painful and ignominious cross, on which he was worn out, wasted and consumed as by a
                            lingering fire, until he was forced in his last convulsive agonies, to cry aloud and yield
                            up the invisible and immortal spirit. Thus the work of final redemption was finished, and
                            the second man arose and ascended out of that lawless nature into which the first fell. Then
                            the serpent's head was bruised, and the first born of the woman's seed put everlastingly out
                            of his reach. According to this transaction, all the types, figures and allegories in the
                            old testament, and parables in the new are to be understood. Thus, Cain and Abel, Ishmael
                            and Isaac, Esau and Jacob, the sumptuous glutton and Lazarus the beggar and the foolish and
                            wise virgins, are to be considered as types of these two distinct natures; the one elect,
                            the other reprobate ; the one beloved, the other hated ; the one and his offering accepted,
                            the other rejected." "Again, the divine nature which was chosen, redeemed, exalted and
                            glorified in the person of Christ Jesus, is denominated in Scripture the spirit, the inner
                            man, and the new man. Its opposite, the old man, the man of sin, the sou of perdition, the
                            flesh wThich lusteth against the spirit, the carnal mind, that wicked which sitteth in the
                            temple of God and defiles it; wThich in the work of redemption must lift up his eyes in
                            torment, be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, be consumed
                            and destroyed and go into final perdition." "This wicked which is one and the same in all
                            men, being overcome and destroyed in the person of Jesus Christ, laid a foundation for the
                            gospel to be preached to every creature under heaven, and for all to look and hope for
                            redemption at his final appearing. That it was necessary that this gospel should be
                            published to all the world, before a full end of that wicked should come. By this gospel he
                            was bound, but suffered to live another day, or thousand years. This thousand years is now
                            expired and the period come for that man of sin to be finally consumed from off the face of
                            the earth. For this end, the spirit of God is poured out upon the people, first to reveal,
                            and then to consume this wicked." Such were the general propositions advanced by Malcham
                            Worley, in the summer of 1804, and which was acceded to by a number of those Schismatics who
                            were considered foremost in the New-Light. "From whom or from what did Christ redeem ? I
                            answer: He came to redeem us from sin. Mankind are represented as sold under sin, serving
                            sin, servants to sin, under the dominion and reign of sin. It is plain that Christ redeems
                            us from sin or from all iniquity."<pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> "I now inquire what was the price
                            given for our redemption? The blood of Christ is everywhere in Scripture declared to be the
                            price given. Acts xx., 28. Rev. v., 9. It may be asked if Christ or God in Christ, redeems
                            from sin? And if he gave Ms blood as the ransom or price, who got the price ?" The Apostle
                            to the Hebrews answers ;�-"Forasmuch as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he
                            also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that
                            had the power of death." Here we see who had the power of death ; and he got the price,
                            which was the death of Jesus. Then was fulfilled that old prophecy, "I will put enmity
                            between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: It shall bruise thy head and
                            thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen. iii., 15. This particular point, "the devil getting the
                            price," was combated by Dr. Campbell in his strictures. Whereupon Br. Stone agreed "to eat
                            these dreadful words" because so extremely offensive to the Doctor, and the occasion of a
                            wildness of imagination in the Calvinist preachers and people. Neither Dr. Campbell nor Br.
                            Stone fully understood the expression when they agreed that it should be eaten. The offence
                            of the expressions seemed to lie in giving Satan something that was precious ; hence the
                            Doctor's objection, "that the precious blood of Christ was given by God to Satan in payment!
                            " That "God was so merciless as to deliver up his only Son to glut the malice of a
                            blood-thirsty demon!" That "the lamb of God was immolated on the altar of hell." Had he
                            adverted to the Apostle's idea, quoted by Stone, that this precious blood was intended to
                            destroy the one to whom it was given, it must have appeared more consistent for the devil to
                            get it, than the justice of God. The Doctor would not be so unreasonable as to give a dose
                            of tartar emetic to one in perfect health, and thereby at-one him to the bilious. He knows
                            the precious tartar emetic, which is the very essence of bile, must be deposited in the
                            bowels of his patient, in order to collect into union with itself every thing there of its
                            own nature and carry it off in the draught. Admitting that Christ assumed that blood, life
                            or nature, in which all mankind lay separated from God, that life was his, and he had a
                            right to do with it what he pleased. Although it was endowed with no greater excellence in
                            him than in another, considered in itself, yet it might be denominated precious, from the
                            use which he made of it. Admitting that he gave it up as a public sacrifice, made a show of
                            it openly and put away sin by the sacrifice of it, the Doctor must grant that Stone's
                            inference was not so full of horror as he at first imagined, and consequently it must prove
                            a very strong emetic to him that eats it. The above Schismatic doctrine, as far as it was
                            opened and explained, threatened the total subversion of the Calvinistic system; for, upon
                            the principle that sin must be actually destroyed, that Christ did actually assume, overcome
                            and destroy it, and that the same battle must be fought,<pb n="173" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> and the same
                            victory gained by all who are born of God, it follows that proxy sinning, suffering,
                            obeying, dying, rising and reigning are the proper effects of a disordered bruin. It' it was
                            the enmity which Christ nailed to the cross and took out of the way, and evil which he
                            destroyed by death, the hypostatical union of two distinct natures in the Son of God
                            forever, must be a capital mistake, and all the worship that has been offered to him upon
                            such a faith, must have conduced to the dignity and honor of that spirit, which the meek,
                            lowly, and self-denying Savior foiled upon the mount. In fine, the Schismatics taking it for
                            granted that sin was the whole occasion of two, that Christ came to destroy it, that his
                            veracity was pledged to finish the work, and that the time of the promise was near at hand,
                            expected, in whatever way the work should be affected, the day would soon declare it.
                            Several objections were raised in the Schismatic fraternity against Br. Worley's manner of
                            understanding the Scriptures, the most particular of which was, 1st. That it led to
                            Universalism and made Christ the Savior of all men eventually, as well as officially; taking
                            it for granted, that either in the plan of redemption or the execution of it, God had
                            distinguished the souls of men by number and person. 2nd. That if such a doctrine was
                            established it would open a wider door to vice, inasmuch as it would cut off at once from
                            the carnal mind, the powerful influence of hope and fear; consequently, the wicked spirit in
                            man would become more violent, and sin with more greediness, knowing that his time was
                            short. As all agreed that they were only beginning to learn the mysteries of the Scripture,
                            and each one had a right to exercise his own faith, and walk by the same rule, and mind the
                            same thing whereunto he had attained, the investigation of these mysterious and intricate
                            points, was put off to a future period, and the churches went on harmoniously in the first
                            principles of the New-Light which they conceived to be so well established by the
                            extraordinary power and gifts of the spirit. I shall now proceed to give some account of
                            their particular form of government and manner of worship. It has been before observed that
                            they constituted by a vote, which considered the Scripture as the only written oracle
                            through which the mind of God was revealed to them. In order to this general suffrage, in
                            which the body of the people at large had equal privilege, every claim to superiority, by a
                            succession of church offices, had been laid aside, consequently the power of government was
                            considered in the body of the people thus constituted. This new republic, under the standard
                            of liberty and equality, and invested with so great a degree of light, life and power,
                            assumed a threatening aspect toward the little surrounding kingdoms which had so long been
                            weakening each other by civil broils. It is difficult to paint the zeal for liberty, and
                            just indignation against the old aristocratic spirit, which glowed through every member<pb n="174" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> of this new confederacy. Under the influence of this warm democratic
                            zeal these churches soon exhibited an appearance, distinct from anything that had ever been
                            seen. The following minutes of the church at Turtle-Creek will serve to illustrate some of
                            the particulars of their proceedings.

                            admire, represents a charming landscape, surrounded by distant mountains, while the first
                            faint gleams of the spring-tide sun floods hill and vale with a silver radiance, lighting
                            the fresh green foliage with a tender glow, and the early flowers of May are reaching up to
                            the sunbeam to unfold their beautiful lives. But this is not all, only the outward
                            expression, the real scene lies back of these things, as much as the soul is behind the
                            body. Perhaps you think it is the recollection of a painting from some ancient artist, or a
                            production of modern times ; but none of these ; it is the pleasant reminiscence of a
                            kindness received from a friend and penciled on the plastic walls of memory, never to be
                            forgotten. It was a lovely day in the spring when all Nature was crowned with the beauty of
                            the vernal season, even the atmosphere was so balmy that it seemed like drinking in the
                            nectar of the god's, most delightful and inspiring ; but none of these could I enjoy ; a
                            slight accident had confined me to my room, and in my misfortune I was not forgotten. A
                            loving hand, prompted by a loving heart, had gathered from the woods some messes and early
                            blossoms, Nature's first offerings, artistically arranged, and brought them to me to console
                            my weary feelings and speak in their tongueless language of the beauty and sublimity of
                            Nature's works. And they did speak in audible sounds to my inner senses. I heard the music
                            of the rippling stream as it bounded over stone and pebble, moistening the roots of these
                            woodland flowerets ; I saw the sunbeam painting their delicate petals, and the proud oak and
                            lofty elm, that for many years had stood and debarred the keener rays of the sun, and
                            sheltered many such fragile blossoms from the tempest ; and linked with all this beauty was
                            the Divine Mind who forms the atom and holds worlds in immeasurable space. The thoughts that
                            flowed into my mind at that time, pen cannot portray. I felt my soul blended with the good,
                            the beautiful and divine of the past and present, and flooded with a spiritual feeling
                            entirely unknown to me before ; in the ecstasy of the moment I could but exclaim�twOh! the
                            soul is more than the body, the spiritual is superior to the material." If we unlock the
                            door to the inner sanctuary of God's universe, and cast off the earthliness by which our
                            minds are beclouded, we might pierce through the mysteries that enshroud, and perceive more
                            fully the soul of things. Such were the thoughts and feelings produced by the tender
                            sympathy of a<pb n="175" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> friend. Be not sparing of good deeds, they will yield a
                            harvest for time and eternity. Do not let us omit any opportunity for doing a kindness, no
                            matter how trifling, it may touch some heart-chord that will vibrate forever, giving untold
                            pleasure to the receiver, while the law of recompense returns a three-fold value of blessing
                            to the giver. The recollection of the circumstance that occasioned these thoughts will live
                            in memory as a picture of eternal worth, surviving the fleeting, perishable things of time.

TEIform="index"/> WHAT MAKES HAPPINESS?</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Pool, Jason B." TEIform="persName"/> Jason B. Pool.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Heaven is composed of two elements or conditions. The first in order is a justified
                            conscience, void of offence toward God and man. In this condition we acquire a disposition
                            to deal justly, love mercy, walk humbly and make our fellow-creatures comfortable and happy.
                            The second element has reference to the force of circumstances and to our surroundings. If
                            we have in addition to a clear conscience, a good home with plenty to eat, drink and wear,
                            and all our surroundings are pleasant and agreeable, we are in heaven. But if our
                            surroundings are of a different nature, if we should be placed among a race of savages whose
                            delight would be to hunt us down like bears and wolves, and to torture us in every way they
                            could invent, we should be in misery and torment. Again, when an individual has a jumping
                            toothache, he is liable to have less regard for his previous good conduct. He would be
                            willing to do anything to mitigate that terrible pain. So we see our environments have a
                            great deal to do with our happiness. We are well aware that the reader will be inclined to
                            say to the above, "this is all very true, but there is nothing new brought to light; nothing
                            that was not familiar to every one. No ghost is needed to tell us that." Perhaps we can make
                            use of it though, for an illustration. We are admonished to enter the Spirit world with a
                            good conscience, and so far, so good, but the next question is, "Will our goodness insure us
                            perfect happiness ? " Will that give us good surroundings in all respects? As we reasonably
                            suppose that the life of the Spirit world is made up of the life from this world, we may
                            well suppose that much evil, confusion and bad conditions are carried thither from<pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> here, and this statement is corroborated by our mediums and
                            clairvoyants. Those who have been permitted to make explorations in the Spirit realm aver
                            that it is composed of spirits of various grades and conditions ; some good, some bad, and
                            some indifferent, all of whom commenced their career in this world. But perhaps there are
                            other beings which make bad conditions besides the human. If the life of animals and
                            vegetables exist after the dissolution of the organic structure, then it follows that there
                            is much confusion existing with respect to animal and vegetable life in the Spirit world,
                            because there is much existing in this world among these classes. It is not to be doubted,
                            however, but that good spirits when they enter the Spirit world find a haven of rest. It is
                            said, that like gathers to like ; consequently the good gather to the good, and make
                            happiness for their own company, yet it is believed that they are, to some extent, adversely
                            affected by outsiders. It is therefore of the utmost importance that steps be taken to make
                            the Spirit world a ' 'land of pure delight." The doctrine which the materialists inculcate,
                            "one world at a time," will hardly answer our purpose. It savors too much of carelessness
                            and unconcern for tha future life, although while here we can act only in one world, yet we
                            should ever have a concern for the next. We should not only endeavor to save ourselves, but
                            also teach the necessity of bringing this world into a normal condition and thereby bring
                            about a state of improvement in the Spirit world.

                            progress Of the human race on earth; I would trace the evolution Of that race, to the
                            fruition Of its hopes and expectations, In a so-called second birth. Back beyond remotest
                            ages, Seen by prophets, seen by sages; Man is traced by modern science, As he never was
                            before; Traced from lower, bestial nature, Primal works of the Creator, Through evolving,
                            fruitful eons, To a state for man in store; Through the savage, the civilian; Through the
                            Christian, cultured million, Through the dark and bloody ages, That essayed the symbol
                            cross; To our Savior's high ideal, To the day this is made real, In a final, full salvation;
                            In redeeming man from loss. Man is what lie is by nature, Through no mistake of the Creator,
                            Scientific research teaches As it never did before; In accord with revelation, In accord
                            with the foundation Of the mountains and the valleys, As they formed in days of yore. Yet
                            the will of the Creator In the universe of nature And her laws, is apprehended By experience
                            alone; And, forsooth, each generation, Of each epoch, of each nation, And each individual
                            person, Must needs have one of his own; For we find, although another, An officious, kindly
                            brother, May afford us hope and courage; Yet experience alone, Is sufficiently assuring To
                            establish all enduring Faith in Ciirist and in his gospel, That shall make Ms life our
                                own.<pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> That shall furnish the conviction, That alone the
                            crucifixion, Which our Savior meekly suffered, Symbolized upon the cross,� Is the final step
                            in progress, Is the only way of egress From our rudi mental nature, Which theology names
                            loss. Mark! this partial, selfish feature In our riiclimental nature, Is the source of
                            earthly fulness And of travel to its goal, Of the human race through ages, To the time
                            foretold by sages, When the Christ should come in glory, To redeem the human soul. This last
                            change in evolution, Is no cruel retribution; ~No infliction, but an epoch In the travel of
                            the race; To a state�a situation, E'en the most exalted station, Occupied by men or angels
                            In the heavenly Father's grace. To attain this royal favor In the union of the Father, There
                            is needed total change In the direction of the will And the motives and desires, Of whoever
                            fain aspires To this perfect state of freedom, 'Tis man's privilege to fill. For while
                            working down in nature,� A subordinate creator,� It is needful man be governed By the laws
                            of primal life; Must be partial to his father, And his sister and his mother; And must keep
                            and love his children, Lands and chattels and his wife; With their unions, and their
                            schisms, And their world antagonisms; And these, needs must bound his being, And must fill
                            his heart and life. For the family relation, Could be formed but by attraction,� An
                            affection, superseding For the time, all other care Of whatever name or nature; Even that of
                            the Creator, Has small place in these affections, Quite a secondary share. And hence not
                            until this labor In the reproductive order,� Or in act or in desire,� Is outgrown and left
                            behind, Can the man attain fruition To his hopes of full salvation; And be born again, a
                            freeman, And a Savior of his kind. Free from social limitations, From mere sensual
                            relations, Forced and painful separations, And resultant suffering. From unsatisfied
                            desires, From the quick or sraoldering fires Of the appetites and passions, With their
                            noisome clamoring. Free from envy and suspicion, Avarice, and vain ambition; Pride, and
                            jealousies and hatred With attendant train of strife. This it is to be a freeman, Raised
                            above the merely human Into that exalted region, Even the angelic life. This it is to be a
                            savior, Zealous to assist another, By the power of love and kindness, Into this angelic
                            sphere; Far above the world's ambitions, In its fairest, best conditions; To a realm of
                            peace and safety, Free, alike, from doubt and fear.

                                    country road. Just over the stone fence yonder there was a broad field, smooth as
                                    the floor, and most exquisitely arrayed in the fresh spring greenness of its grass.
                                    It seemed to me my eyes had rarely fallen on a sight so lovely. But ripping right
                                    through that smooth and pleasant greenness there was being dragged a plow, and the
                                    fresh beauty of the fair sward was being turned under from the sun and air, and only
                                    the ugly brown soil was being turned outward, and all the fair and radiant scene was
                                    being changed and scarred. "Why?" I asked myself. I do not have to wait long for an
                                    answer. The "chastisement" of the fair field was in order that the autumn might find
                                    it golden with the more precious harvest of wheat. Well, God's ploughshare cuts; but
                                    never for the simple sake of cutting; always for the result of character�fairer,
                                    sweeter, nobler. There is benign design behind our chastisement. Wherefore lift up
                                    the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Christian witness" TEIform="index"/>The Christian Witness.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I enclose a little slip and should be pleased..."

TYNG AND THE TIGER.</head><p TEIform="p"> Lyman Abbott, in the Christian Union. Dr. Stephen H. Tyjstg, of St. George's Church, New
                            York City, was speaking in his Sunday school one Sunday afternoon. He had told the children
                            that in all of us there is an animal nature, and he had run this familiar idea out in forms
                            which appealed to the childish imagination. "The liar" he said, "is a serpent, that creeps
                            in secret and sinuous ways to strike with his fangs and poison with his virus. The frivolous
                            boy is a monkey, giving himself up to antics and grimaces. The vain child is a peacock
                            spreading himself to be admired by others. The angry child is a tiger, passionate and
                            untamed." Then he gave out a hymn. The children did not make ready promptly, and began to
                            sing it in confusion and disorder. Instantly his face flushed. He rapped sharply on the desk
                            with his book, and gave vent to some exclamation of impatience. A little girl in the rear of
                            the room, standing on the seat, who had been swept away into forgetfulness of self by the
                            vehemence of the preacher's eloquence, pointed her finger at him, and called out in a
                            childish voice, hut loud enough to be heard all over the room, "Tiger!" Instantly a hush
                            fell upon the room. Dr. Tyng laid down his book, walked down the aisle, took the little
                            girl, shrinking and frightened, in his arms, quieted her fears with his benign smile, walked
                            back to the platform, and, caressing her, said to the children, "Yes, she has told the
                            truth. My enemy all my life has been the tiger in me. I have hard battle to keep him caged.
                            Every now and then he breaks loose in spite of me; and it is because I have had such a hard
                            battle that I want you children to tame the tiger that is in you while you are young." ISTo
                            child that was present will ever forget the lesson of that incident, and no man of less
                            consecrated spirit could possibly have made this childish rebuke such a means of ministry.</p><pb n="179" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Prayer for Manifesto" TEIform="index"/> PRAYER FOR MANIFESTO.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Newton, Agnes E."

                                    in the revelation of His Femininity. Hardly has the time come for the common

                                    manifest to the world in Jesus the Lord. Common sense ought to teach the mind of man
                                    that the righteous man�when matured�is both the image and likeness of God, but it
                                    does not. Even after God's revelation of himself in his own human form and office as

                                begin to wake up and put on a little more spiritual life, with the peaceable fruits of
                                righteousness, or they may be left outside the gate on the speedy coming of the great
                                millennium. Professor Totten of Yale College, has satisfied himself and many others,
                                that he has most assuredly demonstrated the correct time for the opening of that
                                wonderful era of spiritual prosperity which is to be the saint's joy for one thousand
                                years. / By mathematical demonstration from the prophecies he unhesitatingly declares
                                that the '"'millennium will come suddenly, like a snare ; everywhere at once ; amid the
                                crash of all existing systems, and out of a jreign of horror." v To prove that his
                                calculations are correct, beyond a doubt, he has placed elaborate tables of figures
                                before the public, and respecting these he makes the following remarks. "I know of no
                                flaw in these tables, cither astronomical, chronological or historical, and by means of
                                them I am permitted to convey to all my race the substance of my convictions." The
                                prophetic Congress which met, recently, in London, and was composed of hundreds of the
                                most learned bishops, prelates, members of Parliament and deep thinkers, agree in their
                                wisdom that the end of the world would come on or about the year 1899. Prof. Totten's
                                array of mathematical calculations is really wonderful, and to thousands will be only
                                bewildering, but it is said to have awakened a profound intensity of feeling, and the
                                "Midnight Cry" is again being heard through the land. This has been one of the wonders
                                in the religious world, that since the first publishing of the biblical record,
                                prophetic calculations have been made with such accurate precision that every shade of
                                Christianity has accepted their own illustration as satisfactory and conclusive. If Paul
                                had only been silent on<pb n="181" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> this subject and not said what he did to
                                the worldly-wise Corinthians, we might have entered the ranks with Prof. Totten to
                                herald the incoming day. "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God." And then
                                the direct testimony of Jesus. "Of that day and hour knoweth no man, not even the angels
                                in heaven." While this wisdom of the world may interest the children of the world, it
                                does not seem to develop them to be the children of God. It is quite singular that the
                                combined wisdom and labor of this great body of educated minds, should determine the
                                coming of the second advent, when they would be unwilling on their own part, or for
                                others to enter into God's kingdom as it was established on the earth during the first
                                advent of Jesus ; but it is characteristic of the race of man. It is the looking forward
                                for something to come that will do for them what they are unwilling to do for
                                themselves. Deny yourself, said Jesus, and take up your cross and follow me. If we
                                neglect the lessons given in the first advent, how can we expect to work out those of
                                the second? That a wave of religious thought is now passing over the civilized world,
                                and is of sufficient force to push aside the grosser elements of the world, is a
                                wonderfully redeeming feature in our day of grasping, defrauding and sensuality. If the
                                believing thousands can accumulate the requisite amount of courage, and push ahead
                                regardless of their enemies, as did Moses at the passage of the Ked Sea, then, indeed,
                                will the millennium have commenced, and in due time the world will come to an end. The
                                end of the world is the life of Christ, while the Christian resurrection from the world
                                brought the disciples into a new element, where, like Jesus, they neither marry nor are
                                given in marriage. The life of the world is the marital relation, the foundation upon
                                which others of the same class may build from generation to generation. Take away this
                                foundation and the world would come to an end. Paul, in speaking of his disciples
                                respecting the position they were to occupy, said, "These things are written for our
                                admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. They were dead to the world, but
                                alive in Christ. The waiting few who were engaged in the outpouring of the spirit of God
                                in 1848 under the ministration of Wm. Miller, will renew their strength and have cause
                                to believe that the long midnight through which they have patiently watched is nearly
                                over, and the "morning dawn is breaking." In this religious thought we are as deeply
                                interested as any class can be, and accept the awakening which, even for a brief space
                                of time holds<pb n="182" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> the religious world sufficiently quiet, that it may
                                more carefully study the laws of God MThich are for the wellbeing of the body, and for
                                the purification of the soul. Can it be possible that these believing thousands who are
                                anticipating the putting on of their white robes in 1899, ai'e already engaged in the
                                preliminary work of making the body a fit temple for the Holy Spirit ? Are they rising
                                from a life in the elements of the world, to a life in the spirit of holiness ? To delay
                                is dangerous. To attain to success one must reach the place in his life where he can say
                                as did Jesus ;�"The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me." While others
                                may look for the fulfillment of the prophecies, agreeably to their special calculations,
                                we are with those who believe that the light of the new day, the millennium, is already
                                shining upon us. That it is a progressive work in righteousness and peace, and may enter
                                the heart of any one who denies himself of all ungodliness and every worldly lust. All
                                the chronological tables and all the calculations of days and years that may be formed,
                                will be of no value when a pure heart is demanded. Paul bears a testimony that will more
                                effectually open the path to the anticipated millennium than all the wisdom that may be
                                brought forward by a host of professors, bishops or prelates. He says,�God is not
                                mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth. to his
                                flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of
                                the spirit reap life everlasting. Any body of people who will accept the word of the
                                Apostle and make of it a practical application in their relations among men, and then
                                keep themselves unspotted from the world, need not wait till 1899, nor during one week
                                for the second advent of the Christ, or the opening of the thousand years of glory. Such
                                a demonstration of spirituality would bring the New Jerusalem down from God out of
                                heaven, and every one would have the pleasure, at once, of saying ; "Behold the
                                tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be his
                                people, and God Himself shall be with them and be their God."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mount Lebanon, N.

                                be far advanced in spiritual perception, as to the fitness of our work to the present
                                needs of the world. Mark M. Pomeroy and wife spent the Sabbath here, a few weeks since,
                                and has given us a rosy description in his July Advance Thought. He seemed pleased with
                                his visit and with the way we conduct matters and to rightly appreciate our place and
                                work in the world. We view such as indicators of the world's advance in spiritual
                                enlightenment, if no more. * The past month has been a very fruitful one. Strawberries
                                have yielded very abundantly, and extra fine. Cherries are just splendid, and the boys
                                are about tired of picking them. Gardens are looking exceedingly well and promise a
                                plentiful harvest. We enjoyed a beautiful visit with our gospel friends from Enfield, N.
                                H. Only one fault to find; there were no Brethren. They were the most prompt company I
                                ever had the pleasure of waiting upon, always on hand at the appointed time in every
                                instance. Am very sorry to learn we are to have no more visitors this season; perhaps
                                they are being reserved for 1892. We have commenced haying, but oh! the weather; much
                                better for setting out cabbages than for making hay. We have set up, ready for use a hay
                                loader; big stories are told about it, we shall have a story to tell bye and bye. We
                                also have a reaper and binder alreadj to put in the harvest field when the time comes.
                                It costs a good deal to keep up with all the various improved machinery; but I rather
                                think it would cost more to keep on in the old way. Life is a continual problem solved
                                one day at a time. We can generally see afterward where we could have done better.
                                Thanks for new music. In kindest love, D. O. Bk. Daniel's notes slipped off from the end
                                of his pen and into the mail before we were aware he had written them. I thought we
                                would give the account of the strawberry crop, which has been so bountiful this season.
                                According to the size of the patch which yielded best, .we think there would have been
                                over one hundred bushels to the acre; the berries were marvels as to size, and delicious
                                in flavor, I think they are mostly of the Sharpless variety. Here is the aggregate
                                account. Picked 37 bushels and 19 quarts. Preserved 55 gallons. Sold 7 bushels and 22
                                quarts. Gave away 2 bushels, and 26 quarts. Finished picking the eleventh. Desiring that

                                We are anticipating some fruit from the apples, pears, plums, peaches, quinces and

                                doubtless to our negligence in sending it. The heavenly riches are hers. She has been a

Jests said: "Blessed are the merciful," not blessed are the unkind, the
                                cruel, the oppressive, but blessed are the beneficent, the compassionate, those who are
                                kind and willing to forgive. This quality is one of God's characteristics. Those who
                                possess it are like Him, in that respect. In Psalms cxxxvi., every verse ends witli the
                                words, "For his mercy endureth forever." If all were merciful what a beautiful world
                                this would be. Even the lower animals might feel that they were in paradise, for "the
                                merciful man is merciful to his beast." Notice the last part of this blessing; "for he
                                shall obtain mercy." This promise was given by one "who spake as never man spake," and
                                he is able to fulfill it. May we grow in this divine characteristic, for our own good,
                                and for the good of others. 50*75 spaces of cream were sold in June. A space of cream is
                                simply a certain measurement of cream, about 34 inch, established by the Brattleboro
                                Vt., Creamer Manufacturing Co., and recognized by buyers of cream in the northern and
                                western part of New England as the standard quantity at a certain price. The former
                                system of measuring cream was by inches, but there were fractional parts difficult to
                                reckon. In the present system there are no fractions. Strawberries will yield a larger
                                revenue from a given area than any other berry, though more labor must be given than
                                raspberries or blackberries require. Small hens may be good layers, but small eggs by
                                the dozen are not desirable. It is the state of mind of the poultry keeper that causes
                                failure in poultry keeping, not the state of the market. Chicago Gluten meal for
                                chickens is excellent. D. Orcutt. We are made aware of the flight of time by the arrival
                                of our beloved little messenger the Manifesto, which we hail with pleasure, as we prize
                                the soul-inspiring truth it contains. The Home Notes are cheering and edifying. The busy
                                season is now approaching, haying has commenced, think it will prove two-thirds of an
                                average crop. The rye field is also nearly ready to harvest and looks uncommonly good.
                                Corn and potatoes looking well, although we have had a dry season thus far. The
                                strawberries have surpassed our expectations, and yielded over 250 quarts; not half the
                                amount of one year ago, on account of the drouth. We have a much larger bed set out this
                                spring, of a better variety, from which we hope to realize something superior another
                                season, but "Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God giveth the increase." The garden
                                is bringing forth a good supply of early vegetables, and many are the blessings which
                                surround us as time goes swiftly on and for these may we ever return heartfelt thanks.

                                the dear ones in the different parts of our Zion home. Lessons of wisdom are written on
                                every page, and as we glance over the words of truth and strong testimony we often find
                                the initials of loved ones who have, hand in hand with us, fought the battles of life,
                                and are now giving evidence of the blessed salvation they have found to the young and
                                inexperienced, who are now stepping into the ranks and putting on the armor. Let us,
                                Brethren and Sisters, give them all the courage we can, that they may have the true
                                planting and be established in right principles. An aged brother once said to one caring
                                for children:�"You must still love them with all their faults." This, at times, may seem
                                almost impossible, yet I believe it is the only redeeming quality of mankind. Without
                                love life is scarcely worth living. With it the worst blows of fortune fall
                                comparatively harmless. So long as we love and are beloved we can bear the whips and
                                stings with stoical equanimity; but when love fails us or our beloved are taken from us,
                                then we begin to feel as though our armor of defence was gone. This principle of love
                                shone out brightly in the life of Ann Lee when establishing upon earth the everlasting
                                gospel of salvation. Called to forward these principles to mankind at a time when the
                                country was involved in the severe struggle for its liberty and rights of conscience,
                                she was compelled to meet a class of minds whose whole theme was patriotism and love of
                                freedom; and to meet these minds she found this God-given principle was stronger than
                                the rifle or sword. Why should not this same spirit be as powerful to-day, in reaching
                                the souls of poor humanity who are crying�Lord, what shall we do to be saved�and show
                                them where salvation and a rest for their souls can be found? The three day's rain last
                                week has done untold good. A7egetation has taken a new start and we are in hopes of
                                saving part of our crops from early frosts. Haying has commenced, but the crop looks to
                                be about two-thirds as large as last year's. On the 13th of June we were once more
                                called to witness the departure for the spirit land a dear loved one, Sister Mahaleth
                                Pratt. She has been one who has seen a long life in the work of self-denial and has
                                proved its full benefits. She was a woman of strong faith and had the force of spirit to
                                speak her faith under any and every condition. The pride and fancies of the natural mind

                                with propriety ask for an extra share of patience. To have the rain pour down from day
                                to day just as the hay is ready for the barn, involving an abundance of extra work and
                                increased expense, is not quite so agreeable as one would like to have it. But then
                                there is another side to this subject equally interesting to saints and sinners. All the
                                small fruits are made better by a liberal supply of rain, and those who watch the vines
                                and the bushes are anxious for rain while the hay-makers are sitting cross-legged, for
                                good luck to come, in fair weather. Br. Watson Andrews of North Union, O. called on us
                                the 19th of June. Seventythree years have already been recorded in his favor, and
                                although quite feeble at present, he has our union in adding to his life, as many and
                                even more years than King Hezekiah obtained in answer to his prayer. Br. Watson left us
                                on the 8th. of July for K"o. Union, expecting to call, for a short visit, at Watervliet
                                and Groveland. John Connelly, better known as Blind John, of the salvation army, made us
                                a visit, while on his way home, to Campton, N. H. He entertained our family with some
                                very interesting items in his experience as a Salvationist and although blind he has
                                been an able and industrious worker for the army.<pb n="186" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> With an Autoharp
                                he played an accom- | paniment to his singing, which reminded | us of the meeting's of
                                the Salvationists. The hour was one of pleasant satisfaction and profit. The garden
                                which adds so much to our physical comfort during the summer and autumn is now a joy to
                                the eyes, not only to the manager, Br. Arthur, but to all of his friends. One can almost
                                hear those beautiful plants, the tomatoes, potatoes and corn whispering so sweetly, day
                                and night, "I'm coming." The initial visit of the peas was on the 26th of June. Quite
                                early for this locality but very acceptable. Early peas are magnetic. The eyes are made
                                better for seeing them and the stomach decidedly better for receiving them. I had almost
                                forgotten the beans, but not so the gardener. He has lots and lots of them marching
                                along in all their glory. Our welcome for the beans will be ready on the very day that
                                the corn is ready for the table. Delicious succotash! All the Narragansetts, Mohawks,
                                Pequots and Pennacooks may be remembered with pleasure on that day. Whoever eats a dish
                                of siiccotash should remember the red man, with thanks. But we should not say much about
                                eating, it savors of commonness, and our excuse now is that the foregoing plants will
                                help to form redeeming dishes. But,�but�and it is too bad to know it, that a spiritual
                                being, made in the image of God, should not only be a common eater but an omnivorous
                                eater. The civilized and Christianized are as yet but a slight remove from their savage
                                ancestors. A little more thought on this subject may do some good and need do no harm.
                                July 10th. New potatoes are ready for digging, and the yield promises to be all that
                                could be expected. They will average 3% oz. each." The strawberries have all faded from
                                sight. Br. George furnished our family with seven bushels and twenty-two quarts. The
                                berries were large and of an excellent quality.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Alfred, Maine" TEIform="index"/> Alfred, Me.</head><p TEIform="p">July 12, 1891. Beloved Elder Heney :�Many thanks for the package of pencils. They were so
                                nicely pointed. If there are no points in "Home Notes" it will not be the fault of the
                                pencils. Elder Harvey under date of June 3rd. says they were having the last of their
                                strawberries�the first of ours came a little later, and our first green peas the 24th.
                                or three weeks later than at South Union. So it takes from three to four weeks to
                                measure the difference in climate "from Alfred to Kentucky's plains." Field strawberries
                                were unusually plenty this season, and blueberries and huckleberries much more plenty
                                than last season. The Brethren are in the midst of the hay harvest. About three-fourths
                                as much hay as last year is the verdict. June is supposed to be the best month for cream
                                and butter. Yet our May record is better than June, the one giving 4253 spaces and the
                                other 3859 spaces. The cause for this should perhaps be credited to the provender given
                                in May. The summer term of school closed July 3rd. F.

                                a few notes for the Manifesto before I am too late for the coming number. To-day is
                                Sunday and it seems good to return to quiet life after the busy battles of the week. The
                                Bible questions are very interesting and some of them must require diligent searching to
                                find correct answers. The answer to the last question is this, "The 21st. verse of the
                                7th chapter of Ezra conall the letters of the alphabet reckoning i and j as one." We
                                have been having a feast of strawberries, at this date nearly thirteen bushels have been
                                picked and more are ripe-<pb n="187" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> ning. We found the Poland Spring Houses
                                had secured all they needed from other sources so we could not sell ours there, but we
                                found a ready market for part of them in other places. Have canned all we need for
                                winter use, while our table has been bountifully supplied. Haying has commenced, which
                                we regret to say requires hired help, bids fair for an average yield. Selections from
                                the last Manifesto were read in our meeting and were enjoyed and appreciated by all.
                                Thanks to our kind Editor who so carefully prepares for us this monthly feast. Our good

                                for all kinds of crops�fruits� cereals�vegetables. Our wheat is all cut and is likely to
                                be a good yield, perhaps the best for many years. We are still selling timber, but are
                                about winding up that business. The suit against Pleasant Hill Society commenced
                                yesterday at Frankfort Kentucky. It involves a good deal of money and if the plaintiffs
                                succeed it will be an unspeakable disaster to Pleasant Hill. We are about to go back
                                once more to Osage Orange hedge fences, at least on all our public roads. We have struck
                                a Dayton O. Co. with a new method of cultivating and training by wireplashing. They have
                                planted and plashed 1200 miles of their fence within a few months. Our school closed on
                                the 2nd. of June having continued nine months. Ours is a co-education school, and our
                                Board of Education allows our teacher $50. per month. Our 1500 young apple, pear, peach
                                and plum trees are doing well and we are likely to have plenty of apples from the old
                                orchards the present year. Here is a passage from the Bible�"Not any tree in the garden
                                of God was like him in his beauty." Who will hunt it up and explain it? We were just
                                beginning to think our corn was needing rain and here it comes just in good season. We
                                have had one good shower and more is coming. New potatoes begin to come in. Charles H.
                                Sturr, Trustee and business manager at White Water commenced selling new potatoes three
                                weeks ago and opened at $1.25 per bushel. And so it goes out West. O. C.

                                and much needed. A more genial atmosphere is now experienced; the mercury has descended
                                twenty or thirty degrees since the hot days of June. On the sixteenth ult. a party of
                                three attended the graduating exercises at the Geneseo State Normal School, where three
                                thousand persons were present to witness the grand scene. The essays and orations were
                                of the very best; the vocal and instrumental music was most charming. Graduates to the
                                number of one hundred and ten received their diplomas at the hands of the Hon. A. S.
                                Draper, State Superintendant of Public Instruction. After the presentation of the
                                diplomas, he addressed the senior class. In his remarks he told them "they had been
                                educated by the State for a particular purpose, that of being teachers, and the time was
                                now come when they ought to be of considerable consequence in the world; if they were
                                not, the fault would be with themselves. He noticed in looking over the list of names
                                that there were too many pet names. These might do well in the family and even among
                                intimates, but in public life they would be found a decided disadvantage. If your
                                parents have given you such noble and historic names as Catharine or Elizabeth, do not
                                allow them to be degraded to such diminutives as Kittie and Bessie. Have a
                                substantiality and personality of your own so that your names shall mean something. Have
                                your own opinions but preserve in all things<pb n="188" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> the 'golden mean.' Do
                                not be cranks; do not run off into the isms and vagaries that are so prevalent at
                                present; maintain your opinions firmly ii; they are founded on substantial reasons, but
                                obstinacy is not opinion, an-1 amounts to nothing. Broaden your minds, this is
                                absolutely necessary." This, with much more valuable advice was given and we trust of
                                the large audience present many will be doers as well as hearers of the good word.
                                "After the address the Doxology was sung and Dr. Ivittredge of Geneseo closed with the
                                benediction and the commencement services were over." Children's day was observed in
                                this town June 21st. The service was held in the church building Sunday evening. Rev.
                                Woodworth of Byersville opened the meeting with prayer. The singing by the Sunday School
                                choir and the instrumental music was most entertaining. "Hie children's recitations were
                                a success. Rev. Woodworth delivered an address on the subject of Peace and its fruits
                                which he told us was intended for the children of all ages and stations. The "Pearl
                                Gatherers" was perfectly rendered and was a brilliant feature of the evening. John
                                McKay, Superintendent of the Sonyea Sunday School delivered a spirited and well-timed
                                sermon on the mission of the Sabbath School. Mr. McKay is an earnest and enthusiastic
                                worker in the Sunday School cause and is accomplishing much good in the neighborhood by

                                currant jelly making are among the numerous duties of the day. All that Providence has

                                acknowledge my appreciation of it. Well, I am writing you some Home Notes, so as to be
                                in union with the other Believers, as we like so well to hear from them. On the night of
                                June 17th. we experienced a very heavy wind, that injured, but did not destroy our grape
                                vines. It whipped and thrashed the tomato plants so much that we feared the elements
                                would destroy them, but at this date all the garden crops appear quite promising, and we
                                may have something substantial for the future. On the 25th. of June we picked our first
                                peas from the garden, and that is pretty fair for Canaan. In fact, it is the earliest
                                date for gathering peas that has been known during this generation. Strawberry picking
                                has come, and a strawberry short-cake, some less than a foot thick and of a goodly
                                diameter, soon comes from the Sisters' department and so palatable and so sweetly
                                delicious! I tell you what it is beloved Editor, privately of course, if, well, if
                                they�could only take care of the garden crops, they might infuse a magnetic influence
                                into the food. Our Sisters have done considerable in the garden this season, in the
                                setting of tomato and cabbage plants, and a general care in watering them during the dry
                                season, etc. They prefer to do a little gardening rather than to have so much hired
                                help. On the 29th. of June we had the pleasure of seeing a company of Sisters from the
                                Society at Enfield, N. H. The company was most acceptable and the visit very enjoyable.
                                Of late we have been drawing a few tons of Rye straw over the mountain to Lenox,
                                thirteen miles distant. It is an all day job for Brethren and teams, and would pay
                                fairly well if Lenox mountain was removed into the sea. The cherry season is upon us and
                                with the help of crows, robins, boys and other birds, and the help from our worthy
                                Sisters we expect to secure about all that nature is capable of producing on a cherry
                                tree. Have done very little haying as yet, July 5th. but shall begin at once with a full
                                determination to get through before<pb n="189" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> Christmas. So it goes, and Ave
                                must be up and at it all the time, in season and out of season. Accept much love and

                            may arise, than to present them to those who may be supposed as efficient in meeting the
                            anticipation. Although a correct knowledge of the subject must necessarily embody the whole
                            of it, for a clearer elucidation, yet for the general enquirer a more concise illustration
                            will answer all needed purposes. The why and wherefore will always be demanded for any
                            course, either secular or religious, that may bo adopted on the journey of life, and indeed,
                            it is highly proper that such should be the case with intelligent and investigating minds.
                            The informant should represent the subject of interrogation as clearly and as fully as the
                            circumstances of the case will permit. Our religious home is the Lord's vineyard. The
                            present occupants did not lay the foundation of the Community, and cannot be considered the
                            owners of it only in a usufructuary manner. We accept the property in the name of the Lord
                            our God as a consecrated inheritance which is held in trust by acting Trustees. This
                            property must be used for the mutual protection, support, comfort and happiness of the
                            Brethren and Sisters in the gospel and for such other pious and charitable purposes as the
                            gospel may require. As wTe are denominated a Christian Community, all our time and all wre
                            possess must be devoted to the uses of the Order of which we have become members.<pb n="190" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> Those who are accepted on probation and ultimately become able to comply with
                            the provisions of the Church Covenant may share in the advantages which this property
                            affords as before stated. Inquiries being made having reference to our home, our religious
                            views, or to the management of our Order should always receive kind and respectful
                            attention. No. 1. Upon what conditions is an adult admitted to a Shaker Society? Upon
                            condition that he will conform to the rules and regulations of the Society, and refrain from
                            all acts, conduct or speech that will be prejudicial to its interests. A probationary member
                            may retain the lawful ownership of his property, but the interest accruing therefrom will be
                            devoted to the benefit of the Society, until by his own free consent and the consent of the
                            Trustees he shall consecrate the property to the support of the family where he shall
                            reside. He must discharge all just and legal claims, as the Society will not be held
                            responsible for debts contracted previous to membership. If the applicant has a family, the
                            provisions of the civil law must be complied with, as no believing husband or wife is
                            allowed to separate from an unbelieving companion except by mutual or legal agreement. The
                            residence of a person in the Society will be considered as full compensation for any labor
                            that may be rendered, and wages are not paid to any person accepted into the Community. The
                            applicant for admission should be full}7 informed of the religious belief of the Society and
                            also of all duties and obligations devolving upon its members, as his acceptance is a
                            voluntary consecration of soul and body to the high principles by which the Community is
                            maintained. Some families would add other considerations to the above, as the drinking of
                            alcoholic liquors, and the smoking and chewing of tobacco.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Pilgrim fathers" TEIform="index"/> PILGRIM FATHERS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> Smoking tobacco was forbidden on the highway, or anywhere out of doors within a

                                church controversy, and says it clearly and well, giving a portrait of the reverend
                                critic. A remarkable Irishman and public character was Mr. Kavanagh, who is described,
                                and how he made his way in the world, despite the fact he had neither hands nor feet.
                                The character of Hadyn, the great musician, is well limned, and Dr. Reynolds relates
                                certain interesting incidents of animal intelligence. In the department of Practical
                                Phrenology the reader will be much entertained. It contains a striking and profusely
                                illustrated article on the study of character by photographs, and the first prize essay
                                on the "Utility of Phrenology." "A pink of Perfection" hits off a certain type of
                                childhood capitally, and "Wrong Side Out" is a good illustration of motherly tact.
                                ''Refined Physical Culture" takes up the subject of exercise on a line that has novelty,
                                and "Grape Juice" will probably open the eyes of some of the temperance people. In his
                                second article on "Systematic Moral Culture," the editor opens a newT field, and shows
                                the fallacy of expecting moral starbility without a definite training of the moral
                                faculties. Many other titles in this number (631) are deserving mention. Price, only 15

                                        acquisition. Cook both these meats until nearly done, then make the dumplings
                                        like baking powder biscuits; pour all but a little of the water from the meats
                                        into another vessel for gravy, and put the dumplings in the pot on the meat so
                                        they will not touch the water, and cook until all the water is boiled away. To
                                        remove scratches and bruises from furniture, rub them gently with a fresh

                                        basins, or in the water-closet bowl, nothing equals pulverized chalk, moistened

                                        disappear. In cooking vegetables, always remember that boiling water evaporates
                                        rapidly on the approach of a storm or when it is raining.</quote></cit><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Ladies' home journal" TEIform="index"/>From The Ladies' Home Journal.</bibl></p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">Correction.

CARD TO THE PUBLIC,
Some six months ago we began the publication of our reprint of the famous Encyclopaedia Britannica in 25 Volumes, -which
we issued at $1.50 per volume. The price
of the English edition always has been
and still is $8.09 per volume, and the
Scribner edition $5.00 per volume in the
cheapest binding.
That the public appreciate so great a
bargain is shown by the feet that over
half a million volumes of this reprint have
been sold in less than six months.
This elegant new edition we still offer
at the same price, $1.50 per volume. This
is the greatest bargain ever known in books.
Better still, Ave will deliver the set complete on small easy payments, to suit the
convenience of customers.
Eemember this is not an abridgement,
but the great Edinburgh ninth edition,
reproduced page for page, with important articles on American subjects rewritten to date by eminent American authors,
and new maps, later and better than in
any other edition.
Special Offek.�We claim that our reprint compares favorably with the high
priced editions in every respect, and in
respect to maps, and strength and beauty
of bindings is superior to them. In order
that this claim may be tested by a person
al inspection we make the following proposition: We will furnish volume I. at
60 cts.�a fraction of actual cost�ii' sent
by express. Add 40 cts. postage if wanted
by mail. Amount paid for Volume I. will
be credited on price of set when ordered.

We have before us a work just issued from
the press, entitled The early life of "Brick"
Pomeroy. It is dedicated to all who are
struggling to better their condition by honest persevering endeavor. This journey of
the life of a poor boy is one checkered scene
from infancy to extended manhood, and will
prove a present inspiration to a large class
of readers who are contending against difficulties on their journey of life, and will soon
learn that "where there's a will, there's a
way."
"To an excellent constitution and well attuned heredity union of parents, am I indebted for an unusually vigorous health line.
To the watchful care of a mother in heaven
and to her beautiful spirit whisperings to me
am I indebted for the joy there is in looking
up and . patiently plodding along in the way
that I believe is the  proper one for man to
work and walk in. To the love, kindness,
good advice, continued interest, affection and
watchfulness of my dear uncle and his wife,
am I indebted for foundations of manliness,
honesty, industry and temperance.
My early life was spent in the thin-soiled
garden of poverty, with almost every way
upward hedged in by. circumstances beyond
my control. I was taught obedience, the
first of all useful lessons, and at the same
time I feel that less severity would have
done the work as well. Early wants were
supplied by labor and contriving."
This book contains 250 pages. Within the
same covers are bound two other books.
Better than Gold of 140 pages and Ourselves and Neighbors of 160 pages. Price
