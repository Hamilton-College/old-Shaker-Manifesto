BLACK GETS A BLACK EYE.
A. ]�ew York Jud^e Rentiers a l>eci�ion
in favor of the  It. ji. Peale Reprint
of toe JEiiejcl<>i��Mliu Britannica.
[New York Special.]�Judge Wallace, in
the United States Circuit Court rendered
a decision to-day refusing to grant an injunction against the firm of Ehrich Bros.,
to restrain them from selling the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," published by R. S.
Peale & Co. of Chicago. The complainants are the firm of Black & Co., publishers of the original work at Edinburgh,
Scotland. In his decision Judge Wallace
holds that rival publishers in this country
have a legal right to use the contents of
the original edition, except such portions
of them as are covered by copyrights, secured by American authors. The defendant's work, he finds, has substituted
articles for these copyrighted ones.
This decision is a square set back to the
book trust, and directly in the interest of
education and general intelligence. As an
educational factor in every household, no
work in all literature is so important and
desirable as this King of Encyclopedias,
of which it has been said that "If all other
books should be destroyed, the Bible excepted, the world would have lost very
little of its information." Until recently
its high cost has been a bar to its popular
use, the price being $5.00 per volume,
$125.00 for the set in the cheapest binding.
But last year the publishing firm of R. S.
Peale & Co. of Chicago issued anew reprint
of this great work at the marvelous price
of $1.50 per volume. That the public were
quick to appreciate so great a bargain is
shown by the fact that over half a million
volumes of this reprint were sold in less
than six months. It is the attempt of the
proprietors of the high priced edition to
stop the sale of this desirable low priced
edition, which Judge Wallace has effectually squelched by his decision. We learn
that R. S. Peale & Co. have perfected their
edition, correcting such minor defects as
are inevitable in the first issue of so large
a work and not only do they continue to
furnish it at the marvelously low price
quoted above, but they offer to deliver the
complete set at once, on small easy payments to suit the convenience of customers. It is a thoroughly satisfactory edition, printed on good paper, strongly and
handsomely bound and has new maps,
later and better than any other edition.
We advise all who want this greatest and
best of all Encyclopajdias to get particulars from the publishers, R. S. Peale &
Co., Chicago.

Published in Albany, N. !"., in 1808. No. 3. Of the first
                            appearances of the extraordinary ivork, in different parts of Kentucky, in 1800 and 1801.
                            The first extraordinary appearances of the power of God in the late revival, began about the
                            close of the last century, in Logan and Christian counties ; on the waters of Gasper and Red
                            Rivers. In the spring of 1801, the same extraordinary work broke out in Mason County, upper
                            part of Kentucky; of which I was an eye witness, and can therefore, with greater confidence,
                            testify what I have heard, seen and felt. It began first in individuals who had been under
                            deep convictions oi sin, and great trouble about their souls, and had fasted and prayed, and
                            diligently searched the Scriptures, and had undergone distresses of mind inexpressibly sore,
                            until they had obtained a comfortable hope of salvation. And from seeing and feeling the
                            love of Christ, and his willingness to save all that would forsake their sins and turn to
                            God through him; and feeling how freely his love and goodness flowed to them, it kindled
                            their love to other souls, that were lost in their sins; and an ardent desire that they
                            might come and partake of that spiritual light, life and comfort, which appeared infinite in
                            its nature, and free to all. Under such an overpowering weight of the divine goodness, as
                            tongue could not express, they were constrained to cry out, with tears and trembling, and
                            testify a full and free salvation in Christ, for all that would come; and to warn their
                            fellowcreatures of the danger of continuing in sin. They entreated them in the most tender
                            and affectionate manner, to turn from it and seek the Lord, in sure and certain hope that he
                            would be found. Under such exhortations, the people began to be affected in a very strange
                            manner. At first they were taken with an inward throbbing of the heart; then with weeping
                            and trembling: from that to crying out in apparent agony of soul; falling down and swooning
                            away till every appearance<pb n="50" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> of animal life was suspended, and the person
                            appeared to be in a trance. From this state they would recover under different sensations,
                            which will be more particularly noticed hereafter. The following extract of a letter, dated
                            Caneridge, Jan. 30, 1801, gives a striking account of the work, as it first appeared in the
                            lower parts of Kentucky and Cumberland. "The work is still increasing in Cumberland. It has
                            overspread the whole country. It is in Nashville, Barren, Muddy, Grasper, Redbanks and
                            Knoxville." "J. M. has been there two months ; he says it exceeds anything he ever saw or
                            heard. Children and all, seem to be engaged: but children are the most active in the work.
                            When they speak, it appears that the Lord sends his spirit to accompany it with power to the
                            hearts of sinners. They all seem to be wrought in an extraordinary way. They lie as though
                            they were dead, for some time, without pulse or breath; some longer, some a shorter time.
                            Some rising with joy and triumph ; others crying for mercy. As soon as they get comfort,
                            they cry to sinners ; exhorting them day and night to turn to the Lord." * * P. H. It is
                            worthy of notice that a work by which God intended to bring down the pride and loftiness of
                            man, should begin in little children. By this it was manifest who were the furthest lost
                            from God, and what course must be taken in order to return. At a sacrament, near
                            Flemingsburgh, the last Sabbath in April, the power of God was very visible among the people
                            through the whole of the occasion ; under which there was much weeping, trembling and
                            convulsion of soul. What was the most solemn and striking, was the case of two little girls,
                            who in the time of meeting, cried out in great distress. They both continued for some time
                            praying and crying for mercy, till one of them received a comfortable hope ; and then
                            turning to the other, cried out "O ! come to Christ! Take hold of his promise and trust in
                            him. He is able to save to the uttermost! O ! I have found peace to my soul! O ! the
                            precious Savior! come just as you are ! he will take away the stony heart and give you a
                            heart of flesh! You cannot make yourself any better. Just give up your heart to Christ, now!
                            You are not a greater sinner than others. You need not wait another moment!" Thus she
                            continued exhorting, until her little companion received a ray from heaven, that produced a
                            sudden and sensible change : then rising with her in her arms, she cried out in a most
                            affecting manner�"O here is another star of light!" These children were perhaps nine or ten
                            years old. The Sabbath following about twenty persons were struck in the congregation of
                            Cabin-Creek, Mason Co. Among the first who cried out in distress, was a girl about twelve
                            years old. Their convictions of their lost state, from a sudden opening of that pure
                            holiness to which sin stands directly opposed, were quick as the lightning's flash; and came
                            with such weight, that had they not, in some way or other, opened their case, they must have
                            sunk into<pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> the horrors of despair. It was dire necessity which at first
                            obliged them to expose themselves to public view, as objects of pity ; for everything of the
                            kind was looked upon by the generality, even of professors, as wild enthusiasm, or the
                            fruits of a disordered brain. There were, however, a few who understood the disorder, and
                            were ready to fly to their relief and proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
                            the prison to them that were bound. Here a new scene was opened, while some trembled like
                            one in a fit of the ague; wept or cried out, lamenting their distance from God, and
                            exposedness to his wrath; others were employed in praying with them, encouraging them to
                            believe on the Son of God and to venture upon his promise. To give up their wicked,
                            rebellious heart, just as it was ; for God to take it away, and give them a, heart of flesh
                            ; singing hymns and giving thanks to God, for the display of his power, without any regard
                            to former rules of order. At this, some were offended and withdrew from the assembly,
                            determined to oppose it, as a work of the wicked one. But all their objections only tended
                            to open the way for the true nature and spirit of the work to shine out; and encourage the
                            subjects of it to set out with warmer zeal to promote it. Accordingly a meeting was
                            appointed a few evenings after, to which a crowd of awakened souls flocked, and spent the
                            whole night in singing hymns, praying and exhorting one another. At this meeting one man was
                            struck down and lay for about an hour, in the situation above mentioned. This put the matter
                            beyond dispute, that the work was supernatural ; and the outcry which it raised against sin,
                            confirmed a number in the belief that it was from above. From small beginnings, it gradually
                            spread. The news of these strange operations flew abroad, and attracted many to come and
                            see; who were convinced, not only from seeing and hearing, but feeling; and carried home the
                            testimony, that it was the living work of God. This stirred up others, and brought out still
                            greater multitudes. And these strange exercises still increasing, and having no respect to
                            any stated hours of worship, it was found expedient to encamp onv the ground, and continue
                            the meeting day and night. To these encampments the people flocked in hundreds and
                            thousands, on foot, on horseback and in carriages. At first appearance, these meetings
                            exhibited nothing to the spectator but a scene of confusion that could scarce be put into
                            human language. They were generally opened with a sermon, near the close of which there
                            would be an unusual outcry; some bursting forth into loud ejaculations of prayer, or
                            thanksgiving for the truth. Others breaking out in emphatical sentences of exhortation.
                            Others flying to their careless friends, with tears of compassion, beseeching them to turn
                            to the Lord. ' Some, struck with terror, and hastening through the crowd to make their
                            escape, or pulling away their relations. Others, trembling, weeping and<pb n="52" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>
                            house; who, like so many corpses, covered a considerable part of the floor. There were
                            persons at this meeting, from Caneridge, Concord, Eagle-Creek and other neighboring
                            congregations, who partook of the spirit of the work, which was a particular means of its
                            spreading. The next general camp-meeting was held at Concord, in the County of Bourbon,
                            about the last of May. The number who attended on this occasion was supposed to be about
                            four thousand. Seven Presbyterian ministers were present, four of whom were opposed to the
                            work and spoke against it. On the fourth day about noon, the evidence became so powerful,
                            that they all professed to be convinced that it was the work of God. One of them addressed
                            the assembly with tears, acknowledging that notwithstanding they had long been praying to
                            the Lord to pour out his spirit, yet when it came they did not know it, but wickedly opposed
                            the answer of their own prayers. On this occasion, no sex nor color, class nor description,
                            were exempted from the pervading influence of the spirit; even from the age of eight months
                            to sixty years, there were evident subjects of this marvelous operation. The meeting
                            continued five days and four nights ; and after the people generally scattered from the
                            ground, numbers convened in different places and continued the exercise much longer. Even
                            where they were not collected together, these wonderful operations continued among every
                            class of people and in every situation; in their houses and fields, and in their daily
                            crying out for the Lord Jesus to have mercy upon them: fainting away till every appearance
                            of life was gone, and the extremities of the body assumed the coldness of a corpse. Others
                            surrounding them with melodious songs, or fervent prayers for their happy resurrection in
                            the love of Christ. Others collecting into circles around this variegated scene, contending
                            with arguments for and against. Under such appearances, the work would continue for several
                            days and nights together. I will now mention particularly, some of the meetings of this
                            kind, with a few concomitant circumstances, from which the work took a general spread in the
                            year 1801. The first was held at Cabin-Creek. It began on the 22nd. of May, and continued
                            four days and three nights. The scene was awful beyond description ; the falling, crying
                            out, praying, exhorting, singing and shouting, exhibited such new and striking evidences of
                            a supernatural power, that few, if any, could escape without being affected. Such as tried
                            to run from it, were frequently struck on the way, or impelled by some alarming signal to
                            return : and so powerful was the evidence on all sides, that no place was found for the
                            obstinate sinner to shelter himself but under the protection of prejudiced and bigoted
                            professors. No circumstance at this meeting appeared more striking, than the great numbers
                            that fell on the third night; and to prevent their being trodden under foot by the
                            multitude, they were collected together and laid out in order, on two squares of the
                                meeting-<pb n="53" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> employments, falling down and crying out under conviction,
                            or singing and shouting with unspeakable joy, were so common, that the whole country round
                            about, seemed to be leavened with the spirit of the work. The next camp-meeting was at
                            Eagle-Creek, Ohio. It began June oth. and continued four days and three nights. The number
                            of people was not so great, as the country was new, but the work was equally powerful
                            according to the number. At this meeting the principal leading characters in the place fully
                            embraced the spirit of the work, which laid a permanent foundation for its continuance and
                            spread in that quarter. The next general meeting was at Pleasant Point, Kentucky, which
                            equaled if not surpassed any that had been before. Here, the Christian minister, the common
                            professor, the deist and debauchee, were forced to take one common lot among the wounded,
                            and confess with equal candor, that hitherto they had been total strangers to the religion
                            of Jesus. From this meeting, the work was spread extensively through Bourbon, Fayette, and
                            other neighboring Counties, and was carried by a number of its subjects to the south side of
                            Kentucky, where it found in the hearts of many, a permanent residence. The general meeting
                            at Indian Creek began the 24th. of July, and continued about five days. To this meeting the
                            subjects of the work were generally collected from all quarters, and abundantly strengthened
                            each other in the exercises of prayer, exhortation, singing, shouting and leaping for joy.
                            But there was very little appearance of that power which strikes conviction to the heart of
                            the sinner, until the third day. A boy, by appearance about twelve years old, retired from
                            the stand in time of preaching under a very extraordinary impression, and having mounted a
                            log at some distance, and raising his voice in a very affecting manner, he attracted, in a
                            few minutes, the main body of the people. With tears, he cried aloud to the wicked, warning
                            them of their danger, denouncing their certain doom if they persisted in their sins,
                            expressing his love to their souls, and desire that they would turn to the Lord and be
                            saved. He was held up by two men, and spoke for about an hour, with that convincing
                            eloquence that could be inspired only from above. AVrhen his strength seemed quite exhausted
                            and language failed to describe the feelings of his soul, he raised his hand and dropping
                            his handkerchief, wet with perspiration from his little face, cried out, "Thus, O sinner!
                            shall you drop into hell, unless you forsake your sins and turn to the Lord." At that moment
                            some fell like those who are shot in battle, and the work spread in a manner which human
                            language cannot describe. (to be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="It is not work that kills men..." TEIform="index"/>It is not work that kills men...

                            the dawn was nigh. And I awoke, as if from dreams, Thus did my heart aspire,� To fill the
                            day with sunny gleams Of noble, true desire. And with an earnest soul and will I rose to
                            meet the day, Its many duties to fulfill That cumber us alway, But ere a few short hours
                            were spent, My plans�forgotten, all, On other missions too intent, My lips let harsh words
                            fall. Oh life's wasted, wasted power Of aspirations vast, That thrilled my soul at morning's
                            hour To bless ere day was past. Oh! lofty thoughts, resolves that burned Within a living
                            flame; Those vital fires to ashes turned From whence no brightness came. Oh thoughtless
                            words! Oh idle thought! Yea, weak and erring will; [fraught Life's misspent hours that
                            should be With good instead of ill. And as I viewed^by sunset light, My failure and defeat,
                            I rose with more encouraged might Life's many foes to meet. Failure, new vistas to us opes,
                            Suffering brings us joy; And on the ashes of our hopes We build to God's employ. But hark! I
                            hear a soft voice speak Which bids me bravely bear; And while my erring heart is weak To
                            seek the strength of prayer. Mount Lebanon, N.

Praise to thee,
                            blessed Mother Ann, for this good, great and glorious work which tkou hast done for all the
                            children of this world ; to lead man back to his native purity, that he may, in deed and in
                            truth, again become the noble representative of his God. That he may walk in uprightness and
                            present to his Maker the offering of gratitude, praise and thanksgiving, with "clean hands
                            and a pure heart." We praise thee for this soul-ennobling work in which thou hast marked out
                            the path and led the way wherein the children of men may, by confession and repentance
                            cleanse their spirits from all uncleanness, and become thy lovely sons and daughters. We
                            praise thee for this glorious light and liberty, this sweet releasement of soul and body

                            a wide-spread field, all of which was richly cultivated. Everywhere were seen beautiful
                            flowers, luscious fruits, and golden grain. Through the winding, wellkept paths, wandered
                            people of every age, from happy childhood, to the silvery-haired veteran ; not only to gaze
                            on the beauty before them, but to be fed from its generous growth; and though from the great
                            variety every one found something suited to their taste, and none came away empty handed,
                            yet the supply grew none the less. Though richly ripe the fruit, decay was not visible ; and
                            though the heads of grain with fullness bent, no mildew's blast was seen. ISIo cruel wire's
                            barb, nor thorny hedge, forbade the passer-by to enter; only a low, firm wall its boundary
                            marked, over which a child could leap, or wearied age recline. As we stood there enwrapped
                            in thought, coveting the possession of such wealth, a measured tread was heard in the
                            distance, and too well we knew the harvest signs, to doubt who were approaching. On, on they
                            came ; nearer and surer the footsteps of those who were to gather for the "Harvest Home." We
                            had no greeting for these gatherers, no welcome for the reapers, and we turned not as they
                            silently passed us by and entered the field. Their work was soon done and they departed
                            laden with the growth of a willing heart and skillful hands. "And is this the end of all
                            these fruitful labors?" we cried, as we saw the treasures depart. But a voice from the field
                            called, "Come and see ;" and lo ! the ripened fruit had cast its seed ; from the heavy
                            shocks the grain had fallen, and new life was starting from the fertile soil. "Surely" we
                            thought "The hand of the diligent maketh rich," and "The memory of the just is blessed."
                            Need we a Daniel, or a Joseph, to interpret this open vision? We are now standing by this
                            life-field of our departed father and friend ; and in every particular we may see a life
                            comparison. Wide-spread has been the field of his labor, and his varied talents so richly
                            cultivated, have yielded fruit for every age and class. In business economy a man ; socially
                            a friend and<pb n="56" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> counselor, and spiritually a saint. What better fruits
                            could the many talents bear. Happy in his life-work, his fruits have not ripened to decay;
                            nor has the rust of a discontented old age, hidden the luxuriant growth of his sheaves. No
                            barbs of self-righteousness, nor thorns of selfishness, bounded his goodness ; but all of
                            God's creation were free to share from his liberal hand. And now that the harvest angels
                            have claimed their own, even at this late hour, we sigh that the field was reaped so soon.
                            But over this we have no control and we resignedly bow the reapers out, while we think of
                            the choice seed he has sown, and trust that his parental hand may still assist to mature its
                            growth, until it reproduces his life example. We do not say farewell to thee, dear father,
                            for though thou hast passed to higher fields of labor, thy memory will long be green in thy
                            earth-field. Thine hast been a happy old age, and thy hoary head hast worn the crown of
                            glory, because it has been found in the way of righteousness. "Many shalt arise to call thee
                            blessed" and with one accord we most earnestly desire that we too "may die the death of the
                            righteous." Mount Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Friend John Whiteley:--My attention is directed to an obituary..." TEIform="index"/>

                            Elder Robert Aitken of your Enfield Community, as presented to the readers of the February
                            number of the Manifesto by Thomas Stroud. In reading this, to me, painful notice, I am
                            forcibly reminded of the very pleasant, friendly intercourse which Elder Aitken, thyself and
                            the writer hereof had from time to time together on board the steamship Servia, during our
                            voyage to England the past summer. I assure you that I hold him in sweet remembrance and I
                            shall never forget, I trust, some of the words of wisdom, tempered as they seemed to be by a
                            true Christian spirit, which fell from his lips, and in the contemplation of them and the
                            one who gave them utterance, I am constrained to repeat the words, as penned by the gifted
                            poet, friend, John G. Whittier to the memory of his friend Thomas Shipley. "Gone to thy
                            Heavenly Father's rest, The flowers of Eden round thee blowing, And on thine ear the murmurs
                            blest, Of Siloa's waters, softly flowing! Beneath the tree of life wliich gives To all the
                            earth its healing leaves, In the white robe of angels clad, And wandering by that sacred
                            river, Whose streams of holiness make glad The city of our God, forever. Gentlest of
                            spirits! not for thee� Our tears are shed, our sighs are given, Why mourn to know thou art a
                            free Partaker of the joys of Heaven? Finished thy work and kept tliy faith, In Christian
                            firmness unto death; And beautiful as sky and earth, When autumn's sun is downward going.
                            The blessed memory of thy worth, Around thy place of slumber glowing." As you will probably
                            recollect, I communicated to you and Robert Aitken my intention to visit him and also
                            thyself and friends during the past autumn at your respective homes, and I regret
                            exceedingly my inability to<pb n="57" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> do so, caused as it was by a change in my
                            plans of business, which had they been executed as at first proposed, would have taken me to
                            Boston and hence enabled me to visit you and Robert as I suggested I would do, under such
                            circumstances. I will now assure you of my continued purpose of visiting you at Shirley
                            Village, at some future time and if my life shall be spared until then it will most likely
                            be during the year 1891. In the meantime I shall be pleased to hear from you by letter, to
                            which it will give me pleasure to respond and you will please direct as previously advised.

                            both I am much obliged. I was afraid from the reports of the storms at the time of your
                            voyage, that you would have a rough passage, and regret to learn that you was so ill. It is
                            pleasant to hear of Mr. Carnegie's kindness to you. He is a good man in spite of his
                            enormous wealth. I am sorry to learn from your letter that the vast growth of material
                            riches in the United States is having the effect of degrading the people. It would seem that
                            too great prosperity is always an evil for nations, be they monarchical or republican. The
                            increase of wealth in individual hands is the curse. What is made by society ought to be
                            enjoyed by society in the highest sense of enjoyment, namely, in the moral and spiritual
                            welfare of community. You and I know that man wants but little food, if that be � obtained
                            from the goodly fruits of the earth. I can live healthfully and happily on a few cents a
                            day. This fact is proof to me that the bounty of God should go to the advancing of our
                            mental and spiritual nature. A rational being does not want more than sustenance. All the
                            surplus of our gifts from nature should be turned to the development of our highest powers.
                            That is to the making here on earth that spiritual existence which most religions defer to
                            the other world. I am quite at one with your Society in believing that the vast spiritual
                            universe is open to those who live purely, holy, and for eternal purposes. I have found much
                            pleasure and instruction in Elder Eads' discourses. He has the true illumination. I should
                            be glad to converse with him for I find in him a brother in the spirit. It has taken me some
                            time (in my busy life) to read his book. You will excuse my delay to reply on that account.
                            I have thought several times of the suggestion made by James Burns of Southampton Row,
                            London, that the Shakers should open up this country. I do not think our people are ready
                            for such a movement. They are too individualistic. They need to be socialized and
                            spiritualized a great deal more before they can appreciate the lofty system under which your
                            Community lives. But of this I am assured, namely, that thousands of our men and women,
                            yearn for the peace and purity and spiritual joy, in<pb n="58" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> which Brethren and
                            Sisters dwell. You alone have tried to make this world with all its lowering tendencies, the
                            fore-court of that heaven of rest, that is believed by the multitude to be impossible of
                            attainment now, and doubtful of attainment even after death. Hence you are the pioneers of
                            the great future of humanity. That Britain should have been the birthplace of Shakerism is
                            profoundly significant and portends, I think, to show that our race is ripening for an
                            incalculable spiritual advancement in the near future. By and by when we have got much
                            preliminary political and religious difficulties out of the way, our people will begin to
                            adopt your principles. As you know, stupendous changes are coming upon the world, and they
                            are purely of a spiritual nature. That means the decay of fleshly appetites of every kind,
                            the exaltation of the permanent in human nature and the down-treading of that which makes us
                            earth-bound and materialistic. I should be obliged to you to receive some work informing me
                            of Ann Lee's prophetic work here and in America, or to know from you where I can obtain
                            them, here. She was the first teacher of the new principles, and it is necessary for me to
                            know what can be learned of her wonderful leadership. I do what I can to forward the good
                            cause of spiritual progress by teaching and study, and your Society has been, and is working
                            in this field. All sorts of agents are needed to hasten the progress of the human family
                            from its present unhappy and bewildered position, to the harmony, peace and fraternity which
                            only an absolutely spiritual conception of our beings can bestow. Civilization will be lost
                            and man again be hurled back into bestiality unless the leaders of spiritual truth do their
                            duty. Now, civilization to me is nothing but the bringing together the dispersed and divided
                            children of men into community. But the unscrupulous reign of the wealth made in society by
                            a few, and their habits of natural pleasures and contempt of the spirit will end in the
                            sanguine downfall of the race for an indefinite period, unless we do our best to teach
                            spirituality. The battle is tremendous between the powers of light and d arkness, and all
                            the social convulsions and religious shocks of the world prove it. 1 hope this long and
                            somewhat vehement letter will not fatigue you, my dear friend. But I write as I wou.ld talk
                            with you, and that is impossible just now. I hope some time to have the happiness of seeing
                            you again either here or at your home. We are, I am sure, kindred spirits, equally desirous
                            of raising our fellow-beings somewhat while it is called to-day, and hoping to do forever. I
                            am yours in love and truth,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Flynt, Garrett" TEIform="persName"/>Garrett Flynt.</byline></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Julia A.

                            surprise and pleasure to hear from you. I feared you would forget the promise made, but,
                            here is visible proof of your kindly remembrance. I too, am glad that "Mother Betsey" still
                            lingers on earth. I was much in-<pb n="59" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> terested in her, and have many times
                            thought of our pleasant interview. Many times have I read the names so kindly written in the
                            book given me. Her name is first, and as I trace the letters bold and clear, I seem to see
                            her face, and hear her voice. Bless her! my soul-arms embrace her, and on her lips I press a
                            loving kiss. May her living presence be with you another year. Like a sheaf of full grown,
                            golden grain she stands, waiting to be "gathered in." My tenderest love to her. The
                            "Testimonies of Mother Ann," I have read with much interest, and here I will make my
                            "confession." I believe she was sent of God, to do the work she did, and lay the foundation
                            of the Societies that have been the outgrowth of her labors on earth. I believe she was
                            spiritually illuminated ; that in her experience she passed from darkness to light; from
                            ignorance to understanding ; from simple belief in a truth to a positive knowledge of truth,
                            of divine law and order. I am no saint, wish I was ; but, in my life, 1 have had experiences
                            that have taught me some of the possibilities of the human soul; that in certain conditions
                            it may climb heights, see sights, fathom mysteries and learn lessons of wisdom, not
                            otherwise known to man, and never found in books. It cannot be written. Ah, well are ye that
                            follow, looking upward to that beaconlight set out to guide your feet in purer, pleasanter
                            paths, even the paths of peace. The "Manifesto" is a treasure-house. In its numbers I find
                            many jewels of thought and inspirational poetry. All these prove, that while you are shut in
                            from the coarse elements of the world, you have fields of thought rich and fertile. Your
                            hearts encircle every problem of life. The great questions of the day and age ; the
                            purification of the avenues of worldly life. Who can better point the way to the heights of
                            holiness, and the better adjustment of law, political and social, than the peace-loving
                            Shakers ? Have you not worked out each problem theoretically and practically ? Heaven bless
                            your Society ! May its purifying, vitalizing elements, bless the world and bring the dawn of
                            that day, or period, when earth's children can say, thy kingdom has come, thy will is done
                            on earth as it is done in heaven. Mother Ann was a goodf Prophet; Trust her words and fear
                            not, her coming was not in vain. Remember me in love to each and every Sister. Thanks to
                            Sister Minerva for her pretty card and Augusta for her remembrance. I often think of our
                            pleasant interview and wish for another. I hope to see you next summer, and sooner if it is
                            possible for you or any of the sisters to visit Troy. Don't fail to call. My husband joins

                            </head><p TEIform="p">No better advice could be given to the Christian pilgrim than to "puton the whole armor
                                of God." Walking as he necessarily must, in the midst of trials and temptations, he
                                needs for this divine service a special preparation, and great carefulness must be
                                exercised, to have everything in the best of order, and so nicely adjusted that time,
                                that indispensible staff of life, may not be wasted during the march to victory. Jesus
                                evidently' thought of this same preparation and carefully presented it in the best light
                                he could to his disciples, as he called them "my soldiers," peace-loving soldiers who
                                have been harvested from the ranks of the world a,nd were, even while with him,
                                surrounded by the influences of a long life among the Scribes, Pharisees and hypocrites.
                                He had, through his inspirational gift, called them from that worldly relation to be his
                                co-workers in redeeming the world from its many errors. Their call was the same as is
                                our call, through the manifestation of God, or the good Spirit. Directing influences
                                moved them to change their lives, by making their own paths strait, as they were warned
                                to "make ready the Avay of the Lord, and to make his paths strait." This influence has
                                protected us as we have moved along on our pilgrimage and opened to us a life of
                                spiritual consecration, that we might be made able to walk in newness of life. As that
                                age was one of "wars and fightings," it was readily understood that every man was more
                                or less acquainted with the legitimate duties of a soldier. Peter, by his dexterous use
                                of the sword could not have been ignorant of a soldier's life, and in all probability
                                the whole order of disciples had learned the same lesson. Jesus rebuked this display of
                                unchristian chivalry and a spiritual armor was recommended for all who had entered the
                                warfare against the elements of the world, that were opposed to the life of the soul.
                                Even Paul, in his exhortations to a Christian life assured his hearers that if<pb n="61" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> they were properly equipped for the contest they might be absolutely sure
                                of the victory. Those who accept the cross of Christ and deny themselves of all
                                ungodliness, soon learn the truth of the statement, as made by the Apostle, that the
                                weapons of our warfare "are not of flesh, but divinely powerful for the demolition of
                                fortresses." This is the life work of the Believer which makes of him a peacemaker among
                                his Brethren and a child of God among his gospel kindred. Through this he becomes a
                                preacher of righteousness to the children of this world and an unfailinglight to guide
                                souls to God. It is not always that "the race is to the swift, nor the battle to
                                thestrong," but it is certainly and effectually to those who walk uprightly. How
                                earnestly and devotedly those should work who are privileged to know of a better way
                                than that which is pursued by the children of this world. The light which has illumined
                                the soul has come from God, and if protected through carefulness and prayer, must grow
                                brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. God's gift to our souls, and to our gospel
                                homes should share our undivided interest, that our prosperity, both in the temporal and
                                in the spiritual blessings may be secured and permanently fixed, as our souls awaken to
                                the beautiful and holy calling that has rested upon us.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mount Lebanon, N.

                                is a welcome guest. We always find items of interest in Home Notes of the different
                                Societies and families. In most of the articles of the last . kindly notice is taken of
                                the demise of our honored and much beloved Elder Giles, whose place will be filled by
                                Elder Joseph Holden to the best of his ability. While it is a great cross for us to part
                                with him from the Center family, we are glad that our little circle had one in its midst
                                so worthy and acceptable to the people as he is and we of the Center bid him good, or
                                God-speed in his new vocation. We know he will do honor to the place and to the family
                                in whose kindly care he grew to manhood. Br. Alonzo is a worthy successor to Elder
                                Joseph, who meiits the love and good feelings of Believers far and near, and I doubt not
                                will have the prayers of his numerous friends both among Believers and those not
                                connected with the household of faith. Winter is far progressed and the weather taken
                                together has been quite moderate. All the families in our Society have secured a
                                winter's crop of ice. One family secured theirs this week, in nice condition. Although
                                the season has been quite icy, yet there has been no report of broken bones thus far,
                                which is cause for gratitude. We pray the Lord of the harvest to send forth more
                                reapers, as we have room in our houses and in our hearts for many, many faithful souls,
                                who may wish to<pb n="62" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> come and dedicate themselves to a life of

                                families are hauling and spreading manure on their meadow land. The weather is cold here
                                and a warm stove is looked upon with a good degree of pleasure. 1 hear the hum of the
                                sewing machines every day, except Sunday, and I conclude our Sisters are anxious to make
                                shirts for the heathen, (or somebody else.) So we are busy helping each other along. We
                                have had enough of winter to last us twelve months and are now looking anxiously for
                                spring. The hens have been on a strike this winter, and refuse to lay. We are in hopes
                                with warm weather, to have the strike declared off. We have not much to complain of, and
                                a great deal for which to be thankful. J. B. Oue ice was harvested some time ago, a
                                goodly store, both in quality and quantity. There has been good sleighing most of the
                                time, and snow in the woods has been a little too deep to please the wood-choppers. The
                                weather is good, bad and indifferent ; and we have had f otir stormy Sundays in
                                succession. In answer to enquiries about our silo�would say that since we have commenced
                                feeding ensilage to our cows, we think the quantity and quality of milk much improved.
                                Br. Daniel in Home Notes of Feb. ISTo. says, there is something lacking or wanting at
                                Watervliet and throughout our Zion homes. What is needed? What is wanting? Talmage, in a
                                recent sermon, says, what the Churches need to-day is, "Power from on high." Is it not
                                this power from on high that we need and what Zion lacks? Will it come to us without
                                exertion? and shall we be willing to accept it? Words are not lacking�but the Holy
                                Spirit which is a consuming fire.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hancock, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Hancock, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p">Feb. 1891.

                                serve the purpose, simply because they become tired of the sameness of diet and readily

Dear Editor:�On the 31st ult. we were called to pay a worthy tribute of
                                respect to one of our old comrades, a true soldier of Christ, beloved Elder, Isaac
                                Bailey of Shirley. So we see that the veterans are leaving us, one at a time, to report
                                in another home, and it is left for us to hold aloft the banner of Virgin purity and to
                                keep it for others, as they have kept it for us. Thus far the present winter has been
                                very favorable for business, indeed the best for twenty-five years. The snow came in
                                November and the white mantle has covered the earth to the present day. Our Brethren are
                                engaged in the herb and broom business. Should any of our friends need some of these
                                necessaries of life, we could furnish them very readily. Of herbs we have a large
                                amount, and are continually sending them to Boston, through hope that they may help
                                correct some of the miseries of that enlightened city. On page 35 of Feb. Manifesto, we
                                read a little gem, contributed by some dear soul, "Let no knowledge satisfy but that
                                which lifts above the world," etc. What a lesson to learn! This shall be my aim. The
                                knowledge of deep truths, treasured in the store-house of heaven is what my soul thirsts
                                for each day, and the only way to gain this treasure, is to live to our highest
                                understanding of right. Our blessed Mother Ann, gave us many good examples in this new
                                order of life. "Hands at work and heart to God." "Do not fail to meet together for
                                worship, even though your houses should be torn down, over your heads."<pb n="64" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> The necessity of keeping a spiritual gift and regularly attending our
                                religious service ought to be with us of the first importance, as in this way, our
                                Mother, found a great salvation and travail of soul. "Seek first the kingdom of God and
                                its righteousness and all things will he added." Let us all give this a little more
                                attention. A.

                                Canterbury is elevated some nine hundred feet above the city of Boston, and full one
                                hundred feet above the streams and ponds in our vicinity, so that it is quite
                                impracticable, at present, to use water as a motive power for machinery unless we go
                                some distance from home. At the first family we use a twenty-five horse power engine for
                                laundry purposes and the running of several knitting machines. For the sawing of
                                cord-wood we use an engine of six horse-power; one in the printing office of three
                                horse-power and one in the dairy of one horse-power. This last mentioned is a "Davey
                                Safety Engine," and it is beyond dispute, a safety engine, in the charge of the
                                inexperienced or even of a child. At the North family they have a six horse-power engine
                                for their laundry, their dairy and for the sawing of wood. Our ice harvest in January
                                was of the best quality, and not less than one hundred and fifty tons were secured for
                                the use of our family. The ice, when cut, was sixteen inches in thickness. From our
                                herdsman we have this item:� that a Jersey cow gave ninety-nine quarts of milk in seven
                                days, and from this was obtained six pounds of butter. This we call doing pretty well on
                                the hill-sides of New Hampshire. * Feb. 1891. Beloved Editoi::�The absence of "Home
                                Notes" from Canterbury, in the Manifestos of 1891 is no sign that we are away from home,
                                or that its interests are not still guarded by as valiant soldiers as held the fort
                                throughout the good old year, 1890. It is so natural to depend upon ready pens and
                                willing hands that have served us in the past, that only the absence of a good thing
                                brings us to a realization of the truth, that we should give as willingly as we have
                                received. We are sternly aware that we have entered the second month of our spiritual
                                New Year, which we pledged to make bright and glorious by renewed efforts of willing
                                consecration. Some one says it would be well for us to pause between each month, long
                                enough to settle our debit and credit accounts, spiritually, repent of all sin committed
                                by seeking an honest confession and newness of life; thus enjoy twelve New Year's days
                                where we have formerly had but one. A timely suggestion, the conscientious regard of
                                which will insure us a place in that kingdom, forever increasing. At date of writing,
                                our predicted storm has not commenced, and we meet for our Society service wherein we
                                are blest to hold communion with the worlds above. The wires of spirit telegraphy of
                                which our beloved Elder Giles spoke when at Canterbury last, are neither laid low by
                                winter's fiercest blasts nor the wily attacks of any enemy. Our faith and trust in God's
                                work is unshaken as are the granite rocks of New Hampshire to-day. Yea, we mean to be
                                granite rock Christians. Thus, humbly remembering God's goodness, we fearlessly enter
                                upon blustering March, as we sing� "I'll brave the storm and breast the wave, The way of

                                vineyard, I am puzzled to know just what to place upon paper, as so many subjects crowd
                                before the vision. If the power of expression came as freely, what beautiful thoughts
                                one might place before his readers. How true it is, that the "songs unsung" and the
                                "words unspoken" are the sweetest. No lack of material for thought but language often
                                fails to fulfill its intended mission, even when expressed in good faith. Suffice it to
                                say, in our home, every moment of every day has assigned to it, some duty, all of which
                                we may make "labors of love" if so disposed, and glad are we of this, for duty
                                faithfully and cheerfully performed, gives joy and present satisfaction. We do not envy
                                those who sigh for the weary, tedious day to pass, that night may come bringing its
                                round of gaieties, that make the young, old before their time. We have reason to believe
                                that this style of living is passing into ill repute, even among our sisters abroad, and
                                a more "sensible view of life's responsibilities as beings destined for Eternity, are
                                taking its place. Last year, one thousand corn-planters were manufactured here under
                                contract; this season only five hundred are wanted, which looks as if all had not heard
                                of this new device for corn-planting or had concluded to let the crows help themselves
                                while they I plant in the "good, old-fashioned way." ! The new invention covers securely
                                as soon as the corn is dropped. Our ice was harvested in January, and parties who came
                                from far and near last season to obtain this necessity have evidently procured it nearer

                                alone, for it is a blessing to have the influence of such a good, gospel Brother among
                                us. Two hundred and seventeen bushels of potatoes have recently been freighted to Mass,

                                    eight years that God in his mercy would send a man to point out the way of truth to
                                    me. And as I was one day full of anxious desire, there came a voice from God saying
                                    Go to the porch of the church and thou shalt find a man who can show thoe the way of
                                    truth. And I went and found a man there who was dusty and foot-sore and clothed in
                                    rags. I saluted him and said, uGod give thee a good diiy." The beggar replied, "I
                                    verily never had a bad day." Whereupon I said, "May God give tbee good fortune." He
                                    answered "I never had bad fortune." Then I said "Mayest thou be happy." To which the
                                    beggar replied, "I am never unhappy." Thereupon I concluded, "Ma}7 God bless thee,
                                    instruct me in this, for I do not understand." He replied, "willingly; thou sayest,
                                    may God give me a good day. I replied, I verily never had a bad day. For when I
                                    hunger, I praise God, when I am cold, when it hails, snows or rains, be the weather
                                    fair or foul I praise God. Am I wretched or despised, I praise God. Therefore I
                                    never have a bad day. Thou saye.st, may God give me good fortune, and J tell thee I
                                    never have bad fortune, for I know to live with God, and know whatsoever He does is
                                    for the best, and what God gives unto me, or has destined for me, be it weal or woe,
                                    bitter or sweet, I accept joyfully from God as the very best thing, therefore I
                                    never have bad fortune. Thou sayest also God make me<pb n="67" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> happy, and
                                    I tell thee I am never unhappy, for I desire only to be united with God's will, and
                                    I have thus wholly reconciled my own will for God's will, that whatsoever God wills
                                    I will, therefore I am never unhappy, for I desire only to be at one with God's
                                    will, and I have utterly surrendered my will to his will." Whereupon I demanded of
                                    the man, should God cast thee into hell what wouldst thou say then! He replied,
                                    "cast me into hell? If he were to cast me into hell I have two arms to clasp Him.
                                    One arm is true humility, that I place beneath Him and therewith I am united with
                                    his holy humanity, and with the right arm of love thereby I am united with his holy
                                    divinity and embrace Him that He needs must go with me into hell. Therefore I would
                                    rather be in hell having God than I would be in heaven without God." "Thereupon I
                                    understood" says Eckhard, "that true tranquility with true humility, is the direct
                                    way to God." I demanded further of the man "Whence art thou?" He answered, "from God
                                    ;" I questioned, "Where hast thou found God?" He replied, "as I left all creatures."
                                    I asked, "Where hast thou left God?" "In the pure heart and in the good-willed man."
                                    Again I questioned, "What art thou?" He said, "I am a king." "Where is thy kingdom
                                    ?" "That is in my soul, for I can thus control my internal and external senses, that
                                    all my desires and soul forces fully obey me. And this realm is far greater than any
                                    kingdom on earth." I asked, "Then what has brought thee to such perfection ?" and he
                                    replied, "It was done by my silence, my exalted thoughts and my union with God. For
                                    I could no more rest in anything that was less than God. Now I have found God, and

I, Jan. 22, 1891, RUFUS CROSMAN, aged 92 years. Rufus Crosmax was one of a
                            family "to be wondered at." The father and mother were Vermont farmers, in good
                            circumstances, and having six children; and all became Shakers, in 1825. One sister, Betsy,
                            is still living, aged 86. Though they were not a literary family, they were strictly honest;
                            and, as "an honest man or woman is the noblest work of God," the Crosmans, in this sense,
                            were a noble family. They were consecrated, loyal members of the Shaker Order. As one of
                            many who inherit their life-long labors, in land, houses, and conveniences of various kinds,
                            I am their debtor. When the family united, they paid their debts, righted their wrongs,
                            confesed their personal sins, in the light they had received, and became Christians
                            according to the pattern shown on the mount of transfiguration�Mount Lebanon. Their industry
                            was proverbial; their economy�"gathering up the fragments, that nothing be lost"� I have
                            never seen exceeded. In simplicity of manners, and in dress and address, they were examples
                            to the whole Shaker Order. It was such a manner of people that laid the foundation, in
                            temporal things, of all the Shaker Villages : and a similar class of men and women were the
                            granite f oun-<pb n="68" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> dations of Albany, Pittsfield, and many New England
                            towns and cities. Some of them yet remain, and all citizens are blessed by inheriting the
                            fruit of their labors, and being influenced by them as ministering spirits : thus, being
                            dead, they yet speak to the living, by word as well as work. "Mark the perfect man, and
                            behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace." In his last days, Rufushad no disease
                            or sickness, and was quiet as a child. When he was about to fall asleep, his attendant heard
                            him whisper, "Now, Lord, lettestthou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen
                            thy salvation."</p><byline TEIform="byline"><index level1="Evans, F. W." TEIform="index"/> F. W.

                            things are highly mystical, allegorical, prophetic. They arc difficult to harmonize ; the
                            interpretations are about as numerous as the interpreters. But we may take it for granted
                            that there is not much diversity of opinion regarding the nature of the millennium. The
                            general consensus is that it will be a time of peace and plenty, of virtue and good
                            fellowship. As one of the signs heralding the good time coming, I view the fact that leading
                            Catholics and Protestants, infidels and believers can present their thoughts about theology
                            and religion, morals and ethics, in The Sun without acrimony and bitterness. Such a thing
                            was not known heretofore ; nothing was so sure to arouse evil passions as doctrinal
                            controversy. The writer being a member of the Church of Christ's Second Appearing, commonly
                            called Shakers, has no difficulty in interpreting to his satisfaction the manner and time ot
                            the advent. What is known as orthodox Christianity regards Jesus as being an integral part
                            of the Deity, God himself. We regard that proposition as unscriptural. By nature, Jesus was
                            a human being, who "was tempted in all points like as we are," but his sinless life and
                            obedience to the Divine will made him the Son of God ; and his special mission was "to give
                            power to them that believed on him to become sons of God" likewise. The Gospel which he
                            preached was given to him by inspira-<pb n="69" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> tion ; this constituted him the
                            Christ. There is a difference between the man Jesus and Christ the Messiah. Jesus was not
                            Christ from his birth, though undoubtedly his conception and prenatal existence was
                            powerfully influenced to make him such in the future ; he became the Christ at the baptism
                            of Jordan. It was the inspiring spirit that caused him to say; "Before Abraham was I am ;"
                            it was- the trembling Jesus who begged that the bitter cup might be removed. Peter says that
                            the spirit of Christ spoke through the prophets, and Jesus himself taught that the spirit of
                            Elias appeared in John the Baptist. This proves that the same spirit can speak and act
                            through different persons at different times. There was a paragraph in n New York paper some
                            time ago alleging that when Roscoe Conkling was upon his death-bed and when Christianity was
                            mentioned to him, he spoke rather slightingly of it, saying that Christ had obtained his
                            doctrines from the Buddhists of India ; that the Golden Rule and others of his teachings
                            were found in Buddha's works, &amp;c. Now, instead of being a disparagement, this is a
                            glorious proof of the genuineness of Christ's mission and of the pre-existence of the Christ
                            spirit, who at all ages of the world has endeavored to manifest himself for its redemption.
                            Divine truth is the same always, whether it comes through Buddha or Jesus, but the fullest
                            and clearest enunciation of it, as far as we know, has come through Jesus. The coming of
                            Christ does not necessarily imply the appearance of Jesus. The apostles had been with Jesus
                            a long time before they discovered him to be Christ. It requires a state of inward
                            preparation, a readiness to receive him before he can be discovered, but "to them who look
                            for him he shall appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation." Ann Lee, an English
                            Quakeress, came to this country in 1774, accompanied by a little band of believers; they
                            settled in the forest near Albany and remained there eight years. She. taught that the
                            higher form of Christianity consisted in following the example of Jesus. This logically
                            resulted in the formation of a community whose members were celibates and owned no private
                            property. The way of salvation, according to her, consisted in the confession, repentance
                            and forsaking of sin ; the blood of Jesus could not accomplish that for anyone. She saw that
                            comparatively few had the opportunity in this life of hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
                            therefore she held that nil souls would have it preached to them in the next life. She
                            utterly rejected the idea of an endless hell of torment with no chance nor hope of delivery
                            therefrom ; she considered it blasphemy against an allmerciful God to teach fore-ordination
                            to damnation. Hands to work and hearts to God was her motto. It was her aim to produce in
                            her followers, by her teaching and example, lives of virtue and simplicity, of industry and
                            unselfishness. One sign of the appearance of the Christ spirit is that the message is
                            delivered with a power that causes it to be accepted by a number sufficient for<pb n="70" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> its preservation and perpetuation. This sign must unhesitatingly be conceded
                            to Ann Lee, for in a few years' time�she died in 1784�she converted several thousand people
                            to her views, who, soon after her death, gathered themselves in permanent communities,
                            which, with one exception, are all in operation to-day. These converts were not an easily
                            impressed multitude: they were hard-headed New England folk, whose orthodoxy was
                            unquestioned, whose daily text-book was the Bible, who loved their wives and children, their
                            hard-earned dollars and acres as dearly as any people in the world. It must have been an
                            extraordinary person that could persuade such a class of minds to surrender their
                            time-honored opinions; to give up their property, yea, even largely their wills and
                            individualities ; to separate from wife and husband and the ties of the world and become
                            Christian Communists. Another evidence in behalf of Ann Lee's mission is that the opinions
                            of an unlettered woman like her have overthrown the doctrines of such learned men as Luther,
                            Calvin and Edwards ; for hell and fore-ordination are practically no longer taught in the
                            Protestant churches, the idea of probation is steadily gaining ground, and the formation of
                            celibate orders is being encouraged. Tolstoi, whatever his faults and mistakes, is preaching
                            virtually Shakerism. If it is asked why, then, is the population of Shaker Communities
                            steadily decreasing, we answer that this is not chargeable to any of Ann Lee's precepts, but
                            is almost entirely owing to internal short-comings. The time is not far distant when her
                            people will gather themselves together, reform, re-organize, and pledge themselves anew to
                            carry out the Gospel of Jesus Christ and become again an agressive power for good in the
                            world.
