                            and near, With prayerful heart that such draw nigh To share the good, to me so dear. A
                            peaceful home, a quiet mind, An interest shared in common lot, Such as the Spirit hath
                            combined, And such the selfish world hath not. It is a Christian noble plan Wrought out by
                            Christ in very deed, Possessing all, but not a man Can claim beyond his real need. When
                            shall we love our brother right? When Christian faith by works is shown, Then shall the day
                            dispel the night, And God to each in truth be known. Canterbury, N.

                            this- - that a man lay down his life for his friend."- -John, xv: 13.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Kaime, Joanna J." TEIform="persName"/>JOANNA J. KAIME.</byline><p TEIform="p">We often find occasion to commend the moral heroism of that unselfish man or woman who
                            manifests by words or deeds an unswerving fidelity to convictions of truth in the service of
                            friends even though the ban of public criticism might rest lieavily upon such for a time. We
                            could enumerate many of this noble class, who " made a little lower than the angels"- -and
                            bearing the impress of the "Divine likeness" have quite removed the stigma of total
                            depravity from the escutcheon of the human family by their noble sacrifices. For hath not
                            God made of one blood all the nations of men ?- -But we sometimes think how much superior
                            that heroism manifested<pb n="122" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>by the man or woman who can so far forget self
                            interests as to speak an unwelcome truth to the same loved and valued friends in a strictly
                            conscientious manner, regardless alike of praise or censure. Can there be in this imperfect
                            world of ours a surer test of friendship ? They only who have felt the intensity of a love
                            which enables them to lay down their own lives in anxious solicitude for the spiritual
                            welfare of others, can know the strength of the trial. A soul thus disciplined and chastened
                            rises superior to the thought of self and trusting the " Divine Guidance " drinks from the
                            exhaustless fountain of truth. How beautifully exemplified was the spirit of self-abnegation
                            in the lives of our gospel parents ! or in other words, the early founders of the Shaker
                            Societies and how precious the memory of even the most trifling incidents connected with
                            their wise and loving ministrations ! How unlike the egotism, the thirst for fame, or the
                            love of selfish gain which characterizes modern- -Christianity ( ?) Pioneers were they in a
                            nobler cause than any earthly warrior can boast, for their mission was to wield the sword of
                            spiritual truth against the foe within. They fought to subdue unhallowed appetites and
                            inclinations whether inherited or acquired, and by strict adherence to the Christ life, were
                            made partakers of his resurrection and became Saviors to other souls blest with alike
                            conviction for sin and finally established on a broad and enduring basis, a Community of
                            Interest in its sublimest sense. An interest which embraced the future as we'll as present
                            happiness of souls. This devotion is deemed by their filial posterity as a royal legacy
                            wrought out through sacrifice, and soul consecration . Canterbury, N. H. </p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shaker's look into the future" TEIform="index"/> A SHAKER'S LOOK INTO THE FUTURE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F.

                            Roman Empire than the second appearing of the same Christ Spirit will effect in what we term
                            Christendom. As then, great leading master minds will inaugurate the change of dispensations
                            now impending. The old Heavens and Earth- -united Church and State- -are fast passing away-
                            -dissolving- -melting with fervent heat- -the fire of Spiritual Truth. Out of the material
                            of the old earthly civil governments, a civil government will arise, is even now arising, in
                            which right, not might, will predominate- -a New Earth. It will be purely secular, a genuine
                            Republic. Men and women will be citizens. All citizens will be freeholders. They will
                            inherit and possess the land by right of birth. War will cease with the end of the old
                            Monarchial theological earth, wherein the King could do no wrong, he ruled by the divine
                            right of Kings. The meek will inherit the earth, and the nations neither learn nor practice
                            war any more. Each man and woman will literally sit under their own vine and fig tree, and
                            none to make them afraid, as violsnce and destruction shall no more be heard or felt in the
                            land. Neither shall any one say, I am sick. The Lord their God shall, by revelation and true
                            science, take all sickness away from the midst of tfce people, who shall walk in the light
                            of the wisdom of the Most High. No doctors, drugs or poisons. The same power, exercised in
                            the first Christian Dispensation, of healing all manner of<pb n="123" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>diseases, and
                            saying, Go and sin no more, physiologically, will be again revealed from the Spirit Spheres,
                            and the same light and power that heals will be amply competent to stamp out all maladies

                            eating for strength, not gluttony ; drinking for thirst, not drunkenness. And property,
                            being the product of honest toil, as those who will not work will not be allowed to eat,
                            will be for the good of all, the young and the old. There will be no more sorrow nor crying,
                            no more pain, no more death, for the people will neither hurt nor harm any sentient being.

                            they believe, and why they do or do not, under every command and requirement. The meek, whom

                            consequently the Spiritual Resurrection Order of New Heavens will be cherished by the civil

                            Christian world, is one which will hardly bear the light of the nineteenth century. As its
                            rays are brought to bear upon it, it shrivels and shrinks away and leaves the soul that has
                            trusted in it without any foundation for their 'faith. The belief that by the shedding of
                            the blood of Jesus, by the cruel death of the cross, and that by our believing in the same
                            we shall be washed from every stain of sin, is a doctrine, from which an unbiased,
                            unprejudiced, untraditionated, mind, would recoil with horror, as unjust and irrational in
                            the extreme ; but it is a belief very soothing and quieting to the carnal nature, this
                            resting upon the merits of another for salvation, and feeling that we have nothing to do
                            only believe ; but, before the light aud brightness of the true teachings of Jesus Christ,
                            this doctrine will be consumed with all other chaff and dross. Some of us who have been
                            educated in, and been covenant members of the Churches where this is considered as the great
                            fundamental point in their religion, have been very tenacious of this tenet, and have said
                            in our hearts, if not with our lips, that nothing should ever shake our faith; but when the
                            light of the true gospel shone in our hearts, we found that we could not trust to the merits
                            of another, but must work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Justification by
                            faith, which was first preached by Martin Luther and in obedience to which he felt justified
                            in breaking his vows of chastity and purity, and has given free license to his followers
                            ever since to live in the indulgence of their animal natures, is a doctrine which has had
                            numerous followers, who have spread their belief, in some cases at the point of the bayonet.
                            Can this be the religion of the meek and lowly Savior which breathes forth only peace and
                            good will to man, and admits of no wars or fighting, or even unkind feelings towards
                            another? The faith in which we trust, is one which works by love, purifying the heart and
                            overcoming the world. A faith that <pb n="125" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>will cause us to confess and forsake
                            our sins, right all our wrongs, and by a life of self-denial and the cross, travel out from
                            a fallen nature, and find a new and spiritual life. This faith is the gift of God, and
                            without it we cannot please Him, or know in what manner to walk to his acceptance ; but in
                            it we can find our union and relation to God and all holy beings, and feel his love flow
                            into our souls, causing us often to utter our thanksgiving and praise to Him for having
                            called us from the world, and its fleeting and transitory pleasures, into the new and living
                            way, where faith and Avorks agree. " Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
                            God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. " Canterbury, N.

                            acknowledge fealty or gratitude, or penitential, to make atonement for disobeying a law or
                            command. Voluntary obedience is submission to law, and submission to law is the foundation
                            of order, and order is tbe foundation of harmony, which is an essential element of happiness
                            and heaven. If these affirmations are true, and we think they will commend themselves to
                            genuine truth seekers, it follows that all lasting happiness and prosperity, rest primarily
                            upon obedience to those laws which lay at the basis of order and harmony. The poet has said
                            very appropriately, that " All angels form a chain, That in God's burning throne begins, and
                            winds Down to the lowest plane of earthly minds. " As much as to say that all rational
                            intelligences, proceeding more or less directly from one great primal source, are
                            interrelated and interdependent. It is a law of creation that the sustaining elements of
                            life, light, and happiness, invariably flow from above downward, or from superior to
                            inferior, which makes it imperative that the inferior submit to and be guided by the
                            superior, else there arises clash, inharmony, and interruption to the free course ot life
                            elements. For even as planets obey the attractive power of the Sun, from whence they receive
                            heat, light, and magnetism, so in a Divine order of society some are ordained to lead and to
                            teach, and all to obey a central leading authority, which should have power to attract or
                            draw through love, and to dispense the gifts of the spirit to every member properly
                            belonging to that society. The law and commandment of God, or of His messengers, is light,
                            and disobedience to light shuts out light, and severs interior connection with the order<pb n="127" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>or circle to which the transgressor belongs. In this consists the fall
                            of man. Each one falls by his own disobedience, more or less according to the magnitude of
                            transgression, and can be restored only by confession and repentance, which includes return
                            to obedience. As constant obedience maintains this interior union unbroken, and is the most
                            beautiful and perfect demonstration of feality that can be given, it is evident that to
                            obey, is better than sacrifice that is designed to mend so far as it can, the effects of
                            disobedience ; as evident I say as that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
                            Carlyle says "There is no act more moral between men than that of rule and obedience. Woe !
                            unto him that claims obedience when it is not due. Woe ! unto him that refuses it when it is
                            due." And we believe this is truth. That an influence for good may accompany a command, is
                            manifest in the case of the ten lepers who besought Jesus to heal them. He told them to go
                            and show themselves to the Priest. Going, they were cleansed. Obedience secured to them the
                            blessing. Brother Daniel Mosely, commenting in meeting upon the healing of Naaman the
                            Syrian, by the prophet Elisha, said, after relating the circumstances, " It was neither this
                            nor that, but obedience to the good word of God, then and there made known. In the two cases
                            here referred to, it seems unlikely that any amount of subsequent sacrifice could have
                            recovered the gifts that would have been rejected by refusing to obey. And hence that both
                            illustrate and confirm our text- - - - - - To obey is better than sacrifice." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            influence any one, and we act on a contrary principle of love and kindness, we shall gain
                            the victory on righteous principles and reclaim them. And in like manner with all other
                            evils, pride must be overcome with humility, boisteroiss- - ness by mildness, envy and
                            emulation by preferring others to ourselves. So by acting contrary to these evil feelings
                            and passions in ourselves and others, we gain a victory over them. 2. I have seen with
                            certainty the light of God shine so that I could see clearly my duty without doubt, which
                            brought a conviction that my past conduct was short of God's requirement. And that I had to
                            repent, confess and forsake some things pertaining to it, and to mortify and crucify the
                            nature and disposition that prompted me to do it. I have felt the love of God so powerful in
                            my soul that I could love my enemies and do good to those who spitefully use me, and my love
                            to my Brethren and Sisters seemed unbounded. I have felt and still continue to feel power to
                            forgive tresspasses. 3. I believe that Jesus was in every respect like his brethren, being
                            by generation neither superior, nor inferior. That he did partake of the light and baptism
                            of John, which was attended with baptism of confession and repentance and fulfilling all
                            righteousness by<pb n="128" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>rectifying that which was wrong. That he did by this
                            conformity to the light and gift of God, manifested in John, receive a revelation, and the
                            heavens were opened and the Spirit of God descended upon him. By prayer and tribulation he
                            was enabled to keep his soul from evil he took up his cross against all that was selfish,
                            carnal and placed his affections upon the gift of God which proved a consuming fire to the
                            old man. Thus he became a new creature regenerated to God a perfect example for all souls to
                            follow. 4. From the testimony of the followers of Christ and Mother, I was forced to believe
                            in the Gospel of Christ's second appearing which has proved the power of God unto salvation
                            to me, nothing lacking, inasmuch as I have obeyed it. The word was to me that I was living a
                            life that was not well pleasing to God, and that I had to forsake it; that I must take up my
                            cross against the lusts of the flash, the lust of the eye and the pride of life, and that I
                            must square v\y life by the pure way they laid out. I believed that they had light and power
                            to direct, love and charity sufficient to forgive sin, not in an arbitrary manner, but by
                            the indwelling of the Spirit of God. They taught me that I had to confess my sins to those
                            who were appointed to hear me. So I took hold of the gift of God with an honest heart, and
                            confessed all my sins as far as I had an understanding of what was sinful. I have continued
                            to do so as far as my light and understanding has increased. So by repentance and confession
                            with a determination to forsake, I have gained a victory over sir: that I know I could have
                            obtained in no other way. i). The Gospel requires me to go forth in the worship of God with
                            clean hands and a pure heart, with humility of soul, divesting myself of all pride or
                            bondage, in faith relying on God for a blessing. Thus prepared, I have never failed to
                            receive the goodness and blessing of God to the satisfaction of my soul. I believe that all
                            souls who are thus engaged, without ostentation, will receive that gift that they most need.
                            - - G. I believe it is my duty to be cheerful even while under trials, and govern my
                            feelings and actions in such a way, that I shall give no offense to my Brethren and Sisters,
                            and in no case be offended, although I shall be injured or treated with contempt, but be
                            pleasant and respectful under all circumstances. 7. I believe it is the requirement of God
                            for me to shake myself from all that is carnal, proud, selfish and wicked ; and devote
                            myself wholly to God without reserve, to keep the love of God at all times in my actions and
                            reverence him wherever he is manifested. I feel thankful to God for the Gospel of salvation.
                            I feel thankful to Jesus Christ for opening the way of life, although opposed on all sides ;
                            by his own mind, and hated by the world who hated the crucifying cross. I feel thankful to
                            Mother Ann Lee for opening the way of life. Withstanding hatred, malice, ridicule and
                            contempt, persecution and death, and could through it all breathe the spirit of good will,
                            kindness, charity and forgiveness. In this way Jesus, the first appearing of Christ, bore
                            the sins of the world, and set an example to follow through every trial. I believe that
                            after a few hundred years there was a falling away, and that<pb n="129" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>the true
                            spirit of Christ was not among mankind. Therefore it was necessary that another should
                            attain light and power to burst the bauds of death. That Mother, ihe hated and contemned of
                            the whole world, is equally entitled to our love and thanks, as Jesus was in his Evangel.
                            Thus aud thus only did they bare the sins of the sinful.

This beautiful precept, if universally acted xipon, would
                            eventually turn this earth into a Paradise. In analyzing the text, we observe that it
                            requires as a principle of practice, the grand, universal, Law of Love. "By this shall all
                            men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one for another.'" The gospel as taught by
                            Jesus Christ and manifested in his life was a gospel replete with love and tender
                            compassion. Where is the individual not bearing the signet of discipleship that could raise
                            to Heaven a prayer so full of sweet submission and holy trust as did our Savior when he said
                            "Father forgive them for they know not w hat they do. " O that we could become disciples of
                            Christ in very word and deed ! Remembering at all times it is the heart service that is
                            acceptable to God. How satisfactory was the simple offering of the poor widow because given
                            in sincerity. It is the loveliness of Love to render even difficult things easy, and the
                            bitter things of life sweet. - - Then let us actualize the text " By love serve one another"

                            What a store of richness there is in the apple, rich in itself, in its varieties, and in
                            its- times of ripening. It continues to bless us till the strawberry comes again, the herald
                            of an annual new creation. We are so kindly treated, so abundantly supplied that there is
                            scarcely room for gratitude. Let us make up the deficiency, by imitating the beneficence of
                            Creative Goodness, by being liberal to those who need our aid. Why accumulate when we can
                            grow rich by giving? Are not the needy the treasury of the Loi'd ? Those who invest therein
                            will save themselves many sorrows and dishonors, and open certain doors which are as yet
                            hardly ajar. Let us now cross the wide prairie, a flowery, grassy bed extending to the
                            horizon. Every plant in its place, beautifully distinct, expressions of order, art, harmony,
                            the poetry of creation. Still richer fields and grander creative results await our search.
                            The lowly grasses, presided over by the stately Maize, are before us. A certain astronomer,
                            looking at the starry heavens, thinking of the mighty mechanical and chemical forces in
                            action there, exclaimed, "When<pb n="130" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>I look at these, and think of the
                            conscious responsibility of man, I am struck with awe." When I think of the grains of the
                            grasses, elaborated from the dust of the earth, and think of their adaptation to the
                            sustenance of the complex functions of animal life ; that the hairs on our head, and the
                            nerves of the brain, which vibrate with human thought have their needs ; these, and the hard
                            bones and elastic muscles are all provided for in the grains of the grasses. "All flesh is
                            grass" truly! When I look into this I am filled with amazement ; I clothe my spirit with
                            reverence, and breathe forth my feelings in the eloquence of silence. Animal forms are built
                            up more astonishingly than plants. The latter live and grow by decomposing inorganic matter.
                            The former, by assimilating organic compounds. An animal is a vital chemical laboratory, a
                            self-repairing locomotive ! It is more, it manifests mind. And beneath its wondrously woven
                            skin, are found contrivances and adaptations of the highest order. Pneumatic, hydraulic,
                            optical, and other processes find expression. These are presided over by living chemical
                            energy, ever vigilant not only to control inorganic action, but also to build up all the
                            living tissues, and to carry forth from within the vital organism effete matter ; and to
                            wash away the alkaline salts liberated by the decomposition and assimilation of nutritive
                            compounds. Yea to meet the demands of living animal chemistry, the grains and the grasses
                            are adapted. Every grain of wheat is a little storehouse within which all the elements
                            needful to sustain the human body are found ! In the '' Boston Journal of Chemistry," the
                            editor exclaims. "Wheat is a wonderful cereal; ia its composition the evidence of design is
                            $0 apparent, that one must be stupid indeed not to discover it. Every function of our body
                            can be sustained by the wheat berry. The facts brought to view in the study of a grain of
                            wheat, cannot be set aside as a chance combination. " Even the chemical constitution of the
                            cuticle of the wheat berry is worthy of consideration. Bran is very retentive of moisture,
                            and in dry seasons protects the seed-wheat from being dried up; and when the whole grain is
                            used as food, being retentive of moisture and demulcent, it is a safe-guard against
                            obstruction of the bowels. Hygienic Law, has its foundations in the fitness of created
                            things. The vegetable world is the counterpart of the animal world; they are a duality. The
                            former has been hastily surveyed. The latter now claims our notice. Observe that floating
                            gelatinous disk ; it is almost expressionless ; it is a Radiate. Further up is the Mollusk ;
                            in this order is the oyster and the clam. Each has its habitation and opens and shuts its
                            doors at will. Higher still, is the order of the Articulates. The world teems with
                            interesting beings ; the Bee aud the Ant are there. Teachers of construction, of government,
                            of social economy, of industry, of colonization, of community of goods, and of devotion to
                            the public welfare. The most important human problems are solved by these little creatures.
                            Are not the cattle on a thousand hills also teachers of right living- -of Hygienic Law? As
                            we enter the order of vertebrates, we see, that from the tiny fish of the mountain streamlet
                            to the whales of the ocean, from the humming bird to the<pb n="131" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>eagle, ft om
                            the unobtrusive mole to the stately elephant, and on to man ; Creative Wisdom has stamped
                            all living organisms with an individuality all their own. Man alone assumes to be a per
                            sonality. His body is as essentially animal as the beasts of the field, hence his body is
                            not the personality. Animals are led by their sensations and to a degree think. But a series
                            of thoughts as are involved in a friction match, expressive of a plurality of ideas they are
                            incapable of. They have no history, and their thoughts from age to age remain within the
                            narrow boundaries oi their first progenitors. Man thinks, and the more he does so and gives
                            form to his thoughts, the more he is able to think, and to combine and to materialize his
                            thoughts. With man, his limits of thought widens as he thinks, and his power to materialize
                            them seems only to be limited by his earthly condition. The indications are that man's
                            career on earth is but a small beginning of his future destiny. The steam engine is
                            materialized human thought. It possesses more power a thousand fold, than the animal, who is
                            said to be the person who created it. Hence the personality of man, is manifested
                            essentially in him being a creator, in his ability to control elemental forces, to
                            manipulate them into form and order, causing them to do his will. Thought as manifested by
                            the Creator, is of the same kind as is manifested by man in his creations. To deny the
                            personality of the one, is to deny the personality of the other. That of man, is as
                            invisible as is the personality of his Creator. The former cannot grasp thought, will, and
                            affection in his hand, and say there I am ! Man cannot prove the existence of his
                            personality of his power to think, to control, and to make combinations as aforesaid, but by
                            materializing his thoughts. Neither can we know of the personality of God, nor of his
                            attributes, but by His materializations. "The invisible things of God, even His Godhead, are
                            clearly seen and known, by the things, that are made." Love Beneficence and Goodness are
                            over all the works of creation. Herein is the Fatherhood and Motherhood of God. Only those
                            who are loving and beneficent, are their offspring ; whose labors of mind, of body, and
                            spirit, are manifestations of these attributes. Only such can address "Our Father who art in
                            heaven. " To imitate the beneficence of the Father, and the affection of the Mother, is to
                            worship God. To deny the invisible personality of man, having his materializations before
                            us, would be insanity. To deny the personality of God, having His many materializations
                            before us, cannot be less so. Mau's are, indeed, but as the fine dust of the balance ; no
                            matter about that; both are the creations of thought. Enter a negation here, and everything
                            above, below, and beyond us, is blank absurdity, and all deductive and inductive results are
                            abortions ; and arbitrary conclusions become as valid as the fittest losic. Without the
                            personality of a beneficent Creator before us, have we any polar star as a guide ? Any
                            standard of perfection to appeal to ? Any Foundation for morals, or for law ? Any test
                            whereby human actions can be verified? Without the Divine Personality, luman force is Law ;
                            and popular clamor God. The argument is now closed. I have lovingly written a long letter;
                            allow me to invite all to retire from con-<pb n="132" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>troversial emotions, and
                            from all feelings of "Who shall be the greatest," and enter the temples of our being, with

                            due respect and veneration toward both equals and superiors, we know it always wins the love
                            and admiration of all to whom it is<pb n="133" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>shown. We may call it "good
                            manners," "politeness," or "veneration," it matters not what, but we know that whoever would
                            establish the habit of practising it uniformly and impartially to all, must first gain
                            simple goodness of heart,- -true Christian love. When this divine principle once gets
                            possession of the heart, how all-pervading is its influence ! Tlie words, the voice, the
                            actions, the gestures, and the very countenance, are all brought under its refining power,
                            and show forth the genuine source from whence they spring. If any soul is so desolate and
                            unfortunate as to have no one to love,- -if the pure principle of disinterested benevolence
                            has never moved the heart nor shed its vitalizing influence on the spirit- -to such a one I
                            should be at a loss what to say or how to advise. Such a condition is out of the range of my
                            experience, and it seems to me that one so unfortunate is incapable of understanding phrases
                            descriptive of the emotions of divine love. But to those who have truly experienced pure,
                            disinterested love, if for only one single individual, I can speak understandingly. If they
                            have so loved any one as to take real pleasure and satisfaction in doing such an one a
                            kindness, then they can understand my meauiug perfectly. That same principle of love,
                            extended to any other human being, would give them the same pleasure, with a corresponding
                            increase, till it widens the circle of their love and kindness and happiness
                            indescriminately to all within their reach. But as we were talking of good manners, or
                            politeness, we must make this application of love to that subject in particular. If we
                            really posses? this pure Christian benevolence of heart,- -a sincere wish to please, make
                            happy and bless,- -we shall need no dancing-master to show us how to make pleasing motions
                            or gestures-no Chesterfieldian monitor to teach us to bow and scrape and smile and put on
                            pleasing airs. This kind, humane feeling within us, is far better than a dozen outside
                            teachers. The art of pleasing is taught by the desire to please, and that desire springs
                            from love. Let us examine, and we shall find it impossible to behave rudely to those we love
                            and desire to treat respectfully and kindly. To illustrate this, and make it a little more
                            practical, I will relate a circumstance that occurred not long since. The writer having
                            recently moved into a new home, went out to a pump that stood in the yard to get a pitcher
                            of water, the weather being very warm. I saw coming from an opposite direction a youth, who
                            reached the pump in good time to take ,i drink before I got there. As I came up he looked at
                            me with a most benevolent smile, and in a kind and polite manner and tone said, "You ought
                            to have some ice in your pitcher. " I auswered, "Yea, but I have not yet learned how to get
                            at the ice. " " Oh, " said he, "let me have the pitcher, and I'll get you some." And taking
                            the pitcher, off he ran, got the ice, and quickly returned, handing it over with a bright
                            countenance and polite manner. Now I observed that every motion, tone and gesture in this
                            little transaction, accorded with the best rules of politeness. They were neither learned,
                            studied or thought of by the youth, but flowed spontaneously from the inward feeling of
                            kindness. This may be considered a small affair, but in my esteem it was great, because it
                            flowed from a<pb n="134" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/>great principle. It was an act of disinterested
                            benevolence, in which the enactor never thought of any reward beyond the pleasure he felt in
                            performing it. In proof of this, it may not be amiss to state that I had not purchased his
                            kindness by any act of mine toward him : I was a stranger to him, and did not know his name.
                            I mu?t add here that our lives are, for the most part, made up of a succession of little
                            transactions, and it is the true work of a- benevolent heart to minister gladly to the
                            little wants and accommodations of every day. It is the habitual performance of these little
                            attentions that stamps the character of a more refined benevolence of mind, than that which
                            only occasionally performs some great deed of charity. The latter may flow from pride ; the
                            former must flow from goodness of heart, especially when impartially bestowed on all, as
                            cccasions offer. But I want to say, in regard to the above transaction, that my heart
                            dilated with love for that dear youth while he was performing that act with so much
                            cheerfulness ; and oh! how earnestly did I invoke the influence of the Holy Spirit of Love
                            to teach him to cultivate that kind spirit and manner by extending it to all impartially, at
                            all times, and on all occasions that should come within his reach ! All habits, whether good
                            or bad, have strong charms and great power over us ; and although we are strongly inclined
                            by nature to contract selfish, low, mean habits, yet I have discovered by a thorough
                            experience that good habits, when once established, have quite as powerful charms as bad
                            ones. Besides this, they have the infinite advantage of stamping our actions with the
                            consciousness of moral rectitude, and the sweet approval of our own conscience. I gratefully
                            remember the training of my childhood and youth, in respect to my behavior toward grown
                            people. My uncle who reared me constantly kept several men hired by the year, and he never
                            allowed me to address them by their given names, but respectfully to give them the title of
                            "Mister," and answer them by the respectful title of "Sir." Although these titles are not
                            necessary to true politeness, yet they become so when custom requires them ; and this was
                            only the starting point of respectful feelings and treatment of youth to grown people. I was
                            not allowed to contradict them, nor to treat them in any manner disrespectfully,- -was
                            required always to do any little kindness which they requested. By this I grew up to feel
                            the respect for grown people which my manners toward them indicated; and this treatment
                            toward them excited their love and kind feeling toward, me in turn. Harvard, Mass. (To be

                            proverb, "flees when he finds the door shut against him. " But woe to him who stops to
                            parley. He is sure to open the door, and let the devil in. The first thing to do, is, to
                            shut and bolt it with triple bolts ; or flee, like Lot, to the mountains- -anywhere- -to
                            escape his insidious wiles. Our Scandinavian forefathers have left us a significant legend
                            to convey their sense of the importance of this step. "There was once a giantess who had a
                            daughter, and the child saw a husbandman ploughing in the field.M<pb n="135" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> Then
                            she ran and picked him up with her finger and thumb, and put him and his plough and oxen
                            into her apron, and carried them to her mother, and said, "Mother, what sort of &amp;
                            beetle is this thst I found wriggling in the sand?" But the mother said, " Put it away, my
                            child; we must be gone otlt of this land ; for these people will dwell in it. They are the
                            race of men called Aryans, and they have come from a far distant land to make us all
                            prisoners. Let us make haste and escape, before they come and destroy us. Our only safety
                            consists in flight. " Unhappily, iiot matly heed the warning voice, and they find, to their
                            cost, that the Aryans are in the land, and they are bound hand and foot, and led in chains
                            which, once riveted, they find it impossible to break, and so remain slaves, all their days,
                            to the enemy. Happy are they who escape, and can sing from the top of the mountains, " I am
                            free!" 8. Aim to reach your highest ideal. In the old fables, we used to read of a cloak
                            brought from fairy land, as a gift for the fairest and purest in Prince Arthur's court. It
                            was to be her prize whom it would fit. Every one was eager to try it on; but it would fit
                            nobody. For one it was a world too wide. For the next, it dragged on the ground. For the
                            third it shrunk to a scarf. They, of course, said that the devil was in the mantle, for,
                            really, the truth was in the mantle, and was exposing the ugliness which each would feign
                            conceal. All drew back with terror from the garment. The innocent Genelas alone could wear
                            it. In like manner every man is provided, in his thought, with the measure of man to be
                            reached. Unhappily, not one in many thousands comes up to the stature and proportions of the
                            model. They are too long or too short, too wide or too narrow, for the ideal they have set
                            before them. We are like fabled Tantalus, dying with thirst with water near at hand which we
                            cannot reach. "There is no such critic and beggar as the terrible Soul. " And only the
                            earnest soul reaches after its highest ideal. Its watchword is "Excelsior! " 9. Watch your
                            moods. Some persons are like the weather-cock on the meeting house steeple, always ready to
                            tell which way the wind blows. Sometimes they are like A sweet, balmy morning in June, their
                            face all wreathed with smiles and sunshine; no rose of summer could be sweeter. Then, again,
                            they are like a cold, frosty morning in December, when the frost paints fairy pictures on
                            our windows, and hangs stalactites from the eaves of our dwellings. They are like the
                            porcupine in a fight; their quills stick out like needles in every direction, to prick every
                            one who approaches them. Thus they carry with them a double identity. There is a story told
                            of Philip of Mncedon to the point. A poor woman approached him, begging a favor of his royal
                            highness. He had been spending the night previous in a drunken carousal, and he turned away
                            from her with contempt and scorn. "Well," said she, turning herself to go, "I will appeal to
                            the king. " " And am not I the king? " he gruffly asked. " There are two kings," she
                            replied, "Philip drunk, and Philip sober, I will appeal to Philip sober. " She afterwards
                            made her appeal to Philip sober, and her request was granted. 10. Be temperate. Volumes have
                            been written in the praise of temperance. There has not been one word too much A temperate
                            man is the only true and self-possessed man. The glutton and inebriate are always cowards,
                            ready to slink away at their own shadow. " Infirm of purpose " is written, in deep
                            characters, all over the face of the intemperate and self-indulgent man. It is said that
                            Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo, owing to eating too heartily of an indigestible
                            dinner. He who had conquered nearly all Europe, was himself conquered by a dinner. And
                            thousands have equal cause of complaint. Their brains have been made muddy, and their
                            purpose infirm from their self-indulgence. By fast eating, and fast drinking, and fast
                            driving, a man drives himself to ruin. " Self-indulgence is the devil's hack." says the
                            wi&gt; e old proverb. He holds the reins, and fills the panniers with imps, and drives
                            the passengers the steepest road to perdition. Cornaro, the Italian, with a feeble
                            constitution, lived to a great age, owing to his temperate habits. When past ninety he
                                said,<pb n="136" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/>"I mount my horse without assistance; I climb steep hills,
                            and I have lately written a play abounding in innocent wit and humor. When I return from a
                            private company, or the senate, I find eleven grandchildren, whose education, amusement, and
                            songs, are the delight of my old age. I often sing with them, for my voice is now clearer
                            and stronger than it ever was in my youth; and I am a stranger to those peevish and morose
                            humors which fall, so often, to the lot of old age. " Sir Isaac Newton composed his great"
                            est work when he was eighty five years Of age, and was bright and cheerful as the sun to the
                            end of his long life. He said, "Temperance has done it all. " Sir Matthew Hale said, " I
                            always rise from my table with an appetite; and, for this reason, my appetite is always
                            good. " Franklin saidi '* I adopted, early in life, a vegetarian diet' and thus L made
                            greater progress, from tha. clearness of head, and quickness of appre hension which
                            generally attend temperance in eating and drinking. The best physicians, " he said, " are
                            Dr. Diet, Dr. Quiet^ and Dr. Merryrnan. " And a famous Trench physician, when dying, with
                            his pupils weeping around him, said, "Do not weep. There are still left in Fiance three
                            greater physicians than the one you now lose They are Dr. Air, Dr. Exercise, and Dr.
                            Temperance. " 11. Write it on your heart, that the present day is the best day in the year.
                            One of the illusions is, that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour. Believe
                            it not. Today does not speak for itself; tomorrow shall hear what it has to say. "God comes
                            to us without bugle or bell, " said the wise ancient, whose speech was gold. 'Tis the old
                            secret of the gods, that they come when least expected, and in low disguises. 'Tis the
                            vulgar great who come bedizened with gold and jewels. Real kings are never known; they hide
                            away their crowns in their wardrobes, and effect a plain and poor exterior. In the Norse
                            legend of our ancestors, Odin dwells in a fisher's hut, and patches a boat. In the Hindoo
                            legend, Hari dwells, a peasant among peasants. In the Greek legend, Apollo lodges with the
                            shepherds of Admetus; and Jove likes to rusticate with the Ethiopians. So, in our own
                            history, Je.-us was born in a barn, and his twelve peers were fisherman. 'Tis the very
                            principle in science that Nature shows herself best in leasts. So it is the rule of our
                            poets, in the legends of fairy lore, that the fairies, largest in power, were the least in
                            size. In the Christian graces, humility stands highest of all, in the form of the Madonna;
                            and in lite, this is the secret of the wise. The highest heaven of wisdom is alike near from
                            every point; and we must find it by watching the employment which the present hour brings
                            us. The use of all history and experience is to give importance to the present hour and its
                            duty. It exalts all beings of the present hour- -all men and women. They think more nobly of
                            themselves. "I knew a man in a certain religious exaltation, " said Emerson, " who thought
                            it an honor to wash his own face. He seemed to me more sane than those who hold themselves
                            cheap. " * Man}7 complain of their want of time. A poor Indian, of the Six Nations, of New
                            York, made a wiser reply than any philosopher, to some one con-plaining that he had not time
                            enough " Well, " said Red Jacket; " I suppose you have all there is " 12. Do not fret.
                            Nearly every one of vis can think of some tiling that he can easily fret over; and fret he
                            will, unless we call, in the aid of our resolution and our religion, to help us not to
                            repine at what comes to us in the order of God's providence. Fear sits in the window, and
                            howls, and moans; and howl and moan it will, unless we call in the help of some good angel
                            to come and drive it away. " If this, or that thing had not happened, " we say,- -"then all
                            would have been right, and we should have had no cause to complain. " And so we rebel
                            against the Divine Will, and kick against the pricks, every one of which enters deep and
                            deeper into the soul, the harder we strike against them. As long as we feed, and nurse, and
                            pamper our troubles, they will live to torment us. Go where we will, there will always be a
                            skeleton in the house, and a black sheep in the flock. Here is a shred of narrative to the
                            point:- - - -*See Emerson's "Works and Days, " for this section.THE MANIFESTO. <pb n="137" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>" As I was walking among the Downs of England" says a recent traveler, "I
                            approached a shepherd with a large flock of sheep. I hailed him, and said, " Good morning,
                            friend, you seem to be out early; and what a fine flock of sheep that is you are driving!"
                            "Oh, yes," he replied, "the flock is all good enough; all thriving and hearty; it costs me
                            but little labor to pasture and fold it; it is all right, all but that black ram, you see
                            yonder. He is never quiet from morning till night, he will not stay with the others ; and he
                            keeps me on my legs the whole day, chasing after him. Look! there he is now- -off like a
                            shot, and taking two thirds of the whole flock after him. I believe Satan possesses that
                            ram!"- -And off he started at his topmost speed, to overtake and secure the recreant sheep,
                            and bring him back again, with the rest of the runaways which had followed him. After much
                            running, sweating, and puffing, he returned, tired out with the race he had had after the
                            ram, and the unruly sheep. "It may not be half an hour, " he said " before I may have to be
                            on my legs again after the ram, and the sheep he takes with him. I wish he was in the
                            shambles, and I could see the last of him, for he is the plague of my life. " And then he
                            rolled up his shepherd's coat, and sat down on a stone, to wait for another headlong rush
                            for the flock, and another scramble over the Downs. Truly, I thought, every man has a black
                            sheep in his flock. Canaan, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Purest pearl" TEIform="index"/>THE PUREST PEARL

They may have
                            come upon the earth as the earthquake, as the whirlwind or as the still small voice. They
                            are with us to-day as in the past. They are in the halls of Pharaoh, in the wilderness, and
                            in the streets of the New Jerusalem. They are the messengers of God to stimulate man to
                            action, in the spirit of peace and in the works of righteousness. The servants of God and
                            the disciples of Christ are always looking forward and making themselves ready to accept
                            whatever may lead from a low estate to that which is higher and better, from darkness to
                            light and from Ihe sins of the wrorld to an inheritance in the Kingdom of God. It was an
                            active work upon which the Apostle enteied as a witness for the spirit of truth and to which
                            he gave his whole life. The sacred historian tells us that the eyes of the Apostle were
                            opened and following this he received the message,- -"Thou shalt be his (God's) witness unto
                            all men of what thou hast seen and heard. " The subsequent life of the Apostle, so full of
                            deeds of self-sacrifice, and so thoroughly absorbed in hi? spiritual work while earnestly
                            contending for the faith gives us the assurance that he was a faithful witness for the life
                            and testimony of Jesus Christ. Other witnesses have arisen among men ; have allowed their
                            light to shine ; have delivered their testimony and passed on to their heavenly reward. The
                            same will be demanded of us when our eyes are opened to see the manifestations of God's
                            work. Not to do less than did the Apostle, but with greater privileges and increased
                            opportunities, we should be expected to accomplish better results. Jesus has assured his
                            disciples of this fact. It was a prophetic revelation. If the present was wonderful and
                            glorious, the futur? inspiration of the Church of God would be more wonderful and, indeed,
                            more glorious. "He that believeth on me, the works that I do, shall he do also ; and greater
                            works than these shall he do." This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all the world
                            for a witness unto all nations. To believe this, is to live and act agreeably to the spirit
                            of it. To work diligently while our day lasts, lest we be found as were the members of the
                            Church of the Laodiceans, and in this reap a corresponding rebuke. The gospel is good and
                            glorious newsto the seeker after righteousness. It is the power of God to salvation. With
                            this knowledge the demand becomes imperative for those who have been chosen as disciples of
                            the Lord, to "Let your light shine." To be benefitted as an individual may afford a degree
                            of satisfaction, but to absorb selfishly the gifts and graces that may be trusted to our
                            especial care would be a very sordid enterprise. Of what use is the spiritual knowledge or
                            the power for good unless the possessor is made an active witness of all that he has seen
                            and heard, and by this means, be able to lead souls on toward God. The Apostle was not at a
                            loss to understand the full force of this. His zeal for the welfare of the church was un-<pb n="139" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/>bounded. He had become a witness of the truth of God's word, and from
                            his own declaration, we learn that no obstacle was suffered to hinder him from carrying
                            forward the good work of the cross of Christ. We are witnesses, chosen from among the world,
                            to bear record of the light which has come to us through the revelation of God. Into honest
                            and pure hearts these messages should be received, having in them the spirit, the wisdom,
                            the glory and the assurance of eternal life. Let this admonish us to seek first the Kingdom
                            of God and its righteousness, as a worthy preparation for the gospel work. If there are
                            those Avho make no profession of a higher calling, but choose rather to dwell in the
                            pleasures of sense for a season, and receive to themselves the treasures of their natural
                            inheritance, we have only to say,- -" Verily, they have their reward." Their spiritual eyes
                            have not, as yet, been opened. Their attention is wholly confined to the things of earth,
                            crude, gross and sensual. That loving and earnest witness who gave messages of Christian
                            kindness to his brethren has left to us this beautiful record,- -"Behold what manner of love
                            the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons and daughters of God. We
                            also will witness to the truth as did the Apostle, making ourselves rightful heirs to the
                            kingdom and to that glorious inheritance of Sons and Daughters of God.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="We each have our motes and blemishes..."

                                his clothes. What a covering of oiled silk does for a wet rag in surgery- - namely,

                                wet. When, therefore, the wearer of a waterproof takes off that article of clothing
                                because it has ceased to rain, he is in the position of a person who has damp clothes on
                                and, if he sits in the saddle, or walks home, or rides in an open trap, he is more
                                likely to take cold than if he had not used the waterproof at all. If, therefore a
                                waterproof is once put on, it should on no acconnt be removed until the clothes can be
                                changed or dried by a fire without reduction of bodily temperature. - - Health and Home.

TEIform="persName"/>SAMUEL S. MCCLELLAND.</byline><p TEIform="p"> In the month of Sept. the Indians stole four of our best horses. So soon as it was known
                            which way the Indians had gone, two of the Brethren and a hired man started in pursuit. This
                            company took with them two horses, but were not provided with any weapons of defence, as
                            they expected to obtain their property in a peaceful manner. After traveling nearly three
                            days they overtook the Indians and found the horses. Abram Jones, who was able to converse
                            with the Indians, told them that they had come for the horses, that they had no guns and
                            would not fight. The Indians would not talk much, but seemed very sullen, as they were
                            busily fix-<pb n="140" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> ing their guns, so that the Brethren could obtain no
                            satisfaction. The horses were finally unfastened and the owners started for home as rapidly
                            as possible, each man having two horses in charge. After they had rode about three miles
                            they learned that the Indians were pursuing them at full speed. Every exertion was now made
                            to keep out of their way. After running some seven or eight miles through the prairie the
                            horses became weary. They entered a nag swamp M-here the horses made slow progress on
                            account of the mud. The Indians had gained on them, and were now discharging their fire
                            arms. To save the horses was out of the question, and fearing for their own lives, they
                            jumped off the horses and made for the brush with all possible speed. Instead of retaking:
                            the four horses they now lost six with their saddles, blankets, overcoats and provisions.
                            The mud in the swamp robbed them of their shoes and in their haste to save their lives they
                            lost their hats. After six days of fatigue they reached home sadly torn by the bushes and
                            briars and suffering for the want of food. Added to all this was the sad disappointment at
                            their loss of the property. The militia were now called to go on duty for three months, up
                            the Wabash. Samuel S. McClelland was drafted and says, "It was just at the time that my hand
                            was useless from the injury received last October. The officer ordered me to attend
                            according to militia rules, but I refused, telling him that I could not use my hand. The
                            officers took advantage of my absence and more than a year from this date, held a court
                            martial and fined me thirty dollars, and then abated ten dollars on account of my hand. They
                            placed an attachment on my tools and sold enough to pay the fine of twenty dollars." An army
                            of 1400 men was raised and marched to Busro. They encamped at Snap's Prairie about a mile
                            from our Church. This proved a sore affliction to our Society till they marched up the
                            Wabash. On the 7th of Nov. the battle of Tippecanoe was fought. On their return we did all
                            we could to make those who had been wounded or were weary as comfortable as possible till
                            they marched on to Vincennes. 1812. A saw mill and a school house were built in the month of
                            March, and on the 7th of May school opened with seventy five boys and fifty six girls. Able
                            teachers were provided from among the Brethren and Sisters. This school house was made of
                            hewn logs, two stories high, and having four large rooms. A stack of chimneys was built
                            between the rooms. On the 18th of June the President declared war against England. This with
                            the rumors of the Indian war, added no little to our fear of impending danger. Of course we
                            would not build forts unless we intended to defend them, and to this our faith was entirely
                            opposed. As our settlement was almost the frontier, many thought we had better leave the
                            ground in peace, than to run the risk of being insulted and abused by the troops, or of
                            being massacred by the Indians. After mature deliberation it was decided for us to move away
                            from the place for the present. The militia were gathering and had made their encampment
                            quite near to our houses. They took the liberty to pass in and out without molestation and
                            without even regarding the rules of good behavior. Our gardens were robbed and our fields
                            were taken as enclosures for their horses. Our cattle and swine they butchered and destroyed
                            in a most savage, wasteful manner. During this invasion the Brethren and Sisters were very
                            industriously employed in preparing for our journey. Suddenly the Press Gang appeared and
                            seized several of our horses and saddles and a few axes. Fort Harrison was already besieged
                            by the Indians and this company were hurrying along to render some assistance. Our loss of
                            horses caused us considerable trouble, but we were still able to provide some saddle horses
                            and others for the plough. With horses and oxen we were able to start fourteen wagons. The
                            boat.', were soon made ready at the mouth of Busro and loaded with a variety of our
                            property. On the 14th of Sept. Elder Issachar Bates and Joseph Lockwocd left Busro for Union
                            Village, to hold a conference with the leaders of that Society. Several of the Brethren
                            remained in Busro to take charge of the property, that could not be removed. The army<pb n="141" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> had increased to 1000 and our houses were converted into barracks,
                            our nurseries into horse lots and our fields into race grounds. Sept. 15, 1812. We now bid
                            adieu to our home in Indiana and began our journey towards the Believers that reside in
                            Kentucky. Several of the friends from Union Village, who had been with us since August now
                            concluded to keep us company. Our camp consisted of 300 hundred persons, 250 head of sheep,
                            100 head of cattle, 14 wagons, one keel boat, one canoe and one pirogue. The .wagons were so
                            largely filled with plunder (meichandise) that it was difficult to make suitable
                            accommodations for the sick. Some who were feeble in health preferred to make the journey in
                            the boats. As the Believers were formed into two companies, one to proceed by land and the
                            other by water we will accompany those in the wagons first. This body which included the
                            company that traveled on foot, the wagons sheep and cattle made only about ten miles the
                            first day. The encampment was in the woods and all were made as comfortable as the
                            circumstances would permit. On the 17th we made a journey of nine miles. Our passage across
                            the ferry at White River cost us eighteen dollars. For several days the weather was
                            excessively warm and greatly increased the sufferings of those that were feeble. We reached
                            the Ohio Iliver on the 21st at noon. The ferryman very kindly offered us the use of his
                            boats for which we made him a present of several sheep. The Brethren continued the work of
                            transportation till midnight, and began early the next day and were not all over the river
                            till the evening of the 23rd. Our place of landing on the Kentucky shore was three and one
                            half miles above Red Banks in the town of Henderson. The militia troops were crossing the
                            Ohio at the same time and forming an encampment on the Indiana side, but as they crossed at
                            Red Banks, we were quite out of their way. It was not long, however, before forty of these
                            soldiers, ordered the ferryman to take them over the river near the place where the
                            Believers landed. They soon marched to our resting place and informed us that they had
                            orders to press eighty blankets. In their search they were able to obtain only sixteen, as
                            the others were stored in the boats. For these sixteen blankets they gave us an order on the
                            pay-master for seventy one dollars which we received at a, subsequent date. Our next move
                            was on the banks of the river and within two miles of the village of Henderson where we
                            found sufficient fodder for our stock and good canes for our tents. On the 26th John McComb
                            arrived from Busro with word that the army were making sad depredations upon our property at
                            that place. A heavy rain fell on the night of the 27th from which we were but poorly
                            protected. The next day all hands were busy in drying the clothes and furniture, and making
                            ourselves generally comfortable. We will now return and accompany the Believers who are in
                            the boats. We all left Busro at o P. M. and floated down as far as Fort Knox where we
                            stopped for the night. A gun was fired by the soldiers at the fort as a warning for us not
                            to pass without permission. The next day one of the boats ran on a sand bar and all the
                            goods were taken to the Illinois shore. The river was very low and we worked hard to force
                            the boats over the bars. On the 18th we reached Little Rock, and were again obliged to
                            unload our large boat and carry our goods about a mile down the river. This night we
                            fastened the boats to the rocks and then encamped on the Indiana shore. On examination we
                            found the river so shoal that it would be impossible for us to carry our goods. After
                            traveling two miles we wer.e enabled to hire a horse boau and a pirogue, and by wading and
                            pulling the boats through the crooked channel we made the distance of about two miles daring
                            the day. On the 20th we reached the Grand Rapids, and soon learned that we could not pass
                            them without more assistance. We engaged four men to assist as far as White River, a
                            distance of nine miles. A large part of this day we were obliged to be in the water in order
                            to make a safe passage. For six miles the river abounded in rocks and one half of this
                            distance was included in the Rapids. For this extra help and the boats we paid nine dollars.

                            " Champion " Stylographic Pen, patented November 18th, 1884. We have used for two years past
                            a Stylographic Pen sent us by Mr. Dunlap, but this latest invented Pen, is endorsed
                            unanimously by the trade as a great improvement and givTing perfect satisfaction to their
                            customers. Many say, it is the only Stylographic Pen worth having at any price. The New
                            England agent of the Union and Central Pacific II. K. writes : " I have been a constant user
                            of the Champion, after having tried several other makes. Since receiving the Pen and having
                            become . accustomed to its use, it would be like a relapse into barbarism to return to the
                            old style. I would not pan with my Champion Pen for $100, if I could not replace it. I
                            consider it the best Pen in the market. " This new Pen, which is rightfully called the
                            "Champion" contains valuable features never before combined in any Stylographic Pen, but the
                            principal feature is a compound spring formed from a tube of hard rubber, while other
                            Stylographic Pens, have fine gold wire or metallic springs, which soon rot and corrode. In
                            order to successfully introduce to the public this new and valuable instrument the Dunlap
                            Stylographic Co., 296 Washington St. Boston, Mass., (manufacturers of the Pen) have reduced
                            the price to $2.00 each for plain, and $2.50 each for gold mounted. They will (for a short
                            time only) send by return mail a Champion Pen, 6 months supply of ink, and a beautiful gold
                            mounted pencil, on receipt of the price of a Pen. The Pen is the same in style and finish as
                            Pens sold everywhere at $3.50 and $4.00 each.</p></div2><pb n="145" id="p29" TEIform="pb"/><!-- AD VERTISEMENTS.
