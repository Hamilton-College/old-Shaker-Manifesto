THE MANIFESTO.
The Atlantic-Pacinc Railway Tunnel Company, now driving a five mile tunnel for railway use and mining purposes as well, straight
through the Rocky Mountains, 5,000 feet below their snow-capped crests, sixty miles due
west from Denver, is really making a success of the great work, to the satisfaction of
more than four thousand men and v, omen already interested as share-owners in this cooperation of labor and capital to unearth
immense wealth from the gold and silver
mines owned by the Company. The tunnel
is already in 3,000 feet on the east side, and
1,400 feet on the west side, and at the depth
of 1,800 feet below the surface in the east
end they are bringing ore out from an eight
foot wide vein that yields $184 per ton of
gold and silver, and from another vein five
feet wide, silver and lead ore worth nearly
.$200 per ton. When completed for railway
use�as it will be�it will be the greatest and
most profitable honest enterprise in this
country. Those caring to know particulars
will receive a large descriptive pamphlet by
enclosing a 2 cent stamp to Mark M. Pomeeoy, President, No. 234 Broadway, New
York City.

                            mortal birth of Jesus, or any preceding Avatar reverenced by the nations of antiquity, but
                            of that redeeming spirit, the Savior of mankind, the Christ which prompted Jesus to say
                            :�"Now 0 Father glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee
                            before the world was;"�that spirit with which Jesus was baptized as he ascended from Jordan,
                            when the heavens opened, and unto mortal vision was manifest a spiritual presentation in the
                            form of a Dove, which abode upon him ; beautifully typifying that gift of peace of which he
                            was the herald, bearing glad tidings of great joy. Then did he receive more deeply, we
                            believe, than had any predecessor, of that divine unction from the "Christ of the
                            Ages"�which is co-eternal with the Father and Mother of all which has been revealed to
                            mortals under various epochs of spiritual progress, and in degrees adapted to the needs and
                            receptive capacity of those to whom it was given. But throughout all Christian lands,
                            sr-called, how few celebrate the day writh fitness to the occasion ; and the thoughtful will
                            ask, wherefore is the day appointed by the civil government? and why is it almost
                            universally held as a feast day for the physical senses, when the term Christ-mass indicates
                            only religious service? Under the reign of Constantine the G-reat, the Christian religion
                            first became united to the State government, and from that time on, through Medieval ages,
                            the two powers became more closely combined, until the edict of the Pope was the only
                            authority recognized; but, under the constitution of the United States, the civil
                            authorities have no more right to appoint a Christian holiday for universal observance, than
                            special days for Jews, Buddhists, Mahometans, or any other religious sect. In regard to
                            Christmas having become a feast day, we can only say that originally it was a religious
                            ceremony of the Romish Church, in commemoration of the "Lord's last supper," and that with
                            more anxiety to increase in numbers, than in spiritual power, the most sacred rites of the
                            church were degraded, in order to accommodate them to the<pb n="266" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> gross
                            conditions of the people to whom they opened their doors. And the twenty-fifth of December
                            having for ages been observed as one of joyful festivity by all nations of the Orient, as
                            the day on which the sun passes through Capricorn, or the renewer of Life, for the purpose
                            of drawing the multitudes then assembled from Pagan rites into those of the Christian
                            Church, (?) no means were spared to render the latter attractive to the populace ; and thus
                            was the Christ-mass held upon that day. Therefore, without the least assumption that it is
                            the period of the birth of Jesus, the event is commemorated in the sternest season of the
                            year, while it would seem that it was a genial season of verdancy and growth ; for we read
                            that while shepherds watched their flocks by night, Bethlehem's star was seen, and under its
                            soft gleamings, while keeping their silent watches, came floating down the strains of angel
                            music which thrilled their souls : "Peace on earth, good will to man.''' It would see in
                            more appropriate to commemorate the advent of Christ's mission at a season when leaping
                            rills, springing verdure, unfolding buds and all the glad voices of nature's spring, mingle
                            in a chorus of rejoicing for the liberating power received from the sun, which is the most
                            fitting emblem of the Christ Orb. Its life-giving radiance entering the hearts of humanity,
                            releases from gloom and soulfreezing infidelity, awakens from spiritual inertia, melts the
                            icy coverings of selfishness, unsealing deep fountains in the .soul, and quickening with
                            ever expanding power those diviner germs, which bud with immortal hopes, blossom in the
                            sweetness of true and pure desires, and bear precious fruitage in a life wrought in God.
                            But, neither the season, nor the outward forms of celebration are important as compared with
                            the spirit and motives which actuate. Decorating the churches with evergreens and flowers is
                            a beautiful and fitting expression ; also the custom of bestowing suitable gifts, when
                            offered in sincerity as tokens of the heart's gifts of love, peace and good will, especially
                            when the poor and lowly are remembered in a tangible way ; thus bringing to mind one day in
                            the year that equality and competence of blessings which may be enjoyed by all, when
                            Christ's teachings shall have been so far accepted that man, through selfish greed shall no
                            longer rob his brother man of an inheritance in the land, thus making of his labor and very
                            life a mere commodity�practical slavery, resulting from the extensive systems of monopoly,
                            all having their foundation in that of the land. But we, dear gospel friends, have entered
                            the Millennium ;�a perpetual Sabbath unto the Lord�an eternal Christmas� a life in which is
                            practically embodied all those glorious principles which it was the divine mission of Jesus
                            to inaugurate ; and more than any other people, Believers have cause to rejoice in
                            celebrating this day, not alone for the Fatherhood revealed through Jesus, but for the
                            manifestation of the Heavenly Comforter, an unction from the Mother Spirit in Deity, that
                            was poured out upon a little struggling band of whom Mother Ann Lee be-<pb n="267" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>

                            evil devices of the human heart. The greater the comprehension of the structure of humanity,
                            the fraction of excellence in its composition, the greater is human wTonder, that the Lord
                            is mindful of man. An estimate of the qualities of the lords of creation suggestive as
                            fragmentary and far from being complete, may shock the senses of those who consider the
                            condition of the present generation but a little lower than that of the angels, and thus,
                            such judgment was belittling the work of the Almighty. Such views are not profound. The
                            conditions of to-day are greatly changed from those of the early creation. Wickedness did
                            not then fill the earth, nor was the earth then corrupted. In the beginning, man was made
                            upright, and all created things were pronounced good. But what does history tell us
                            followed? Man, realizing his free agency, and being of the earth earthy, unwisely listened
                            to his earthly, animal part, yielded to his weaker powers and thus assumed his independence
                            that he might become as god. From this experiment, he acquired a knowledge of evil. A^hafc
                            was the result and what the entailment upon his posterity! Lo! the eyes of the once innocent
                            were opened, and both the man and the woman found themselves naked before God. As a
                            mountain, the sin of their disobedience loomed before them to their condemnation, and they
                            were cast out of paradise, driven from blissful Eden. The ground was cursed for their sake ;
                            the fruit of wliich they were to eat in sorrow, all the days of their life. From that day to
                            this, such has been human experience ;� man being "Born unto trouble as the sparks fly
                            upwards." Job v., 7. Notwithstanding this rebellion and the spirit thereof, which has been
                            manifested in every dispensation of God's grace to man by Adam's posterity, yet a merciful
                            God has provided a safe means of escape from the curse. Here comes the cross, a sacrifice of
                            all that is animal or beastly found in man's composition. He is no more to partake of
                            forbidden fruit, which, from the days of our first parents, has produced shame, condemnation
                            and death to the spirit. He is no more to eat of the tree that produces life; the effect of
                            such an act is death to the spirit. He is no more to cultivate and give support to the vine
                            of the earth. On the contrary, all his powers are to be given in service to God; every act
                            of his life is to be given in consecration to the building up and support of Christ's
                            kingdom in works of virgin purity, as manifested in the life and godly example of Jesus, who
                            said, "Follow me," and your<pb n="268" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> reward shall be eternal life. No more is he
                            to look for justification in the works of the first Adam. No more a resort to arms for
                            satisfaction for wrongs. The Christian command is, "Put up again thy sword into his place ;
                            for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Matt. xxvi., 52. No more
                            tooth for tooth and eye for eye, as under the Mosaic law ; but suffer wrong rather than do
                            wrong, and thus work to cause peace to fill the earth as waters cover the sea. No more
                            marriages ; as that institution is an order of the old creation and not that of the new ; as
                            in the resurrection or in Christ,�"They neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as
                            the angels of God in heaven." Matt, xxii., 30. No more mine and thine in earthly things,
                            which are to be used unselfishly as not abusing them, after the manner of the first
                            Christian church at Jerusalem, where "All that believed were together and had all things
                            common ;" Acts ii., 44, and where "The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and
                            of one soul; neither said any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his
                            own; but they had all things common." Acts iv., 32. Upon the present generation is the
                            spirit of Christ calling, "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in
                            heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." Matt, xi., 29. He that hath ears to hear,
                            k&gt;t him hear ; and he that hath heart to conceive, let him understand and find strength to
                            obey. Enfield, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear Elder Henry:--Our good Eldress Adaline wishes to contribute..." TEIform="index"/>

                            vanishes, which lasts forever. True happiness can be found only in conscious union with God
                            our Heavenly Father, therefore, my daily, continual prayer is, that God may be with me and
                            with all my Brethren and Sisters ; that he may enter into our hearts, that bis spirit may be
                            united with our spirit, that they may be like<pb n="269" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> one, then will true
                            happiness be ours, then shall we really be at-oned. What is the meaning of this ? God our
                            Father in Heaven, is the great spiritual sun, the center of the universe, from which streams
                            out to every particle of creation, to every being, the highest and the lowest, the essence
                            or substance of Divine life, which is love, wisdom and holy will. Will or energy, is the
                            active (that is creative and preservative) principle of Divine substance. If we wish to be
                            at-oned�that means to be one with God or united with him,�then his love, his wisdom and his
                            holy will must take dwelling in our hearts ; we must strive to equal him in every respect.
                            But we cannot reach this perfection through our own power and will, without his aid and
                            assistance. God assists only those who seek his help by prayer. The first step toward Divine
                            perfection therefore, is prayer : not only once in a while, but daily, continual prayer for
                            Divine help and assistance in our endeavors. "There is an Eye that never sleeps Beneath the
                            wing of night; There is an Ear that never shuts When sinks the beams of light; There is an
                            Arm that never tires, When human strength gives way; There is a Love that never fails, When
                            earthly loves decay. That Eye is fixed on seraph throngs; That Ear is filled with angels'
                            songs; That Arm upholds the worlds on high; That Love is throned beyond the sky. But there's
                            a power which man can wield When mortal aid is vain, That Eye, that Arm, that Love to reach
                            That listening Ear to gain : That power is Prayer, which soars on high, And feeds on bliss
                            beyond the sky." Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dearly Beloved Elder Abraham:--It gave me very great pleasure..." TEIform="index"/>

                            Oct. 1890.</dateline><p TEIform="p">Dearly Beloved Elder Abraham ��It gave me very great pleasure to receive your kind favor of
                            the 8th. inst., giving me welcome to our hospitable shores�the home of my adoption and
                            especially my Shirley, Shaker home, from which no outside beauty or splendor hath power to
                            charm me, longer than duty, or liberty in the gift of God will allow. In answer to your
                            first question will say that I found much improvement in the condition of the great body of
                            workingmen, generally. They have better homes, are better clad and fed, have much better
                            means of learning the things that pertain to their physical, moral and religious conditions.
                            There is still intemperance, a great tendency to enjoy sports, and considerable gambling in
                            connection. But so far as I could observe, in traveling nearly the full length of England
                            and quite a "piece into Scotland, I was pleased to notice evidences of culture and thrift on
                            every side. I was talking with a good Methodist sister, an old friend, and said to
                            her,�Hannah, your Chapel is very much improved in size and appearance. Is the religious
                            element equally so? She replied, "I fear not." Perhaps she was justified in her fear. And
                            possibly it is there as elsewhere, there has been too much yielding towards worldly tastes,
                            fashions and customs. I heard some of them telling the Lord what "miserable sinners they
                            were," perhaps so. I would not wish to dispute their words in the matter, though if I or any
                            one else had accused them of being such, the probability is, they would have resented it.
                            This shows the need of the life-giving testimony that will show them they must be saved from
                            their sins and not, as the natural man would desire, in their sins. As you say, there have
                            been great changes since I first left England, forty-eight years ago. Very few are left that
                            I knew then. I found a very few, and I am happy to say, some noble specimens of men. Onu the
                            present Mayor of the Borough; another whom I met in the Mayor's parlor, had been Mayor four
                            terms. These two were intimate friends. Another with whom I had great hopes of having a
                            pleasant visit, and to whose house I made my first call, had been<pb n="270" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>
                            buried two weeks. I mention his name, J. H. Walker, as he was not an entire stranger to the
                            Manifesto readers. He was formerly one of the Aldermen in Manchester, England, but spent a
                            few of his later years in Canada, and once made an extended vi.sit at Shirley. He loved the
                            Shakers, and spoke of his love for tliem many times in his last sickness. I appreciate what
                            ycu say in regard to the succession of earth's generations. Generation to the natural,
                            worldly mind, is of the first importance, while regeneration, that will fit us for the
                            eternal, heavenly conditions, is put off in too many cases for an indefinite, or more
                            convenient season. Still with this, there is a spirit of inquiry and of a very candid,
                            courteous nature. On our way over, while there, but more especially on our return by
                            steamship "Servia," there were on. board some two hundred delegates to the Iron and Steel
                            Convention. Quite a number, men of title, and much above the average of men in intelligence,
                            by their frankness and freedom from ostentation, and their manifest earnest desire to learn
                            the truth, opened a way for the sowing of gospel seed, that I trust may be seen in a
                            fruitful growth, when 1 too have laid a^ide the mortal, for a home in the land of souls. I
                            respond heartily to your prayer, that the time may be hastened when Zioa shall put on her
                            beautiful garments, and shall take her place fearlessly as the agent in God's hands in
                            unfolding to the world, Millennial lives and Millennial blessings. Why are we not more in
                            earnest about it? Does some spell bind us that needs to be broken? My prayer is, come Love,
                            Light, Liberty, with that savin? power and victory that shall make Zion shine in the glory
                            of God. j I liave written hurriedly and just as my pen would seem to run, and trust it may
                            in some way satisfy your desire. Hope I may hear from you again, as I used to long since. I
                            love a truly good Believer and mean to be such in truth and sincerity, believing it will, in

                            Friend and Brother, A. G. Hollister :�I thank you heartily for your letter ; I expected it.
                            I knew that my ideas about marriage would be approved by your Community. Your books and
                            tracts, especially "What would become of the world if all were Shakers," corroborated my
                            views and helped me very much to a clear understanding of the question. I am very much
                            astonished how a Christian cannot approve yours and my view of marriage. In Corinthians
                            vii., it is said in so many plain words. I admire very much your explanation of the
                            comparison of the kingdom of heaven to a net, and the conclusion that the fishes taken in
                            the net, cannot depopulate the sea; and that if it does, it will be after the will of God,
                            which in the form of our love for purity and chastity, is written in our hearts. I received
                            one of your books, the Millennial Church, and thank you very much for it. But pardon me, in
                            brotherly love and spirit I must tell you the truth : it was very painful for me to read in
                            your letter the account of the influx of spirits from heaven and so on. It is painful for me
                            because not only your faith (excepting Ann Lee and the manifestation of spirits,) and your
                            practice of life as far as I know it. is a true Christian faith, corroborated by your life,
                            and it should have attracted to you all the people who crave a true Christian life : but
                            your peculiarities� manifestations of spirits�repel them. God's truth has been known always,
                            in the old times, the same as now. True progress, the establishing the kingdom of God on
                            earth consists not in producing new truths, but in sifting the truths that are known to us ;
                            by putting aside the lies and superstitions with which they are intermingled. You have put
                            aside a great many lies and superstitions of the external world, but I am afraid you have
                            accepted new ones. Put them aside. Analyze them. Don't keep to beliefs only because they
                            have been believed a long time, and are old. Put them away, and your Shaker faith, with your
                            chaste and spiritual life, your humility, charity, and principles of moderation and manual
                            work, will conquer the world. Please pardon me if I have offended you. I have written this
                            only because I think and feel it, and because I love God. I try to love Him, and through Him
                            to love you my brethren. All that you say about the time fast approaching in which the
                            Divine light will be spread over all the world, and darkness dispelled, is quite true. I
                            feel it, and therefore write thus to you.

                            placed a copy of "Shaker Theology." This last was a present from the author, Elder II. L.
                            Eads. Both are eagerly perused by other readers whom we trust are seekers after the abiding
                            love of Christ. This is the holy calling of all true Believers. To abide in the Love of
                            Christ, is to overcome self and the world. If it were not possible to withstand the
                            temptations, and overcome the world, then Christ would not have admonished his disciples to
                            "'continue in my love." We are in constant danger of forsaking Christ and the teachings of

                            if we do not "-Watch, watch and pray." The spirit of the world, if we will permit it, will
                            creep into our hearts and overthrow Christ's love and life, therefore we need to bear in
                            mind the words of Paul;�"Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto
                            God. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind
                            that ye may prove what is good and acceptable uuto God." It is God's will that we should
                            abide in his love and be filled with the fulness of God. and it is not only his will, but it
                            is our privilege to become perfect, and love God with all our heart, soul and mind. Jesus in
                            his mission among men, proclaimed, "Not every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter into
                            the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." To abide
                            in Christ's love we must keep his commandments. "If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide
                            in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love." Christ was
                            submissive to the will of his Father. "My meat," said he, "is to do the will of Him that
                            sent me." Apd when the Father saw fit to give him the bitter cup of sorrow he took it
                            meekly, and said, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt." It is Christ's command that we should
                            follow him daily and deny ourselves for his cause. We should follow him in his humility, in
                            his meekness, in his gentleness, iu his patience, in his long-suffering, in his holiness and
                            in his purity. When God may choose to give us the cup of sorrow, we should submissively
                            drink it, and gladly do or bear every duty in a humble manner, and do our best. We should
                            not fear to do too much for Christ, for our Gospel kindred, and for such as know not of this
                            precious love. To abide in the love of Christ will bring no sorrow nor regret but joy and
                            peace forever. 0 Lord my best desire fulfill, And help me to resign Life, health and comfort
                            to thy will, And make thy pleasure mine. Why should I shrink at thy command, Whose love
                            forbids my fears ; Or tremble at the gracious hand That wipes away my tears. Thine, Lord,
                            wholly thine, Forever one with Thee : Rooted, grounded in thy love, Abiding sure and free.

                            will teach, We ask if Christ such sentiment approves; Or would he bless the worldly creeds
                            they preach, Which bring no change of heart, nor sin remove? We see them live in pride and

                            impossible that in the long line of human evils there can be one more terrible than
                            intemperance known in the use of alcoholic drinks. Behold the mighty sea ! and many streams
                            and myriad crystal drops, which ever now and then rise up to heaven, and made more clear and
                            beautiful return to earth again in showers of rain and snow which sparkle in the ices of the
                            frosty North, and glisten in the sunlight of the summer South. Behold the golden harvests of
                            shining grain and waving corn ! Then why the maddening cup? why turn to such abuse God's
                            gracious gifts ? He might with justice withhold his generous hand, thus to prohibit man's
                            base and wicked deeds. The question arises in the mind of the native teetotaler as to the
                            pleasing or acceptable taste of strong drink ; how such hard, burning, biting fluids can be
                            suffered to pass the mouth and throat with any endurance, and is answered by the fact of the
                            great stimulus it proves to be to the mental and nervous conditions. This habit usually
                            commences, not in excesses, but in slight sips, and its effects lead to further and greater
                            temptations ; too<pb n="274" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> often induced through medical prescriptions, at
                            banquet tables, at pleasurable sociables and in many instances when but little is taken, but
                            the habit and taste become permanent. The history of ardent spirits runs through the ages
                            from the time of Noah ; a history which records no virtue nor blessing, but eA^ery kind of
                            woe that has fallen upon the human race. The heart's dearest affections, love, happiness,
                            home, reputation, soul, everything has and must succumb to this terrible monster, and death!
                            death! more agonizing, yet sure as the guillotine and untimely graves, are the terrible
                            results and calamities of its victims ; it is really incredible that with all the suffering
                            that has been produced by, and existed through the power of this thing, that it should not
                            in some way have been controlled. If any inexperienced persons wish to imagine the penalties
                            of this irresistible temptation when once overcome by it, let them read the Autobiography of
                            J. B. Gough, he, having once sunk to the lower depths, and endured its despair and the
                            tortures of frightful delirium�and afterward reclaimed� knew and nobly confessed and
                            proclaimed to the world its direful effects, he could find no language too strong in its
                            denunciation ; and we may also well imagine the pangs of a woman's aching heart together
                            with the utter detestation which she had due cause to feel, when we remember the forcible
                            poem known as the "Drunkard's Daughter," and which contains the sentiments of many of her
                            sisters. It is to be regretted that there is no law controlling this drain upon the life and
                            resources of the people. Prohibition is a large and prominent plank in the platform of the
                            reforms of today, and yet think of the waste of property in land and labor still going on ;
                            the statistics concerning drink in the country, presented to us frequently, are appalling;
                            over two hundred millions invested in breweries, malthouses and distilleries ; enough
                            drinking places to reach in an unbroken line from New York to Chicago. "Intemperance costs
                            this nation a thousand million dollars in hard cash every year, and it could better afford
                            to buy out the vested interests of the liquor traffic five times over than to allow the
                            business to go on under legal sanction." Look for instance�and it is only a sample�at the
                            metropolis of our Puritan Massachusetts, styled "The Literary Center of the World," "The Hub
                            of the Universe," with hundreds of liquor saloons, and thousands of inebriates and famishing
                            children and mothers who circle their fireless hearths spending between fifty and sixty
                            millions of dollars yearly for this deathproducing luxury. We might have anticipated
                            Boston's redemption by this tune if we remember the report of the Grand Temperance Jubilee
                            and procession that marched her streets in the year 1848. Its total abstinence army known by
                            various epithets was numbered by the thousand. It could hardly be thought that any one
                            living in the state did not belong to the Clear Water Throng. This evil indulgence, even in
                            moderation, impairs, excites and inilames every portion of the body and mind,<pb n="275" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> and if the sins of our forefathers are visited upon succeeding generations,
                            then we are able to account in some measure for the fearful nervous conditions so prevalent,
                            and for the mental depression and inclination to commit crimes even among those who are
                            innocent of the evil in all its forms, and if continued, what of the future ! more
                            generations of paupers, criminals, idiots, tramps and insane ; how can the nation afford
                            this waste ? but, the evil lives in high places and is the source of political corruption ;
                            the battle must be turned to the gate ; public opinion must receive a greater awakening ;
                            all good people must unite as citizens, patriots and Christians to fight the common enemy.
                            "Where there's a will there's a way," and greater than conquering heroes of battle are they,
                            who are and will be able to vanquish this wanton foe. There is one perfectly sure remedy for
                            intemperance and that is total abstinence ; then will Bacchus fall and God be praised
                            forevermore. Let us drink from the crystal goblet, and bathe in clear waters that our bodies
                            may be fit temples for the indwelling of our immortal souls ; let us fire them not with the
                            indulgence of any carnal passion, for the reward of our doings is inevitable. Mt. Lebanon,

                                At this time we may have a very commendable reason for looking backward and reviewing
                                the path in which we have walked, the places we have visited and make note of the
                                persons with whom we have associated. "But first and chief est with thee brinoHim that
                                yon soars on golden wing, Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne, The cherub Contemplation."
                                Our lives in this world are quite worthy of all the care that may be extended to them.
                                The health of the body, an inestimable treasure, stands prominently in the foreground.
                                '"First that which is natural," in which one holds a relation to the world and its order
                                of life. It is the natural man that is standing erect, and disciplining himself to the
                                laws of a higher intelligence, in anticipation of "transforming himself by the renewing
                                of his mind, that he may prove what is good and acceptable to the perfect will of God."
                                All should be disciplined to love righteousness and to accept the guidance which Wisdom
                                has so beautifully marked out for the willing mind. To live in a state of indifference
                                respecting these vital points, is as the faithful record bears witness, not only
                                dangerous, but ruinous. The immortality of our being demands recognition and we prove
                                ourselves more than unprofitable servants if we selfishly attempt to escape from that
                                duty which the spirit of God has imposed upon us. In a few more days the eventful twelve
                                months, into which we forced so many anxious hopes, will have passed away. Then we saw
                                as "through a glass darkly," but now the light discloses all. What unnumbered privileges
                                have been vouchsafed to us, and what treasures of good have teen secured in the kingdom
                                of God, as we count up our victories over wrong. "We have fought the good fight," we
                                    have<pb n="277" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> resisted many temptations and dispelled many doubts,
                                while in earnest prayer and clad with the armor of God. And now we rejoice in the
                                unfailing promise that the whole catalogue of evil deeds are to be blotted out when the
                                conquering power of God's love is manifest in the soul. It is then that we are ashamed
                                of the crooked paths in which we have at times, allowed our feet to walk. It is then
                                that we might wish to forget that we have kept company with the profane, with the vulgar
                                and with those who dared to make light of sacred things, while we passively smiled a
                                recognition to that conversation which would have burned our cheeks, had others known
                                the discourse of the hour. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he reap." It is
                                well to look forward and resolutely dare to do right. It is well to look forward and
                                make all due preparation for becoming established on a sure foundation which may not be
                                overthrown in the day when temptation is around us. Let every reader of the Manifesto
                                look forward and resolve with the Apostle, to live soberly, righteously and Godly in
                                this present world. AVhile this is our Christian privilege, it is also our moral dut}r
                                to ourselves and no less to those by whom we are surrounded. While the past may afford
                                many lessons of admonition and of encouragement, or the future be portentous with
                                stormclouds or radiant with brightness, the present, the ever present, is the golden
                                opportunity in which to establish a character that will be an honor to our beautiful

                                write a passing note as they rush by. It seems but yesterday that the breezes of spring
                                whitened the earth with scattered blossoms; and now the somber clouds are falling at our
                                feet in feathery crystals. The blossom tells of coming fruit and says to the young, that
                                "if the tree bears no blossoms in spring, we may look in vain for autumn fruit." A wise
                                and happy truth is also evolved by eve^y matured leaf that flutters to the earth; for it
                                leaves not its place on the tree, until it has assisted the growth of tiny buds at its
                                feet, wherein is wrapped the entire growth for the next season. Our first snow in this
                                locality, on the 11th and is hailed with as much ecstasy by happy childhood, as were the
                                first signs of spring. Would that we could all take "whatsoever the good God sends" with
                                equal gratitude. The Indians and squirrels prognosticate a severe winter, but of this we
                                shall know more in March. We hope not for a repetition of the insipid weather of last
                                winter but cling in faith to the promise that "while the earth remaineth, seed-time and
                                harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease." By limiting
                                its use to the greatest necessity our scanty supply of ice lasted until the middle of
                                October, which spoke well for the patience and economy of the Sisterhood; for none but
                                those experienced can tell of the weary steps saved by this household luxury. At 2 P. M.
                                Oct. 19, a new and beautiful phenomenon was ours to behold. A gorgeous rainbow in the
                                northeast. Its colors were so very bright, that the reflection seemed to be repeated to
                                the horizon, making the entire north-east one splendid arch of rainbows. Amid such
                                beautiful displays of the laws governing the works of the Almighty Creator, who can but
                                with humble reverence declare with the Psalmist, "The heavens declare the glory of God
                                and the firmament showeth his handiwork." A. J. C. Center Family. Nov. 13, 1890. The
                                Nov. number of Manifesto has much choice reading matter among which is Eld. Eobert
                                Aitken's account of his visit to England. It is especially interesting; and that was a
                                singular coincidence that those two Brethren, Elder John and himself, should start for
                                the old country and meet on the same steamer without preconcerted action ; they had a
                                real good time. I hope Elder John will favor us with his notes of travel. The History of
                                the Church at Mt. Lebanon, by the Editor, has been very interesting and instructive, for
                                which he has our sincere thanks. While we contemplate the coming cold season and expect
                                to be more secluded from outside influences, we hope to gather the fruits of the spirit
                                in our retired domiciles. Our fall work is well nigh finished ; never, that I know of,
                                were we better prepared for the rude storms of winter than this season. I wish to send
                                greetings to all my gospel kindred. The Christmas festival is close upon us, and I would
                                say peace to him who is near and also to him who is afar ofF; let all Zion's children
                                sing in their hearts the song of the angels, "peace on earth, to man goodwill." T.
                                Kayson. UNTortli Family. "Waves of light like ocean billows Break upon time's beaten
                                shore Opening to our darkened vision Scenes that ne'er were viewed before. Shine, O
                                glorious light of heaven! That all souls may bask therein, Bathe and wash and be
                                forgiven By confession saved from sin." Nov. 10. Christmas time is nearing, a very
                                appropriate season to forgive and be forgiven. If the confession is full the forgiveness
                                will be complete. Love will abound and our salvation be increased. I wish all my gospel
                                friends a joyful Christmas and a Happy New Year. Our joy and happiness will depend very
                                much on each individual effort. One sinner destroyeth much good that belongs to all;
                                especially is this the case in our community relation. Have had two successive stormy
                                    Sabbaths,<pb n="279" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> and we shall probably have no more Society meetings
                                this season. We have had some signs of approaching winter, with its white wings on the
                                mountain tops and frosts in the valleys. Soon 1890 will pass into history long to be
                                remembered and talked about. We havs not accomplished all we set out to do; if any body
                                has we shall rejoice. The blessings of the past season, notwithstanding some unfavorable
                                weather, are abundant and ample to incite us to thankfulness, without even a
                                proclamation from the President or Governor. Thankfulness is made manifest when a proper
                                use is made of the good things with which we are blessed. A wasteful, self-indulgent
                                spirit and practice always savors of ingratitude and leads to unholiness. The past
                                season we have painted all our buildings, and are now engaged digging under our
                                dwelling-house preparatory to setting in the new steam boilers to take the place of one
                                that has been in use nearly thirty years and has not had one cent of repair expended
                                upon it in all that time. At the same time we also expect to improve the sanitary
                                condition of our house, by making it rat proof, and putting in iron pipes to take the
                                place of the old stone and brick drains that have been a nuisance ever since we learned
                                that we live by breathing and that the night air is not poisonous. Perhaps some young
                                people do not know that even the doctor* of old taught that the night air was very
                                injurious, so people would sleep in closed rooms to keep out the night air. Then when
                                any one got sick the priests taught the people that it was sent of God, either as
                                punishment or to make them more pious. But now, some of the coirmon people have found
                                out that even foul drains are avenues through which disease enters and that the air out
                                cf doors at night is full of health ; while the day air closed in a room becomes a
                                deadly poison if people remain there long enough, whether they are saints or sinners.
                                Houses inhabited by human, or other animals should as really breathe as does the house
                                we live in, our bodies. Elder Frederic says, no one can be a perfect Christian unless he
                                has good bread to eat, and much less, except he breathes pure air. It takes time for
                                even religious people to learn to eat, drink and breathe to the honor and glory of God.
                                In our farming operations, we have made some grievous blunders; one was, in not putting
                                our ensilage cutter in perfect order when we got through using it last season. We
                                thought it might run all right and and if it did not we could easily get the needed
                                repairs ; but alas, we broke down,, wrote and then telegraphed, but it took twelve days
                                before the repairs arrived, in the meantime the corn-cutting went on in the field, and
                                some of it laid on the ground about three weeks before it reached the silo. We have
                                commenced feeding it and the unanimous voice of the cows and herdsman is against such a
                                manner of going. Let no one do likewise ; it is not good cattle gospel. Another blunder
                                was, that we let too many weeds grow and mature their seed, and these will spring up in
                                due time and condemn our heathenish manner of farming. Nothing should go to seed on the
                                farm, or in the garden, except what is so designed. Using large quantities of
                                fertilizers, and raising immense crops of weeds, is like having two openings in the
                                grain bag; what is put in at one goes out at the other. It is only by constant watching
                                and care of the little things or a big machine that it is kept in working order. One
                                little nut or key getting lost will disable the whole concern. It is very easy to find
                                excuses for the weeds growing, and for this, that and the other; but these often times
                                only make matters worse. This laying to Providence and the weather what properly belongs
                                to our carelessness and after thought, is hardly the thing. Let the truth stand, though
                                it reveals all our crooked ways. In kindest love, D. Offurd. Soiitli Family. Dear Editor

                                hundred winter squashes and is now putting up some wire fencing, which is very much
                                needed. We are still making and selling nice chairs and mats and will gladly fill all
                                the orders we receive. Sister Olive has made a large quantity of butter this year for
                                home use, and to sell. At the Second Family they make excellent cheese. Are we telling

                                reason and unbelief, a few of us are trying to live in peace and bridle the "unruly

                                Since my last correspondence to the Manifesto have been from home, up in the Berkshire
                                hills; received much benefit thereby, also the pleasure of Gospel interchange which is
                                always profitable. The ministrations of love and kindness received, inspires the soul

Eain, rain, rain. For some time past the heavens have been pouring copious
                                showers of rain upon us, making it almost impossible t.i do any fall ploughing or other
                                outdoor work. But why complain or feel disheartened? The old negro said, "more rain,
                                more rest, Massa." But ours must be, more, rain, more work and more weeds. Let us
                                remember that it is a long lane that never has a turn. And so it is with rainy weather.

                                it feels. Almost like the touch of the electric battery, it nerves us again to start
                                about our duties. Wood chopping has commenced and we are planning for one hundred and

                                the hour very pleasant, and it is of all hours the most precious to the good Believer.

                                as much pleasure as at the opening of this volume of time. Good Old Year of 1890! We may
                                never see one just like you, but the good we have gained, the wisdom we have gleaned
                                from your fields of experience are ours for possession and profit, and we say, rest with
                                the honored manuscripts of past chronicles. Our score is settled; we have had our
                                digressions and progressions, secessions and accessions ; we have seen the fair prove
                                false, and the false acknowledge the blessings of truth. At this juncture we quote for

                                storm which has now entirely left us, and we are enjoying a delightful Indian summer.
                                There are a number in our family approaching eighty years of age, but one over. Sister

                                beautiful letters from gospel friends in other Societies, tidings of good cheer drawing
                                us nearer and nearer together in spirit. Lovingly farewell until you hear from us again.

                                the meaning of each name? Number of writers from Mt. Lebanon, 24 : Canterbury, 25 :
                                Hancock, 10. Ans. The two preachers were Paul and Barnabas, and their names were changed
                                to Mercurius, meaning chief speaker and Jupiter, the air or heavens. 10. Jupiter means
                                the Father that helpeth and Mercurius, an orator. 30. Several writers say that Simon was
                                called Peter and Saul became Paul. The author's answer is as follows :� Paul, called
                                Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker, and Barnabas, Jupiter, meaning a father
                                that helpeth. [It would be well for the writers to state their authority for the answers

We should be very careful of
                            what we are building the foundation of our character, for if that is not firm the whole
                            structure will fall. We should keep adding to our structure "faith, courage, meekness,
                            patience, godliness, love and all the other stones that enter into a s:.lid and Christian
                            life." The opposite of humility is pride which "permeates many sins" as surely as humility
                            "forms an important part of nearly every virtue." True humility drives pride, selfishness,
                            disobedience, untruthfulness and all the other sins from the heart, for they would grieve
                            the Holy Spirit. God has promised "not to merely visit, but to dwell with the humble until
                            they shall be taken to dwell with Him." What a beautiful promise ! How clean and pure we
                            should keep our hearts if we want God to dwell with us, and also if we want to dwell with
                            him in that beautiful place they call Heaven. How dependent we are upon God for everything
                            we have, every good thought, every pure desire which stirs within us is from God. He also
                            gives us strength and wisdom to direct all the good that is in us. "Humility leads us to
                            shun the tempter to distrust ourselves and to trust God. It enables God to bestow upon us
                            his richest blessings and to use us in his service." So we should not be proud of what we
                            have, but remember that it all came from God. It is written "God resisteth the proud but
                            giveth grace to the humble" and Solomon wrote "A man's pride shall bring him low; but honor
                            shall uphold the humble in spirit." It shall ever be my prayer that I may, with God's help,
                            grow in humility.

                            all Christian virtues and the dispelling of all sin from the heart. We are told that we are
                            the living temples wherein God would like to dwell if free from sin. Our hearts should not
                            be like the Egyptian temples, beautiful on the exterior, but filled with idols within, for
                            God has said '�Thou shalt have no other God's but me," so that when the Sun of Righteousness
                            shines in, it may not find, even in the remotest corner idols so cherished but that under

                            manifest itself in the thoughts, words and acts of those who possess it. We should be very
                            careful to think only pure thoughts as our words and actions will be of the same import. It
                            is a life work; each time we overcome a temptation we add to the purity of the heart, as
                            every time we yield we tarnish it, but if we rely on God's help we shall be strengthened;
                            for he has said, "I am with thee alway" "I will never leave thee" and "In times of trouble I
                            will deliver thee." Jesus gave a most precious promise in these words "The pure in heart
                            shall see God" and they can in part receive the fulfillment of it in this life, for they
                            will see God's hand in every event and feel his presence ar. all times. If at last we attain
                            that degree of purity we shall feel amply rewarded for all our struggles.

                                other extreme, caused by the false teachings of blind leaders of the blind, which has
                                given the materialistic torn? to the thought of the age is being remedied or restored to
                                its proper equilibrium. The Macedonian cry has gone out from awakened souls, "come and
                                help us." The forlorn hope of the advance guard of human progress have organized into an
                                army with banners. The signs of the times are ominous of impending changes in the
                                thought of the age. The Manifesto occupies an important place in the arena of
                                spiritualistic journals and must be maintained.

                        </head><p TEIform="p">The lamp business may be classed as one of the great industries of the country. Within a few
                            yeacs a great change has taken place in the business. Glass and Crockery lamps have given
                            way to Bronze, Iron and Brass. In Connecticut alone the following cities and populations are
                            largely engaged in the manufacture of Bronze and Brass lamps: Meriden, 22,000; Waterbury,
                            30,000; Birmingham and Ansonia, 20,000; Bridgeport, 50,000; Total, 122,000, people. The
                            business has increased immensely since the "Rochester" bronze lamp was introduced with its
                            perforated cone burner, about five years ago. There are over two million Rochester lamps in
                            use, and over half a million a year are regularly sold.</p></div2><div2 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Campanini's advice to singers" TEIform="index"/> Campanini's Advice to Singers.</head><p TEIform="p">"My advice to all singers is: Do not impose upon yourself and you will preserve your voice,"
                            says Campanini, in a striking article 'How to train the voice', in the November Ladies' Home
                            Journal. "Good health is necessary to keep a voice in good condition. Dissipation of any
                            kind is of the greatest injury to a voice. The vocal chords are very sensitive and
                            susceptible, and what affects the physical condition will sooner or later affect them. What
                            regimen a singer should follow depends upon the constitution. Some singers can smoke
                            continuously and not suffer from the effects, while others have been seriously injured. It
                            is, therefore, very hard to lay down any cast-iron rules and'say that they should be
                            followed. What is poison, you know, for some, is food for others. "Again I must urge young
                            singers to beware of trying to force their voices; it is dangerous and means the early loss
                            of the voice. The man who builds an organ would not think of having some one try to play on
                            it when the reeds are not properly adjusted, and in like manner the young singer should not
                            tax his voice unless he is prepared to stand the effort. "Amateurs and non-professionals do
                            not of course, require the long and rigorous training of professionals. It would be a waste
                            of time and money, and Avhile it might be a satisfaction to the young lady or young man to
                            have a professional education, in a few years, through lack of constant practice, he or she
                            would probbly sink to the level of the perfunctory parlor singer."</p></div2><div2 type="food" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Thomas G. Newman, editor of the American Bee Journal..." TEIform="index"/>

Lonely, in ruins, but yet picturesque,
the old Newgate prison of Connecticut,
named for its London prototype of gloomy
memory, stands upon a green hillside in
the town of East Granby. Viewed with a
glass from Bartlett's tower, a lofty observation point away across the Farmington River, it resembles an old castle, turreted, moated, bearing the unmistakable
marks of age. This old mine-prison holds
a unique place among the antiquities of
New England. To-day, as one stands beside its crumbling and vine-eovered walls
and looks across the peaceful valley of the
Farmington, with its quiet villages, it is
not easy to realize that the place has a
history written in blood and suffering.
Only a descent into its subterranean caverns puts the visitor in the mood to feel
the spirit of the stories which the place
has to tell.
Newgate has been successively a copper
mine, a colonial prison, a military prison
in the Revolution, and a state prison.
The first chapter of its history opened in
1705, and the last chapter closed over sixty years ago, when the prisoners of the
state were removed to better quarters in
the new prison at WethersfieM. The amateur mining of its early history, conducted at first by clergymen, had a comic cast.
The horrors of its later history were tragic, and through them we gain some insight
into the ideas of penal discipline which
ruled in the old "blue-law" colony.

The feeling against the Tories in the region of Newgate was especially bitter, and
as might have been expected, the Toryism
thereabout was of a particularly malignant type. Hence a bitter struggle between patriots and loyalists raged in the
vicinity, and as many as thirty or forty
Tories were sometimes confined in the
prison. A strong military guard was
maintained, sometimes nearly numbering
one man to each prisoner, with a commissioned officer in command. The discipline of the guards was apparently very
defective, for, in spite of the large force
maintained, the Tories on several occasions escaped in considerable numbers,
either outwitting or overpowering the
guard. In 1776 the prisoners, then only
half a dozen in number, nearly suffocated
themselves in an attempt to burn the
heavy wooden door which closed a level,
used as a drain when the mine was worked.
Of course, in the damp, confined air of the
caverns, only a prodigious amount of
smoke resulted, causing the death of one
man by suffocation, and effectually teaching those who survived the danger of the
experiment�From "The New England
Neivgate" by Edwin A. Start, in the New
England Magazine for November.
