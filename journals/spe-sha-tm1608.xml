                            Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders would occasiona'ly relate to the Brethren and Sisters some
                            of their own experience and the sufferings through which they passed in the earlier part of
                            their faith. Mother Ann's experience in particular, as it evidenced her indefatigable zeal
                            and invincible fortitude of soul was very instructive and interesting. To those who accepted
                            the faith it had a great effect in stimulating them to faithfulness in the way of God. Just
                            previous to the imprisonment of the Believers, in Albany, they were all under much
                            tribulation, as they expected that Mother Ann and the Elders would be driven from their
                            home. Their meetings were seasons of prayer and sadness. At this time Mother Ann entered the
                            room, and said to the Brethren and Sisters, " The wicked men of Albany are plotting against
                            us ; they are making an effort to drive us from our home, and it is unknown to me whether I
                            shall ever see you again in this world. " To a company that visited Watervliet in 1780, she
                            said, u I love the day when I first received the gospel, I call it my spiritual birth day.
                            At that time I prayed earnestly to God, day and night. I was, at times, under great
                            tribulation, so that I could not rest. I prayed to feel a sense of the sufferings<pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>of those who were in distress that I might keep my soul awake to God. " '' I
                            made a confession of all sin to my Elders, one by one, and repented of them in the same
                            manner. I then labored to overcome the nature of sin for myself. It was made known to me by
                            the revelation of God, that he would support me through all trials, find establish me an
                            Elder in the Church. " "When I set out to serve God, I served him day and night, and prayed
                            for deliverance from everything that was offensive in his sight. Many times when I was about
                            my work, I felt the blessed gifts of sorrow. If I was weary and in need of rest, I labored
                            for the spirit of God to aid me, that I might feel refreshed. " " I strove to be temperate
                            in all that I ate and drank, that my soul might hunger for nothing but God. The Lord
                            revealed to me the depth of man's loss, what it was and the way of redemption. Then I was
                            able to bear an open testimony against all sin, and I felt the love of God flow into my soul
                            like a fountain of living water. " Before I found Christ, I found that I had a deceitful
                            heart and was very wicked, so that I could not trust to my own soul, and I made this promise
                            to my God. " I will not allow my soul to rest till I have received a baptism into the spirit
                            of Christ Jesus. " " I cannot deny this manifestation of the goodness of God, but I must
                            dwell in the light forever more. " Persecutions that fell to the lot of Mother Ann and the
                            Elders, while they resided in England. The apostle has very kindly left us this assurance, "
                            All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. " Mother Ann and the
                            Elders learned by a long and painful experience, the truthfulness of this apostolic
                            assertion. So soon as they left the ordinary course of the world and gave their souls in
                            prayer to God, that they might become purified temples for the holy spirit to dwell in, the
                            enemies of the cross of Christ began to annoy them and finally to persecute them in a
                            malicious and savage spirit. Some of these instances that occurred while they lived in
                            England, were related by the Elders to the Believers in this country. They are striking
                            evidences of the inveterate hatred of a lost world, against every increasing manifestation
                            of Divine Light. An attempt was made upon the life of Mother Ann, but it does not appear
                            that this was done by any legal process. It is supposed that it was stimulated by the
                            connivance of .some of the officers of the stone prison, with the designs of her enemies.
                            Mother Ann was confined in a small cell of the prison with the evident intention of starving
                            her to death, as none of the officers of the prison visited her during this time. Here she
                            was kept fourteen days without any kind of sustenance, except what was conveyed to her,
                            privately, through the key-hole of the door, after the first two days, once in twenty-four
                            hours. This act of great kindness' was done by one of the Believers, who found access to the
                            door of her prison, and inserted the stem of a pipe through the key-hole. Into the bowl of
                            this pipe he poured a small quantity of milk, mixed<pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> with a little wine,
                            which was her only temporal support during the whole time of the imprisonment. At the end of
                            fourteen days the door was unlocked and to the great surprise of her enemies, she was not
                            only alive, but as well as when she entered the prison. Some who were present and saw Mother
                            Ann in such perfect health, said that a supernatural power attended her and declared that it
                            was wrong to imprison or to oppress such persons. Speaking of this instance Mother Ann
                            remarked, " Because I bore a testimony against their sins, and told them of their wicked
                            lives, they hated me. " " You must all be faithful and they will hate you as they have hated
                            me, for wicked men and women will always hate those who take up their crosses against the
                            sins of the world. " Elder John Hocknell remarked that the people were astonished, when they
                            saw Mother Ann walk so actively, after such an imprisonment. Elder James Whittaker speaking
                            of this persecution, said;�"I was young at that time, and had but little acquaintance with
                            Mother Ann, but I could not rest as I wanted to do something for her. At length I thought
                            what I might do, and bought a bottle which I could carry in my pocket. I then bought some
                            wine and some milk, and a pipe with a long stem. At night I waited till all were asleep ;
                            then went to the prison and accomplished my mission of mercy as God had led me. This I did
                            several times and I know I received a blessing of God." Mother Ann relates that one of her
                            brothers was very much opposed to her religious teaching. He spoke in very rough terms to
                            her about it, and she said, '* I felt no liberty to answer him." "Will you not answer me,"
                            said he. " At this he became so angry that he obtained a staff and abusively used it upon my
                            person, but I sensibly saw the bright rays of the glory of God which shielded me from harm ;
                            I cried to God for his healing power and it came like balsam to my soul. " A mob arose at
                            one time and seemed determined to put an end to my existence. They carried me into the
                            highway, and ordered me to advance. I made the attempt but was thrown to the ground. When I
                            arose and began to walk they struck and kicked me every few steps for more than a mile. I
                            was so faint that I thought they would take my life." " While I was suffering from this
                            merciless mob, not one friend was allowed to be with me ; but God, in his mercy remembered
                            me, and sent a man who was instrumental in my deliverance. This man was impressed to go
                            somewhere, but he could not tell where, nor for what purpose. Having ordered his horse he
                            rode hastily, as for the saving of his own life, and soon came to a large concourse of
                            people. He then enquired about their business. On being informed he rode to the place where
                            I was and commanding the mob to desist, reproved them for their cruel conduct, and ordered
                            them to disperse immediately. He then inquired if I had any friends present, if not he would
                            care for me himself. " "Elder John Hocknell soon arrived and stated that he was my friend.
                            Thus God made use of this noble man to do his will. 'And the earth opened her mouth and
                            helped the woman.' "<pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> Elder John Hocknell remai'ked, " I followed
                            closely in the rear of the mob, through the hope of rendering some assistance to Mother Ann.
                            I had not proceeded far when I was seize/1 by several persons and rudely thrown into the
                            vault of a privy. It was with much difficulty that I escaped from this unpleasant place. On
                            obtaining my freedom I went immediately into a bath and then secured a change of garments.
                            In a short time I was again on the road and soon overtook the mob. They had supposed that I
                            should not be seen again and my presence aroused their savage natures, so that they beat and
                            abused me severely, then threw me into a slough." "Although I was in pain and my head and
                            face much bruised and bloody, I prayed to bear it all, with patience. After these inhuman
                            creatures left me, a poor woman came and bound up my head. I took another bath and again
                            changed my garments, and once more went in search of Mother Ann. When I came to the place
                            where she was, the nobleman was reproving and dispersing the mob. Agreeably to his orders I
                            took good care of Mother Ann. We went and obtained some food and then returned home in
                            peace." Other instances of persecution were related by Mother Ann. " Once, " said she, "I
                            hid myself from a mob, in a large quantity of wool that was in the attic of a house. I heard
                            the mob enquire for me, and then threatened to search the place. The man gave them liberty
                            and they came into the loft where I had made my hiding place. I heard them say. She is not
                            here. There is nothing here but wool! 80 they left the house and I went down and rested in
                            peace that night. " L' At one time I was accused of blasphemy. My accusers told me that my
                            tougue must be bored through with a hot iron and that I must be branded on the cheek. " I
                            was then arraigned before the ministers of the church. They wanted me to talk to them as I
                            had talked to others. I told them that they must wait for it was the operation of the spirit
                            of God. After a consultation among themselves they warned the people not to hurt me. A mob,
                            however, is never satisfied and some of them said that the Shakers should be stoned to
                            death." " Father William, Father James, Daniel Whittaker, James Shepard and myself were then
                            led into a valley .to be stoned. Daniel Whittaker receiving a wound on the head, threw the
                            mob into a contention aud through fear of the civil law they soon dispersed. " " While they
                            were throwing the stones I felt myself surrounded by the spirit of God and my soul was
                            filled with love, I knew that they could not kill me because my work upon the earth was not
                            done. " (TO BE CONTINUED.)</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="My brother: On reading from the..." TEIform="index"/>My brother: On reading from the...

                            answer, I know my life to be completely hid in Christ? How many can confidently reply,�that
                            from early dawn to setting<pb n="173" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> sun, my whole service is unselfish, wholly
                            devoted to the support of the principles of truth, with no reserves, no act performed that
                            would not commend me to our Father and Mother in heaven and merit blessing; no word spoken
                            that was idle, unweighed or would condemn me ; no seeking or longing for objects forbidden
                            the genuine follower of Christ or a thought indulged that should on the instant be rejected
                            ; and no motives I would wish to conceal from mortal eye ? Who among this throng is not to
                            be found in the broad way, where but little sacrifice is demanded and self-denial is not the
                            order of its travelers, or by them practised? Who acts the good Samaritan, and who but
                            passes by on the other side to escape duty, the rendering of a service of humility, the
                            making of a sacrifice of pleasure, thus forbidding the indulgence of some animal propensity
                            ; who in their hearts do not truly reject Christ, virtually pierce him and place his life
                            and example too far oft' to be reached, thus consoling and stultifying themselves with the
                            false idea; that Jesus the Savior, the son of man is a portion of Deity, whose life was too
                            exalted for imitation and beyond the reach of the capabilities of man ; that his blood shed
                            on Calvary cleanses every impurity of the heart of those professing his name aud his
                            sacrifices atone for all their errors ? Multitudes profess Christ and are called by his
                            name. Are there not multitudes, far from being pure in heart who flatter themselves they
                            shall see God and reign with Christ, however much they set aside the precepts and example of
                            Jesus and walk in the light of the fires of their owu kindling ; and however positive the
                            declaration that such shall not see God? Little do such regard the spirit of the sermon on
                            the Mount. Virtually they despise the poor iti spirit, the mourner, the meek, him that
                            hungers and thirsts after righteousness, the merciful, the pure in heart and the peacemaker.
                            Such have no just claims to the character of being the light of the world, the salt of the
                            earth. Such dispel the light and become clouds of darkness. Such, if ever salted with the
                            fire of truth, have lost their savor, and through false teaching and ungodly lives by their
                            name and profession of Christianity have become a curse in the earth, unworthy the respect
                            of intelligence or reason, science or religion. Deliver me from all forms, ceremonies and
                            ordinances devoid of the spirit and substance that give to the soul progress and are of a
                            redeeming character. I weary of every shade of sanctity, every name and profession not
                            associated with godliness. Give me the truth that maketh free, or take away the knowledge of
                            a cloak that gives no excuse for sin. Ignorance is preferable to light, unless light is
                            accompanied with that power which looses the bands of wickedness, undoes heavy burdens and
                            lets the oppressed go free. A gospel that breaks not every yoke is not the saving gospel of
                            Christ. Therefore if the means of salvation is not found in obedience to a declaration and
                            testimony, the evidence is clear that souls are not baptized into the spirit and power of
                            the gospel of Christ; and no soul should rest until that revelation is reached. Abraham

                            SABBATH. NANCY ft. DANFORTH. When God made an end of his creation, He "rested for a season ;
                            and not only so, but He hallowed that time, thus making; it holy. After two thousand five
                            Hundred years had passed away, the law was given to the Jews, when the Sabbath was renewed,
                            with many injunctions to keep it holy and sacred, a holy convocation to the Lord, a day of
                            humility or rejoicing wherein they should do no servile work. Whoever violated this law was
                            punished with death. Then was added a week of Sabbaths ; again a whole year was to be kept
                            holy, when all should be released from any bondage wherein they had been made to serve. This
                            was enjoined upon them forever so long as they remained a people. While they were obedient
                            to the commands of God they were abundantly blest and prospered; their enemies were subdued
                            and slain. Indeed, they sometimes had only to "Stand still and see the salvation of God."
                            Thus showing the power of God to be sufficient to save all who trust by yielding strict
                            obedience to the requirements, "Resist not evil," or, in other words, contend not with those
                            who would seek your harm ; but bow submissively and in the spirit of the Lamb them shalt
                            overcome and surely prevail. It was thus with the Jew-* in the days of their prosperity. But
                            when they were carried away captive by their enemies, it was often said, 'wYe have polluted
                            my Sabbaths. " The prophets frequently warned the people to repent of their desecration of
                            the Lord's Sabbath. The ancient Jews were called to be the Lord's people, chosen to do a
                            figurative work. All the laws and many prophecies pointed to the final work of redemption ;
                            therefore we see in this law of the Sabbath, a point of peculiar meaning and interest. The
                            Lord ceased from his work of creation and man is called now in the fullness of time to do
                            the same, as it is written, " He that hath entered into his rest, he also, hath ceased from
                            his own works, as God did from His ; on the Sabbath they were to perform no servile work. In
                            this last great Sabbath we may not pander to servile passions that will bring the soul in
                            bondage to the adversary. The Jews were to keep a great Jubilee ; so may we rejoice in songs
                            of praise, for deliverance from worse than Egyptian bondage. It is the privilege of those
                            who are blest with a knowledge of Christ's second appearing to live free from the baneful
                            influences of sin ; thus to enjoy a perpetual Sabbath of praise and thanksgiving, even in
                            this life. The Jewish Sabbath was a striking figure of this rest from sin. If we would be
                            sons and daughters of God, we must be guided by this law of the Sabbath and cease from "
                            finding our own pleasure, or speaking our own words," that is, not find pleasure in anything
                            save the will of God. When we reject this testimony of true obedience to known law, God will
                            also reject us from being His " peculiar people' even as He did the Jews. Canterbury, N.

BLINN. </byline><p TEIform="p">The above interrogation is frequently made, yet the answer is very simple and easy to be
                            understood. One of the first things to arrange in the mind is the resolution to "live
                            soberly, righteously and godly in this present world." " Cease to do evil and learn to do
                            well. " " That," says the enquirer, "is indeed, veiy simple, and perfectly satisfactory, and
                            pursuing that course you must have a beautiful home." A Christian Community is certainly a
                            beautiful home, and it is more than that; it is a spiritual home. The term home, should
                            never be construed to mean an asylum or simply a home for the needy or destitute. On this
                            account the Shakers should exercise a judicious care and not gather into their families
                            those persons who would become members only in name. To be efficient workers, those who are
                            accepted must be in sympathy with the interests of the Community and be willing to adopt the
                            principles of the order, and maintain the rules and regulations which are for the protection
                            of the Society. It would seem to be quite necessary for a person of mature mind to make
                            careful self-examination, and be assured that he is prepared for the required sacrifice. To
                            forsake the relations and connections that constitute the order of the world, in short, "To
                            crucify the world with all its affections and lusts."' A Community may be and often is
                            imposed upon by the application snd acceptance of those who are not worthy of the privilege.
                            Jesus, our exemplar, has said, "He that cometh to me (in a humble spirit) I will in no wise
                            cast out. " He prepared a wise and beautiful formula which should be learned by those who
                            contemplate entering a religious Community and holding the relation of Brethren and Sisters.
                            They should show, by good works, that they are dependent upon Communi-<pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>
                            ty for the blessings which only a Community can bestow, or in other words, be " humble in
                            spirit." They should be known for their honesty, their selfdenial and their faithful
                            perseverance in the cause of right. Jesus says, '' Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
                            after righteousness." They should be kind and forgiving. A gospel affection should be
                            wrought out for those with whom they live, and nothing cruel or unkind should be manifested
                            toward either man or beast. "Blessed are the merciful." The Eevelator wrote that
                            nothingcould enter the New Jerusalem that was false or that was defiled. This should be
                            borne in mind in the preparation for Christ's kingdom on earth. To be "pure in heart" is an
                            essential condition, and any one entering a religious Community should abandon " all
                            uncleanness and covetousness" and let "neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting be
                            once named among you, as becometh saints. " Eph. v. Unless the spirit of the peacemaker is
                            largely cultivated there could be but sligth hope for harmony in any class ot people that
                            have been gathered from the ranks of the world. The peacemaker embodies the essential
                            element for the prosperity uf the order, and may well be classed among the children of God.
                            The man who wishes to accept the testimony of Jesus Christ should keep these sayings, that
                            he may lay a foundation which neither fire nor flood can destroy. To enter a Community
                            demands a change which should be thoroughly investigated. It is to leave the order of the
                            children of this world and enter an order of united inheritance and of universal love. Some
                            may call t-his a change of heart, and indeed, that is a good term, but we will present it in
                            the words of the Apostle, "Put off the former conversation of the old man which is corrupt,
                            and be renewed in your spirit. Put away lying and speak every man truth with his neighbor.
                            Let him that stole, steal no more. Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth. Let all
                            bitterness and wrath and anger an:! clamor and evil speaking be put away from you. Be kind
                            to one another, forgiving one another." Eph. iv ; 22-32. Those who are not prepared to
                            accept this discipline of the Apostle, have not yet counted the cost of a Christian life.
                            Persons may grow weary of the fruits of a life of unrighteousness and wish to escape to some
                            spiritual retreat, anticipating a great deal of happiness on their' own part, without
                            deliberating carefully the essential sacrifice which they must make in order to secure the
                            privilege. Communities for their own prosperity and individual peace must be surrounded by a
                            system of rules and regulations that will cover all their interests. These must be
                            religiously maintained by every member as the success of the order depends largely upon
                            their careful observance. A great many people drift along from year to year without taking
                            serious thought of the imperative duties of life, and from a multitude of cauees look toward
                            a Community for a home. Some may be led by high spiritual attractions, desiring a nearer
                            walk with God, wrhile others with sinister motives may expect that Society will patiently
                            bear all their burdens. Biblical history informs us that a class of people went out seeking
                            for Je-<pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> sus, that were not especially awakened by his gospel
                            testimony. Jesus spoke to them as we might speak to many who call upon us. " Ye seek me, not
                            because ye saw the signs, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." It is very
                            true we should not refuse to entertain an industrious, honest, poor man, while we might an
                            unprincipled rich man. Whatever may be the inducements for a man to enter a Christian
                            Community, he should have this fact thoroughly impressed upon the mind. That he enters the
                            order as a pupil and not as a teacker. He comes to receive the gift of the Community in
                            obedience to the cross of Christ, and to leave behind him "the lust of the flesh, the lust
                            of the eye and the pride of life. " If he really means to renounce the world with all its
                            allurements and sins, he will not endeavor to see how many he can carry along with him. Let
                            him seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness. Make an honest confession of his
                            sins, settle his just debts, cancel all lawful obligations and after having done this he may
                            be able to speak with the Apostle. "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for I know it

                            most dangerous to the religious and spiritual life. The first article in the Agnostic's
                            creed affirms the existence of an Eternal Energy from which all things proceed but it dares
                            not to call it God. The second. All things occur according to law. The creed seems to be the
                            invention of Prof. T. H. Huxley of England. Whatever he intended by its introduction I know
                            not, but as it is used by his adherents and followers, it seems to be involved in a
                            contradiction�It is made to mean both to know and not to know that is I know and don't know

                            promise to a future bettering ; and what does such existence mean? A weeping birth, a
                            smitten child, a wayward youth, oppressed man, afflicted and sorrowing woman, a mourning
                            death, and all is over ! The sect is now publishing an Annual in defense of their doctrine,
                            in which Huxley, the high Priest thus defines it, "Agnosticism is of the essence of Science.
                            It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no
                            scientific grounds for professing to know or believe," thus placing all knowledge on
                            intellectual ground, ignoring God and everything Spiritual. He continues:�"I have no doubt
                            that scientific criticism will prove destructive to the forms of supernaturalsm which enter
                            into the Constitution of existing religious"�This will certainly prove<pb n="178" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>
                            true with all religions that base any part of their structure on Science which belongs not
                            to the Spiritual but to the Material and intellectual plane of life� But continues the
                            Priest�'' There may be things not only in the heavens, but beyond the intelligible universe
                            which are n�t dreamed of in our philosophy. " There may be but I am Agnostic, that is, I
                            know I don't know it thus contradictory stands the high priest himself; because he knows it
                            not, he will not believe any other person knows it being spiritually blind himself he cannot
                            believe any other person can see, " though a man declare it unto him "�Thus the Agnostic
                            makes himself easy aDd dozes and dreams his life away�He feels composed and smiles at our
                            ignorance in believing in spiritual realities that have no existence�Such ones pity our
                            weakness and would gladly help us on to Scientific ground, all this while they acknowledge
                            they have nothing to look to or rest on but nature, themselves being the top round. So at
                            last they rest on themselves, a forlorn hope, a broken stick, knowing if they know anything,
                            that they must soon perish and pass away as forest leaves :�All this confusion of thought,
                            thij incoherency and blindness come from the fact that they are materialists and that
                            spiritual things are incognizable by the intellect; if they were, animals could see
                            spiritual things ; but they cannot as " spiritual things are spiritually discerned, " not
                            intellectually. Such ones may behold persons engaged in worship and smile at their folly and
                            pity their weakness, without knowing what they are smiling at when the weakness, ignorance
                            and folly are with themselves though admitting there may be a power above to whom we should
                            pay homage. Such a thing may be possible as a future existence, and there may be such a
                            thing as a future accountability to the power that caused our existence here but we don't
                            know it say they, and there may be such a thing as future rewards and punishments, but no
                            one knows it and all such are spiritually dead while they live and I would say with the
                            Apostle : '' Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ will give thee
                            light. " Believe and obey, then ye shall know. '' The blind shall see and the dead be made
                            alive." Here the Agnostic will say, how am I to know this? To which I would answer, by a
                            change of base. I have shown yours to be untenable, looking and depending on something
                            inferior to yourselves, you being an effect look to the cause of your being in prayer and
                            supplication, then deliverance will come, then you can unite in the worship of that Power,
                            not mechanically merely but in spirit and in truth being quickened into spiritual life.
                            Christ does not promise by the aid of Science to quicken the intellectual man, but to
                            quicken the spiritual man, when this is done we are new creatures '' old things will have
                            passed away, all things become new and all things of God.

                            therefore a faith that saves must be a living principle, producing works, or fruits, whereby
                            its quality is known. Hence, those who receive the faith of God in Christ, which teaches<pb n="179" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> among other things that every one will be rewarded for their works,
                            good or evil, according to the strict rules of justice, work out for themselves the
                            character of Sons and Daughters of God, by ceasing from their own wills that they may do the
                            will of God, and manifest His righteousness in their conduct, by the fruits of a righteous
                            faith. '�' Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. " The belief of one who
                            sins, and trusts to be saved by the merits of another, from meeting its consequences, is
                            equally manifest by works. He professes to believe and follow Christ who knew no sin, but
                            really believes he cannot live without sin, which in one sense is a fact, because his life
                            is in those works which Christ requires his subjects to hate and forsake�and should he
                            utterly renounce and forsake them all, he would certainly die to all carnal pleasure, as did
                            Jesus, and rise with Mm in the resurrection of life eternal. But,' "Why call ye me Lord !
                            Lord ! and do not the things that I say?" "He that committeth sin is the servant of sin, "
                            and "no man can serve two masters, for either he will love the one and hate the other, or
                            else he will cleave to the one and despise the other. " It is evident from the writings of
                            the Apostles, that those who honestly obeyed Christ's doctrine from the heart, received
                            power over sin. But those who, under a profession of following Moses cleaved to sin,
                            despised God's messengers of their own time, of whom Moses testified. And so loving sin,
                            they were blinded and led by it, for which cause, they hated and persecuted unto death those
                            messengers of Truth, who endeavored to persuade them to cease from sin, that they might not
                            reap its wages. Consequently their "green tree" ceased ;o bear fruit to God, and became "
                            the dry tree, " and their house was left unto them " desolate " of any saving grace or
                            virtue. Hence, after all the good grain that was among them was harvested by the messengers
                            of Christ, the protecting power of God was withdrawn, and " the flood" of clashing and
                            destructive elements which sin ever generates, consumed and swept them out of the way. And
                            just so surely as history repeats itself through the operation of interior causes, may all
                            ecclesiastical organizations claiming the name of Christianity that make provision for the
                            works of natural generation, and the gratification of the corrupt propensities of fallen
                            nature, read the decree of their destiny in Revelations, xviii. For all systems that are
                            built upon hearing the sayings of Christ, and doing them not, are likened to a house that
                            was built upon the sand. And when the rains of heavenly righteousness descended, and the
                            floods of light and truth came and beat against that house, it fell, and great was the fall
                            of it, because it was founded upon the sand. Such are a-11 the buildings erected, (not by
                            God) but by men who profess to follow Christ with their lips, but deny him in works, and
                            thus dishonor his name. Of whom Christ said "Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
                            have we not prophesied in thy name ? And in thy name have cast out demons ? And in thy name
                            done many wonderful works? " And then will I profess unto them I never knew you, depart from
                            me ye that work iniquity. " Repent! Repent ! for that day is revealed which shall try every
                            man's work. O that all men would hearken and<pb n="180" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>obey the silent monitor
                            conscience, cease to do evil and learn to do well, that they may receive and know the voice
                            of God in His messengers, in their own age and time ; and commence the practice of those
                            works that belong to their everlasting peace and to lay up an interest and substance in
                            eternity ; which begins here, in all who obey the law of eternal life revealed in Christ.

NO. 2.</head><p TEIform="p"> In about a month I made another visit, and carried my wife with me. By this time the enmity
                            of the wicked began to show itself. The children ran out of the houses, hallowing, Shakers,
                            Shakers, and mocking us as we passed along the road. At this time my wife confessed her
                            sins, and set out with me in this self-denying way. I found the testimony had greatly
                            increased since my last visit. The word of God in Mother and the Elders, was swift
                            and'powerful beyoud expression. It was like a twoedged sword against all sin and all manner
                            of uncleauuess. Many people continually resorted there to hear the word of God and learn the
                            way of salvation ; and many confessed their sins and set out to take up their crosses.
                            Mother Ann's testimony was like flames of fire to search out and bring to light the hidden
                            works of darkness. She exposed with keen and cutting severity the deceitful craftiness of
                            men and women, showing that all these practices proceeded from the nature of lust, the seed
                            of the serpent; that it produced self-defilement, deceit, hypocrisy and all manner of evil
                            communication, which tended to corrupt the mind, to darken and defile the senses, and sink
                            the soul into the filthiness of the flesh and separate it from God. Her testimony was the
                            most mortifying to a carnal nature that can possibly be imagined. Never since the world
                            began, was the nature of lust so powerfully and so effectually exposed. Yet the tenderness
                            and charity of Mother and the Elders toward poor. souls who were lost in the flesh, and
                            honestly desired to find the way out, was as boundless as their severity against sin. While
                            I was there four high minded and foppish young men came on a Sabbath morning, and rode to
                            the house and hailed it, and said, "We understand that there arc those here who have the
                            spirit of discernment, and can tell people their sins ; and we want to have ours told. "
                            Mother and Elder William went out and invited them into the house ;�they refused to come in,
                            but insisted upon having their sins told. Instantly the power of God fell upon Elder
                            William, and he exposed their sins to them with such plainness and such power, that they
                            hung their heads, and were ashamed even to look each other in the face, and mounted their
                            horses and made off as fast as possible. Great numbers of people came from various parts to
                            see them, whom they fed and lodged freely, without manifesting any lack of any thing. They
                            would often meet the Brethren and Sisters, at the door, when they came, saying, " Come in
                            Brethren and Sisters, come in ; we have but little room in our house; but we have a great
                            deal of room in our hearts. " It was clearly evident that they felt willing to give up all
                            their earthly substance, yea, and<pb n="181" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> their own lives also, for the sake
                            of planting the gospel in this land. This I felt as sensibly as I could feel one hand from
                            the other. They spared not even their own lives, but gave them freely. They were accounted
                            poor, having nothing but what tkey gained by their honest industry ; though they had taken
                            up a lot of land which they held by lease in perpetuity from Stephen Van Rensselaer, Esq.
                            yet it was in a wilderness state when they took it. By their industry they cleared some part
                            of it, so as to accommodate themselves and their little family with some pasture and tillage
                            laud. It appeared evident, however, that they could not devote what little they had to feed
                            so many people as were continually visiting them, without suffering materially themselves. I
                            returned home, and the Brethren in New Lebanon, taking these things into consideration,
                            agreed to send something for their relief. Accordingly we collected nine sheep to send them,
                            and David Darrow undertook to drive them to Watervliet: and having proceeded within about
                            eight miles of Albany, he was pursued by some evil minded men from New Lebanon, who robbed
                            him of the sheep, and seized his person under pretence of treasonable conduct. rJ hough the
                            malicious conduct of these men evidently proceeded from a spirit of enmity against this new
                            religion�the testimony of the gospel which had then just been received and embraced by so
                            many people in New Lebanon ; yet the pretence for these rash proceedings was as follows: it
                            had been reported that Mother Ann had come over in Burgoyne's army, and engaged in plotting
                            against the liberty of the country. Many who opposed the testimony and rejected the cross of
                            Christ, were willing to believe these reports, and were ready to assist in any means to
                            overthrow the leaders of the work, and suppress the testimony. Hence, these enemies of the
                            cross, having received information seized this occasion to vent their malignity by charging
                            with a design of conveying his sheep to the enemy. The event showed the real object of these
                            malicious persecutors. David Darrow, after being robbed of his sheep, was required to give
                            bail for his appearance at Albany for trial. At the time appointed, he appeared before the
                            commissioners in Albany, in company with Joseph Meacham and John Hockuell. They were all
                            three committed to prison without any trial. A few days after this, Mother and the Elders
                            were taken from their own dwelling and conducted to prison also, without any trial. Such
                            were the measures taken by their enemies to suppress the work of God, and prevent the spread
                            of the gospel. But the measures taken to destroy the testimony of Mother and the Elders,
                            instead of producing that effect, was the very means of extending its power and increasing
                            the number of Believers. The prisoners, conscious of their own innocence, and filled with
                            the power and gifts of God, sung and praised God in the prison, that they were counted
                            worthy to suffer persecution for righteousness' sake. This gave offence, and was the
                            occasion of their being removed from the jail in the old City Hall, to the prison in the old
                            fort on the hill. There they were visited by many people, who heard the testimony and
                            confessed their sins in this prison. I visited the Elders while they were in prison. The
                            mighty power of God<pb n="182" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> which attended their singing was so extraordinary,
                            that it really seemed to me as if the very foundation of the prison trembled. After they
                            were released, I visited them frequently, at different places�at Watervliet, Harvard,
                            Ashfield, Hancock and New Lebanon, and found a continual increase of the power of God. In
                            all the many privileges I had with them, I never saw the least fault in them, neither in
                            word nor deed. They were like angels in my view, being continually filled with the gifts aud
                            power of God, and striving, with great fervency of spirit, to help souls to God, that they
                            might have the law of Christ written in their inward parts, and be able to keep the gospel
                            when they should be left without their present help. Hence they labored in. sorrow and
                            sufferings, and spared no pains to plant and establish the gospel in this land. I visited
                            Mother just before she left this world. She counselled me to be faithful and keep the way of
                            God. She spoke in the spirit of prophecy and said, "The time will come when the Church will
                            be gathered into order, and then it will be known who are good Believers. But that is not my
                            work ; my work is nearly done. " I then took my leave of her. I never saw any thing in her
                            but godliness, from the first day to the time she left this world. I know by the spirit of
                            God that dwelleth in me, that she is the Lord's anointed�"the Bride, the Lamb's wife�in whom
                            is no guile. " In persecution she suffered exceedingly, and with great patience. In sorrow
                            she exceeded any one I ever saw. Many times have I seen her on her knees, in tears, crying
                            to God with such cries as I never before heard from any mortal. The energy of her spirit was
                            so great, that it seemed enough to break the hardest heart and melt it into tears. Such was
                            her labor and tribulation to plant and maintain the gospel. At other times she was filled
                            with great joy, and would fill a whole assembly with this gift in a few minutes. Even the
                            heavenly joy that seemed to shine in her countenance, was sufficient to cheer the heart of
                            every beholder. Mother and the Elders never spared any pains in teaching the Believers in
                            every good work. They often told us that if we would be faithful, we would be " blessed in
                            our outgoings and our incomings, in our basket, and in our store," both in things temporal
                            and spiritual. These promises we have found verily fulfilled, even beyond all our
                            expectations. Elder James Whittaker, who succeeded Mother in the Ministry, was boundless in
                            charity, as well as Mother and Elder William. He was very faithful in building up what
                            Mother had planted ; in purging out evil, in supporting and encouraging the feeble, in
                            strengthening the weak, and in preparing the people for that order in a church relation
                            which was at hand. He often warned us to keep the testimony we had received from Mother,
                            pure and unspotted. He would often say, "We have given you the gospel;�see to it that you
                            keep it, and make a good use of it." He was a bright example of love and kindness, meekness
                            and innocence : he was indeed like an angel before the people. Sometimes he would exclaim, "
                            O, the glory of Zion ! When you see Zion nourish and bring forth fruit, then know ye that
                            the root is holy." This might be sufficient evidence to the world, if they had no other.
                                The<pb n="183" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> evident prosperity of this Society, both in things spiritual
                            and temporal, is enough to show that it is not built on a false foundation. Every malicious
                            slander, that is published and circulated against the Society is without a cause. Now I
                            would ask the candid reader, what more striking evidence can we have to prove that Mother
                            Ann was really anointed of God to usher in the latter day of glory, and bring in the kingdom
                            of righteousness and peace, and make an end of sin, than the abusive slanders and calumnies
                            that are poured out against her and her faithful followers? For Jesus Christ said, " If they
                            call the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more them of his household ?" He was called
                            " a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners, " and all manner of evil was spoken
                            against him falsely. This was, and still is considered as an evidence that he was not of the
                            world, and therefore the world hated him. Mother Ann was slandered by those who delight in
                            slander�by those who delight to feast on the iniquities of the righteous, and who hunt for
                            iniquity in the followers of Christ, as the raven and the vulture seek after the dead
                            carcasses of those who fall in battle. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                instructed them how to use their gospel light. Whatever they may have been before this
                                date, they were now exhorted to let their light shine before all men. These disciples,
                                in all probability, even in their new calling, manifested no great anxiety to have their
                                order of life either seen or known. Possibly they preferred to take their nets and still
                                follow their occupation of fishing. At the same time they were anxious to be the
                                disciples of so good a Teacher, who held forth the promise of an hundred fold reward in
                                this world, and with this the assurance of eternal life. Poor people are always
                                interested in the multiplication of the treasures of this world, and the sudden
                                accumulation of an hundred fold, must have seemed very inviting to their unspiritual
                                minds. It was a gospel preached to the poor, and by them it was received into thankful
                                hearts. They had not learned that by accepting the words of Jesus, they were to become
                                evangelists and preachers of the word of God ; but having given to them th�' light that
                                came down from heaven, he was anxious that they should use it. It had raised them from
                                an earthly order into a better element, and was well calculated to remould their lives,
                                and to make them men of God. " Let your light so shine," said he, " that others may see
                                your good works. ". The presentation of bad works had been sufficiently prominent to be
                                a characteristic feature among men and hence the demand for a radical change. It was to
                                be manifested in their lives, rather than in their words. Any Pharisee could boast of
                                his good works, in fasting twice each week, and in giving liberally to the poor, but the
                                exhibition of a practical righteousness was what the Pharisee had never learned. To
                                impress the importance of this new life more clearly upon the minds of the disciples,
                                Jesus brought forward this simple illustration. " No man when he hath lighted a candle,
                                putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they
                                which come in may see the light." Luke, viii., 83. The light was to be an object of
                                attraction, people wanted to see it; to ascertain if it was better than what they were
                                using. They would make inquiries about it, to learn to whom it belonged and from whom it
                                was obtained. Jesus would impress their minds with the fact that this light was the
                                gospel testimony and that it was intended for the salvation of the family of man, THE
                                    TERMS.<pb n="185" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> They mast use it tor the good of others, as they had
                                received it,�Freely, liberally and charitably. A miserly use of gospel treasures is
                                equally as inconsistent as a miserly use of the blessings that fall to our lot in this
                                world. It is not giving as God gives. It is not seeking diligently to find that which
                                has gqne astray, that it may be brought home to God. The followers of Christ to be
                                consistent with their own doctrine must have respect to the manifestations of his
                                spiritual life. And this life was righteousness as measured by the testimony which he
                                gave, as one test of discipleship ;�"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
                                ye even so to them." A few such vital evidences of Christian fellowship which become in
                                the soul like "awell of water springing up into everlasting life," stands far in advance
                                of any churchal system of forms and ceremonies that men may have devised.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="biography" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Reminiscenses of my Shaker childhood" TEIform="index"/> REMINISCENSES OF MY SHAKER CHILDHOOD.</head><p TEIform="p"> SUMMER. "How dear to my heart are the scenes of rny childhood When fond recollection
                            presents them to view." Mont than twenty five years have elapsed since I dwelt among the
                            scenes of childhood which I shall now recall with such success as will hereafter appear.
                            Childhood is with the majority of little folks the joyous season of life and Summer is the
                            very time of delight for most children everywhere,�but in no place is it more thoroughly
                            enjoyed than among those modest 'people termed Shakers, or it was thus in my experience and
                            I presume it is the same with the children of to-day. First then among all pleasant memories
                            I shall place our school time, where every day rain or shine we scholars wended our way to
                            the little temple of learning. The path from our dwelling thereto, lay through high roadside
                            grass, nodding buttercups and daisies, which was often rendered especially gay, with the
                            music of the bobolinks that seemed to revel in the fragrant hay fields bordering the road on
                            either side. Never, since then have I seen the Sun shine as brightly, or felt the breath of
                            the meadows as balmy, nor have I ever listened to a bobolink since, though I have often
                            longed for its song inexpressibly. I remember, that years after, when recovering from a
                            severe illness on being asked, what I most wanted I replied most earnestly ; " To hear a
                            Shaker Bobolink sing. " It really seemed to me that its song would restore me at once. The
                            Summer School was my esppcial de~ light and my daily reward or penalty then was the
                            approving smile or the rebuking ftown of the Teacher, and in fact, I sought only the former
                            and dreaded only the latter in those thoughtless days. The lessons we learned, the songs we
                            sang, the recitations, dialogues, &amp;c, in which I took part come back at my bidding
                            now, seemingly like a cluster of precious memories, as also does the gentle tones of a voice
                            long since silent on earth. To vary our exercises, our Teacher often selected appropriate
                            dialogues from our School Readers for us to commit to memory and personate as well as we
                            could, thinking thereby that a little exercise of muscle as well as of brain, would promote
                            the health of both. One scene from the ancient drama of Pizarro and Gomez (by Kotzebue)
                            interested me exceedingly for my part was to play sentinel and guard the unfortunate
                            Peruvian Alonzo. Of course I tried to manifest great authority as I passed up and down the
                            entry door guarding the imaginary captive. I dare say my classmates have not yet forgotten
                            how they pleaded in Rolla's behalf,�but how long ago it all seems! So easy was it then to
                            learn, so delightful to excel others too. When vacation came we went to gather berries of
                            all kinds, and then it was that we were overjoyed to find that we were to belong to the
                            favored berrying party. On a little range of low hills West of the<pb n="186" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/>
                            Village we frequently spent the live-long day in plucking the juicy wild fruit, reaching
                            home at early twilight, weary 'tis true, but happy and 0 so hungry ! How often I have looked
                            from these hill tops to the lofty majestic old Kearsarge as it seemed to lean against the
                            western sky, purpling in the oncoming darkness, or hiding its summit in a crown of fleecy
                            clouds! Ah, those were useful happy days made hright with youth and hope and thus laying up
                            in memory's storehouse a wealth of pleasant recollections, which the hand of Time only
                            serves to endear as it turns our youth to middle age;� " Aud now far removed from the loved
                            situation The tears of regret will intrusively swell." The crowning event of the whole year
                            however was the scholars annual ride, so long anticipated, so heartily enjoyed. Who of us
                            can forget the anxious suspense in which we waited for the dawn of that auspicious day?�the
                            hurried breakfast, the joyful starting, the glorious sunrise and the endless conjecture as
                            to our destination?�for that was generally kept as a surprise, and 0 how we would sing as
                            blithely as the birds or chatter like squirrels and anon gaze in raptured silence at the
                            ever changing scenery as we sped along. The road-side lunch under the spreading trees, the
                            refreshing drink from the gushing spring, these combined, help to render the day so
                            enjoyable, as never to be forgotten. The year that we went to Weir's Landing and took
                            Steamer bound tor Centre Harbor was memorable indeed for it was then we felt we were
                            travellers in a special sense. The modest Steamer to our unaccustomed gaze was a splendid

                            and bright and free ; It sparkles on the green hill-side; In yonder meadow see it glide.
                            I'll take my little cup and dip, And of the good, cold water sip, And when I am a woman

TEIform="persName"/> LIZZIE C. FISH.</byline><p TEIform="p"> We cannot understand how an intelligent person can remain in doubt as regards the importance
                            of this fundamental principle of the Shaker church, when so many examples are to be found in
                            Biblical History, showing that about three thousand years" ago it was considered the only
                            "Door of Hope, "for salvation. We read that wise old Solomon declared; "He that covereth his
                            sins shall not prosper,(spiritually,) but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
                            mercy, (forgiveness of God.) Prov. xxviii., 13. This confession was not to be made secretly
                            or alone to God as a great many are willing to believe; as an offering after this form,
                            brings nothing to light, and to hide from the presence of God, even the remotest thought
                            would be impossible. We can only cover our sins from God's human agents, it is before these
                            witnesses alone that the confession must be made, if we wish to obtain that forgiveness and
                            power, which prompts us "to go and sin no more. " We know quite well that the selfish
                            individual who will make an honest confession h efore a witness, human, like himself, will
                            deal a death blow to the selfishness that rules the heart, and will experience a joy and
                            confidence which no other sacrifice gives, also that love and forbearance of a heavenly
                            Parentage, which surpasseth all other loves. Was there no Scriptural evidence to declare the
                            necessity of this principle, we are very sure a Shaker church could not exist successfully
                            without recognizing confession of sin as one of its essential basic principles. It surely
                            could not be the perfect church, spoken of by the Apostle as the " glorious church without
                            spot or wrinkle, " for there would be no repentance unto salvation. We know from our own
                            experience that, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
                            and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. John, i., 7. Canterbury, N.

                                " leader " a biographical and phrenological sketch of Prof. James B. Richards, M. A. The
                                portrait is of unusual excellence and the character sketch must take rank as one of the
                                best of Prof. Sizer's instructive contributions to the fast-growing literature which
                                looks to the general weal of mankind. The sketch is at once a study of causes and their
                                eft'ects; a eulogy on the greatest of greatness, practical humanitarianism; a tribute of
                                affection to a dearly beloved friend and co-worker. It is especially interesting to
                                thoughtful parents and progressive teachers. The reader's sympathizes are at once
                                enlisted with the work to which Prof. Richards was so fully wedded, and in which he
                                attained such remarkable success. Who is worthy to wear " the royal mantle which he has
                                let fall? " Is it a fact that " Familiar Talks about Phrenology for Young People " grow
                                in interest, or is it because the reader is being coaxed into the editor's way of
                                thinking, that each installment seems better than the last? "Dublin, Ireland," is finely
                                illustrated. "Latter Day Pilgrimages to Mecca," "The Use of Phrenology in Business, " "
                                Some Floral Gossip, " are brief yet condensed information. " People of an Old
                                Massachusetts Town " is written by one who knows whereof she writes, and the sweet face
                                of Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor Ames, that illustrates it will delight the reader of the
                                article. Every young girl should read " Whose Fault? " " Asthma " may bring consolation
                                to many sufferers. " Water Treatment in Typhoid Fever. " is timely as well as sensible.
                                " Notes on Science and Industry" is brimiul of good things. Editorially this number of
                                the Joubnal is up to high-water mark. The " Correspondents " are numerous and the
                                questions asked and answered are always of general interest. $2.00 per year; 20c, per
