BUISNESS TACT 4ED OPPORTUNITY.
A stbbak of pure, good luck in business, or the
sudden achievement of success and wealth by a
happy hit is rare, but there are many luck}' and
prosperous folks who are so because they watch
their opportunities and make the best of them.
Mr. Koehler, of Rochester, N. Y., tried his hand at
canvassing for "Plain Home Talk," and made four
dollars in the first two hours. Mr. Sandford, of Maine,
took forty three orders from forty seven persons to
whom he showed the book. Mr. Taylor, in Cleveland, took nineteen orders in one day. Why do
smart, capable men, complain of hard times and
"nothing to do" when equal opportunities are open
to them ? They have only to call for circulars, prospectus and terms of the Murray Hill Pub. Co., 129

                            I do, shall he do also, and greater." What is the baptism of Christ ? It is a baptism of the
                            Holy Spirit and sufferings which attend bearing the "Cross of Christ, whereby his followers
                            are crucified to the world and the world to them." In Christ, there "is one faith, one Lord,
                            and one baptism. " John testified, "I indeed baptize you with water, but he that cometh
                            after me, shall baptize with the Holy Spirit, and with fire." John was not a Christian in
                            the sense of being a follower of Jesus. The least in the kingdom of heaven was greater thau
                            he, because he was not in the kingdom, and he never entered it while in the body. An Apostle
                            tells us, "Jesus baptized not" with water, "but his disciples did," while they were not yet
                            baptized with Christ's baptism, and had many things to learn. Jesus was baptized with the
                            Holy Spirit and something was added to his life when he came up out of the water at the
                            baptism of John. After his occultation and reappearance to his disciples, he said to them,
                            "John baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit in not many days."
                            Acts i., 5. The Holy Spirit illuminates the understanding. It was the spirit of Truth, the
                            Mentor that led and instructed them as a mother does her offspring. It brought their
                            previous knowledge of, and talks with Jesus to mind as occasion required, and enabled them
                            to perceive spiritual meanings previously hid, as appears in their testimony, and sudden
                            change in attitude toward their persecutors and the world. But that was not the completeness
                            of Christ's baptism, which removes all sin and conflicting desires. Does water baptism wash
                            awray sins ? Is it more than of a type of spiritual cleansing, and sign of submission to the
                            society which requires it? If not, it cannot be the essential baptism to a Christian life. A
                            type cannot be the substance which it only figuratively represents, and all contention about
                            the form in which' it is administered, what is it but contending over a shadow, while the
                            substance is lost or evaded. Only the waters of spiritual life, can wash away sins, and only
                            the fire of the daily cross and Divine life, can take the nature of sin away from the heart.
                            "The day is revealed by fire, and fire shall try every one's work." "He is<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> like a refiner's fire." "He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. He
                            shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto
                            the Lord an offering in righteousness." The sous of Levi were the appointed ministers of
                            Jehovah, and teachers of the people. ''Our God is a consuming fire" to whatever is contrary
                            to the spirit of holiness. How great the transformation needed, from death in Adam to life
                            in Christ, before as sons and daughters of his love, earth's children are created anew in
                            his likeness. Jesus said, "I came to throw fire on earth, and how I wish it were already
                            kindled." The baptism of fire is a baptism of suffering, and is alike for all. When James
                            and John petitioned to sit, one at the right, and the other at the left of Jesus in his
                            kingdom, Jesus asked "Are you able to drink of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that
                            I am baptized with?" Again he said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I
                            straitened (lit. pressed) till it be accomplished." Neither of these expressions referred to
                            water baptism which had occurred long before. The baptism of fire began with the cross which
                            he bore from the period of the descent of the Holy Spirit, until upon the last instrument of
                            mortal hate and torture, he pronounced, "It is finished," and breathed out his spirit. " Are
                            you ignorant that as many as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death? We were
                            buried together with him through baptism into death, that as Christ was raised from the dead
                            through the glory of the Father, thus we also should walk in newness of life." Rom. vi., 4.
                            The last sentence dL&gt;closes the character of the death referred to : viz. death 10 all that
                            is opposed in us to the new life. "For he who died, died once to sin, but he who lives,
                            lives to Goa." "He whs obedient till death of the cross." "For though he was a son, yet
                            learned he obedience by the things which he suffered." He died to deatli, and to its cause,
                            that death should no longer hold sway over him, "Who has left us an example that we should
                            walk in his steps." Hence it is evident that the real Christian baptism both illuminates the
                            understanding, and brings death to sin and sinful desires�to the old man�to "The carnal
                            mind, which is enmity against God"�to that mystery of lawlessness, "which is not subject to
                            the law of God, neither indeed can it be"� to "the man of sin," in whom every sinner holds
                            partnership. And though one may be partly enlightened by a holy spirit, and become a learner
                            for a season before receiving this baptism, as in the case of the first disciples, we
                            believe nought else than this can make one a Christian of the pattern of Jesus Christ. Nor
                            can anything short of this, destroy the life of sin, so that the new and resurrection life
                            can be possessed in lieu thereof. "Who is sufficient for these things?" All they who will
                            bear the cross of Christ until it is worn out. They will know by experience the death of the
                            cross, and the life of the true resurrection. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Love for the youth" TEIform="index"/>LOVE FOR THE YOUTH.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Whitcher, Mary" TEIform="persName"/>Mary Whitcher.</byline><p TEIform="p">We love the youth Who love the truth And work for Zion's home,<pb n="195" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> And we

                            theories as there are different sects; and the believers in each, claim theirs as the ouly
                            rule and guide of action, by the observance of which, they can find their justification and
                            acceptance with God, and at last, admission into heaven. Among all these varied and
                            oftentimes conflicting theories on a question of such supreme importance to the whole human
                            race, the query would naturally force itself on every reflecting mind, which is the right
                            way ? All cannot be right; each way cannot be the one only way to heaven, for Christ was not
                            divided, neither will his true followers be divided in their faith and principles. We read
                            in the scriptures, " There shall be one Lord, one faith, and one baptism." "Pure and
                            undented religion is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
                            ourselves unspotted from the world." Here is a religion which is practical in all its
                            bearings, and embodies the sum total of our duty to God and man. To be kind, charitable, and
                            merciful to all with whom we have any dealings, and to keep our spirits free from the
                            contaminating influences of worldly elements and principles, would also imply a complete
                            consecration to God, of all our faculties e .A possessions. There is no religion worthy of
                            the name which is not actualized in every-day life, in thought, word and deed. That which is
                            only assumed on the Sabbath, is not a religiou, but a cloak to cover up the sins of the
                            week. There is one criterion by which we can judge unerringly whether we are the true
                            disciples of Christ or not. ''If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
                            whether it be of God." John, vii., 17. If that is the rulingmotive in the heart, to do the
                            will of God ; and we conscientiously live up to the highest light that shines into the soul;
                            regardless where that light may lead us ; carefully taking up the crosses that may lie in
                            our pathway ; patiently bearing whatever trials or tribulation we may be called to pass
                            through ; counting all things but los&gt;s for the excellency of the knowledge of the will of
                            God ; we shall be assured beyond the possibility of a doubt, that we have found the one only
                            straight and narrow way which leads to the summit of full and final redemption from
                            sin�eternal life. As a believer in the practical Christian life, I have proved it by the
                            experience of more than a quarter of a century, to be the power of God unto salvation,
                            inasmuch as I have lived it out. I know that in the end it will give me complete victory
                            over the very nature of sin, if I continue to square my life by the life of my Savior,
                            taking him as my pattern and guide, bearing the cross which he bore, and living his life of
                            purity and love. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Govern your thoughts" TEIform="index"/>Govern your thoughts

                            by which mam I received impressions of mind concerning a future state of rewards and
                            punishments at a very early age. Hence I became greatly concerned lest I should not be of
                            that chosen number who would be happy after death. The thought of being forever miserable
                            after death, often made such a deep impression on my feelings, that I would endeavor to gain
                            the favor of God by confessing my sins in secret, one by one, and pray that they might be
                            forgiven. Thus I went on, sometimes praying and crying for mercy, at other times sinning,
                            until I arrived at the age of fourteen, which was in the year 1779. At this time there was a
                            remarkable awakening among the people in New Lebanon and the adjacent towns. This work was
                            attended with such mighty power of God, that I have seen rugged, stout-hearted young men,
                            who came merely as spectators, fall like men wounded in battle, and screaming so that they
                            might be heard at a great distance. I was much exercised in mind, and greatly desirous to
                            find something that I could depend on for salvation ; for the testimony of this revival was,
                            that Christ was about to make his second appearance. After the visible operations of the
                            power of God had mostly ceased, myself and a number of others were baptized and called
                            Christians of the Baptist church. But I did not feel satisfied in my mind with regard to the
                            state and situation of my soul. lu the spring of the following year, (1780,) there was a
                            report in circulation concerning a singular people who lived above Albany. Some people from
                            our neighborhood went to see them, and received a measure of faith in their testimony,
                            believing they were the people of God and the true followers of Christ. About the middle of
                            June, I went also to see them, and found them kind and hospitable. Their testimony was plain
                            and pointed against all manner of unrighteousness. They appeared to me like heaven-born
                            souls. Their worship was attended with operations of Divine Power, and their songs were
                            melodious and heavenly. They did not appear to belong to the gross inhabitants of this
                            earth. Thidr singing, seemed to reach the very heavens. Their testimony completely destroyed
                            that deeeptious covering of false religion by which Antichrist had endeavored to persuade me
                            that I was born again. I sensibly felt the inconsistency of pretending to be born of the
                            Spirit, while living in the gratification of the desires of the flesh and of the mind. In
                            obedience to their doctrine, I confessed my sins to God in the presence of the Elders ; and
                            by them I was taught obedience to my parents, and faithfulness in all things ; and their
                            instructions felt to me like the word of God. By continuing in obedience, I have proved it
                            to be the word of God in very deed : for by it I obtained the power of salvation from sin.
                            Hence I know of a certainty that the testimony which I received from these parents in the
                            gaspel, is the power of God unto salvation, and must of necessity come from God through
                            their ministration. Their doctrine is, indeed, crossing to the elements of an evil nature in
                            every soul that receives it; which is a further<pb n="197" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> proof that it proceeds
                            not from an evil source, but from the source of all goodness. And the effect it produces in
                            every faithful soul, is a full confirmation that it is the true doctrine of Christ ; because
                            it makes such souls the real heirs and possessors of those blessings which he promised to
                            his faithful followers. It makes them poor in spirit; it makes them hunger and thirst after
                            righteousness; it makes them peacemakers. It also saves them from the corruptions of the
                            flesh through lust; from evil surmising and jealousy ; from envying and strife; from hatred
                            and malice ; from evil-speukiug and all intemperate language ; from intempemnce in eating
                            and drinking ; and from every thing which is contrary to the law of Christ. The gospel of
                            Christ which we have received from Mother Ann Lee and the Elders, as well as from their
                            successors in the ministry, is in truth and reality, our only hope of eternal life. And this
                            gospel is a durable and abiding treasure in every faithful Believer. It is "a well of water
                            springing up to everlasting life," which continually nourishes and supports the soul in
                            those scenes of trial and tribulation which it must pass through in the work of
                            regeneration. We were instructed in the beginning of our faith, to prove the way of G-od for
                            ourselves ; that we might have rejoicing in ourselves, and not in another. This I have done,
                            and have found the benefit of it. We were told that when we came to see the branches
                            flourish, we might then know that the root was holy. And truly, when we see the branches
                            grow and flourish in righteousness, from such a small and humble beginning, we must know,
                            for ourselves, that the foundation is righteous, and in righteousness hath the hand of God
                            planted it. We were also told that, if we would hearken to the voice of the Lord our G-od,
                            and do whatsoever we were taught, we should be protected. These promises have been amply
                            fulfilled in every faithful soul who has traveled in reconciliation to the cross of Christ,
                            revealed through Mother Ann aud her successors in the gospel. And their preaching and labors
                            in the vineyard of Christ have not been in vain : for we have thereby " tasted the good word
                            of God and the powers of the world to come." And this has been an abiding substance with
                            every *:rue and faithful Believer, by day aud by night, from the first of our faith. 1 had
                            many privileges and opportunities of seeing Mother Ann and the Elders. They faithfully
                            taught us the necessity of becoming righteous, and of living a godly life; and instructed us
                            how to doit. They were, in truth, the ministers of the living God, who taught us the way of
                            life and salvation ; aud all their deportment, in conduct and conversation, corresponded
                            with their calling. It evidently appears that the slanderous reports against Mother and the
                            Elders were fabricated for the purpose of a refuge to the fabricators, that they might hide
                            themselves from the piercing rays of that light which is in the Church of Christ, which is
                            as a city set on a hill, where all the evil actions, done in the dark, must be brought to
                            the light. But in the event, the true children of the resurrection will receive the reward
                            of their labors. And those that "have hated instruction and despised reproof," will find
                            themselves disappointed in their ex-<pb n="198" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> pectations. After exaltiug
                            themselves, and trusting in a form of godliness, but denying the only tme gospel, which is
                            the power of God unto salvation, they will find their reward to be according to their works
                            ; they will then see and feel the truth of those doctrines revealed by the Spirit of Christ,
                            in his second coming, through the testimony of Mother Ann Lee, and the Elders, who are God's
                            witnesses to us.

                            discoveries in the Bible now ; a flood of light and life, refreshing and enlightening,
                            rushes down upon me from the pages of this book of books. Strange it is that we are so
                            seldom urged to study its contents; stranger still that so many Ingersolls and associates
                            should persist in their Sysiphus�labor of assailing this bulwark of the ages." Since there
                            is a cause for everythiug so is there a reason for the phenomenal popularity of Colonel
                            Tngersoll. Crude infidelity, with its cold negations, is never attractive, but when allied
                            with wit, satire aud eloquence it assumes a character that demands attention. It was biting
                            sarcasm and merciless epigrams that made Voltaire famous. Iugersoll is listened to today
                            because he is a man whose character is above reproach, a descendant of a line of pious
                            ancestors who were virtuous and Godfearing because the Bible taught them so to be. As a
                            soldier of the Union he gallantly led a cavalry regiment in the war ; as a lawyer he amassed
                            a large fortune ; as an orator he commands one thousand dollars for every lecture. His
                            eloquence, his wit aud pathos, his humor, his keen perceptions of the frailties of human
                            nature, his magnetic presence, the play of his clean-shaven expressive features, the ease
                            with which he moves his audience from tenderness to laughter and boisterous applause, all
                            combine to make him an uncommon man. Standing on Memorial Day before a vast and
                            distinguished audience in New York, pearls of beauty dropped from his lips. Said he: ''The
                            dome cannot save the temple whose foundation is injustice." "A brazen falsehood and a timid
                            truth are the parents of a compromise." "History is only the trace of a few mountain peaks,
                            crimes, calamities, mistakes and wars. The valleys, where the real victories are won, are
                            left in eternal shadow." He saw "a<pb n="199" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> world where thrones have crumbled
                            and the aristocracy of idleness has perished from the earth," a world "without the beggar's
                            outstretched palm, the miser's heartless, stony stare, the piteous wail of want, the livid
                            lips of lies, the cruel eyes of scorn." He saw a race "without disease of flesh or brain,
                            shapely and fair, the married harmony of form and function, life lengthened, joy deepened,
                            love canopied the earth, and over all in the great dome, shone the eternal star of human
                            hope." Pretty and poetical, no doubt, but what can an infidel mean by all that? St. John had
                            a vision very like the Colonel's, glorious with blessing and wisdom, thanksgiving and honor.
                            "These are they which came out of great tribulations and have washed their robes and made
                            them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve
                            Him day and night in his temple, ajid He that sitteth upon the throne shall dwell among
                            them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light upon
                            them nor any heat. For the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and
                            shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their
                            eyes." Says a writer in the Tribune, commenting on the above: "Liberty is a great blessing,
                            and it removes all barriers from human progress and makes the field of opportunity wide as
                            the world. But it does not make men of itself virtuous or wise, and when the vision that
                            Colonel Ingersoll and St. John both saw is realized, it will have been brought about by a
                            force that only the latter detected." There is a further reason why Col. Ingersoll is heard
                            respectfully. Much of what he says is but too true. When he launches forth the arrows of
                            invective against the hypocrisies, the frauds and shams and hollow pretensions that exist in
                            the church, thoughtful men say he is right, and applaud. But when lie attempts to deny the
                            facts of eternal life and of human responsibility to a Divine Being, the music of his
                            cadences becomes like childish twaddle and the nights of genius and eloquence but as the
                            aberrations of a wandering mind. And the vulgar crowd, frivolous men and women, love to hear
                            him attack things sacred and sublime ; they feel as if authority were given them to break
                            the restraints of faith and conscience and to work their own sweet wills as they list and be
                            a law unto themselves as far as safety and convenience will permit. Let it not be forgotten
                            that Ingersoll is an advocate of and for the world ; who insists upon the right of all to
                            exercise and enjoy and use all the faculties and powers '.nd sensations they are in
                            possession of; to whom the idea of self-denial is an absurdity, and the practice of
                            religious celibacy a crime and offence against the designs of nature. There is no surer sign
                            of the growth and existence of true religion than that he can go about and give utterance to
                            his opinions without molestation or hindrance ; were it otherwise one might indeed suppose
                            that the Colonel's assumption were true. Hancock, Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="A providence for every one..." TEIform="index"/>A providence for every one...

                                celibate life. When I see the evils in society, arising from the indulgence of the
                                animal passions, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion, than that it would be
                                much better if men would strive to bring their baser passions into subjection to the
                                higher laws of their nature, and try to live a nobler aud a more spiritual life. On this
                                we are all agreed, but the difficulty is to get men and women to exercise self-denial
                                for the happier enjoyment of intellectual life. There is hardly a great crime committed
                                ag-iinst society that is not traceable, directly or indirectly, to the indulgence of the
                                animal passions, and the unhappy marriages, separations and numerous divorces, show how
                                impossible it is to regulate this evil by law. Against the celibate life there is no
                                law, and the advantages of such a life over the married state, in properly organized
                                society, are sufficiently obvious. Even in the world it may be said that tlp whilst he
                                who marries doeth well, he who doth not marry doeth better ;" whilst in community life
                                it seems almost a necessity that men aud women should not marry. Where marriage has been
                                permitted or lawless intercourse indulged in, it seems to have been fatal to all
                                community organization, and such communities have sooner or later been broken up. Not
                                that marriage of itself is sinful, but it has led to a diversity of interests, and the
                                increase of selfishness to so great an extent, as to be destructive of the unity and
                                concord so essential to the community interests, so that it is quite possible that the
                                Shakers are right in their views on this subject. No doubt the enforcement of the
                                celibate rule is a great hindrance to many who would otherwise join your order,<pb n="201" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> but whether you could safely alter or modify the rule, or abandon
                                it altogether, would be difficult to say. I should be glad if something could be done to
                                make your order better known, and more acceptable to the religious world in general. To
                                illustrate what has been said I will refer to the dreadful incidents connected with Mr.
                                G. of Aylmer, Ont. He was a man of good standing, the owner of two flouring mills with
                                an interest in a third one, was fairly wealthy, and moved in the best society. He was a
                                Freemason, an Oc'dfellow, a Workman, and a leading member of the Methodist church, as
                                well as a man of social and political influence. His crime was that of incest. He was
                                arrested at his own mill and while taking him to prison he asked to see his family. Soon
                                as he entered the house he seized a revolver and instantly destroyed his own life. And
                                yet this man stood up in the church only four weeks before, and said he never was so
                                happy in his life, and hoped that many would be brought into the right way. What will
                                not the indulgence of this vile lust lead to ! ! I have to thank you for sending me the
                                Manifesto. It is an interesting journal, but I do not agree with all and everything that
                                I read in it, but the moral tendency is good and the whole tone religious and elevating.

                                July, 1888.</dateline><p TEIform="p">J. 11. Walker, Friend:�Your very interesting letter of the 2nd. iust. to our beloved
                                Elder John Whiteley has been forwarded to us for perusal. It cannot be thought strange
                                that we find in your communication, a common bond of sympathy, as we so clearly see the
                                present state of society,�such sad departures from righteousness, and then allow
                                ourselves to anticipate what it might be under the redeeeming influence of the cross of
                                Christ. It is quite too true that there is a strong tendency in the mass of mankind to
                                cling to the earth, and to become absorbed in its relations. Self-denial is not
                                congenial, so that in the ruling of the animal propensities, over the moral faculties,
                                many, very many pass on to destruction. We are not surprised that you see these things
                                so distinctly, or that you should acknowledge yourself as becoming a convert to the
                                testimony of Jesus Christ, which dwells so forcibly on the benefits accruing to those
                                who follow after righteousness and who work diligently ' to become pure in heart. But
                                there is a difficulty to get men and women to accept this better view of life. One of
                                the great barriers is found in the fact that many of those who assume to be the guides
                                on the highway to the kingdom, are quite as blind, or as unwilling to practice
                                self-denial for the good of mankind, as are those before whom they stand as teachers.
                                "If the blind attempt to lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch," and certainly,
                                none are so blind as those who live in selfishness and sensuality. Just here the
                                marriage question finds a place. That there is biblical authority for mar-<pb n="202" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> riage is quite correct and Paul in his zeal to become all things to all
                                men, that he might partiall) save some, admitted this life of the flesh in his Gentile,
                                Christian Church, and then tried hard to justify it. There is biblical authority also
                                for war and bloodshed and for slavery and for polygamy,�but it would be hard to find an
                                authority for these things in the teachings of Jesus. There can be no truer saying than
                                this, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that v/hich is born of the spirit
                                is spirit." We firmly believe, however, that any departure from the pure testimony of
                                the Christ, would, at once, destroy our religious order and make us emphatically, as are
                                the children of this world. As witnesses for the truth of God, the Shakers should, with
                                their light and privilege, be able to speak with as much confidence as did St. Paul,
                                when he said, "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and
                                lusts." "God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ, by
                                whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world." Our success in maintaining
                                our order and our prosperity as a Community must be by our faithful continuance in
                                welldoing. Our duty is to "preach the kingdom of God and its righteousness." We
                                appreciate your very kind remarks, having reference to our little journal, and only hope
                                that it may be able to do much good and no harm. Accept with this our prayer for your
                                prosperity in this life, and the blessedness of peace in that to come. Respectfully,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.

                            from the pen of our beloved brother, Elder William Leonard, of blessed; memory, and will no
                            doubt give pleasure to many of our readers. Ed.] THE APOSTLES REQUIRED TO KEEP A GIFT OF
                            HAND LABOR. Jesus said to the Jews, "The kingdom of God is among you," Luke, xvii., 21,
                            alluding to the disciples who were practicing and studyiug under him. To the disciples he
                            said, " It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
                            is not giveu." Matt, xiii., 11. This signifies that he taught them much that they must
                            practice in the new kingdom, which the world knew nothing about. From what follows it would
                            seem that hand labor was among their private instructions. In years after they had commenced
                            their ministry, Paul declared, "I think that God hath set forth us, the apostles, (he
                            excepts none) a spectacle to the world, angels and men. Even to this present hour, we
                            hunger, thirst, have no certain dwelling-place, and labor working with our hands, being
                            reviled we bless, being persecuted we suffer it." 1 Cor. iv., 8, 12. Paul does not say that
                            the apostles chose this condition for themselves. He does not even intimate that poverty
                            drove them to it. But he emphatically says, "God laid it upon them." It will be remembered
                            that Jesus was mediator between God and themselves. His word to them was the word of God.
                            When Jesus sent the twelve to preach and commanded them that they should take nothing for
                            their journey, save a staff only ; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse, and not put
                            on two<pb n="203" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> coats, Matt, x., 9, this to them was God's word. Or as he says
                            above, "God, laid this condition upon them and they felt it so," when Jesus told the twelve
                            after his death, "To go iuto all the world and preach the gospel." Matt, x., 7. The above
                            shows us, that they understood that God's word to them was, that they must go, as Jesus
                            first sent then* through life. And going in this gift, they distinctly understood that hand
                            labor must be resorted to for support, if nothing else had been said on that subject; but
                            under the next head we will show that Jesus enjoined hand labor on all. Jesus the author of
                            Christian hand labor in the church. Paul says to the Thessalouiaus, "We hear that there are
                            some among you, disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. Now such we command by
                            our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work and eat their own bread. If any man
                            obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, (or as on the margin, signify that man by
                            an epistle) and have no company with him that he may be ashamed, yet count him not as an
                            enemy, but admonish him as a brother." 2 Thes. Ill-, 8, 15. If Jesus did not bind hand labor
                            on all his followers, as a Christian duty, would Paul dare hold him up before the Church as
                            the author of it? He commands all, in the name of CJirist to perform it, as one authorized
                            by him to teach it as a Christian duty. If the word of God from Jesus did not render hand
                            labor binding on every one who professed the Christian name, would Paul have dared to order
                            the Church to cut themselves off from all, high or low, rich or poor, who did not perform it
                            ? It should be remembered that Paul was a regular member of the Church, at Jerusalem, in
                            good standing. If there was an order for labor revealed to the twelve he must have known it.
                            He was under that Church oue year before he went forth among the gentiles ; and here we may
                            conclude he learned the whole duty in this respect of apostle, teacher and every lay member
                            of Christ's body. This qualified him to say, "We hear that there are some disorderly among
                            you working not at all." If it was orderly to work, and disorderly not to work this must
                            have been the order of the primitive Church. How could there have been order, equality or
                            justice in that Church any more than in this, without such a rule of life for all? With
                            them, as with us, we see plainly that the quiet, industrious member was the more orderly
                            Christian, while the idler or loafer was selected out and pointed at by all the faithful, as
                            the busybody, the mischief-maker and the harbinger of strife and discord. THE APOSTLES
                            REQUIRED THAT ALL SHOULD LABOR FOR THEIR DAILY BREAD. Paul taught without hesitation or
                            qualification, and proved it by his works, that he who opposed or purposely fell short or
                            cast aside the duty of hand labor was an enemy to the Christian faith. He says, "If any
                            provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the
                            faith, and is worse than an infidel." 1 Tim. v., 8, or worse than a barbarian who never was
                            enlightened by the Christian faith. No language need be uttered plainer than this, to claim
                            hand labor as a foundation<pb n="204" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> principle laid down by Jesus as the true
                            Christian fa'.th. Ou the strength of this understanding of what the true faith in Christ
                            required he writes to the Thessalonians, "When we were among you, we commanded if any would
                            not work, neither should he eat," and then adds, that as teachers of the true faith they as
                            apostles or patterns were willing to be squared by it themselves, saying, "Neither did we
                            eat any man's bread for nought, but wrought with labor and travail, night and day, that we
                            might not be chargeable to any of you. Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves
                            an example to you to follow us.'' Paul claims that they had power to do otherwise. They
                            could gather gold and silver like other men, and spend it in worldly ease and pleasure. Many
                            pious donations could have passed from the Church into their hands ; they ha,d affectionate,
                            rich brethren they could have leaned upon, who as Paul said of some of the Corinthian
                            brethren, "Ye are full and rich; ye have reigned like kings without us, " or before we came.
                            1 Cor. iv.,8. These advantages were nobly laid aside and as Christians were to them as
                            nothing while in their estimation their own example before the Church was every thing. As
                            did their Lord, they spurned the idea of requiring of others what they were not willing to
                            do themselves. As apostolic teachers they must set an example in all things, "and they took
                            joyfully, the spoiling of their goods." When Jesus led them on earth, his testimony to the
                            worldly great was, "Woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. Woe
                            unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger." When they took his place as teachers of the
                            same faith, of course, by word and example they must hold out the same word. Jesus condemned
                            the same spirit in the Jewish pnesthood, he said, "The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses's
                            seat. They bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders but
                            they will not move them with one of their fingers." Matt, xxiii., 1, 4. The apostles knew
                            that Moses originally was a bright example and the greatest of burden bearers among his
                            people ; but that the Jewish teachers in Jesus's time were guilty of every extortiou and of
                            imposing every conceivable burden upon the people. Iu their intercourse with Jesus they knew
                            how he viewed these men and how he expressed himself concerning them in the true light of
                            heaven. Jesus said, that the priesthood said and did not; and they determined to do, as well
                            as say to the acceptance of their Lord and Master. It is simply ridiculous to say the
                            apostles pursued the course they did and were not taught of Jesus to do it. How perfectly
                            true inspiration has brought out iu Mother Ann and the Elders, the same willingness to toil
                            with their hands for their own support and to present an example to Believers in these days.
                            The first churches gathered in the east were planted iu the same spirit. The western
                            pioneers being taught in this school, when they journeyed west, purchased lands, erected
                            habitations and there put their hands to work, that others might when gathered become rooted
                            and grounded in this consistent Christian theology. When they had duties or travels to
                            perform these were carried along in the same spirit of diligetice, and when ended, they had
                            a habitation as a home<pb n="205" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> in which to retire supported by their own
                            faithful industry. When Jesus had passed into the heavens, the first work to be performed by
                            the twelve was to establish a Church at Jerusalem, built upon the word and example of Jesus,
                            that could be referred to when the Gospel spread among the Gentiles. In exhorting the
                            Thessalonians to a Christian course, and a life of industry, Paul points them directly to
                            the example of the Church at Jerusalem, and says, "Ye remember brethren our travel, for
                            laboring night aud day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you. Ye, brethren,
                            became the followers of the Churches which in Judea are in Christ Jesus." 1 Thes. ii., 9,
                            14. To no Church was Paul more faithful in his endeavors to stir them up to hand labor than
                            to this. He here shows them that as far as they had obeyed his instructions they had become
                            the followers of the parent Church in Jerusalem ; and he here states that the Jewish church
                            was in the very life of Christ. This renders it conclusive that they followed the example of
                            Jesus even in haud labor, just as the Believers follow the example of Mother Arm in this re
                            spect. However imperfect their order may have been, they could as really point to their best
                            and most perfected patterns as we can now point to the example of the Elders. Perhaps no
                            better illustration can be presented than in what follows to show not only the method that
                            hand labor was performed by in the Jewish Christian church, but the estimation that such
                            laborers were held in by the people and leaders. Power was given to Jesus to raise the dead.
                            After he closed his ministry and was gathered hence, seven years passed over before such a
                            miracle was wrought by the Apostles. The first power that was manifested in behalf of any
                            one under their charge to restore them again to life, was upon an upright working woman who
                            toiled for the poor and needy of Christ's flock and bestowed her gifts as free as the light
                            of heaven. Stephen, who was stoned by a mob ; James, who was slain by the sword of Herod did
                            not receive it. It was reserved ibr that world-renowned Sister of Charity named Tabitha or
                            Dorcas, who was again restored to the Church as a blessing to the friendless. She appears to
                            have been in independent circumstances and dwelt in Joppa, a day's journey from Jerusalem,
                            and the scripture says, "This woman was full of good works and alms-deed* which she did."
                            Acts, ix., 36. As she was the friend of the poor, her loss seems to have been felt most
                            bitterly by her people. With sad hearts "They washed her and laid her iu an upper chamber."
                            37. The mourners learning that Peter their great friend was at Lydda, about twelve miles
                            distant "Sent unto him two men desiring that he would not delay to come to them. Then Peter
                            arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber, and all
                            the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while
                            she was with them." 39. They appear to have laid out the remains of this world-renowned
                            Christian in the chamber where she had laid by her stores and dealt them out to the pocr,
                            that when the Apostle arrived, he might find her resting from her labors, surrounded by the
                            works of her own hands. The text does not say that the mourners pre-<pb n="206" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>
                            sented to Peter, articles she had purchased or hired others to manufacture, but they,
                            ''Showed him the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them." This
                            Sister was evidently a believer, who, like Lazarus and his sisters, knew something of Jeus,
                            Without doubt she had been a member of the Church quite through the ministry of Peter. In
                            her history we discern a valuable quality in the true character of the Jewish Church ; we
                            understand their labors and the disposition they made of property. Like her, the faithful,
                            wealthy members appropriated the means they had to the best account for the needy among
                            them. It appears that the excitement after Pentecost was attended by breaking bread from
                            house to house, saving nought of what they possessed was their own, and in laying thousands
                            at the apostle's feet. But when they advanced their order required them to carry out
                            practical ( hristian principles in their own habitations. Evidently the rich had to labor
                            with their hands and help support the destitute, and to require them to do the same. Those
                            who would not do this, ''To provide for their own, especially those of their own house,
                            denied the faith." Paul labored for his own support and the support of those that were with
                            him. Hence it could be said by James, "Let the brothei' of low degree rejoice in that he is
                            exalted, but the rich in that he is made low." James, i., 9, 10, They could carry
                            consecration no further till the revelation to Mother Ann brought both sexes into Church
                            order spiritually and temporally.

                            the receipt of your kindly New Year's greeting and expressed good wishes of the fraternity
                            you represent. Words cannot express my appreciation and I can only ask you to accept a
                            soulful return of the same kiud feeling. I verily believe the outflowing of soul reached me
                            before it was transmitted to paper, as about that time 1 received a baptism of blessing from
                            some source such as I have not experienced for a long time. At the time I wondered if it
                            could be the effect of the Soul Communion wave, if so, I felt there could be no denying the
                            power of silent forces. Whether the blessing came of soul communion with this or the angel
                            world, as of those who, while still in the flesh can realize and "recognize the kinship
                            which is higher and more durable than that of merely flesh and blood," I return thanks, and
                            the wish that they may be blessed in return. Thanks also for accompanying tracts. I have
                            read them with much interest and can see the beautiful and true in the divine life set
                            forth�a life I should have found it easy to have led had I been surrounded by its influence
                            in youth, and by so doing should have perhaps escaped many troubles and trials by 'he way,
                            for I know my nature never was adapted to the institution of so-called holy marriage, albeit
                            while under the law I tried to make the best of it. 1 have long seen that the present social
                            system is very defective�indeed wholly so. About fifteen years ago, as it were in answer to
                            my earnest prayer for something better for those who should come after me, Communal life was
                            shown me in a vision ; something I had never thought of, but 0 so grand, so beautiful ! It
                            flashed on me like a light from heaven. Either it was a revelation of life in the higher
                            spheres or a prophecy of the yet U be, the New Jerusalem that is to come dowu from heaven. I
                            wait in hope. That which was shown me was life attuned to perfect harmony. I should like to
                            know more of the workings of community life as established by your Order. I can see where
                            celibacy makes it so much more possible to give up all than where anxious care for the
                            future welfare of posterity stands in the way. But this is sure, every day I see more to
                            convince me of the inefficiency of the present system. What assurance is there for
                            protecting care in old age? Of this I have an illustration in my own life experience. For
                            years I have been the sole dependence of an aged and widowed father who, in spite of
                            abundant possessions in the way of property, might have been uncared or and his possessions
                            wasted but for the incident of my own life which made it possible for me to devote myself
                            entirely to his service, though at a great sacrifice to my own best interests in many ways ;
                            the most trying of which is complete isolation ; his mind of late being iu such condition
                            that he cannot endure the presence of strangers, and it is but seldom that I can even have
                            the privilege of my children visiting me. But yet he is not what might be termed insane, and
                            though in his 87th. year, is iu robust physical health and may quite likely last longer than
                            myself. I enter on these particulars that I may introduce a<pb n="208" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> question
                            that often comes up for solution and on which I have pondered much : Filial duty requires
                            that I care for my father. Jesus said '"Let the dead bury their dead, follow thou me." Now
                            to all intents and purposes of this world my poor father is dead in mind, being deaf and
                            almost listless ; but think you that I could feel justified in deserting him in obedience to
                            a call to other work, even though it might be in the Master's vineyard? No, humanity would
                            forbid. There may be sacrifices to make under any condition of life, but under the present
                            system it is life-long sacrifice with but little compensation in the way of real happiness.
                            I know that communal life is the better way, but a person requires to be '' born again " to
                            see it, and then it requires great faith in humanity to adopt it. I hope I may sometime have
                            the opportunity of visiting a Shaker Community. I should think it would be "like a little
                            heaven below," so many united on a true spiritual plane. Yet the little cherubs must be
                            missed. I always feel that there is something very heavenly in the love of little children,
                            and that there is no mission more holy than caring for them in their helplessness and
                            guiding their youthful minds in the right direction. It has often been a perplexing question
                            with me as to how your system is perpetuated� whether by adoptions from the outside world or
                            in what way ? It has never been my good fortune to live near a community, neither have I had
                            an opportunity for gaining much knowledge in regard to the system, though with what little I
                            have learned I have been very favorably impressed. But as there is a wide gulf between the
                            present stage of humanity and the perfected condition I feel that as yet there must be au
                            intermediary. This subject I am making my life study. Some form of communal life that will
                            fit the present requirement and lead to the more perfect development of the race. I believe
                            1 am called io this work. As yet with my pen is the only way I can make an effort in the
                            direction, but I often feel that the position I am placed in is for a purpose of education
                            in the utter inefficiency of the present system to guarantee "life, liberty and the pursuit
                            of happiness" to mankind. Likewise, we must ever be trampling on laws human or divine,
                            trying to serve two masters�God and mammon. The worst feature of the present system is that
                            it is conducive to selfishness- -compelled by the necessity of self-protection. I will here
                            add that in my vision of communal life the children were a very prominent feature, for it
                            was shown me that motherhood was a holy and divine mission of which no sensual lust should
                            form a part; that the love from whence it sprang should be a divine sacrament, and maternity
                            wholly under woman's control. I believe that as yet, a communal life of degrees, each
                            community according to its plane of development, but the end and aim perfection ; is all we
                            can hope for the world at large. For myself, however, the purely spiritual is all I find
                            pleasure in, and should I be spared to arrange for future years I should most assuredly
                            situate myself where I could have such association. Please allow me to express myself as
                            equally interested in your able spiritual articles in W. A. T. We sometimes have come very
                            near expressing the same ideas. I ask that your Order will<pb n="209" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> remember me

                            similar ones in my travels through the States. But Elder Henry, I will frankly confess that
                            you have chronicled in the June Manifesto, a vision which has no difficulty for me, in which
                            I read with great interest, and for which I thank you. It is the vision of Elder J. G.
                            Russell. Such men may tell me their visions and I will accept them and wish that I might be
                            favored as they. Those who have well done their work, as I know the good Elder has done his,
                            such visions are true; such are the products of true religion, the fruits of it. And oh, who
                            could wish for a happier end, to be able to feel as the dear Elder Russell feels, with the
                            great future close before him.�His end here, his beginning there.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="H., J. H." TEIform="persName"/>J. H.

                            they would only believe what they profess, that God is able to make them happy without
                            anything else. They imagine if such a dear friend were to die, or such and such blessings
                            were removed, they should be miserable; whereas God can make them a thousand times happier
                            without them. To mention my own case : God has been depriving me of one mercy after another
                            : but as one is removed, he has come in and rilled up its place. Now when I am a cripple and
                            not able to move, I am happier than ever I was in my life before, or ever expected to be;
                            and if I had believed this twenty years ago, I might have been spared much anxiety. If God
                            had told me some time ago that he was about to make me as happy as I could be in this world,
                            and then had told me he should begin by crippling me in all my limbs, and removing me from
                            my usual sources of enjoyment, I should have thought it a very strange mode of accomplishing
                            this purpose.

                                would not have made it a subject of so much importance. So long as men trespass againsf
                                the law of God, or against their fellow men, so long will there be need for confession
                                of these faults. It is quite to the poir:t that the apostle James says, "'Confess your
                                faults one to another, and pray for one another." Some people talk very loud about
                                confessing to God, whom they never knew, while they hesitate to make confession before a
                                gospel brother. The entering into the secrecy of the closet would lose much of its
                                value, if a listener was knewn to stand at the door. We well agree with the apostle,
                                that confession and prayer are so closely conjoined that the one would seem quite
                                unfinished without the other, as in humble, penitent confession we walk with God. And as
                                "every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess," to God, it is wisdom to approach that
                                pure spirit so near as we are able, and unburden the mind before the greater light, in
                                the presence of a witness. Nothing will cure a fault so thoroughly as to make it a
                                subject of confession to those before whom it was committed. Mother Ann Lee taught that
                                the first step in obedience to spiritual light, was an honest confession of our sins to
                                God, before a witness. The benefit to be derived from this form of active repentance has
                                been well understood by those who have accepted a religious life. To some extent, it has
                                been carefully guarded from age to age, ti'l it reached the time when men were taught to
                                "Do unto others what ye would that they should do unto you." In this, the confession of
                                our faults, one to another, became a Christian obligation, and no less, the praying of
                                one for another. It is a matter of great importance that we take the first step in the
                                gospel work aright, or we may fail to be successful in those which are to follow.
                                According to the word of the New Testament, John the Baptist had his followers confess
                                their sins at the time of thenbaptism, and this agrees in full with Acts, xix. ,18, when
                                the people who would be Christians, confessed their sins and showed their deeds. An
                                unconfessed Christian must be quite like the wicked city as seen by the Revelator:�"The
                                hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean bird." Rev. xviii., 2. In our
                                gospel order, the confession of sin has been accepted as a revelation from the spirit of
                                God, and those who were appointed as witnesses sought to impress this fact upon those
                                who availed<pb n="211" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> themselves of the privilege, that every confession
                                must be made to God. The testimony of Jesus bears upon this point as he says, "There is
                                nothing covered that shall not be revealed : neither hid that shall not be known."
                                Whatever is revealed must be brought to the light, and the followers of Christ are the
                                light of the world. To those who receive the gospel testimony, as in the advent of
                                Jesus, an honest confession of all siu before God, is the "door of hope" for
                            salvation.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="One of the kings of Israel got sick" TEIform="index"/>ONE OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL GOT

                                line of "right living, aud of right doiug." We read of the heathenism of the past, and
                                also of a people "not numbered with the nations.''" Whether the heathenism of today, in
                                some of its aspects is not of a darker hue, more insidious and corrupting, than any
                                preceding may be a matter of consideration. The outcome of heathenism, results in a long
                                list of bodily, and social ailments. The outcome of obedience to the laws of God
                                hygienic aud moral are in an opposite direction. The many and varied troubles of outside
                                life furnish scenes not pleasant to think of. Inasmuch as we enjoy freedom, are
                                separated from their social maladies, we are saved from their industrial judgments. In
                                this respect, we are not numbered with the nations. In bodily ailments why should we be
                                numbered with them ? The long and lengthening list of bodily diseases to which the
                                subjects of modern civilization are heirs, is evidence that God is not in their way of
                                living. Gent-rally, the subjects of disease instead of turning to God, heap to
                                themselves many M. Ds. Even as God is in his Order for protection and salvation from
                                sin, in that Order, there must needs be protection from disease, the fruit of sin. In
                                the fulness of our gospel there will be an ever-abiding of the presence of God, and an
                                absence of that tending to destroy or to hurt. No greater evidence of the absence of his
                                presence can be presented than is manifested in seeking God where He is not to be found.
                                A corresponding loss is manifested in ransacking the bowels and surface of the earth tor
                                a universal cure-all ; f r a constitutional remedy ! There is no such remedv. But there
                                is indeed within us an inherent constitutional power, endowed with ability to maintain
                                in health every one of us fiom infancy to old age, if not abused. This beneficent power,
                                even when sinned against, is ever ready to restore us to health, to mend injuries and to
                                respond to every effort of "right living." It is written, "God is not far from any one."
                                This is also true in regard to our material bodies. The king of Israel instead of going
                                back to God in confession aud rapentance, in the fitness of Jewish law, went to men.
                                When we come home to the simplicity of the truth with our bodily ills, as we are taught
                                to do with spiritual transgressions, we shall be saved in a goodly degree from men-made
                                M. Ds. and from their drugs. There is something out of place when a Believer presents
                                himself or herself be-<pb n="212" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> fore a doctor of the world. It.is a
                                remarkable fact, that the attitude of all medical men to their patients is, "Yon are
                                sinners." And the attitude of a patient to these men is, "'I am a sinner." Seeing these
                                M. Ds. do not themselves obey the "law of right living," dietetically, they are out of
                                place in assuming to sit in judgment, they being themselves unjustified sinners. Again
                                they are out of place in prescribing for Believers, because they have been trained to
                                prescribe for those who are the subjects of great vital expenditures ; hence they are
                                ever ready to advise the use of stimulating foods altogether unsuitable for those who
                                live a life of purity. On this point we need to take heed. First, we do not require such
                                a fulness of nutriment as generative men and women do. Second, the nutriment taken by
                                us, should not be stimulating, more particularly so, for young people. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                        sometimes, but you need me just the same, summer and winter. By using me your
                                        lungs purify your blood, and pure blood keeps you well. Do not dress your body

                                        says, "I am a better drink than liquor but the nerves are a little excited over
                                        my presence in their midst, and if taken strong and steadily, I soon get to be
                                        master for they cannot do without me, but I store up impurities all the time in
                                        the system." Tea says, "I whip up the nerves to greater activity and am regarded
                                        as a friend by the<pb n="213" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> people because I make them feel good
                                        and help them to do more work when they are already tired. But the vital organs
                                        must regard me as an enemy, too, because soon after there is a depression of
                                        feeling and a nervousness that nothing but more tea will soothe. Many old tea
                                        drinkers have very severe headaches, showing the nerves have been greatly
                                        irritated." Pure food says, "Use me. I will nourish your body without unduly
                                        exciting the nerves." Fruit says, "I have gathered the rays of sunshine, the
                                        drops of dew and all the good there is in air and earth. My juices will allay
                                        thirst and sharpen appetite. You can use me without any waste of force." The

                                        the body. Do not fail to count me first and last in your daily diet." Vegetables

                                        especially by professing Christians. The writer of this note has recently heard
                                        the use of tobacco by ministers condemned in the strongest terms. One man said
                                        if he had a pastor who was addicted to its use he would give him to understand
                                        that he was never to use it about his house, and that he never wanted his boys
                                        to see him using it. Another went even further and said he would not listen to a
                                        minister preach who used tobacco. He said he could not receive the pure sweet
                                        truth of God coming through such a filthy channel. Apropos of all this is the
                                        suggestive testimony of the noted New York missionary, the late Jerry McAuley.
                                        He says : "And here let me say a word about tobacco. I consider it a great
                                        stumbling-block in any Christian's life; but when a man has had an appetite for
                                        liquor and is trying to keep from drinking, the use of tobacco is positively
                                        fatal. It will surely bring him back to his cups. * * * I was led at last, by
                                        the grace of God, to do the clean thing to give up every sinful habit, and from
                                        that time Jesus has kept me."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Religious telescope" TEIform="index"/>Religious Telescope.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="national-news" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Woman voting" TEIform="index"/>WOMAN VOTING.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F.

                            pass." What right, except that of power, have men to prevent woman voting? Is it not as much
                            the right of women to decide who shall and who shall not vote as of men? If man arrogates to
                            himself the decision it proves his egotism and ignorance of first principles, not his right.
                            The present race of fishes in the Mammoth cave do not want the sunshine. They have no eyes.
                            Unroof the cave and let in the sunshine ; it will create eyes in the next generation of
                            fishes. Pass the woman suffrage bill arid women will soon see the duty and beauty of voting.
                            Why does not the Tribune apply the same logic to non-voting women that it used to apply to
                            the slave who did not want freedom, but hugged the chain that bound him? The inalienable
                            rights of freedom and voting do not depend upon the will or the choice of the slave or the
                            non-voting woman. Like life itself they inhere, as duties in human nature. Suicide is an
                            indictable offence. "Who would be free, himself must strike the blow." The slave who spurns
                            emancipation and the non-voting man or woman of the world, class themselves with infants and
                            idiots whom the state should care for until the child is of age, and the man or woman
                            becomes sane. If doctors would take enough of their own drugs it would soon stop their
                            insane efforts to deprive citizens�free Americans�of the right to medicate either themselves
                            or their friends. Let us all do as we would be done by. Let woman vote and every man and
                            woman be their own physician.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Be severe with yourself" TEIform="index"/>Be severe with yourself

                                    expected that the revised New Testament would take the place of the old, and become
                                    the standard authority. It was presumable that the most ardent believer well knew
                                    that there were errors in the King James' version, and would gladly have such errors
                                    eliminated. Such presumption has not been warranted by the facts, lleally, if there
                                    are errors, the believer does not wish to admit that there are. He prefers, like a
                                    young ostrich, to hide his head in the sand, and not be blinded by the light. In
                                    that condition he refuses to believe that there is any other light than that which
                                    filters through the sand which covers his closed eyelids. Those who expected so much
                                    from the new version did not take into consideration that the value of the Bible
                                    depended on its infallibility, and after many generations had received every word
                                    and letter as divine authority, and held that eternal salvation depended on belief
                                    in every text. Now to have that belief shaken by a new translation, by which
                                    passages considered of vital import are changed or omitted, is like the destruction
                                    of the Bible itself. If the old is not correct, what assurance have we that the new
                                    is more perfect scholarship? Was not the old surrounded by a halo of scholarship at
                                    its birth? If it depends on scholarship, and scholarship improves, how soon before
                                    still another new version will be required? True, in a certain way the new version
                                    has been approved by the Unitarians, because a certain strong passage favorable to
                                    Trinitarianism was omitted; by the liberal-minded ministers, because "hell" is
                                    euphonized into "hades," and thus the repugnant doctrines of hellfire and eternal
                                    punishment cast overboard. Henry Ward Beecher pronounced it "a first rate affair,"
                                    and many other advanced thinkers in the ranks of Orthodoxy agree with him. But
                                    Talmadge said ' 'it was already dead" before it was well published, and Spurgeon
                                    thinks the old the best, and nowhere, not in a church in all this country has the
                                    new taken the place of the old. The version is dropped dead�it is not wanted. The
                                    Bible as it is, is sufficient, and to admit a better version is to overthrow its
                                    authority, and shake the old faith to its foundation. But the destructive work is
                                    done and casting aside the revision will not make the water flow back to its source.
                                    The whole world now knows that a great number of eminent scholars regard the
                                    translation of the Bible, which has been for centuries believed perfect to the
                                    letter, as very imperfect, as misleading, and removed texts which have been the rcot
                                    of dogmas held of vital import. Whatever the final conclusion of the laity, they
                                    know that there is disagreement among the doctors, and infallible authority admits
                                    of no disagreement. The support of the doctrines of hell and the trinity are taken
                                    away, and the worship of the Bible as a holy, inspired and infallible book, cannot
                                    long be maintained. Instead of blind worship, there will come rational study in
                                    parallel line with the literature of other races of mankind.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="R. P. J." TEIform="index"/> in R. P. J.</bibl></cit></p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Tuttle, Hudson" TEIform="persName"/>Hudson Tuttle
