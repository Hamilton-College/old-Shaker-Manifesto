THE LAUGH CURE.
All sorts of isms, pathies and " cures " have had
their day, but the " Laugh Cure " we have always
with us, or �ught to have, for it is sure to benefit
even where it may fail to cure. Since the most ancient " chestnuts " will often provoke the heartiest
laugh, especially when served up in a new dress, we
can afford to forgive the man who has collected
many old and new favorites in a paper covered book
called " Medical Sense and Nonsense, '� for ten cents.
Illustrated. It is confidently offered as antidotal to
the "blues," stimulating to the diaphragm, and accelerating to the blood circulation, and is served
out by mail, " on receipt of price, " by the Murray
Hill Publishing Company, 129 East 28th Street
New York.
A summary view of the "Millennial
Church " or United Society of Believers.
It treats of the Rise and Progress of the
Society, together with the general principles
of the Faith and Testimony.

                            spiritual life. Stagnation would curdle the blood in the veins! Precisely so the sources of
                            spiritual life ! The exercise and proper use of the spiritual powers in the service of God,
                            is the primary source of their life. The spiritual heart must pulsate with inspirations,�its
                            life-blood. The spiritual arteries,�rivers of the waters of life, mutt be unclogged, that
                            the life currents may flow on to the veiaous system�the little rills of spiritual love,
                            sympathy and interest, that permeate the whole tissue of the soul's structure, and give it
                            vitality, and round up its form, giving it Gospel grace and beauty. But, the interested may
                            inquire, How is this life to be attained ? Man can only plant, till and water, and operate
                            to keep in circulation what God hath provided ; it is God who giveth the increase. This is
                            true, but God hath presented to souls garners filled with spiritual provisions sufficient
                            for both present and future spiritual needs. Man has but to exercise his powers to
                            appropriate their stores ; and this duty is not a mystery, except to persons, who, by
                            confining their interests and attention to material things, have become oblivious to
                            spiritual conditions, who take little thought and concern about their soul's welfare, and
                            exist, in this present world, a product of material combination, as a plant is a product of
                            the soil. But, that spirit who is alive to the sympathies that unite soul to soul, and the
                            soul of man to his Creator, reaches forth its spiritual hands in prayer, to grasp after soul
                            food ; it pours out its yearning desires in positive flows of hungering, to the powers
                            above, as the ocean's waves kiss the shore when driven by a powerful wind. Yet, the
                            conditions needful to obtain the answer to prayers, are, to live daily iu firm obedience to
                            known laws of righteousness ; thus living, the soul floats upon the rivers of the favor and
                            power of God. But, man has extensively used his reasoning powers balefully, or neglected to
                            use them at all, and, instead of applying himself wisely to appropriate the bountiful
                            provisions God hath bestowed, has starved his soul in the midst of boundless spiritual
                            providences, for lack of exertion to utilize and elaborate God's blessings, has wantonly
                            wasted them, by disregarding the laws of simple use, or poisoned them with adulter-<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> ous influences and impulses contradictory to spiritual truth, until
                            soul life pulsations cease, and all the little rills of spirit life are dried up, their
                            channels empty as the storm spent cloud, perhaps, dusty as the burning desert. But what is
                            spirit life ? What are its resources? The present state of mankind in the worldly order is
                            such, that, to the multitude, a soul life is almost an anomaly. Spirit! What is it? Is there
                            a human spirit that exists when the physical body it once inhabited is laid in the tomb ?
                            These are even questions in the minds of millions ! But this is an abnormal condition of
                            humanity, a disease,�the fruit of transgression of the laws of our being. The normal state
                            of the human family niaiutains as real consciousness of spiritual, as of material existence,
                            and is as really cognizant of the presence of the angel throng, who people the eternal
                            worlds, as the earthly man is cognizant of the myriads who inhabit the domain of earth, and,
                            in this normal spiritual condition, the spirit man would be as conscious of its relations to
                            God, and as open to communications from Him, through mediating intelligencies ; therefore,
                            the present state of masses of the human race, who are so blind to even an existence of the
                            spiritual body, after the death of the physical, is the result of the sins of the race
                            against the laws of God, producing a moral and spiritual atrophy, a paralysis often
                            terminating in soul death. The soul of man is an effluence from the All Father and Mother of
                            the Universe, an etherial idiocracy, the vital life of which is the inspirations of the
                            Father and Mother God. This is spirit life, and its resources are the wellsprings of
                            Divinity. To draw soul life inspirations from this fountain, s^ouls must live so purely, so
                            strictly in the light of truth, as to keep a relation to, and knowledge of, the gift of God,
                            as Jesus suggested to the woman of Samaria, at Jacob's well; thus, "If thou knewest the gift
                            of God, and who it is that saith unto thee 'give me to drink' thou wouldst have asked of
                            him, and he would have given thee living water." "And whosoever drinketh of the water that I
                            shall give him, shall never thirst" (for sinful pleasures) "but the water that I shall give
                            him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life." And Jesus further
                            gave the Samaritan woman to understand that the formal worship of tljio sinner, should cease
                            from Samaria and from Jerusalem, thus. "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true
                            worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth ; for the Father seeketh such to
                            worship Him." Thus, "to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life
                            and peace." And souls who so live as to keep their joining to the Divine life, will not be
                            found faltering by the Gospel way-side, uor halting between two opinions, whether to serve
                            God or Mammon ; they will not be circumstantial travelers in the way of God, that is,
                            conclude to try to go in it if all the circumstances of surrouuding conditions and
                            influences are favoring their journey ; if persons in whom they are greatly interested are
                            firm in faith, true in principle, steadfast in righteousness, but if not, conclude to go
                            back to the beggarly elements of the world with them. Zion's pillars of strength, Heaven's
                            benefactors, the Saviors that the proph-<pb n="243" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> et Obadiah declared "should
                            come up on Mount Zion, to judge the House of Esau, (a figure of those who sell their
                            birthright inheritance to the blessings of God, for carnal pleasure,) these are souls who
                            stand for truth like a rock in the midst of the sea, whom no waves of opposition, no
                            fawnings of carnal affection and weakness will turn away from Zion's pathway. When the faith
                            of the Believer is firm and unshaken, when his obedience to the Gospel principles is true
                            and persistent, his spiritual status will be wholesome, then the power of God will be his
                            savior and redeemer from all temptations and weakness of the fleshly life. The gospel of
                            Christ is a call to repentance, to a reform of life, a new and true life ; but those who
                            reject this call, there remains no open door of hope for salvation, redemption and Heaven.

They are so snarled and
                            twisted together, that to straighten them seeras impossible. In the natural fibre there are
                            so many kinks, I see no other way of keeping things right than by every person smoothing out
                            their own kinks. In this frame of mind a visitor, not of earth, approached me. He was clad
                            as wayfaring men usually are, in clothes the worse for wear. I saw he had something to say ;
                            he made a halt and scanned me intently. I motioned him to sit down ; he did so and dropped
                            his bundle at his feet. He said, I perceive you are troubled as I am about the state of
                            things among men. When I lived on earth I was thought to be somebody, now I am a tramp. The
                            want and crime in your world distresses me ; to be at freedom to sit down and rest a little
                            feels good. I have come to see what can be done to stop the flow of wicked men and women
                            into the land of souls. There is no hope but in the extinction of the race, or in its
                            amendment while on earth. Men and women give way to their animal emotions to the injury of
                            themselves and others. You see the misery of earth. I feel the misery of dead millionaires.
                            I was one of them. At first I felt destitute and horriblv alive. I had no rest; I was driven
                            out of settled society ; I had to tramp. My feet got sore; a man gave me these old rubbers.
                            Wherever I turn, the measure I gave unto men, is measured to me. I have not come to be
                            delivered from being an outcast, for I have learned to rejoice that the wrath of God is
                            against all unrighteousness. The object of that wrath is, that all may be just, kind and
                            lovable. The talk of the glorious principles involved in the Declaration of Independence is
                            hollow and out of date. The word is, ''Give over employing your millions in absorbing nil
                            the elements of human subsistence you can lay your hands on�driving the landless to poverty,
                            crime, and to the highways. Could you feel but for a season the condition of those who lived
                            upon, and became rich at the expense of others, you would feel more than words can express.
                            The presence of dead millionaires is unendurable. I would rather tramp forever than live
                            with them. I pray that the time will come shortly when all will<pb n="244" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> have
                            equal natural opportunities to live. Of my own hard-heartedness, I am tramping out of it,
                            ju^t as I got into it; only, I have to tramp backwards. I find great relief in meeting those
                            who are righting their wrongs while in the body, and seeking the uplifting of humanity. The
                            talk of doing unto others as we would be done unto is stale. Go to work with a heart full of
                            loving kindness and the work is done. The lack of this in me makes me feel bad now. The law
                            of the Heavens, and also of the Moral Universe, is "Be happy in making others happy. There
                            is a lack of honesty of purpose in society in seeking to suppress crime. Tts leading members
                            do not want to go to the root in this m.itter. They are the ones who create crime and punish
                            criminals. It is they who obstruct (as I did) the honest toilers in their eudeavors to
                            reach, to improve and enjoy Godgiven opportunities. A case of this kind presented itself in
                            one of the hells. It appeared that one of the leaders in society had been robbed, and that
                            the robber had a family, and that his children were in want. Under the impulse to provide
                            for them he stole some food. The results were, conviction and sentence of punishment. The
                            robber appealed to Heaven's high court of Judicature. The decision of the lower court was
                            set aside on the showing that complainant was the robber. He having taken away by legal
                            force the poor man's access to the elements of human subsistence. The wants of the latter
                            were provided for, and the legal robber and his gentlemen of the jury sunk back to their
                            respective hells. The procedure of this court is not arbitrary; a sweet reasonableness
                            pervades it, and both parties are benefited by its conclusions. When society honestly seeks
                            to meet crime in the spirit of this court, poverty and its attendant, crime, will be reduced
                            to their minimum. Humanity is a unit, hence the happiness of its substratum is the happiness
                            of the whole. Your world is a world of effects ; of necessity there is a world of causes the
                            forces of which are not material; even the impulsive forces of instinctive life are not
                            visible. Man in common with animals feels these forces, but he is not the subject of the
                            limitations of instinctive life. He manipulates and controls to a certain extent the
                            inorganic elements ; and as he thinks, designs and materializes his thoughts, his sphere of
                            action ever widens. He causes these elemental forces to do for him most toilsome service and
                            in obedience to his will, new creations of beauty and use spring up before him, the
                            fulfillment of his wishes. Again, there is a world open to him to which instinctive life has
                            no access� a world of duties and of moral responsibilities. In the sphere occupied by man he
                            is more of a sovereign than he is aware of. Man's place in creation is truly grand and full
                            of possibilities. In his hands are the ever contending forces Good and Evil. At his will,
                            either predominates. Fate and Destiny are in his hands. All the forces of heaven and earth
                            are at his disposal. Hell exists because he created it, and wills it to be. But I must go ;
                            my mission is to tramp, and tramp I will till humanity is elevated into physiological, moral
                            and divine righteousness. Having closed, he lifted his bundle and disappeared. Mt. Lebanon,

                                Sept. 1, 1888.</dateline><p TEIform="p">My Dear Friend, Robert Aitken : I received your favor of the twentyfifth yesterday and am
                                glad to hear of your happiness and that of the friends of Shaker Station for all of whom
                                I entertain sympathy and affection. I hope to visit them and you sometime when I can
                                know more of your community life. It has always been an ideal life to me ever since my
                                Concordium experience, although it was very imperfectly carried out at Ham Common. The
                                difficulty in Community life however, is in drawing the line between individual
                                responsibility and freedom of conscience, which are essential to true manhood, and the
                                will of the community. SwedeMborg says, "The Lord preserves the freedom of the human
                                will as 'the apple of his eye,' or the highest importance. Yet this freedom must be
                                limited to some extent in civil society and still more in community life. There is no
                                such thing as perfect freedom in imperfect conditions. Yet the higher the spiritual
                                condition the more perfect is the freedom. In fact the sooner we can give up our
                                self-will and accept the divine guidance the sooner shall we enjoy true freedom.
                                Self-love is slavery. Love to God and man, although requiring the sacrifice of self, is
                                the highest liberty. But liberty is the beau ideal of humanity without which there can
                                be no responsibility and consequently no manhood. I thank you for sending Greaves,
                                although the book has not yet arrived, I presume it will iu due time. The chief idea of
                                Greaves I think is submission to the divine will. It seems a paradox that man is free
                                only in proportion as he gives up his own self-will, and yet it is true. Our self-will
                                enslaves, the divine will exalts and makes free. I believe I could accept practically a
                                life of celibacy, but it has always appeared to me to be a duty to provide for the
                                future generation. Our own existence is due to the performance of this duty parentally,
                                and does not the boon of existence conferred on us, rightly and justly include the duty
                                of transmission of that boon to others, although it may involve us in some anxieties and
                                even spiritual disabilities ? There are spiritual sacrifices as well as material
                                sacrifices and our obligations cannot be fully discharged if we neglect to use any of
                                the functions conferred upon us. Of course we cannot judge for others in this matter. It
                                must be for each one to do as he receives the light to do. It may be wisdom in one to
                                live a life of virginity while it may be unwise for an-<pb n="246" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> other. I
                                cannot see that a universal rule can be set up which it would be right for all to follow
                                except the rule of individual conviction. My friend Edmunds asked me if you had
                                consented to "prepare a place for him." He thinks well of the Shaker life. He is very
                                fond of children, and I do not know whether he would find such attraction with you. We
                                must have something on which love can ultimate or it is apt to die. If I were with you I
                                should miss the children more than anything else. We are passing away and the hope of
                                the world is in the coming generation. It seems to me that this is where Shakerism fails
                                of universal application, one hundred years of Shakerism will leave this earth desolate
                                if you apply it universally. The creation of man includes propagation as au important
                                function, and if that is abandoned, existence of the races of mankind ceases and the
                                eartli becomes again a wilderness. Do the Shakers believe that a new creation is to
                                supply the place of natural generation and that regeneration includes recreation? lam
                                not asking in the spirit of opposition but for the sake of information. There is no
                                doubt but a ceasing to generate would abolish human wars, but it would be at the expense
                                of abolishing the human race and leaving this beautiful world to be inhabited by wild
                                beasts alone and they would devour one another. There is something sublime in the effort
                                to live a pure, chaste life, but to abolish marriage seems to me contrary to divine
                                order and in some cases it may be an avoidance of duty and responsibility not altogether
                                justifiable. But this is a great question and cannot be settled by letter. Perhaps you
                                do not claim Shakerism to be universally applicable to mankind r With love to all the

                                sympathy expressed for us. In your letter you have touched on points that it might, as
                                you say, be difficult to clear up by letter. It is in your case as well as my own, when
                                we once get a taste of community life we never can forget it. Could I have found it
                                outside of Shakerism it is not likely you would find me a Shaker to-day ; i. e. had I
                                found community before I found Shakerism. It must always be puzzling to the generative
                                man and woman, as long as they are unable to view the entire distinction between the
                                order of Adam and the order of Christ. In not viewing the Adam order as distinct from
                                the Christ order there must always arise a confusion of ideas. The order of Adam is
                                wholly generative, the order of Christ is wholly regenerative, and for 'hose who follow
                                Adam it is right and proper for them to generate; and I should say with you, it is their
                                duty, as it is the duty of those who follow Christ to cease generating and follow him in
                                the work of regeneration. Generation belongs to the Adam order of the world,
                                regeneration belongs to the Christ order, which is the order of the kingdom of heaven :
                                the one being wholly natural, the other wholly spiritual. Here is<pb n="247" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>
                                where confusion of ideas comes in, viz., the blending of the natural with the spiritual.
                                When you speak of sacrifice of freedom in either the natural, generative or spiritual
                                regenerative order, I can conceive of none in either when both are perfectly lived out
                                free from sin. It is the siu life that destroys all true freedom. It is true, indeed, as
                                you affirm, that all true freedom comes from renouncing our own self-wills to do God's
                                will. In regard to the perpetuation of the race ; that can safely be left in the hands
                                of Him who created it. If God gives me light that it is my duty fo leave the works of
                                generation behi-jd and follow Christ in the regeneration, no one can be at all
                                responsible for what becomes of the race of man, as in that case it is wholly in the
                                hands of Him who is able to do as He wills in this matter. It must be evident that
                                nothing that man can do can alter the purposes that God has decreed, and it is for us to
                                obey what light is given us of God irrespective of results. God, in the order of his
                                providential processes, has given me light that it is my duty to follow Christ in the
                                work of regeneration: herein is where I am held responsible to that light,.but as you
                                have not that light yet, you caunot be held responsible. It stands the same to-day as it
                                did when Jesus uttered the saying, "He that is able to receive it, let him receive it;"
                                here is perfect freedom for all cannot receive the saying. You kindly ask me, "Do the
                                Shakers believe that a new creation is to supply the place of natural generation ?" The
                                Shakers believe that he that is in Christ is a new creature, i. e., a new spiritually
                                born man, and so becoming new he lets the natural entirely alone in God's hands to do
                                with it as he lists, and being born anew his work is to propagate spiritually, that is,
                                to propagate spiritual children, as the apostle Paul said Timothy was his beloved son,
                                certainly not naturally but spiritually it must be. You are so well employed in doing
                                good where you are that I do not feel as yet it is the purpose of God to call you into
                                the regenerative work that I feel called to obev, not but it would be very pleasing to
                                me to see you come up into a work that is higher and better, than for you to remain in
                                your present sphere of action. In respect to your friend Edmunds, as a candidate for our
                                order of life, I scarcely know what to say, uot having had any previous acquaintance
                                with him, nor what opportunities he has had to acquaint himself with our life. It is
                                well to count the cost, lest he should find that, upon a trial, he is not able to build.
                                I can appreciate his dietetic views full as well as any in this Society or perhaps any
                                other, but those views can go but so far as preparation. It very much depends on what
                                ground he holds them as preparatory for oar life. If he holds them merely as for health
                                or economy, without reference to the divine end, they would not help him much into our
                                life ; indeed, they would rather retard as he would be in danger of enforcing his views
                                on others ; thus producing conflict and inharmony in the body. In respect to his
                                fondness for children, it would very much depend how far that went, to qualify him to be
                                an inmate with us. You are a man of experience, and you will at once perceive that there
                                is a risk<pb n="248" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> in taking any one into a social relation without a
                                previous acquaintance. If he is sincerely convicted that it is his duty to forsake a
                                worldly life, and if he is sincerely desirous of finding salvation from sin and a sinful
                                life, and if he is willing to lay himself on the altar of self-sacrifice and to yield
                                himself up to the guidance of experience then I should say he had better pay us a visit
                                and see for himself, before any permanent steps be taken for admittance as a novitiate
                                in our order. I am prompted to write as well as I know for his good and the cause of
                                good. It would be very pleasing to us all when you can come and make us a visit. I think
                                a closer acquaintance with the life we are living will convince you that it promotes
                                perfect freedom of the will and conscience, and is the only way whereby the human will
                                can be brought into submission to the divine will. J. P. Greaves will find this to be
                                truth before he can realize of what lie wrote. In love to yourself and family and friend

                            ocean, where Many millions have rendered up their souls, And laid their bodies down among
                            the strange And countless wonders of its trackless vault. I love the wave, the foam, the
                            bounded shore. I love the sunlight gleaming through the blue, And clouds that 'mid them
                            sail, and all the gifts They give throughout the year. The dews, the stars&gt; The breezes that
                            make glad the summer time. I love the daisied meadows and the lambs, The waving golden grain
                            and tasseled corn, And all the mellow fruits of harvest time. How grand the thundering in
                            the awful dark, The vivid flash, and rolls of ebon mist, And rainbows painted in the evening
                            sky. Behold the mountain-tops and sylvan slopes, Fountains, canons, cataracts, rocky cliffs,
                            indeed I cannot: tell it all, but well I love, Yea more, I fill with ecstasy, and pant Amid
                            the palpitations of my heart, So awed am I, wondering how God could Have made them so. I
                            love the happy soul Who walks and lives among these things, and loves Them too; Through them
                            is known the great kind His handiwork, omnipotence and power. [God, And 'mong them all, most
                            dearly truly loved Is my good home, sweet home, all circled round With these unfailing
                            lovely gifts. If things External could the soul's eternal grace Insure, and give to life
                            below and life Beyond, the joy and treasure it would gain, Then would our living be
                            complete; no sound Of discord would there be, nor strife nor woe, So perfect would the
                            concord be. But sad Enough, much evil born to multiply Has entered every human heart, and
                            darkened With its clouds and graceless images The holy light, and robbed mortality Of bliss,
                            its just and rightful heritage. I love the truth, the virtues every one, The heart most
                            honest, true to consciousness of right; The brave, the noble, valiant in the cause That will
                            elevate to heaven all the race. The ever gentle truly Christian spirit That each day gives
                            out its gifts of gold In deeds and words well tried, and coined within The mint of faith,
                            and scattered with kind care.<pb n="249" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> I lore the wayward, erring, thankless,
                            With a pitying love that harbors no ill-will, And fain would pardon those who do me wrong. I
                            prize my counselors, companions, friends; The kiss that ministers sweet peace, and words
                            That teach the holy way of righteousness. I daily pra}' that 'mong the many things That
                            others love, they may love me, For I would win it by my toil, and strive To recompense it by
                            my humble gains. I often pray for angel care, and kind Direction, and all that will redeem
                            and Make me worthy of a privilege to live Upon God's earth, so glorious and great, So
                            beautiful, so grand and truly good. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Golden sheaf garnered home. In memory of eldress Hester Ann Adams" TEIform="index"/>A

See ! he thrusts it in and

                            sheaf of grain. She has heard the joyful summons Freeing her from earthly pain. O the joj
                            she feels at greeting, Those we're sure were there to guide, O the happiness of meeting
                            Loved ones on the other side. As she meets our own beloved, Will she look this way again, On

                                    span of well-kept horses ; brother Daniel whose face, round and rosy as a winter
                                    apple, beamed with placid content and cordial welcome. Our small party had just
                                    arrived at. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., the home of a large body of Shakers, in company with
                                    Elder F. W. Evans, and at his invitation, in order to study the domestic and
                                    religious life of that curious sect of which the world knowr. so little. After we
                                    had mounted the high vehicle the horses' heads were turned, the mountains looming
                                    upon the eastern horizon, up which the road winds, by a gentle acclivity, for a mile
                                    or more before reaching the Shaker Village. On either side the fertile lands
                                    belonging to the community extend for a distance of six miles or so by more than
                                    half that width, directly on the road leading from Lebanon Springs to Pittsfield,
                                    Mass., nine miles distant, embracing pasturage, forests, upland meadows, orchards,
                                    and rich intervales. Every<pb n="250" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> acre shows the industry, thrift and
                                    intelligent management of its owners, beginning with the massive walls which enclose
                                    it, "every stone of which," said Elder Evans, "was laid by consecrated han;!s." It
                                    is about a hundred years since these lands were bought by the zealous followers of
                                    Ann Lee, who settled here and have obtained great triumphs and received great
                                    persecutions. The first gathering of the Shakers into a community similar to that of
                                    the primitive Christian Church, under the leadership of two orthodox clergymen who
                                    had been converted to her belief, was just one hundred years ago. Fleeing from the
                                    deadly warfare of the old world to the witch-burning bigotry of the new, Mother Ann
                                    and her seven devoted followers could little have guessed how beautiful the scene
                                    would one day become, whore now toil and worship a peculiar people, the like of
                                    which the world has never known. In a few moments we reached the Colony known as the
                                    North Family, and saw before us several large rectangular buildings, set within a
                                    few rods of each other in the midst of flowering shrubbery, gardens and orchards.
                                    The buildings, destitute of piazzas, look stiff and bare in their coats of dazzling
                                    white, but the walks are trim and faultless ; the hillside laughs with luxuriant
                                    verdure, and the whole scene is one of quiet and smiling beauty. Brother Daniel
                                    stopped before the first building, where, on alighting, a Shakeress bade us welcome
                                    and led us through a long hall to our several rooms. This sister, whom we soon
                                    learned to know and highly regard as Eldress M., devoted herself with the refinement
                                    of a perfect lady, to our comfort. In fact all witbj whom we came in contact seemed
                                    to have found that golden mean where, without officiousness or neglect, they were
                                    ready to give the "reason of their being.'' In address, the leaders among the
                                    Shakers might easily stand before princes and kings. Eldress M.�and to describe her
                                    is to describe all,�was clad in a quaint costume very much like that worn in country
                                    places in the days of Mother Ann. After a time, its stiff simplicity exercises a
                                    certain attraction upon the visitor. By it age is softened and the mode-ty of youth
                                    enhanced, and one learns to regret its clear outlines and delicate coloring after
                                    returning to the absurdities of worldlv dress. It consists of a self-colored frock,
                                    full and plain in the skirt, which is laid in large, pressed plaits from waist to
                                    hem. The tint is always pleasant to the eye, either dove color, dun, soft brown,
                                    pale lavender or plum. Across the bust a large white kerchief "half conceals and
                                    half reveals" the form, and from its upper folded edge rises an underkerchief, or
                                    collar white as the throat it encircles. A cap of snowy gauze covers the head and
                                    comes well over the thoughtful and placid face. Until within a year or two all the
                                    materials for clothing and bedding save plain cotton, were home-spun and woven as
                                    well as home-made. "Why do you wear such lovely changeable silks every day?" was
                                    asked of Eldress A.�a lady of great culture, sweetness and refinement. "Feel of it,"
                                    she replied laughingly. "Instead of changeable silk it is home-made worsted, woven
                                    in our own looms more than thirty years ago. This skirt has been made over and<pb n="251" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> pressed and new waists have been fitted to it again and
                                    again." On examination it proved to have been spun with almost hair-like fineness
                                    from long-wool merino, dyed wine-color and then used as a filling for dark blue
                                    cotton warp, making a cloth as beautiful as it is indestructible. No more such
                                    material will ever be woven, and the few uncut remaining pieces are cherished as
                                    mementoes of early days. Truth compels us to say that the home-spun coats of the
                                    Brethren are ueither so well-fitting or becomiug as the clothing of the Sisters,
                                    though the same care has been bestowed upon them. But the home-woven blankets are
                                    soft, even, fine and warm. The guest rooms at Mt. Lebanon consist of four good-sized
                                    sitting-rooms, each with its large airy bed-room, containing two single beds.
                                    Husbands and wives occupy separate jooms while under the Shaker roof. These rooms
                                    are models of purity, for cleanliness is a part of the Shaker creed. The middle of
                                    the floor is covered with rag-carpeting made from new strips of listing, bound and
                                    made in sections for ease in frequent shakings, and no dirt ever dares to gather on
                                    the shining painted flooring at the edge. The sashes are raised and lowered and the
                                    fine hair mattresses and bedding undergo a thorough airing daily according to a
                                    certain method devised by themselves, and are then made into snowy mounds at a fixed
                                    hour, for perfect ventilation and perfect order are also parts of their religion. An
                                    indescribable air of purity pervades everything, and it takes little perception to
                                    see that this purity is a portion of the mental and moral as well as physical
                                    atmosphere of this Shakerian home. Within the same building are the work-rooms where
                                    clothing is cut and made, and store-rooms, cool and sweet. Underneath is the dairy,
                                    filled with cans of golden cream, and butter fragrant as the breath of yonder
                                    Holstein cows, stabled in that lofty stone barn filled with every appurtenance of
                                    bovine luxury and the just pride of all Shakerdom. Truly if there is perfect
                                    housekeeping within, the farming without lags not behind. A few rods back of the
                                    guest-house is the dwelling of the Shakers. At one end are the rooms of the
                                    Brethren, furnished like those of the Sisters, who have charge of them. Two or four
                                    room together in large many-windowed apartments, always furnished with single beds.
                                    The house, the occupants and iheir occupations are presided over by two elders and
                                    two eldresses, selected for those peculiar qualities and experiences which would
                                    alone render them fit to hold such relations to sixty or seventy men, women and
                                    children of all temperaments and many nationalities. On this point it is enough to
                                    say that the intentions and character of each novitiate are carefully investigated,
                                    and that scandal among them is unknown. The heredity of a child is studied before it
                                    is accepted as an inmate ; when once a member of the family its natural proclivities
                                    are considered and its u gifts" given room for free expansion. The school-room is
                                    provided with apparatus and a museum, and the little schoolmistress is dearly loved
                                    by her charges. While the Shakers believe celibacy to be the highest form of life,
                                    they respect the institution of marriage, concede that only a few are called to join
                                    their number and be separate from the world.<pb n="252" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> Rather do they
                                    look to see their principles slowly spread over the earth and uplift its iuhabitauts
                                    to a higher plane of thought and action. For integrity and justice, as well as for
                                    breadth of sympathy and hope for the future of humanity, it may be safely asserted
                                    they have no superior. All are hard workers, leaders and teachers, as well as common
                                    members. Rising before five o'clock in the morning, each group of men and women
                                    repair to their respective duties. Two sisters take charge of the dining-room, two
                                    of the bake-room, and two of the kitchen,�the latter a large handsome room fitted
                                    with every convenience and exquisite with its well-oiled floor and rows of burnished
                                    sauce-pans. The Brethren have devised unheard of comforts for the in-door workers,
                                    and the visitor leaves with the feeling of pity for the housewife who does her
                                    cooking in the ordinary way. Here every step tells, every movement counts.
                                    Co-operative work can point to no greater triumph than in Shaker house-keeping. In
                                    the dining room the men sit at one table, the women at the other. The food is of the
                                    best quality and generous in quantity. Almost no use is made of flesh-food and
                                    home-grown and ground cereals are cooked to perfection. Such vegetables, plucked
                                    within the hour, and such pies, shortened with sweet cream and filled with fresh
                                    fruit or that preserved by their own peculiar process, we mutually confessed to have
                                    never tasted before. All the work is done by the Sisters who have their seasons of
                                    leisure and repose. Running water brought from large springs gushing from the
                                    mountain side grinds the grain, churns the butter, rocks the washing machine, cools
                                    the huge refrigerator, and being heated, warms the house in winter. Strung along "
                                    Shaker Village," half a mile or so apart, are seven such colonies as this of the
                                    North Family, each numbering from thirty to a hundred members, all together beings
                                    called a community. Every family dwelling contains a large room called the
                                    "meeting-room," where several times each week the members congregate for social or
                                    religious purposes. At the former there is reading from books and periodicals and
                                    discussions upon topics of the time, in which both men and women take part. And it
                                    is safe to say that nowhere can there be found persons better informed upon history,
                                    politics, sociology and religion than those members of a religious community who
                                    have withdrawn themselves from the great world in order to live in purity, crucify
                                    selfishness, and subdue the animal propensities to the dominion of reason. "What
                                    have the Shakers ever originated?" we asked of one who had been a member of the
                                    order over sixty years, a Scotch gentleman, elegant, scholarly, of great experience,
                                    whose society is sought by some of the ablest of modern thinkers. He is a noble
                                    instance of one who has obeyed the laws of the higher life. In reply he demonstrated
                                    that the Shakers originated the drying of sweet corn for food ; they instituted the
                                    raising, papering and vending of garden seeds, and the raising, drying and
                                    preparation of medicinal herbs and roots for market. They also first manufactured
                                    medicinal vegetable extracts for market. They first raised broom brush and made it
                                    into brooms ; they made the first buzz<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> saw in this country ;
                                    they invented and used planing and matching machines for dressing, flooring and
                                    ceiling lumber. They also invented the making of cut nails by machinery; they first
                                    cut and bent card teeth and punched the leather for setting them, and lastly, the
                                    invention and use of the metallic pen is due to the inspiration of some of the
                                    Brethren at Watervliet, near Troy, N. Y. A long enough list for a body of people who
                                    at no time have numbered over five thousand souls. Every community has its
                                    Churchbuilding, open during the summer months ; at other times the meetings are held
                                    in the large family rooms used for social purposes. Bare, and spacious, with
                                    polished hard-wood floors and provided with movable beaches, they are open, on
                                    occasion, to Sunday spectators from more ornate forms of worship. At the appointed
                                    hour two long processions file noiselessly in, the Brethren ranging themselves upon
                                    the seats along the wall od one side, the Sisters on the other. It is an impressive
                                    sight these latter present, with naive, serene faces framed in spotless lace, each
                                    with an introspective, unworldly look that hushes the spectator into quiet awe. They
                                    bear large, white kerchiefs, and hymn books on which the hands are clasped, and
                                    these trim, quaint forms and downcast eyes, motionless and soundless, while the
                                    breeze whispers within and the shadows dance upon the wall, seem to belong to some
                                    pale ghosts of the past, clarified from all earthly passions, which have returned to
                                    remind their fellow-beings of that other world to which they hasten. A few moments
                                    and the spell is broken. The Elders rise, and the others following, range themselves
                                    in two opposite parallel lines. Some one strikes a note and the others join in a
                                    simple but thrilling song. One of the Elders, when this is finished, gives a brief
                                    and practical exhortation, instinct with high, religious aspiration, linked with
                                    intimations �f struggle and trial, temptation and triumph. How to subdue the lower
                                    nature to the rule of the higher, how to live aright in thought and deed, seem the
                                    burden of these remarks. Another song follows and then an exhortation, perhaps by a
                                    Shakeress, who here as in all other places is on terms of equality with the
                                    Brethren, till finally the time for marching is at hand. The best singers among
                                    their number group together facing each other in the middle of the room, and burst
                                    forth in a stirring march. This is emphasized by the beatin ; of the hands and an
                                    increased stress on the accented measures of the bar, with the body gently swaying
                                    forward and backward and the feet keeping time to the rhythm of the music. Round
                                    these singers circled the Shakers, men and women by themselves, all beating time
                                    with upward palms of the outstretched hands, and keeping time with the advancing
                                    feet. Sometimes the convolutions resembled simple figures in the marches of light
                                    gymnastics ; at others it wras a mere rhythmic procession. Enrapturing religious
                                    emotion was plainly visible on the faces of many ; a serious but joyful earnestness
                                    on others. In the scene there was nothing ludicrous, nothing unseemly. On the
                                    contrary more than one onlooker found himself deeply impressed by this form of
                                    worship in which the body is recognized as the temple of the Holy Spirit. The
                                    services ceased with as little ceremony as they began, and after mutual<pb n="254" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> greetings the members of each family return to their homes, which
                                    they regard with as much affection and pride as the members of a private family. Of
                                    this fact proof is shown in a variety of ways. kt When you see a good thing," said a
                                    Spanish philosopher, "put on a magnifying glass�" None is needed in regarding the
                                    Shakers. The social advantages they enjoy, their freedom from anxiety in regard to a
                                    livelihood, the conviction that labor meets with an honest reward, the satisfaction
                                    arising from wholesome, delightful and elevating environmeuts and associations,�all
                                    these are advantages not to be despised. It is no light thing to be shielded from
                                    want and wrong, to look forward with content to a life of repose and comfort. Yet
                                    agreeing with all this will not make a person a Shaker. There are vital underlying
                                    principles which must first be apprehended and embraced. There are not many who can
                                    sacrifice the stirring hopes and ambitions, loves and warfares which are a portion
                                    of the common lot, and so there are but few who desire to step aside from the roses
                                    and thorns of the ordinary pathway into that straight, well-fenced, verdurous road
                                    that leads into the fold of the Shakers.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Poughkeepsie eagle" TEIform="index"/>Poughkeepsie Eagle.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Read at the funeral of Brother Simon T.

                            we shall miss that busy step at early dawn, That wrought the deeds that built thy temple
                            fair; We see thee now in the silence of great death, Calm as the eternal hills upon whose
                            front Shines the soft radiance of a pure white day. We see the crystal beauty of thy Soul
                            Unclouded as the marble of thy face. And within our hearts we say, he is not dead, But
                            living in the glory of his work� In things accomplished that no fate can kill� In deeds
                            done, that grateful hearts still cherish. For he has lived for truth and manly deeds :
                            Touched with the spirit of our common weal. And so he passed, not like the petal blown, Or
                            like the floating mists of summer sky, But is immortal in that glorious life, That beats
                            from age to age in deathless man. Bright as the morning freshness of pure light, In this
                            fair memory he is emblazoned now. He is a part of the illustrious past Which naught can
                            change, and naught can dissipate. With what a solemn glory over life Death draws its mystic
                            and unfathorned grace; Its wealth may seem to perish, but transformed Becomes a brighter

                            Salvation, by which I mean that hidden series of soul experiences by which the spirit or
                            individual soul, is separated from the flesh, is a secret work. The growth and ripening of
                            grain is imperceptible to the outward eye, but the advance which the wheat has made is
                            observable, and when the proper time arrives the harvest is "saved,'' that is, separated and
                            stored. The divine admonition "Confer not with flesh and blood" is very important; to be
                            heedless of it subjects the "babe in Christ" to much tribulation. The spirit which brings
                            Salvation works in secret, each end which it accomplishes, in its order, is palpable, only,
                            when the end is reached for which the exercise was sent. The wind bloweth where it listeth,
                            we may hear the sound thereof but the end for which it blows and the source from whence it
                            comes, are hidden from the novice until he, or she, experiences the effects ; then is he
                            conscious that the Divinity has been at work within him, for he knows that he has "come up a
                            step higher." Following upon this is the assurance that, having come thus far on our journey
                            toward the Infinite, we shall go on and on, until "He" shall have put all carnal things
                            under his feet, then shall we be free indeed. Who would be willing to retard such mighty
                            work, fraught with such momentous consequences, by yielding to that love of display,
                            notoriety or approbation which has its being in the very core of human character? When the
                            subject has become "free" then, perhaps not till then, shall he know thaf "The Father"
                            seetli in secret, that his work, in the heart, is hidden from, and is intended to be hidden
                            from, common observation and comment ; that though the world does not know us and cannot
                            appreciate the work done within us, yet "He" knows us and it, and that we have been "saved"
                            and separated from the world's passion and approval and at last rendered willing that it
                            should be so. The skeptic may need "physical" manifestations to convince him that there is
                            another and more occult world, but those who look into their own souls, do not need that
                            "Spirit friends" should manifest for that purpose. Ah! no!! what the world of humanity most
                            needs to-day is to have its attention called to the sublime facts of the Divine "Spirit" and
                            to the world of mystery and sublimity within.�Sturgis, Mich.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Religion is the highest attribute in man's nature..." TEIform="index"/>

                            consciousness, the grand acme of thought and feeling, the supersensuous element that links
                            his soul to Divinity. It is that undefinable outreaching spirit, that ever seeks something
                            above and beyond itself, and those material substances which tether it to the earthly plane

A thing- should not be worn merely as an ornament. Read carefully the
                                    following. "Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair,
                                    and of wearing of gold and putting on of apparel." 1. Pet.iii,3. "And they gave unto
                                    Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all the earrings which were
                                    in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem." Gen. xxxv., 4.
                                    "And no man did put on him his ornaments." "And the children of Israel stripped
                                    themselves of their ornaments." Ex. xxxiii , 4,6 Also, Isa. iii., 16, 26. Putting on
                                    apparel for adorning is as plainly forbidden as gold or broidered hair. Ornaments
                                    are those parts of apparel known as trimmings, such as lace, fringes, embroidery,
                                    buttons, ribbons, braid, stripes of velvet, feathers, ruffles, flounces, bustles,
                                    etc. Christian parents are forbidden to put any of these things on their own
                                    clothing and that of their children, as mere ornaments, and would sin in doing so.
                                    God requires you to bring up your children in the "nurture and admonition of the
                                    Lord," and you are responsible for their proper teaching. 2. "Gold, and costly
                                    apparel." Wearing gold ornaments, chains, rings, pins, buttons, studs, etc., as
                                    ornaments is understood by spiritually minded persons to be meant, and apparel that
                                    is worn for its costliness, instead of its economy, its comfort, and its durability,
                                    is condemned. No appeal to Old Testament practices can justify the use of what is
                                    wrong in and of itself. Because David, that "man after God's own heart," committed
                                    murder, should not be taken as evidence that murder is right. 1 Cor. x., 11. A
                                    writer on the subject has well said : "The unholy women, as they do now, adopted a
                                    fashionable, worldly attire. They were known by their appearance. 'For they had
                                    golden earrings because they werelshmaelites.' Judges viii.,24. If they had been
                                    true Israelites they would not have had upon them these useless ornaments. In Isa.
                                    3rd chapter, the various modes that fashionable women adopted to render themselves
                                    attractive, are specifically mentioned and unsparingly condemned." Chas. G. Finney
                                    said: "What does that gaudy ribbon, and thpse ornaments upon your dress say to every
                                    one that meets you? It makes the impression that you wish to be thought pretty. Take
                                    care ! You might just as well write on your clothes : 'No truth in religion.' It
                                    says 'Give me dress, give me fashion, give me flattery and I am happy.' The world
                                    understands this testimony as you walk the streets. You are living epistles, known
                                    and read of all men. Only let Christians act consistently and heaven will rejoice,
                                    and hell groan at their influence. But, O, let them fill their ears with ornaments
                                    and their fingers with rings�let them put feathers in their hats, clasps upon their
                                    arms, and heaven puts on the robes of mourning, and hell may hold a jubilee " Bishop
                                    Weaver said � If there were two heavens, one where Jesus is all and in all, and the
                                    other with a Paris in it, I presume the road to the Paris heaven would be crowded
                                    with fashionable Christains." Dr. Judson says : "During the years you have been
                                    wearing these useless ornaments many...... have gone down to hell, with a lie in
                                    their right hand, having never heard of the true and only Savior ! The Holy Bible
                                    and valuable tracts might have been more extensively circulated in heathen lands had
                                    you not been afraid of being thought unfashionable and not "like other folks," had
                                    you not preferred adorning your persons, and cherishing the sweet, seductive feeling
                                    of vanity and pride." What should Christians do? Rev. Albert Sims says : 1. "Aim
                                    directly at pleasing God�dress so as to have God bless you in the dress. 2. Aim at
                                    promoting the health of the body; it is God's Temple. Dress on sanitary principles.
                                    3. Let the dress be made so as to promote neatness, tidiness, simplicity, and good
                                    taste not slouchily and repulsively. 4. Dress so that a sound reason can be given
                                    for the wearing of every article. 5. Let your dress be a rebuke to fashion and
                                    extravagance, and a Model worthy of imitation. 6. Do not be afraid to profess
                                    religion by your dress. Do not shrink from the singularity of being right in this
                                    particular."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="War cry" TEIform="index"/> War Cry.</bibl></cit></p><pb n="257" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Be kind" TEIform="index"/>BE KIND.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Whitcher, Mary" TEIform="persName"/>Mary Whitcher.</byline><p TEIform="p">Ne'er turn away for one misstep That's taken by a friend, But patient wait and give them time

                                    teacher can do as much as the preacher. Christ did not preach to a great multitude
                                    after his resurrection, or show himself to many, but walked for several miles along
                                    the Emmaus road with two discouraged disciples. Christ left the crowded streets to
                                    address Matthew at the custom house, and turned from the multitude to call Nathaniel
                                    from under the fig tree. The great crowd did not get a sermon from Christ the day he
                                    paused to use his personal influence with Zacheus in the sycamore tree. The Savior
                                    made such use of personal influence as to show how to win souls to the Gospel by it.
                                    In this we should copy after him. We, too, can stop a moment by the old well to
                                    point some poor woman to the waters of eternal life. We, too, can pause by the
                                    roadside to talk to some passing friend about his soul's welfare. The magnetism of
                                    personal attention is wonderful in power. Wield it over the children; by it draw
                                    your irreligious friends to Christ; try its reviving power with those who never go
                                    to church. Consecrate your personal influence to Christ, and then let it, like the

                                present this so plainly that there need be no mistake in the forcing of a correct
                                understanding. " By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and
                                keep his commandments." The interest which we manifest in the keeping of the laws of God
                                will go far in determining the depth of our honesty. There is among the professors of
                                Christianity and, indeed, among all other classes of men, a general understanding of
                                what sin is, and the duty devolving upon mankind to suppress it, "for sin is a
                                transgression of the Law, " or a transgression of the light which has been received into
                                the mind. As it was the mission of Jesus to preach a system of righteousness, more
                                exalted toward the realms of spirituality than was ever before known, so it was within
                                his mission to publish a new commandment and at the same time, zealously to stimulate
                                his followers to fulfill in their lives, the Mosaic commandments, and the God given
                                testimonies of the prophets. As a faithfulness in this work of self-discipline was
                                necessary to lead the soul to God, so it was equally necessary to establish the soul in
                                the Christ Life. A state or condition where one can with confidence say as did the
                                Apostle. "I am persuaded that ueither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
                                nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, shall be able
                                to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." A good Jew was
                                a man blessed of God, and the Psalmist has made this observation, " I have been young,
                                and now I am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging
                                bread." This testimony, so full of comforting assurance to the '' follower after
                                righteousness" has reference to a people who lived under the Law. After an experience of
                                3000 years and the claiming of a greatly advanced position in all that pertains to a
                                religious life, the Christian Church, of to-day could not, in confidence, say so much in
                                favor of its own disciples. Jesus was more than a good Jew. He was spiritually baptized
                                into an element of righteousness, that made him superlatively, a man of God, and a
                                Redeemer of mankind. In accepting this position before men ; "dealing honestly and
                                loving mercy," a course so at variance with the Jewish Church of his day, that it is
                                said of him, "He increased in<pb n="259" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> wisdom and statue, and in favor with
                                God and man." Referring to his gospel work, he says, "Think not that I am come to
                                destroy the Law, or the prophets : I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." "Follow
                                me." Those who lived under the law and in the power of the prophets, were judged by the
                                Law and compensated, " in basket and in store," agreeably to the promise of that
                                dispensation of God's light to man. Had the Jews claimed the right to live as did the
                                antediluvians, by bringing into the Jewish Church all the defilements of that sensual
                                people, they would have done no more than is claimed as the right of the Christian
                                church of the nineteenth century. The new commandment from the spirit of God,�'"Follow
                                me," mast have a vital, spiritual significance, a divine baptism of the Holy Spirit,
                                that will save us from the sins of the world, and give to us that power which will
                                enable us to subdue the selfishness of our own hearts, or it becomes of less value than
                                "sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal." The Christ Life is a life of self-denial and a
                                renunciation of the life of the world. All must be consecrated to God. It is the
                                crucifixion of the man of sin and the resurrection into spiritual life, where peace and
                                righteousness shall form the foundation upon which man shall live and work.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The nearer the earth we are, the smaller we find the circle..."

                                        sick man worse. I believe many a man has been hurried across the dark river by
                                        his horrible, soul-depressing treatment, who might have become well and strong

                                        to die. At that time no one was allowed to leave the army for a visit to the

                                        comrade. I saw Marcy and said to him : Now, Marcy, you say you are going to die.
                                        If that is so, I don't suppose a few days one way or the other will make much

                                        get a leave of absence. Now, if you want to do me a very great favor and will

                                        to the above subject, will you receive another view? That man can best subsist
                                        on the direct products of the vegetable kingdom, is either a scientific truth or
                                        a fallacy. The founder of Hygeio-Therapy believed it to be an important truth,
                                        and regarded it as a cornerstone of his system, and if it cannot be maintained
                                        the whole structure must topple. Dr. Sanborn in his first article expresses the
                                        idea that flesh contains little or no nutriment. No other vegetarian, that we
                                        are aware of, has advanced this view. Vegetarians admit that flesh is a
                                        nutritious food, and that man may live in health to a good old age, eating it
                                        daily, with a good proportion of vegetable products. But Dr. Walter is quite as
                                        misleading where he claims that "it is not true that the mental and physical
                                        vigor, especially the former, of the vegetable eater, ever has, or ever can,
                                        equal, let alone surpass, that of him who eats food transformed and reorganized
                                        by the animal for the use of him." Pythagoras, Plato, Epicurus, Plutarch, Sir
                                        Isaac Newton, Milton, Swedenborg, Shelly, John Howard, John Wesley, and many
                                        others who were vegetarians can hardly be sat down upon in regard to mental
                                        power by any modern writer. Daniel and his companions not only "appeared fairer
                                        and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat of the king's meat,"
                                        but, "in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king enquired of them,
                                        he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were
                                        in his realm."�[Daniel i., 15-20.] "Enquirer" asks Dr. Walter why, if meats are
                                        better adapted to the need of man�"because they have been brought vnearer to the
                                        structure of the human organism than the vegetable products,"�may we not
                                        logically conclude that human flesh would be the best food of all? This would be
                                        the natural inference from this kind of logic, which if true, we ask why do
                                        carniverous animals prefer for their food the vegetable-eating animals? Because
                                        the flesh of animals appears to be nearer the structure of the human organism it
                                        does not follow that it is man's most suitable food. If man's digestive
                                        machinery be adjusted to assimilate a different kind of food, it will keep in
                                        good condition longer by performing the work for which it was designed, as tills
                                        is a rule which applies to all nature's works. It is well known that men are
                                        more happy, more healthy, and longer lived, who use their faculties of body and
                                        mind, than those who live in idleness. Then it does not follow that because food
                                        is easily digested in the stomach that it is the best in all respects. Important
                                        changes take place in the liver in what is called "after digestion," in which
                                        the liver performs an important part, particularly in the metabolism of
                                        albuminoids. Dr. J. Milner Fothergill says : "There can be no question about Hie
                                        fact that with some persons vegetable albuminoids are much more easily digested
                                        than animal albuminoids." Dr. B. W. Richardson, equally as good authority, than
                                        which there can be no better on physical science, in a recent lecture on the
                                        food of man, says : "From experimental observation which I have made, I am of
                                        the opinion that vegetable flesh-forming substances may be as easily digested
                                        when they are properly presented to the stomach as animal substances of like
                                        quality." In taking the testimony of personal experience we must consider the
                                        habits of the individual. The digestive machinery of the flesh eater has a
                                        different adjustment to that of the fruit and grain eater and in man has the
                                        power of adaptation to circumstances. Man therefore may become so adapted to the
                                        use of pernicious substances as to seem to require them. That many find no
                                        trouble in digesting flesh, but would be distressed by a meal of fruit ard grain
                                        is true, others will feel happy while chewing tobacco and be miserable without
                                        it. This shows how much an unexplained fact is worth. Thousands of men, having
                                        become con-<pb n="261" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> vinced of the evil of tobacco using, for
                                        example, have given it up only to return to it with their chains of habit
                                        revived, and all their courage for another trial gone, whereas by right
                                        management for the first few days, they might have become masters of themselves
                                        as when evil habits are removed nature readily restores normal conditions. There
                                        is also a necessity of good management in changing a life-long habit of diet,
                                        and many have failed for lack of this, who with it would easily have succeeded.
                                        The practice of using flesh as a portion of food being almost universal by the
                                        people of this country there are very few advocates of the vegetarian theory; as
                                        men of good scientific attainments are apt to be influenced in their teachings
                                        by their perverted proclivities and conditions. Dr. B. W- Richardson, above
                                        quoted, a flesh eater, can rise above his idiosyncrasies, and referring to man's
                                        food, he said: "Evidence on this question can only be derived from two sources,
                                        the one physical, and the other mural. In searching for physical evidence it is
                                        necessary to turn to the construction of man, and to ask whether by his build
                                        and construction he was formed for animal food * * * * On the whole my judgment
                                        on the evidence of the teeth is in favor of tlie vegetarian system. * * * If
                                        from the teeth we pass to the subject of the process of digestion which goes on
                                        in the mouth, the evidence, as far as it goes, is also in favor of the
                                        vegetarian theory. The secretion of saliva is clearly a provision for vegetable
                                        food and not for animal. * * * * Taking into consideration the whole facts
                                        connected with this structure of man, the inference was justified, that in spite
                                        of the very long time which man had been subjected to an animal diet, he
                                        retained in preponderance his original and natural taste for an innocent diet
                                        derived from the first fruit of the earth. * * * * In my long medical career I
                                        have known no instance in which a child had not preferred fruit to animal food,
                                        and it is a lesson learned from experience that the next natural diet for the

                                        for his food, would be to show an inharmony in his creation, and thus we must
                                        consider that could it be proven that mental and physical strength could be

                                        its lakes and rivers well supplied with fishes, may have found an excuse in
                                        their necessity, in using them for food, but its continuance in these days when
                                        that wilderness has been transformed into grain fields and orchards, making it
                                        necessary to breed animals for the slaughter, or transport them from the far
                                        West, must be attributed to perverted appetite and to misguidance by those who
                                        are looked to as teachers in this matter. �J. Harvey Lovell, M.

                                it not in your hearts? And how large a field for action is spread before you in this
                                spiritual vineyard, where you ought to work earnestly and perseveringly all the time,
                                laboring while it is day. If you are faithful workers you will find your time and
                                talents fully employed, and your lives can be made noble and beautiful by unswerving
                                adherence to truth and virtue. " Work to-day in my vineyard." Give especial thought to
                                the second word in this command. The command is not for next year or next w^ek; not even
                                to-morrow is left for your choosing or convenience, but, work to-day. There is no safety
                                in "putting off." You cannot promise yourselves tomorrow. It may belong to your
                                eternity. Your hour for action is the present one.<pb n="262" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> Work now. Now
                                is to you the golden moment. Use it wisely. "To-day is yours, improve to-day, Nor trust
                                to-morrow's distant ray." The future will take care of itself if you take care of the
                                present. To-day is the time appointed for doing what the Savior bids you, without
                                hesitation or complaint. But some grow careless and thoughtless, and see not the
                                importance of such work. So many refuse to do this bidding, to follow the Savior, to
                                walk in his footsteps and imitate his virtues. So many wait for the "more convenient
                                season" that will never come, missing the real happiness they might enjoy in obeying
                                Him, and they must feel regret over misspent time. Resolve that such an experience shall
                                not be yours. Take each hour as a gift intrusted to you for use and improvement, and
                                labor in such a manner that your time shall not be wasted or its results laid up as
                                witnesses against you. And when you give an account of your stewardship, may you be
                                found worthy to receive the reward, "Well done, good and faithful servants." Your

                                    taljj Of the descending rain. "I've come to take that plant in charge : I'll try to
                                    make this tree In fruit as full in limb as large, As yonder one you see." So, on
                                    this gracious mission bent That day and night it fell Until its forces all were
                                    spent, Alas ! and sad to tell! Fresher! no larger seemed the tree Than it had been
                                    before, Wasted this rainfall seemed to be And kindness more than all. 'Twas morn: A
                                    sunbeam on its way Came warm and strong and bright; It said : "I'll take yon weakly
                                    thing And make a tree of might." But when night came, greener, perhaps, Not larger
                                    seemed the tree. Wasted the sunshine with the hours elapse? All, so it seemed to be
                                    ! Then gently fell the drops of dew On every leaf and twig, With the same object
                                    still in view, It said : "To-night it shall grow big." The proper elements in air
                                    And in the soil combined, Each in its turn worked silently, The same results to
                                    find. A few more leaflets than before, A little stronger grown The merest hint�and
                                    nothing more Of influence it had known. Ten years ! Again I pass that way, I look;
                                    behold a tree, Whose branches, leaves, and fruit display Great beauty�majesty. Not
                                    rain, nor sun, nor dew, nor food Alone, the work could claim, But all combined and
                                    oft renewed In time, receive the fame. So, often, men will plan some great And noble
                                    work to do. They labor hard, impatient wait The quick result to view. But oft comes
                                    disappointment -'een When after all is done, They cannot see the progress made By
                                    seeds on wayside sown. And then another comes to try By other methods quite, A
                                    little added growth espy, Perhaps it shines more bright. A third and fourth then
                                    take the work Striving to finish fast; Put forth what hidden force may lurk, And
                                    still, the work all these out-lasts, And many years must intervene, And many workers
                                    throw Deep love, strong labor, in between, Ere sought results will show. One sows,
                                    one reaps ; no one can boast, "I shall receive the praise." He little does who does
                                    the most, And short the longest days; But none of these can be excused Because their
                                    part seems small. The widow's mite was not refused But counted more than all; What
                                    seemed but wasted almost lost Sometime will all be seen� Life-work on marble-shnft

                                        with the family of Shakers at Canterbury, N. H. She embraced their faith in
                                        early life, and in 1843 was appointed to the order of the ministry, which office
                                        she filled with great acceptance until 1859, when she was transferred and chosen

                                years, four months and twelve days. He has lived in the Society eighty years. In 1833 he
                                was appointed one of the trustees. In 1847 he became Senior trustee, in which office he
                                spent the remainder of his life. Even at his advanced age the Society sustains an
                                irreparable loss. His diligence in business cannot be excelled and has few equals. His
                                integrity bears not the taint of suspicion. Punctuality was prominent among his many
                                virtues. It was no fault of his if all accounts were not cancelled in due time. Some one
                                has said, "In the open hand of death we have only what we gave, what we keep we lose."
                                Then his wealth must be great who gave all he had�a whole long and arduous life for the
                                common good. In storms and adversities he was oak and rock never faltering in duty. Duty
                                was the dial on which he measured time. Now that the duties of life have all heen well
                                done, and the sun touches the western horizon, and lengthening shadows slant towards the
                                east, then surrounded by friends the harvester comes with a strain of music. So much
                                departed worth is felt by a large circle of acquaintances whose memory they cherish with
                                respect.</p></div3><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sneeden, Betsey" TEIform="index"/>Betsey Sneeden
