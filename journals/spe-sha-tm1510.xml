SIX LITTLE WOEDS.
Six little words arrest me every day;
I ought, must, can�I will, I dare, I may.
I ought�'tis conscience' law, divinely writ
Within my heart�the goal I strive to hit.
I must�this warns me that my way is barred,
Either by Nature's law or custom hard.
I can�in this is summed up all my might,
Whether to do, or know, or judge aright.
I will�my diadem, by the soul imprest
With freedom's seal�the ruler in my breast.
I dare�at once a motto for the seal,
And, dare I? barrier 'gainst unlicensed zeal.
I may�is final, and at once makes clear
[appear,
The way which else might vague and dim
I ought, must, can�I will, I dare, I may;
These six words claim attention every day,
Only through Thee, know I what every day.
I ought, I must, I can, I will, I dare, I may.

                            the world concerning the first founders of this Society, many candid and respectable people
                            have expressed a desire to receive from living witnesses, belonging to the Society, a true
                            statement of facts respecting its first rise in this country, and especially concerning the
                            character and manners, moral and religious, of the first founders and leaders. As I was one
                            among the first who embraced the faith and tenets of the Society, and have had a general
                            knowledge of the circumstances of its rise and establishment, and was intimately acquainted
                            with Mother Ann Lee, and the first Elders and leaders, I shall endeavor to give a little
                            sketch of j facts which came under my own observation at different times and places. Having
                            received intelligence of a strange people living in the wilderness above Albany, who came
                            from England, and who attracted considerable attention on account of the new and very
                            singular religion which they professed, I felt an inclination to visit them. Accordingly, in
                            the fore part of June, 1780, I set out one Saturday morning, in company with a number of
                            other young people, to go and see them, with a view to attend their meeting the next day. As
                            I was, at that time, about 18 years of age, of an airy turn of mind, and full of vanity, I
                            did not go with the expectation of getting or seeing any good ; but merely to gratify my
                            curiosity, as I had heard that they were exercised with singular and strange operations. But
                            when I came to see the people and their worship, and<pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> heard their
                            testimony and observed the remarkable operations which attended them, my mind was struck
                            with the fear of God, and I was fully convinced that the power of God was there. Mother
                            Ann's appearance seemed truly beauteous and heavenly, while walking the floor under the
                            beautiful operations of the power of God : such Godly fear and heavenly love I never beheld
                            in any person before. As my mind, at that time, was not biased with any kind of prejudice,
                            neither in favor of the people nor against them, I could look on with an impartial eye, and
                            felt able to judge with candor. The beautiful singing of Mother Ann so attracted my feelings
                            that I was really delighted with it; and indeed no one could listen to it "without
                            admiration; even her very countenance could not but inspire a heavenly sensation. In passing
                            by me, as she walked the floor, she turned to me and said, "Young man, you must wait with
                            patience; your time is not come yet. " This she repeated several times, which inspired me
                            with a feeling of reverential love. What it meant I could not then comprehend; but I kept my
                            feelings from my companions. After returning home and reflecting on what I had seen and
                            heard, I found that I was not yet prepared to take up a full cross against the world, the
                            flesh and all evil, according to the testimony which Mother had held forth. I was very
                            proud, and was not willing to let my faith and feelings be known to my nearest friends. So I
                            went on, consulting my own feelings, and trying to pray to God and keep myself from sin ;
                            but I found I was not able to resist temptations, and was frequently overcome in many ways,
                            until I drew up a determination to take up my cross and confess my sins as soon as I could
                            get a suitable opportunity. After this, I had power to resist temptations, which
                            strengthened me in my resolution. Persecutions soon arose, and through the malicious
                            influence of 'those who hated the cross, and were determined to put a stop to the increase
                            of the work of God, Mother and the Elders were imprisoned in Albany, together with a number
                            of leading characters who had embraced their faith, from New Lebanon. This prevented me from
                            visiting them again until a little before Mother was separated from the rest of her
                            companions, and sent to Poughkeepsie jail, when I visited them in prison, and still found
                            them the same wonderful people, still bearing a powerful testimony against all sin, with a
                            courage and fortitude which remained entirely unshaken by their imprisonment. Though
                            confined within the walls of a prison, they could speak the word of God through the grates
                            of the prison to multitudes of people with undiminished confidence in that divine authority
                            by which they were commissioned. In this prison I had a privilege to fulfill my promise, and
                            confessed my sins to one of the Elders. Ever after this I found increasing strength to bear
                            a testimony to others, and to keep my justification and live in obedience to the
                            instructions which I had received from Mother and the Elders. After they were released from
                            prison, I had many opportunities with them at Watervliet, Harvard. Ashfield, Hancock New
                            Lebanon and Stephentown ; and I always found their example to correspond with their
                            teaching. They maintained an inflexible and undeviating testimony against all dishonesty,
                            fraud, covetous-<pb n="219" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>ness, injustice, slothfulness, idleness, hypocrisy,
                            lies, lust, pride, fleshly affections, and intemperance of every kind. They taught us to be
                            prudent and saving in all things that God had entrusted to our care: for (said they,) "� you
                            cannot make one grain of corn, nor one spear of grass grow without the blessing ot God."
                            They taught these things by example as well as by precept; for they were remarkably prudent
                            in all these things. Mother always manifested great concern for the protection of those who
                            had set out to take up their crosses against a carnal nature, and follow Christ in the
                            regeneration. Knowing that we were unskillful and unacquainted with the subtilities and
                            wiles of Satan, and were exposed to be caught in his snares many ways, she spared no pains,
                            day nor night, to teach us how to shun the snares ol the adversary. She would often speak to
                            the young people after this manner : " See that you do not lay temptations to provoke carnal
                            desires in each other; but shun every appearance of evil. Ye young women, see that you
                            behave modestly in all your manners before the young men, and in no wise entice them. And
                            you young men, see that you lay no temptation before the young women, as they are the weaker
                            vessel. But if they should be overcome iu their feelings, and offer themselves to you, stand
                            ye like men of God, and teach them the consequences of those things, and save yourselves and
                            them." Mother also taught the married people to be careful, and see that they laid no snares
                            for each other. "But do your duty to each other in the fear of God, (said she,) and love one
                            another as Christ loves the Church. Christ never had carnal knowledge of the Church ; so you
                            must labor to subdue a carnal nature in yourselves ; and in so doing, you may be helps to
                            each other. And be agreed to bring up your children in the fear of God, and be careful to
                            govern them. See that while one is correcting a child, the other does not take the child's
                            part; for that will spoil the child, and neither of you will be able to govern your
                            children." Thus did she instruct the married and the unmarried, each according to their
                            situation and circumstances, and spared no pains to plant the principles of purity and
                            righteousness in all. And all who were faithful and obedient to her instructions, found an
                            increasing victory over the nature of evil, and proved the truth of her testimony by their
                            own experience. Many evil reports have been circulated in the world against Mother and the
                            Elders, in which they have been stigmatized as the basest of characters. Those who continued
                            to obey the light of God revealed to them through Mother and the Elders, received the fruits
                            of their labors, which are righteousness and peace, and a justified conscience. The truth
                            is, Mother saw the loss of man to be in the lust of the flesh, and took up her cross against
                            that fallen nature, iu all its branches, and labored in sufferings and cries to God for
                            deliverance from it. She continued to labor for mortification and death to that nature until
                            she found complete redemption from it, for all her conduct clearly showed it; and I have not
                            the least doubt that she was so in the sight of a pure and holy God. Hence she was able to
                            teach and lead other souls out of that corrupt nature ; and her testimony<pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> was like a naming sword against it in all its branches. This was so opposite to the
                            nature and feelings of fallen man, that she and her testimony were both despised and hated.
                            And this has been the cause of all the evil reports that have been spread abroad against her
                            and her followers. I can testify that all those slanderous reports are without the smallest
                            foundation in truth. When I take a view of the goodness of God in calling me from the course
                            of the world, in the prime of life and in the height of youthful vanity, to take up my cross
                            and embrace the gospel of Chriot's second appearance, through Mother Ann, I feel myself
                            under the greatest obligations of thankfulness to God : for this gospel has saved me from
                            the pollutions that are in the world through lust. And I am confident that the gospel which
                            is able to save me from sin in this world, will save me from the punishment of sin, which is
                            death and hell, in the world to come. By strict obedience to the orders and counsels which
                            have been graciously given by Mother Ann, and those who have stood as her successors in the
                            lead, I have found that degree of mortification and death to all carnal inclinations, that
                            instead of feeling desirable, they are odious and loathsome to every feeling of my soul. And
                            I can truly say, that the comfort and peace I daily enjoy in the gospel, more than repays me
                            for all the crosses I have taken up, besides the assurance I feel of eternal happiness
                            hereafter. Therefore I can testify by my own experience, to the truth of our Savior's
                            promise : '' There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
                            mother, or wife or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive an
                            hundred fold now in this time, houses and lands, brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and
                            children, with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life." (See Mark x : 29, 30.)
                            After having forsaken all for the gospel I have received an hundred fold of heavenly
                            blessings and gospel union, with parents and elders, brethren and sisters, which I would not
                            exchange for all the glory, riches and honors of this world. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Interesting discourse delivered at South Union, KY" TEIform="index"/> An Interesting

                            joy.�Isa. lxv., 17, IS. Mankind in general seem not to know that God hath established in
                            their midst the long promised new earth and new heavens and set up His kingdom therein,
                            which will never have an end. It has come upon them unawares, " as a thief in the night,"
                            and being yet in the mustard seed form it has not been visible to the world at large ; but.
                            as promised, it will yet spread to the ends of the earth. Although existing here in this
                            mundane sphere, it is distinct from the old, having no connection nor blending therewith, in
                            spirit nor purpose. This new earth is that which is redeemed from sinful, selfish man and
                            occupied and used for regenerative purposes, while the old is held by selfish man and used
                            for generative purposes ; there being no more connection between them than there is between
                            flesh and spirit. The new heaven is the new kind of happiness enjoyed by the deni-<pb n="221" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> zens of the new earth, where "Jerusalem is made a rejoicing and her
                            people a joy." The old heaven is the old happiness enjoyed by the selfish generative world.
                            It is thought by some that the new earth is to be a part whereon propagation will be
                            confined to God's law of nature, and from this orderly propagation will the new heavens be
                            supplied. Than this there can be no greater mistake. If true the animals already occupy the
                            new earth, and old Father Noah did the same ; but how did his orderly offspring turn out?
                            Were they better prepared for the new heavens than others ? The child born in the gutter is
                            as pure, as holy, and as near to God, as the child born in the King's palace. His
                            displeasure rests not on the child, but on the disorderly parents. The highest and most
                            chaste generative work is born of lust, and hath no place in God's new Earth ; for " When
                            lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is finished, it bringeth forth
                            death. Do not err, my beloved." James i., 15, 16. The Apostle was right in saying: " Not
                            many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called." 1 Cor., 26. There
                            are more pearls to be found down in the mud than up on the mountain top ; gather them in and
                            wash them and they will shine. It will ever be as it has been, more difficult to go up and
                            bring them down than to go down and bring them up: hence Christ's words in the parable : "
                            Go ye into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that the Lord's table may be
                            filled. " It is neither the duty nor the province of the new earthians to undertake to
                            discipline the old in matters pertaining to generation : their whole duty there is to reap
                            the ripened grain and gather it into the garners of God; but, while orderly generation
                            should rule the old earth, yet the better children are made more by better training, better
                            surroundings and associations than by better propagation, because, in its best form, it is
                            destitute of anything spiritual. It is all carnal. To redeem souls from these lower
                            conditions is the object of the creation of the new earth, where generative propagation is
                            wholly excluded. Here souls are created anew, raised into holiness of life and become the
                            children of God. Believers, called Shakers, are now the privileged occupants of God's new
                            earth and heaven, wherein dwelleth righteousness ; than which nothing better nor higher is
                            possible to the world, neither in the present time nor in any coming age or " cycle." The
                            way, the conditions are Godmade, God-given and perfect. None other can be more so, for
                            herein the opportunities are given by which all can, if they will, be " perfect, even as
                            their Father in heaven is perfect." Matt, v., 48. Any attempt to change God's plan of
                            redemption would be to weaken its efficiency and mar its beauty and perfection. The
                            requirement now is to give up all, including our own wills and our own lives, to the will of
                            God in his appointed order�to be as was Christ Jesus ; in our humiliation let our own
                            judgment be taken away, as was his. To the worldly wise of the old earth this seems to be
                            foolishness ; but it has been this very foolishness that has builded and upheld the work for
                            more than one hundred years ; and this only will perpetuate it, the equal of which (and 1
                            say it not boastiugly) is not to<pb n="222" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>be found anywhere on the whirling
                            footstool of God. Then let me repeat: Nothing less Avill answer God's demand on every soul
                            who enters His new earth, and nothing more can possibly be required. Be not deceived. It is
                            the meek that shall inherit the new earth, and "blessed are they that do His commandments
                            that they may have right to the tree of life and enter in through the gates into the city."
                            Rev. xxii., 14. Of this temple the two foundation pillars are Jesus, the Bridegroom, and
                            Ann, the Bride, whose ""teachings are celibacy, community, peace, simplicity in dress,
                            demeanor and language and separation from the world," with its vanities, pride, fashions and
                            customs. They are the shepherd and shepherdess, their sheep do hear their voice and follow
                            them ; no goats in the flock. If any of the divisions of God's new earth should conclude
                            that the way is too crossing, that the requirements are unnecessary, and persist in such
                            thought, they will fail ; but if all will turn in simplicity and obey, then with them there
                            will be no such word as fail, but theirs will be an eternal success with the upholding power
                            of God and His blessing evermore. " And there shall be no more curses, but the throne of God
                            and the lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve him, and they shall see His face.
                            For the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever." Rev. xxii., 3, 4, 5. Some
                            suppose that in a second cycle a change will come, when a " central head will be
                            unnecessary, as then, all will perceive truth fortthemselves, which will be the controlling
                            and growing power;" and then "it will no longer be said, know ye the Lord, for all shall
                            know Him, from the least to the greatest. " The mistake here is in supposing that God can be
                            known by any one outside of his order, " where He has placed His name for salvation. " All
                            coming cycles will be repeated like those of the sun. All who will be saved must travel the
                            same road to reach the same end. All must take Christ's yoke upon them and be meek and lowly
                            of heart as he was, and all must confess their sins alike, as he did. All must repent alike.
                            All must crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts alike. All must give up their own
                            wills and obey alike. These are to be repeated in all the cycles of time without end, or
                            complete redemption will not be found, because this is God's plan, and He cannot have two
                            ways to do the same thing. If any think they are wiser, let them remember that the
                            "'foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. " 1
                            Cor., 25. As said, all our success and prosperity depend entirely on our compliance with and
                            doing God's will�not God afar off, in or above the clouds, but God in his appointed order.
                            Those who fail in this fail in all; then they are wont to say: "This is like all other
                            religions, a failure�it has had its day and must pass away, to be followed by something else
                            that will share the same fate, as all history has shown. But not so, God will not be
                            defeated in his purposes. After all the flood-spewings out of the Dragon's mouth a remnant
                            will be left of the faithful to carry the pure work down into the centuries to save the
                            world in the coming ages.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Never wish a thing done, but do it" TEIform="index"/>Never wish a thing done, but do it

                            address you upon a subject of most vital importance to you, as Spiritualists�to us as a
                            people, and to the human family at large. You cannot be ignorant of the fact that the
                            various phases and features of the so-called spiritual phenomena had their beginning and
                            origin among us as a people, and yet you date the commencement with the Foxes at Hydesville,
                            N. Y., which is not the true facts in the case. Our instruments and mediums prophesied and
                            declared again and again, that the work would cease with us, and that it would soon break
                            forth in the outside world, and in accordance to which, it started at the above named place.
                            If you need correct information touching the matter in hand, I would refer you to our books,
                            in which is recorded all that I have here stated ; and for you to date the Anniversary of
                            the New dispensation, as you call it, at Hydesville, N. Y., is far from doing justice to the
                            cause ; you are really only the second edition of the work, and are our children, and should
                            so represent yourselves to the world of mankind. Until this is done, you will fail to
                            fulfill the true object and design of your mission as given from the Spirit world, to
                            prepare souls for the kingdom of heaven on earth, in which is embraced the Evangel, life and
                            teachings of the great founder of practical Christianity. Jesus, our elder Brother, also
                            constituting a true brotherhood of interests, both temporally and spiritually, with a
                            strictly pure and virgin life, with all its selfdenial, self-sacrifice and self-abnegation.
                            From our standpoint, we find you still occupying the selfish Adamic plane, with all the
                            so-called Christian churches of the day, who openly violate in their lives all the
                            conditions of discipleship to the one they profess to follow. The time has now come, dear
                            brethren, when their mask of hypocrisy and deceit will be removed with all their
                            inconsistency, and they will stand in their true colors before an astonished world. Our
                            friends, the Spiritualists, have had far greater and superior light, hence their obligations
                            and responsibility are proportionally increased for them to assume their true attitude and
                            position in the line of reform and progress with us, with all the attendant sacrifices on
                            their part; if they, as pioneers and leaders, fail to heed the present call, as I have
                            endeavored to present it in love and unbounded sympathy, the same will go forth throughout
                            all their ranks. Think not that I am an enthusiast and a religious monomaniac ; not so. The
                            foregoing sentiments are not mine alone, but those of the whole body of people, of which I
                            have been a member nearly forty years, and known to all intents and purposes, whereof I
                            write. The case of A. J. Davis is only a sample of hundreds and thousands, that will soon
                            follow his steps, by rejecting the light that will soon burst upon you. Had he obeyed his
                            light and call as touching the cause we have espoused, years ago, he would now have been a
                            redeemed and happy man. The question of organization has been more or less agitated among
                            Spiritualists for years ; the elements of discord have evidently forbidden it. Let me assure
                            them in all kindness, that it will never be accomplished, having no authority<pb n="224" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>from the spirit spheres for such a measure. A communication similar to this
                            will be forwarded to all the editors of the spiritual papers, so-called, throughout the
                            country. Should they not deem it worthy their notice and attention, we shall select other
                            channels through which the foregoing can be brought before the public; the issues dependent
                            upon it call for immediate action. We are the only people on the globe that do practically
                            demonstrate by a daily life, before all men, the heavenborn principles embodied in the
                            beautiful Evangel of Jesus, having done so for one hundred years ; yet the Spiritualists
                            never allude to us in their writings no more than if we did not exist and justice had
                            departed from the earth. Oh! consistency, thou art a jewel! With assurances of esteem and
                            respect, I remain, very truly, your friend, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Clapp, Charles" TEIform="persName"/>Charles Clapp. Warren Co., Ohio, March, 1885.</byline></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Secret of a happy day" TEIform="index"/>THE SECRET OF A HAPPY DAY

                            carried, but its foundation was not solid. It was a male attempt, altogether, and if woman
                            was not admitted to counsel and help hold it up, then it must come down. Our order of the
                            heavens is for men and women. They regulate and rule the earth order which is likewise for
                            man and woman, and for the lords of creation to be compelled to give woman her right and let
                            her take her birthright in the heavenly order and in the earth order,is something new under
                            the sun. In the former periods there existed a very small degree of heaven and a great deal
                            ot earth, in the same people. We certainly have the foundation principles of a new Heavenly
                            Order and a new Earthly Order, but in both we need to step forward. Jesus declared, till
                            heaven and earth pass, these simple requirements pertaining to diet, as written in the Law,
                            and all the rules of physiological life would stand as God's laws to Christians. Many are
                                beginning<pb n="225" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> to feel that the outpouring of the spirit will be in
                            Zion's laws to govern the appetite ; rule the bodies more consistently and set apart the
                            very food and show the way to prepare it to produce health. We need new rules to regulate
                            our outer life that we may be raised into a glorious, physical resurrection. This would
                            sweep away a host of diseases, unnecessary labors, needless expense and intemperance. It
                            would relieve many sufferers, bring us into closer connection with the heavens and let in a
                            flood of light and power for the prosperity of the Church. As a people we should be
                            preparing ourselves by conscientiously living up to our present light. Our physical
                            condition as a people demands it. As the Lord liveth and as the gospel will increase, new

                            made a profession of the vows of "poverty, chastity and obedience" for the purpose of more
                            fully and freely living a life of Christian usefulness to the poor and needy in that modern
                            Babylon. This act was approved and accepted by their ecclesiastical superior the Bishop of
                            New York, who was thereupon remonstrated with by the presiding or senior Bishop of the
                            church in the United States. And against what was this remonstrance made? Against following
                            practically the teaching and example of Jesus, lie said, "foxes have holes, and the birds of
                            the air have nests, but the son of man�Jesus�hath not where to lay his head." Was not that
                            poverty ? He said, "they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the
                            resurrection from the dead�sin�neither marry nor are given in marriage. " Was not that
                            teaching chastity ? He said, "Father, not my will but thine be done. " Was not that
                            obedience ? And yet this practical Christianity, this actual following the life of Jesus,
                            causes this Christian Bishop to express his " astonishment and distress *' at what he calls
                            an '' unexampled act, " and one which he says must create '' anxiety and alarm" in the
                            Episcopal church. If he is correct in this opinion as to the effect upon the church of which
                            he is the official head, we can only say, what a church to call itself Christian. He further
                            says that " the purpose of the novice (which designation he affixes to each of these young
                            men,) is to devote himself to a religious life�so-called. He forever surrenders all that he
                            possesses or of which he may hereafter become possessed. He promises to continue in the
                            virgin state for the remainder of his life. " A lofty purpose, an unselfish surrender, a
                            holy promise; and yet this Christian Bishop reprobates such a purpose, such a surrender,
                            such a promise. Does he forget that Jesus set an example of " poverty, chastity a^d
                            obedience to his followers? If so, had he not better remonstrate less and read his Bible
                            more ? We think that the worthy example set by these young men if followed and lived
                            faithfully, would produce results befitting the name ot Christian. It<pb n="226" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>
                            would tend to elevate and purify the mass of humanity now sunk in lust, selfishness and
                            greed. There is work enough of this nature for thousands of other young men in this broad
                            land, work of purity and self-denial which will be approved by the great Teacher of right
                            living even though it be disapproved by an Episcopal Bishop. Any church calling itself
                            Christian, and any minister professing to be a follower of the '' meek and lowly Nazarene"
                            ought to offer peans of praise and thanksgiving that there are yet those whose love for God
                            and man has prompted them to enter into such a work. Such young men as these, seem to have
                            some of the elements of Shakerism, and if they do not reach the goal to which others have
                            attained, we feel that at least they are on the right road. The world would be better for
                            more such as they are and feioer such as he who condemns them. A. Canterbury, N.

                            and Apostolic dispensations God had an order through which he communicated his mind and will
                            to the people ; and through that line of order established in that day, he could lead, warn,
                            admonish, and administer his love and blessing to his own chosen people. And while they
                            rendered obedience to that order, he always recognized them as obeying him ; and blessed
                            them in so doing. Yea, he blessed them abundantly, in their basket and in their store, in
                            their out-goings and in their incomings. No good thing did he withhold from them who walked
                            uprightly, and were subject and obedient to the order of God in that day. On the other hand
                            those who were disobedient and rebelled against that order, never failed to meet with the
                            displeasure of God; if not with his immediate judgment, and a curse. Witness for instance,
                            the case of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. See Numbers xvi: 1, 8. Let every one read this
                            chapter. By what has transpired in past dispensations, in relation to disobedience and
                            rebellion against the order of God, we may learn if we will, what God requires of us under
                            the dispensation in which we live, which is emphatically, a spiritual dispensation and not
                            so great in outward display, as formerly, because it is an inward spiritual work ; therefore
                            souls ought to be the more careful how they treat it. God is unchangeable the same
                            yesterday, today and forever. Although the order varied in each succeeding dispensation in
                            some respects, adapted to the day and age in which it was given, thus the Jewish -ceremonial
                            law, was superseded only by obeying the higher and superior law of Christ, and continues so
                            to this day ; but the order of the priesthood was changed, and St. Paul tells us how, and in
                            what manner. "And God hath set some in the church, first, apostles, secondly, prophets,
                            thirdly, teachers, after that, miracles, gifts of healing, helps, governments." 1 Cor. xii.,
                            28. " And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and evangelists, and some pastors, and
                            teachers," and for these reasons. '' For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
                            Ministry, for the edifying of the<pb n="227" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> body of Christ, the "Anointed.' Eph.
                            iv., 11,12. Elders were ordainec in every church. " Actsxiv. Deacons, were also appointed
                            after the following manner. Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them
                            and said, " It is not reasonably that we should leave the word of God to serve tables.
                            Wherefore, brethren look ye out among you, seveu men of honest report, full oi the Holy
                            Spirit, and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business." Acts vi: 23. Take notice, whom
                            we may appoint. It was not done by majority vote,�it was done by the gift of God, to the
                            apostles and their successors, on whom the appointing power was established, as St. Paul
                            expressed it. "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us,
                            we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." 2 Cor. v,, 20. i. e. through his
                            order. This was the order of God in Christ's first appearing, and was rejected and
                            overthrown by the spirit of antichrist, which already began to work in the Apostles' days ;
                            not so much at first, by open rebellion, as it was by a false lying spirit, to work out of
                            sight, under a mask, under a smooth outside Christian name, by denying Christ in any form of
                            visible lead, not confessing that Christ had come in the flesh, or in human shape. Such, St.
                            John denounced as the spirit of antichrist. "Ye shall know them by their fruits." North

                            Self-discipline is, to so control the natural passions and impulses, as to form good habits
                            of thought and action. If, in the natural order, cultivation is necessary to enable one to
                            pass through life respectable, inasmuch as the kingdom of heaven is higher than earthly
                            kingdoms, so will it take higher degrees of culture in order for the soul to stand free from
                            the clogs of an earthly inheritance. One may pass through life bearing a good moral
                            reputation, still be coarse and rough in manners, speaking in loud harsh tones; may indulge
                            in many unseemly habits, and still be respected by acquaintances. But the gospel of love
                            calls for that discipline and purification of life and affections which will bring more than
                            merely a good reputation but will lay the foundation of character deep in the Christian
                            virtues and graces. This will teach the tongue to utter kind words in gentle tones; the feet
                            to walk softly as in the fear of God; the hands will handle all things as being consecrated,
                            will close doors with care, also be careful not to mar or injure anything that will require
                            time and labor to restore to its former beauty and excellence. The soul that is thus
                            disciplined for Christ's sake and the gospel which he taught, and not for worldy fame or
                            ap)lause will find sweet peace and combrt while dwelling in this clay tenement also the
                            blessed assurance of an increase of happiness as the eternal ages roll on their way relaxing
                            not the discipline till redemption is complete. Canterbury, N.

                            compelled to interfere with the practices of a religious sect. It must be remembered that
                            the warfare of the U. S. Government against the Mormons of Utah is not directed against any
                            article of faith or belief held by them, but against the practice of polygamy. Bigamy or
                            polygamy, is considered to be a crime in every state of the Union ; and it is punished as
                            such, not from any religious or moral consideration, but for social and political reasons.
                            There must be but one law for all; if polygamy is a criminal offence in New York, then it is
                            one in Utah, and the authorities are only doing their duty in suppressing it. When Mormonism
                            first attracted public attention, polygamy was not one of its doctrines ; even as late as
                            1849, its missionaries in Europe, when called upon to explain the rumors of polygamous
                            practices which had travelled across the Atlantic, utterly denied their truth and charged
                            them to the hatred and malignity of their enemies. It was not till 1853 that the "revelation
                            " authorizing polygamy, claimed to have been given to Joseph Smith ten years before (who was
                            murdered in 1847) was published. It is interesting to observe the shrewdness with which the
                            declaration of Jesus that there is no marrying in heaven is made to harmonize with this new
                            revelation. There is, they say, indeed no marriage in heaven ; marriage is contracted on
                            earth, with this difference ; marriages contracted in the ordinary manner are for this life
                            only ; when the parties thereto enter spirit-life they become '' angels of heaven who
                            neither marry nor are given in marriage, " they become ministering servants to the gods. The
                            gods are they who have married according to the law of the new revelation ; such marriages
                            are for time and eternity, and the more numerous the wives and posterity are, the greater
                            will be the exaltation in heaven. Such teachings were not heard of in the early days of
                            Mormonism. The claims made for the new faith were that it was Christianity restored, the
                            visions of by gone ages being again vouchsafed to man ; angels had descended to earth ; a
                            great prophet had arisen preaching the gospel of the last days; gifts of prophecy, of
                            healing, the working of miracles, were now as in the days of the Apostles, witnesses to the
                            power of God. The lost tribes of Israel were to return to Zion ; grace, pardon and
                            everlasting bliss promised freely to all who would repent and be baptized into the new
                            covenant. Their preachers spoke with a fiery earnestness that carried conviction with it.

                            arouse the assembly to the highest pitch of enthusiasm : The spirit of God like a fire is
                            burning! The latter-day glory begins to come forth; The visions and blessings of old are

                            missionary zeal developed by it. Without any provision, often unacquainted with the language
                            of the country, enduring every privation, they invaded every country of Europe and succeeded
                            to gather 100,000 souls to their faith within one generation. The story of their persecution
                            in Illinois ; their heroic pilgrimage of 1500 miles across the pathless desert; their
                            industry that caused the barren wilderness to smile with fertility, are well known. The

                            praise of every unprejudiced observer. Such achievements are accomplished only by
                            convictions that have a nobler purpose and a higher aspiration for their sustaining

                            Law. Therefore, Hygienic Institutions must be the beginning of that day. That it may dawn in
                            every household in the land, is the object of this paper. The time was when neither
                            saleratus nor soda, or any kind of baking powders were used in food. Any person on
                            reflection, rejects the idea of being daily dosed with powerful drugs, even should h^ be
                            ignorant of their mode of operation. THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE METALLIC SALTS.
                            They combine with any kind of fatty matter and form soap; and readily attack all kinds of
                            animal tissue. They are also used in making glass ; they help to melt the sand. WHEN USED AS
                            BAKING POWDERS, they are the carbonates of Soda or Potash, as the case may be. In plain
                            English, these alkalies are fully charged with carbonic acid gas (the gas of death) for
                            which they have a strong affinity. The acids of these powders under the action of heat and
                            moisture, liberates this gas, and it expands the dough. This gas, whether given out as in
                            fermented bread, or from baking powders, is not known to increase the digestibility of
                            bread, but the contrary. THESE ALKALIES WHEN TAKEN IN FOOD, pass through the digestive
                            processes, form new compounds, and float off into the circulation, impressing every drop of
                            blood with their saline affinities. The inhering power of saline solutions is to soften,
                            relax, and consequently to injure in the blood, the muscular and other tissues about to be
                            formed from the vital fluid, as will be shown hereafter. SALT AS TAKEN BY MAN and other
                            animals, operates as a solvent in the blood. The salt water of the ocean is also a solvent,
                            not a preservative of animal matter. In the use of salt, imitate the animal creation. They
                            take enough at once to move their bowels, and then let it alone; hence but little enters the
                            circulation. With man, the case is otherwise, minute doses do not move the bowels ; hence
                            the salt takes a more circuitous route. SALT TAKING IS AN ACQUIRED HABIT and may so far
                            prevail in a family, till the entire circle of cookery becomes saline. No animal stays long
                            at a salt-lick. Let us so cultivate ourselves as to be true to the fitness of things; then
                            we will enjoy the natural flavor of all the grains, roots and vegetables. If a dose of salt
                            is needed, take it; but do not live in a salt-lick. SEVENTY FIVE HEAD OF HORNED ANIMALS. The
                            herdsman for a special purpose gave to the cows oft repeated doses of salt. After a while
                            lameness took hold of the herd; and a fine growing heifer could be seen limping along to
                            pasture. The salt was discontinued and the herd got well. In feeding salt to animals be
                            careful not to induce foot-rot. THE QUESTION IS NOT SALT, OR NO SALT ; but the proper use of
                            it. The worst possible way of taking that article, is a little at a time. What would we
                            think of a sheep taking a pinch of salt with every mouthful of grass? Under the force of
                            habit, silly humans do so daily. WHY IS NOT SALTED MEAT AS WHOLESOME AS FRESH? Is answered
                            by Dr. Holbrook in his admirable work " Eating for Strength" page 138. " It carries far too
                            much salt into the system. Much of the impaired health farmers have in spring comes from
                            this source. It would be better for them to substitute oatmeal, molasses, cream and fruit,
                            for salted flesh. With this diet they would rarely have the debility so common in Spring. "
                            At the end of a chapter on salt, he states "Its use on almost everything, is a mere habit."
                            And advises, "To learn to use some articles without it. '' Those who have not seen his book,

                            BLOOD. See these highly colored cakes, they are almost yellow. That color indicates that
                                the<pb n="232" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> flour has been chemically attacked by the potash of the

                            life-giving gas of the atmosphere? Not in the smallest degree, but for carbonic acid gas,
                            the gas of death. These salts, and all saline solutions in the circulation operates, as
                            already stated, to soften, relax, and to dissolve They have another effect, they impress the
                            vital fluid with an affinity contrary to that of venous blood for oxygen. This twofold
                            action breaks up the coagulating power of the blood, makes it watery; and induces a
                            diminished vital cohesion of that important fluid, thereby impairs bodily strength, causing
                            langour and debility. As is evidenced in every household in the land where saleratus, soda,
                            and baking powders are in use; and by the frightful ravages of scurvy at sea caused by salt
                            provisions. PROF. YOUMAN'S OPINION of soda, saleratus, and of course, of baking powders.

                                    strength slight, and we fold our hands, vainly thinking the right will prevail; that
                                    we must not be so sensitive and particular; that we can surely endure the jars of
                                    wickedness for a few years until we are called to the saintly rest beyond their
                                    sound. " There will be no swearing or drunkenness in Heaven, " we attempt to console

                                    rate, and it is better to leave things to take their course. But it is this spirit
                                    of sufferance and inactivity that is demoralizing our nation, and allowing evil the
                                    upper hand, until in some of our boroughs and traveled ways a person can scarcely
                                    walk a hundred yards without hearing men, boys and even babies exchanging oaths.
                                    Intemperance is the root of profanity, but the branches overshadow even more than
                                    the root. The babies learn to swear before they are taught to drink. Country reared

                                    and silence, can scarcely reconcile their ears to the jargon of oaths. If there are
                                    no active measures taken to hush profanity on the streets, should there not, at
                                    least, be rules of discipline adopted to prevent the use of such language in our
                                    public schools and institutes of learning? The presence of a few foul-mouthed pupils
                                    who are unrestrained in a school of two or three hundred boys, have a demoralizing
                                    effect on the weak, and make it gratingly unpleasant for those of finer moral taste.
                                    We are progressing as a people in many regards, and while the good grows, can we not

                                Honor and eternal life belong to truth. It requires constant watchfulness to be true.

                            is not always the correct speech that is considered nice language, although very necessary
                            but the government over the words that we utter is the essential point that I wish to

                            addressed. Now, when you think, has not the mind as much rule over the tongue as it has over
                            the fingers? Every part of the body is really governed by the mind. First have the mind pure
                            by being careful what you read, who you associate with your thought. Now have these perfect

Working in the interest of righteousness, we have a broad and beautiful field of
                            labor. In this we find so much to do that we have no need to fear. We shall always, in all
                            probability find those who will need assistance on the journey of life. To do right or
                            righteously is quite an essential feature in the pursuit of happiness. The day has gone by
                            when a mere profession will be of any vital worth to the individual who is bound for the
                            kingdom of God. A man will be known better, in this work, by what he accomplishes among men,
                            than by the multitude of words which he may speak. If he seeks to establish a good name in
                            the society of his friends, he must do right. " Do unto others as ye would that others
                            should do unto you," is the only safe rule. For a man to say he is honest is not sufficient
                            evidence to warrant the fact. The manner in which he conducts his business will much more
                            readily determine the fact. To say that he is a Christian because he performs some few
                            religious offices, cannot be a very permanent foundation upon which to stand. Religion does
                            not consist in the performance of outward rites, but it should be made a discipline of the
                            soul. Bad men, sometimes do good deeds as a matter of policy, expecting through this means
                            to obtain some advantage as a compensating reward. Righteousness may be the pleasant
                            accompaniment of every moral and religious life. Creeds, forms and ceremonies however much
                            they may be used, can never build up or establish a character. This will be accomplished
                            only by earnest and persistent efforts to do right, because it is right. Prayer, even may be
                            a form of words, and these may be repeated while upon the bended knee, and yet be destitute
                            of righteousness.<pb n="235" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> Alms may be bestowed upon the poor, and the deed
                            bear the outward form of a charitable gift, and yet the whole may be more closely allied to
                            selfishness, rather than to righteousness. Christian professors may sometimes place more
                            value upon their organization than upon the quality of fruit which their lives bear while in
                            the organization ; forgetting that most essential lesson which Jesus gave to his disciples,�
                            "By their fruits ye shall know them." ;'Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?"
                            Churches, Societies and Institutions are all very essential for the good and happiness of
                            mankind. If it might be possible to be without them, it is certainly of great advantage to
                            have them. Having established the Church or Society, the principle of righteousness should
                            be of the utmost importance in every transaction. And even this should be an active and
                            living growth in which a healthy circulation of gospel duties maybe maintained. All quite
                            well understand that the advent of the gospel work was to be known for the promotion of
                            peace, and for the manifestation of brotherly love. Those who accepted it would be
                            designated as the sons and daughters of God, and their righteousness would be one of the
                            marked features of the order. This test of a religious body should always be open for
                            inspection, as a system of religious discipline that did not make righteousness one of the
                            most essential points for cultivation, could not in this ag3 of the world be regarded as the
                            spiritual house of the Lord our God.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Read no book of which you would not like..." TEIform="index"/>Read no book of which you would not like...

                                        Odontological Society, Dr. E. Parmly Brown said : I will venture the assertion
                                        that the excessive use of common salt is one of the main factors in the
                                        destruction of human teeth to-day. I am now engaged in collecting some
                                        statistics on this point, from which I hope in time to demonstrate, what seems
                                        to me to be the fact, that common salt excessively used is a great solvent of
                                        the human teeth. If it will injure the human teeth through the chemistry of our
                                        systems in some way or other that I will not try to explain to-night, why might
                                        it not also have the effect of preventing a good development of the teeth when
                                        taken into the system in excess? I have lately procured some statistics from the
                                        Sandwich Islands, from a gentleman who has been there, covering a period of over
                                        forty years, that are very suggestive and interesting. Within that period the
                                        teeth of the Sandwich Islanders have decayed rapidly, and since they have begun
                                        to decay it has been noticed that the natives are in the habit of biting off
                                        great chunks of salt and eating it with their food. According to all accounts,
                                        the teeth of the Sandwich Islanders were formerly the most free from decay of
                                        any people on the face of the earth, if I remember rightly. You will find that
                                        people who eat a great deal of sugar are often entirely toothless. I know
                                        several instances of candy storekeepers where three generations are entirely
                                        toothless. People who eat an excessive amount of salt are tempted to eat large
                                        quantities of candy, pickles, and vinegar. There seems to be a craving for those
                                        substances after the excessive use of salt.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Scientific American" TEIform="index"/>Scientific American.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Fruit-eaters need no doctors" TEIform="index"/>FRUIT-EATERS NEED NO DOCTORS

                                        regularly and largely consumed, seldom needed his services. "We thought what a
                                        pity that every farmer in the land could not be convinced of these truths. It is

                                        crops of the varied fruits, but very few have plenty, and many never have any
                                        fruit, ex cept it may be an occasional apple. The standard food in a majority of
                                        farmers' houses consists largely of bread, butter and meat, mostly pork fried in
                                        grease, and, where pastry or cake is used, it has lard in large proportion in
                                        its composition; and this food is eaten at least twice, and in many families,
                                        three times a day, year in and year out. Is it any wonder that they are not more

                            depth of the love of God which passeth knowledge. This love is vitalizing, ever growing
                            deeper, purer, and more fervent. What a peaceful assurance pervades the soul that is in full
                            possession of this love, how calm the spirit how divine the joy that springs from a
                            confidence that our spirits are united to the spirit of God, by a living faith and loving
                            trust in all His promises. Such love can alone express the deep aud holy meaning of those
                            sublime words, uttered by the Savior, to the mourners in Bethany, whosoever liveth and
                            believeth in me shall never die ; but this redeeming love aud tender mercy of God, is too
                            often used as a covert for low aims and unworthy purposes, without fathoming its deep and
                            vast significance, or remembering that justice is also a part of love. What a blessed change
                            does this love produce in the hearts and lives of those who have felt its renewing effects
                            wrought within by the spirit of truth, ever urging onward aud upward to a full and complete
                            consecration of the whole life to God, keeping our hearts open to the reception of divine
                            influences drawing out in the fervency of our spirits, prayer for the salvation of those who
                            know not God. And may we who have been brought to a knowledge of this marvelous love, ever
                            prove true to its teaching ; realizing its uplifting power, elevating us above all worldly
                            and selfish aims and purposes, cutting loose and separating from the soul, all that would
                            defile or in any way bring bondage, for where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty,
                            and where this love is the ruling motive in the heart, every thought and action will be
                            brought into obedience to it. God's promises will never fail, To those who trust and patient
                            wait. And in the end are sure to find His loving kindness, O, how great! Canterbury, N.

O. C.�who was taken to the almshouse a day or two ago, is a sad
                                    one. He is only twenty-eight years old. When he came to this country he was the
                                    owner of property to the value of some ten thousand dollars, which had been left him
                                    as his share of his father's estate. He became an habitual and inveterate smoker,
                                    and his nervous system became so affected that his brain was injured, and insanity
                                    followed. Physicians warned him of the danger of smoking so much; but he failed to
                                    give up the habit. He was sent to an Asylum, and there, deprived of the means of
                                    gratifying his appetite, improved, and was discharged as cured. But, once out, he
                                    again resorted to narcotic stimulants, and again became insane. This is the second
                                    time he has been sent to the almshouse. The bulk of his property, it is said, is
                                    gone. '' And yet, " says the Congregationalist,� " a great many professing
                                    Christians, even ministers of the gospel, use tobacco, with no seeming regard as to
                                    its effects on their own bodies or the influence of their example in the world." Dr.
                                    Burroughs, of Iowa, says in his Journal:�" It is authentically stated that there is
                                    a young man in Battle Creek, Michigan, that is suffering with delirium tremens from

                            will be found : Making, waste of our work, without reason or gain, And changing our prospect
                            of pleasure to pain : So the use of my motto I now would be showing__ To keep the weeds
                            down, we must keep the hoe going. Bad temper will grow like a weed in the heart, Striking
                            deep with its roots like a venomous dart; And they who encourage it nourish a devil, That
                            changes whatever is good into evil; fness, Then words that should comfort give nothing but
                            sadAnd deeds that should bless are productive of badness; The weed of ill-temper, I now
                            would be showing, Must be struck at the root�we must keep the hoe going. Intemperance oft is
                            a troublesome weed, Changing health to disease, and plenty to need; Embittering life,
                            destroying all quiet, Consuming the household with wasting and riot. Avoid the temptation,
                            keep out of the folly : Why sacrifice gladness to dark melancholy ? Go work in the garden,
                            and soon you'll be knowing, Health and mirth may be gained if you keep the hoe going. Envy,
                            Hatred, and Malice are virulent weeds; Where charity faileth they scatter their seeds :
                            Bright flowers of love, and sweet fruits of kindness, Are choked by their growth and the
                            soul in its blindness Takes evil for good, and the wrong for the right; And goes forth in
                            darkness as hating the light. Oh! tear up such weeds ere their seeds they be sowing In the
                            garden of life, and keep the hoe going. See Hypocrisy spreading a blight on each hand, Where
                            Candor and Truth have no hold on the land. See Deception and Craft and Selfishness grow,
                            Where Simplicity shrinks like a rose in the snow. Oh, such weeds are too rank in humanity's

                            grave. I think that I am sick, or at least, ought so to be, For upon my poor body great mars
                            you will see. In this place I have hung nearly forty long years, No complaint have I
                            uttered, tho' I've shed many tears. I have kept out the cold, the rain, heat and snow, To
                            the best of my knowledge you very well know. A true non-resident you judge me to be, While
                            I'm injured by many, none are injured by me. It is an old saying that patience wears out;
                            That mine is quite thread-bare you no longer will doubt. But I see you're quite anxious to
                            know my complaint; It is this : I am bang�d without any restraint. The tall and the short,
                            the lame, weak and strong, All feel it their duty as they pass along To slam me and bang me
                            as hard as they can, As tho' I had injured the whole race of man. O, how I do shiver and
                            quiver and shake. When one I see coming with fear almost quake, For I know what a clatter
                            they'll make with my latch, My hinges, my panels and door-sill to match. Now I am quite
                            fearful that alive I'll be buried, For I over-heard a sister quite worried, Declare she
                            would take me right off the hinges, And hide me away,�at this my frame cringes. Since in
                            friendship and greeting my life has been spent, And to render good service I am ever intent;
                            E'en the sick and afflicted who're over my head, Will start with a spring almost out of
                            their bed, And then with harsh epithets lay themselves down With a wish that poor me was
                            laid under the ground. Sweet spring and fair summer bring me no relief, Unlatched I am left
                            to annoyance and grief. When the soft gentle breeze creeps over the hill, And enters the
                            door yard where all is quite still, It moveth the grass like the waves of the sea, Then with
                            joyous delight it boundeth to me. It finds me unfastened and slams me at will, Quite enough
                            one would think to break door-latch and sill. O, could 1 convey to your innocent minds, I
                            would speak it in prose or sing it in rhymes, How ashamed I do feel that here I am placed.
                            Shaker Door is my name, O, how I'm disgraced, By you gentle folks for slamming me so. Don't
                            think me too hard for I tell you 'tis true. Now my story to you I have simply related, Yet
                            not half my grievances have I narrated, But if all will remember softly me to close, I'll
