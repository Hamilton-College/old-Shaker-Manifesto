HOLLISTER.</byline><p TEIform="p">It is written in the wisdom of the East, "All that we are, is the result of what
                            we have thought�it is founded on our thoughts�it is made up of our thoughts." Why? Because
                            all action begins in the mind, and thought is both the action of mind, and a product that
                            remains to influence future conduct. This being the power of thought, by controlling our
                            thoughts, and fixing our attention on the things that pertain to our peace, we can school
                            ourselves out of the imperfections of our natural birth, and of defective early training,
                            into that which we wish to be. For whatever the mind or attention dwells upon that will
                            grow, and as all deliberate action is first acted in thought, thought is the key to any
                            desired change of conduct. Hence the proclamation of the gospel was introduced by the
                            exhortation to repent, reform�that is, according to the original Greek, change your mind,
                            your purpose, the thoughts and intents of your heart. Detach in a measure your interest from
                            the visible and transient things of the present life, which now absorb your whole attention,
                            and fix your thoughts upon the unseen and eternal inheritance in the life to come, "for the
                            reign of the heavens is at hand." Without this necessary preparation, and earnest seeking,
                            how can any one discover the presence of that' 'reign of God" which cannot be perceived by
                            outward eyes? Thought guided by true desires, and duly translated into deeds, overcomes all
                            obstructions to the soul's advance in righteousness, penetrates all false disguises, and
                            scans all mysteries of Divine wisdom, truth and love, bestowed upon mortals for their
                            uplifting from the earthly and transient, to the heavenly and eternal life. Mother Ann
                            prayed three days and three nights without intermission that God would grant her true
                            desires, and when she received the answer to that prayer, it was ample compensation for all
                            it cost. "If your eve is on the Eternal," writes an intuitive Seer, "your intellect will
                            grow, and your opinions and actions will have a beauty which no learning nor combined
                            advantages of other men can rival." My own intelligence responds, "it is true." Mt. Lebanon,

TEIform="persName"/>Martyn W. Miles.</byline><p TEIform="p">At a recent Society meeting, an Elder remarked upon the desirability of our
                            keeping before us the doctrines of the Church. This I endeavor to do, and in regard to the
                            main tenets of the Society of Believers or Millennial Church, I desire to bear my humble
                            testimony thereon and to confess the faith. We hold (if I state our views correctly) that
                            the primitive Christian church, spoken of in the book of Acts of the Apostles, was
                            established on right principles ; that the Gentile Christian churches rapidly and fatally
                            fell away from it; and that our order has returned to those original and true doctrines and
                            practices. Prominent tenets of the Pentecostal church were, a life of celibacy ; community
                            of property ; confession of sins ; separation from the world; (marriage and private property
                            being regarded as emblems of a lower order of society.) If we value the teachings of Jesus
                            Christ it is surely logical and right to endeavor to really carry them into practice, as the
                            apostles did ; the New Testament abounds in teachings directly or indirectly bearing upon
                            the principles just enumerated ; one text, for instance, being:�''Sell what thou hast and
                            give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure iu heaven." That is Christian communism,�it
                            is equivalent to saying, 'Let there be as little inequality as is practicable,' the
                            doctrines of Jesus being utterly opposed to the prevalent system which divides society into
                            rich and poor�an inequitable system which is nowhere more tenaciously upheld than in
                            England, "making God's work of none effect." The same fundamental idea has been expressed by
                            many good men who have had a passion for justice. It pervades the writings of the poet
                            Shelly, as in the line�"Foremost of things, divine Equality!" It is expressed by that grand
                            axiom, "Each for all, and ail for each." Shakspeare does not omit to touch upon this
                            subject:� "So distribution should undo excess, And each one have enough." In a brief
                            narrative, St. Luke describes the primitive Christian church :�"And all that believed were
                            together, and had all things in common, and sold their possessions and goods, and parted
                            them to all as they had need," and these words have had a remarkable power over the human
                            mind in all ages since they were written. _ � Iu this Community, for my own part, I find my
                            highest aspirations realized, and I esteem the privilege of being permitted to work, in the
                            place appointed for me, in the vineyard of the Lord. But, holding the sociological views
                            that I do, I was not very happy in the outer world, because, there, the social system by
                            which 1 was environed worked counter to my belief iu the right and the best. Then there is
                            the doctrine of the motherhood as well as fatherhood of God, from which we can derive much
                            help and comfort. It has been well observed�"The Jewish Jehovah and Gentile Christian God
                            was forceful, revengeful, and on occasion even hateful. This one-sided Creator lacked all
                            that plenitude of benignity which, united with a manhood of correspouding wisdom, is truly
                            worthy of reverence. And Christendom waited seventeen centuries for a woman to declare the
                            duality of the deific essence." I also especially prize the principle adopted by our order
                            of separating ourselves<pb n="267" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> from the influences of the world;
                            in which respect it resembles the religious bouses of the Middle Ages. Now, it is well to
                            endeavor to exert a leavening influence, for good, upon the world, while dwelling and moving
                            therein, as the Society of Friends and other religious denominations do; but what if, on the
                            contrary, we find the world gradually leavening us so that we realize, with St. Paul, that
                            "when we would do well, evil is present with us?" This used to be my own experience ; I
                            therefore value the spiritualized every-day life to be found in this order, where, in
                            retirement from the world, it is our privilege to seek to strengthen one another in the
                            Lord, and in whatsoever i3 righteous and virtuous. Among the names of several eminent men
                            who have written favorably of the Society are those of Henry Vincent, Hepworth Dixon, H. W.
                            Beecher, C. Nordhoff, and Horace Greeiey. The latter wrote that "they presented the sublime
                            and hope-inspiring spectacle of a Community founded and built up on the conquest of the most
                            inexorable appetites. When he had stood among the quiet homes of this people, and marked how
                            they had steadily, surely advanced, from poverty to ample competence, how could he refrain
                            from thinking lightly of that blind dogmatism which asserts the impossibility of inducing
                            men to labor except for their own self-gratification?" I pray that God will aid me, by his
                            strength, to faithfully practice so enlightened and spiritual a creed as that of the
                            Millennial Church ; that he will enable me to crucify the life �f sin; to keep the faith ;
                            to dedicate myself to his service ; and to go assiduously and zealously forward,

TEIform="persName"/>Oliver C. Hampton.</byline><p TEIform="p">Sad forebodings are unwise for two reasons and for these they should not be
                            indulged in. 1st. Such sad anticipations may never be realized and then we shall have had
                            all our sorrow for nothing. 2nd. Such indulgence in forebodings of evil does not fortify,
                            but weakens our courage to meet and cope with scenes of adversity when they come into our
                            experience. Some minds of unfortunate construction, cannot easily parry these temptations to
                            fearful anticipations of coming evil. Still it must be and is possible, to educate one's
                            self out of such mental predisposition. Unshaken faith in God's goodness and love, his
                            wisdom and constant care for us, is a great and glorious boon. Paul says we cannot have this
                            of ourselves but that it is a gift of God. So much the better�we can pray to our Heavenly
                            Father, and most assuredly receive this precious faith, and this is a grand substitute for
                            that spiritual vacuum wherein we feel with Jesus "Of myself I can do nothing." Indeed
                            fervent prayer is most salutary and avails mightily in lifting the sincere spirit above the
                            sorrows and crude rudimentalisms of this earthly existence. Gloomy thoughts of the future
                            are unhealthy, both to body and mind. Whatever affects the mind, affects in a corresponding
                            manner and degree, the entire physiological structure in all its functional and organic
                            relations. Joy and peace create health�sorrow and discouragement�disease. We can habituate
                            ourselves to make the most or the least of our blessings. And on the disposition we make of
                            our condition much depends. But above all it is unwise and unhealthy<pb n="268" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> to anticipate evil, which we are not certain will ever come to pass. One
                            of my good ancient Elders once told me a little anecdote which will well illustrate this.
                            One night he was going to mill with a grist, (he said) when a boy about twelve years of age.
                            A very terrible thunder shower was darkening the Heavens. He came to the conclusion, that
                            when he arrived at a certain hill some distance ahead of him, he should certainly be killed
                            by lightning. He was awfully frightened at this coming destruction. He however drove on an:!
                            when he reached the hill sure enough the artillery of Heaven played round him iu the most
                            awful manner. But in one moment as it were all his fright was taken away from him and he was
                            filled full of gladness and joy, and never enjoyed any scene in his life before nor since,
                            more than he did that awful and sublime thuuder shower. And for years and years afterward it
                            filled him with joy to hear heavy thunder. "From that day to this" said he (and he was then
                            an aged man) "I have never had the slightest fear of thunder and lightning." So all his
                            fearful anticipations of death were for nothing not only, but in point of fact resulted in
                            one of the most enjoyable scenes of his whole life. Well, we have fallen on fearful scenes
                            of adversity, cyclones, years of drought, diminution in numbers and strength in Zion ; yet
                            let us watch and pray, struggle and toil, faithfully keep all good Order ; and then be sure
                            our God will not, cannot forsake us, but in the end crown us with the blessing of well-spent
                            lives in the promotion of all good, "'and a crown of Glory that fadeth not away." Union

                            apparently chaotic and spasmodic condition and effort of the various reform and progressive
                            movements of our age, there is both method and wisdom. Each step of humanity, onward and
                            upward, in the past, can be distinctly traced by the evidences of an all-wise plan for their
                            successful accomplishment, and nothing that the world has ever produced in the way of larger
                            liberties, and grander opportunities, for accomplishing the ultimate happiness and
                            prosperity of the race can do aught but attest this truth. Hence, we assume that the present
                            movement toward industrial and social freedom and equity is not only in accordance with the
                            divine plan for the redemption of the race from the curse of riches and poverty, but that it
                            has been foretold in the prophecies of the Bible whose divinely appointed seers were
                            selected to place in the sacred record an outline of events now upon us. That humanity is
                            being stirred to the very depths of reason and passion, preparatory to entering upon a
                            tremendous struggle to restore Liberty and Justice in the State, and righteousness and
                            spirituality in the Church, is as evident, as that honest citizens are being driven<pb n="269" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> from the arena of partisan politics, and honest clergymen
                            from the pulpit in accordance with the injunction to "Come out of her, my people that ye be
                            not partakers of her sins." Yes! great Babylon, which is the church and state of our boasted
                            nineteenth century civilization is fallen, and the proclamation which is resounding through
                            the blue vaults of Heaven will soon reach our earth. Well may the crowned heads of Europe
                            hesitate, ere they hurl their standing armies at each others' throats for the "Time of the
                            end" of all crowned heads is near at hand. Well, also, will it be, if the uncrowned kings of
                            monopolies and corporations here in America take warning, ere they place the last needle
                            upon the camel's back of labor, for a spirit of righteousness is abroad filling the hearts
                            of God's poor children with a sense of outraged justice, and equity too long delayed. Well
                            may our daily press cry out against the rapidly increasing abomination of class distinctions
                            and worldliness in our so-called Christian churches. Says the Boston Herald Jan., !&gt;,
                            under the head of "Socialism in the house of God." "The whole of our Protestantism has the
                            taint of an individualism, which has expressed itself in the cruel and godless distinctions
                            of class, and these distinctions have poisoned the atmosphere in our places of worship."
                            "Not one set of people are to blame for this state of things, but all sorts are responsible,
                            and one of the best fruits of the present social discontent in industrial life will be
                            secured if the churches in their inner life can realize in truth and freedom what is meant
                            by the brotherhood of man." Alas ! Mr. Editor, it is too late for the poison of the asp of
                            mammonism has entered the bosom of our Cleopatra churches and they are doomed. "For all
                            nations have drunk of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have
                            committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the
                            abundance of her delicacies." The editor of the Herald in his superficial range of vision,
                            has failed to discover that there is something deeper and grander than "discontent" in the
                            present industrial movement, for there are myriads of God's angels employed, in preparing
                            the "working classes" so-called for this second coming of the Christprinciples, of
                            socialism, communism, spiritualism, righteousism and all other "isms" for which Jesus gave
                            his life iu the first century. What the world needs, and is going to have, is a Church
                            without hypocrisy and a State without tyranny, a people without wars and bloodshed and a
                            planet redeemed from sin and disease. Many people may say "Oh ! well we know the millennium
                            is coming a million years hence," but pause and reflect, the time when "old things" are
                            passing away and "all things" becoming new, is right here for we are daily witnesses of the
                            same, aud the beginning of the end of the worldliness and the selfishness of the present
                            condition of society may not be as far off as many imagine, "My spirit shall not always
                            strive with- man" and there are many startling events which the nineteenth century will
                            disclose to open the eyes of the blind and compel that attention to the necessity for
                            individual and social reformation which the times demand. We close this article with the
                            relation of a vision. "And I looked, and be-<pb n="270" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> hold! a
                            vision of the world was before me, every nation and people were rapidly being resolved into
                            three classes with banners. The first came marching with a banner the color of which was
                            black, with red fringe, and letters. On this banner was written as follows ! "Great is the
                            God of Mammon, the Creator of Monopoly and organized wealth." In the center was a red skull
                            and cross bones surrounded with the words "Legal piracy and plunder in the name of Law and
                            Order, Babylon the Great." These people were dressed in black wearing black masks. And I
                            heard a voice, saying, "This is the banner under which march all those who believe in the
                            divine right of Kings, the sanctity of Popes and the rights of property, the conservators of
                            society, Church and State, worshipers of Babylon the Great. And I looked, and behold ! the
                            second class marched with a red banner trimmed with black fringe and letters. On this banner
                            was written "Great is the God of War and Vengeance, Anarchy and destruction of human Law and
                            Government." In the center was a red torch and bomb surrounded with these words : "The torch
                            and bomb are legitimate agents in warring upon organ ized wealth." "The Law protects the
                            rich and oppresses the poor." These people were dressed in red and wore red masks. And again
                            I heard a voice saying : "Under this banner march all those who smarting from a sense of
                            wrong and injustice organize to destroy the present fabric of society and government, the
                            destroyers. And I looked again, and behold ! the third class marched with a white banner
                            trimmed with golden fringe and golden letters. And I heard a chorus of angel voices singing,
                            "Behold ! we bring you good tidings of great joy, the annunciation of the second coming of
                            the principle Christ, and beginning of the millennial era, the New Jerusalem descending out
                            of Heaven adorned as a bride for her husband." On this banner was written : "Behold ! what
                            saith the God of peace and righteousness! proclaim the Social Republics and the United
                            States of the World." In the center of this banner was a golden cross and crown with the
                            words "No Cross, no Crown." Surrounding these emblems and words was written : "The Divine
                            Community of the Sons and Daughters of God." "Socialism and spiritualism, are the two
                            witnesses against Great Babylon the modern Church and State." These people were dressed in
                            white and their uncovered faces shone like the sun and their peace and happiness was
                            supreme. And once again I heard a voice saying ; "Under this banner march the lovers of
                            peace, justice and fraternity. The Builders." � "And the great city was divided into three
                            parts, and the cities of the nations fell! and great Babylon came in remembrauce before God
                            to give unto her the cup of the vvint of the fierceness of his wrath." Rev. xvi., 19.

                            1865.</dateline><p TEIform="p">Elder Otis Sawyer, Dear Friend :�In answer to your suggestions per annexed sheet,
                            I submit the following suggestions and replies. The duty of protecting the property of every
                            individual, by just Laws promptly, and impartially administered is one of the strongest and
                            most interesting obligations on the part of government, and in discharge of this obligation,
                            it is bound, and will assist the rightful owner of property, in the recovery of the
                            possession of it whenever unjustly withheld. A Trustee or Agent entrusted with general
                            powers, must exercise a sound discretion, act in good faith, within the scope of his powers,
                            he has all the implied powers necessary to complete the business in the scope of his
                            employment. Tt is a general rule that when an Agent or Trustee is duly constituted, and
                            names the principal for whom he acts, and contracts it, his name, the Principal is
                            responsible and not the Agent. But the Agent must not exceed his powers. This rule,
                            Chancellor Kent says, pervades every system of juris-prudence, and stands on strong
                            foundations ! If a Trustee, or general Agent does what he is authorized to do and something
                            more., it will be good so far as he ivas authorized to go and the excess only will he void.
                            When the Trustee, or Agent exceeds his powers, and purchases in his own name without
                            disclosing for whom he acts, his principal will still be liable, provided the property so
                            purchased comes to their hands and use. Persons dealing with an Agent, or Trustee are hound
                            to enquire and know how far such Agent is authorized, and that their contracts are within
                            the scope and limits of the power conferred on him. All Trustees deriving their powers from
                            courts or appointment of individuals or Communities, are subject to well defined rules of
                            law and equity. The Trustees cannot reap benefit from the use of the Trust fund or property
                            ! He cannot act for his own benefit in any contract, purchase or sale, as to the subject of
                            the trust.<pb n="272" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> He cannot take upon himself an incompatible
                            duty. He cannot have an adverse interest and employment, for this would expose his judiciary
                            trust to abuse and fraud. These principles are especially applied to your Deacons and
                            Trustees, whose time and services belong to the Society. Real estate as well as personal,
                            purchased with the trust fund or property, and conveyed to the Trustees still belongs to the
                            owners of the fund, or property with which such purchase is made. Agents and Trustees are
                            bound to render an account, at any time on demand of those for whom they act. It was settled
                            some forty years ago in this state (Maine) by the highest judicial authority, and upon
                            principles of common law, equally applicable here, and in every other state, that the "
                            Covenant by which the members of the Society or Societies of Shakers are bound, to each
                            other, is a valid instrument, obligatory on all who voluntarily enter into it." That, the
                            Covenant requires the surrender of all the property, and commands the entire services of
                            persons admitted to membership. Not only the property but the individuality of the member,
                            is to a certain extent, yielded up to the Community of Interests, and he has henceforth no
                            power to contract for himself or the Community, except within the rules prescribed in the
                            Covenant and by the authorities of the Society. When he transcends these bounds, his acts
                            are a nullity and impose no liability on the Society. Ans. to Interrogations. Ques. 1. What
                            is the legal, and most proper course to adopt provided an individual appointed as Trustee or
                            Agent violates his covenantal obligations, and refuses to be accountable to the authorities
                            specified in our Covenant or Constitution, who are the Ministry and Elders, and for sundry
                            violations of known duties, it is believed that said Trustee is embezzling the property of
                            the family or Society in which, and for which he is acting as Trustee or Agent? Ans. The
                            appointing power, the Ministry and Elders may remove the defaulting Trustee or Agent, give
                            him notice of the removal and appoint his successor. Ques. 2. Suppose he claims to have
                            taken the responsibility to step one side of the established rules of the Society, in which
                            he is acting as Trustee or business Agent, which forbids hiring money, involving the family
                            in debt, or in any way making the family responsible for money received and he hires money
                            on his own name, and by speculation with funds thus received, earns one thousand dollars,
                            more or less, and claims that as his own private property, what claim has the Society upon
                            money or other property thus earned ? Ques. 3. If money so obtained is vested in neat stock,
                            lumber or real estate, what course should be taken by the Society, to take the possession of
                            said property ? Ques. 4. If the Society has good reason to suppose that an individual
                            Trustee has money or investments in Government or Company stocks, which are deposited iu
                            banks' safes,�How can legal possession be taken of them ? Ques. 5. If there is good reason
                            for believing that said Trustee has money,<pb n="273" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> notes, bonds
                            or other securities concealed on his person, what right has the executive authorities of the
                            Society, to compel such individual to make presentation of property to them ? Ques. 6.
                            Supposing a Trustee holds notes, bonds or title to real or personal estate, or personal
                            property of any kind which he has received in his own name, no reference being made in those
                            deeds, bonds, notes, &amp;c, of his Trusteeship or Agency for or in behalf of the
                            Society, or family in which he claims to be a member, how does this effect or impair the
                            right to claim and hold all such property ? Ans. to 2. 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the Trustees or
                            Agent has neat stock, lumber, or any specific article of personal property, Bank Bills,
                            stock or notes of hand, in his own name, it is still the property of the Society and duty
                            and right of the Ministry and Elders and successors of such defaulting Trustee, to take and
                            reduce to their possession such property, wherever they may find it. If it be in custody of
                            any corporation, Bank or other persons. Give them notice of your claim to it, demand it, of
                            such Bank, or third person. If you obtain possession of notes of hand though payable to such
                            Trustee, you can collect them for the Society. If the promiser is known, you may notify him.
                            that the note given such Trustee is the property of the Society, and then collect the amount
                            of it. If any person, stranger, member or removed Trustee is embezzling removing or
                            destrojing property, papers, title deeds, or anything else or secreting them about his
                            person, the authorities of the Society may, without process of law, detain and take from him
                            such property, using such force as may be necessary after demand to possess themselves of
                            the property, no more. Or if it be deemed safe to delay, they may make complaint to a
                            magistrate, and have an officer obtain the property so embezzled. I have no doubt,
                            conveyances of real estate by deed to a Trustee by name only, ensues to the benefit of the
                            Society and the authorities may enter upon such real estate and treat it as stolen property,
                            of the Society, and a court of equity will order the conveyance by the removed Trustee.
                            Every trade made by a Trustee though in his own name, is for the benefit of the Society. He
                            cannot hold the profits of any trade, as his own. The authorities may take such property
                            wherever they may find it, or money if within their reach. Taking bills of sale and
                            conveyances to himself, does not at all impair the right of the Society authorities for whom
                            he is bound to act, to take actual possession of all such property. Your authorities may
                            take possession of all property attempted to be kept from them, as they find it. If in
                            possession of third persons who refuse to deliver it up, an action at law may be maintained
                            for it, or the value, as the case may be. If the defaulting Trustee, on demand of the
                            Ministry and Elders, to whom he is required to account, refuse and they suspect he has
                            funds, personal or real in his own name, or intrusted to other persoiis, belonging to the
                            Society, they can, by bill for discovery, have him ordered to disclose under oath every
                            transaction he has entered into and what funds, and estate he may have, where it is, and
                            demand that he deliver or convey as the case may re-<pb n="274" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>
                            quire. This is the remedy where you do not know the extent of the misappropriation or cannot
                            get hold of the property, papers or stock, &amp;c. Every person who transacts business
                            for your Society, is known to act not for himself but for the Community. All men dealing
                            with him are bound, especially in an important affair, to know that he is authorized, and
                            the extent of that authority. As your regulations do not authorize hiring money, the Trustee
                            could not bind the Society. If you have been accustomed to borrow money through a Trustee or
                            any member of a certain individual, and the authorities paid it, that might give the implied
                            authority, for the same individual to loan again and collect of the Society. Paying that
                            individual would not authorize other persons, to whom you had not paid, to collect of you
                            loans to the same, or any other Trustee. Ques. 7. If t*he violations of Covenantal
                            obligations of such individuals, are such as to convince the leading authorities of the
                            Society that he has forfeited his right of membership and said individual refuses compliance
                            with Society rules and Covenantal requirements and still persists in holding a place, and
                            right of membership, then what course are the Society to take to accomplish his ejectment
                            from the Community ? Ans. When a Trustee is not only removed from his Trusteeship, but for
                            misconduct and violation of his Covenantal obligations, is removed from membership,
                            according to your rules, after notice, and reasonable time to leave, he has no more right
                            than a stranger and becomes a trespasser by remaining or re-entering and may be treated as
                            such, by process of law. Ques. 8. If such individual has run in debt, contrary to the
                            established rules and laws of the Society, after a declaration and caution to the public
                            against trusting members, or professed members of the Shaker Community, has at any time been
                            made patent to the world, through the medium of the leading public journals in the state,
                            what obligations are the Society under to pay any such demands, supposing the Society may
                            have, at any previous times for the honor of the Society and to secure individuals met some
                            such improperly contracted debts ? Ans. This is substantially answered. Such payments would
                            be considered as secrecy and create no implied promise to pay other individuals nor that one
                            again, after notice. When the Trustee trades outside of his authority, you may elect to be
                            bound or not. If you receive the goods you would be obliged to pay ; not otherwise. When- a
                            Trustee retires, and you do not apprehend an escape or loss of property, an application to a
                            court of equity for a full account would be preferable to the summary modes above suggested.

                            Bible Schools we add. The pupils will fail to appreciate and value the beauty of a Christ
                            life unless they see it manifested by their Christian leaders and those with whom they may
                            mingle. In order that we may draw others into<pb n="275" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> the Gospel
                            Christ life we must first be drawn ourselves and then walk very closely to him, for Jesus
                            says, "If ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye wTill and it shall
                            be done unto you." These grand and glorious teachings of the Bible are Spiritual truths and
                            that must be Spiritually understood and if the Holy Spirit dwell not in us how shall we be
                            able to teach them aright. If our hearts are purified and we are truly made free because we
                            know the truth then we can teach it to others. Again the teacher must be regarded as an
                            instructor who should be throughout acquainted with the history, geography and ancient
                            customs concerning the lesson and deeply conscious of the various duties taught in it and as
                            much as possible be able to clearly communicate his knowledge and personally bring the truth
                            to each pupil individually under his care. Much attention should be paid in questioning,
                            which should not always be so simple as to call forth no mental effort neither should it be
                            so difficult as to be impossible for the scholar to comprehend the principal object of the
                            question, but to gradually lead the pupil to think for himself and to express his thoughts
                            clearly. Teach your pupils how to study� assisting such at times will encourage them to
                            investigate during the week. They should be made to feel that the Bible is the word of
                            eternal life, the true source of comfort and strength to all who believe its precious Gospel
                            promises. Long and tiresome exhortations are unnecessary to bring the child to the gospel
                            truths. Careful, prayerful instruction will more frequently produce impressions that are
                            lasting. Again we should endeavor to become familiar with I the character and circumstances
                            of those whom we are to instruct. Watch their actions, win their confidence, sympathize with
                            them in their trials, share their joys, be a sincere friend as a brother or sister to each
                            one. Remember them in your prayers. Do not become discouraged because you cannot see the
                            result of your labor now:�"Be ye steadfast, immovable; abounding in the work of the Lord,
                            for of such as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the sight of the Lord." Therefore
                            let us make the Bible Schools in every family an earnest life-long work for truly the
                            imprint made on their lives by our words and actions will not be erased during the time of
                            eternity. It thus becomes us to devote nothing short of our noblest energies to building up
                            the most holy faith the Gospel truths with those who are in our care. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            golden calf. From that time Israel turned away as Moses declared when he threw down ihe
                            tables of the law and broke them in pieces. Repeated efforts were made to reclaim the
                            Israelites from their idolatrous, avaricious disposition, yet in their hearts they turned to
                            Egypt's fashions. In imitation of the heathens they believed that God was delighted with
                            bloody sacrifices of savory meats and odors of incense and that these were a propitiation
                            for sin. Tliiy thought that they were God's people for whom He had a partial affection to
                            the exclusion of all others, and that He command-<pb n="276" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> ed them
                            to exterminate the natives of the country and possess their land. Thus at a glance we see
                            the Jewish idea of God and his attributes. That He in person led the armies of Israel to
                            battle requiring them to slay men, women and children. This feature can only be appreciated
                            by such as uphold the principle of war and conquest. We might excuse the barbarity of that
                            superstitious age, for in their ignorance it was impossible for them to conceive cf God in
                            his true character. Those records are a remnant of Jewish history only a portion of which is
                            to be depended on because mingled with heathen traditions. There were false prophets and
                            true ones, the latter they persecuted. The Prophet Samuel, chap. x. and xix., reproaches
                            them saying, "Ye have rejected your God who brought you out of bondage. Ye refuse to obey
                            the true prophets and now desire a king to go before and fight your battles like the
                            heathens around." Saul slew his thousands and David his tens of thousands. They were men of
                            blood that kept back the enemies of the Lord, How does this compare with David's Psalm, for
                            he says, "The Lord is of tender mercy towards his enemies, his goodness and love endures
                            forever-" Here is a surprising contradiction of character. All the prophets sung of his
                            never-ending love and charity, yet his reputation is traduced, his name implicated by the
                            charge of directing the murderous doings of the Israelites. The truth was as Isaiah
                            declared, lix., 7, "They trust in vanity and speak lies. They conceive mischief and bring
                            forth iniquity. Their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood."

One
                            shows a noble, cultivated mind, the other an untrained and unsubdued spirit. Any one who
                            assumes a quiet and dignified cheerfulness is always highly valued in society, for their
                            presence is like sunshine. It refreshes and gladdens the hearts of all with whom they come
                            iti contact. "A cheerful temper joined with innocence will make beauty attractive, knowledge
                            delightful and wit good natured." It may be thought by some persons that in order to be
                            strictly religious they must go around loag-faced and melancholy, but that is a great
                            mistake ; true religion never called any one to sacrifice cheerfulness of spirit; there have
                            been some of the most mirthful and cheerful people who have been very religious and
                            spiritual; but they knew when to use their mirth, and also when to lay it aside. The Bible
                            tells us, that David king of the Israelites danced before the Ark of the Lord with all his
                            might, and when reproached and scorned by Michal the daughter of Saul, he said, "I will yet
                            be more vile than thus, and will be more base in mine own sight." Meaning that he would yet
                            be more joyful in the praise of the Lord, regardless of what the natural man or woman might
                            say of him. Whenever we feel most ^inclined to be melancholy, and look on the dark side of
                            life, then is the time for us to strive the hardest to be cheerful, instead of finding fault
                            with everybody and everything. Robert West has truely worded it, that "Nothing is easier
                            than fault-finding,<pb n="277" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> no self-denial, no brains, no
                            character are required to set up the grumbling business ; but those who are moved by a
                            genuine desire to do good, have little time for murmuring or complaint." It shall be my
                            daily endeavor to cultivate a cheerful disposition and always manifest the fear of God in my
                            deportment. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            beautiful saying of the good Master. It is lightly passed over by the majority who profess
                            to follow him, because human nature is selfish ; and each one seeks his gain, regardless of
                            his neighbor's comfort and happiness deeming it more profitable�if not more blessed�to
                            receive than to give. A selfish disposition knows not the sweet peace and contentment that
                            flows from true benevolence. Have we not all sometimes felt the joy of giving, or
                            ministering to the needs of others ? We feel happier in distributing blessings, than in
                            storing up for ourselves earthly treasures; and even when we make little sacrifices in the
                            every day duties of lite for the comfort of our brother or sister, it imparts to, us greater
                            pleasure than if we lived for self alone. There are some who are constantly hoarding up
                            treasures, and only thinking and caring for their earthly wants without a thought for the
                            future or for their spiritual needs ; such are not laying up treasures in heaven. To live to
                            do good should be the end and aim of our existence ; if we would be happy and realize the
                            true blessings of living we must subdue selfishness, and strive to possess the spirit that
                            actuated the lowly Jesus, who went about continually doing good. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                Months of vital interest to every active worker in the cause of righteousness and peace.
                                To us, they can return no more ; and, indeed, we have no occasion to wish their return,
                                as all our deeds of loving faithfulness will bring their commensurate reward; while on
                                the other hand, if we have an accumulation of broken promises or neglected duties we
                                must undoubtedly suffer a corresponding penalty. All along through these varied seasons
                                we have not been left to toil alone, nor have we been left to mourn over the
                                unfruitfulness of the Christian life. God's goodness has been to us a never-failing
                                fountain, "a well of waters springing up unto everlasting life." Bounteous gifts from
                                the hands of a Heavenly Father and Mother have been conferred upon us for encouragement
                                and for distribution among those less favored with these divine blessings. In many, very
                                many things we have great reason for rejoicing, while in others, as might be supposed,
                                we may have some cause for regret. It will, indeed, be a bright, spiritual season, well
                                worthy to be a part of the incoming millennium, when we can count the full year of
                                twelve months, in which there is no sin, no sorrow or even a "shadow of turning."
                                Whatever may have crossed our path in these twelve months, bearing in the least, a
                                relation to these conditions of mind and manner, we still may rejoice in all the battles
                                that have been fought, in all the victories achieved, and that we are yet able to make
                                renewed determinations to march on toward the Holy City. In this we have the daily
                                lesson as it is brought before the Christian mind, and into which he should throw all
                                the zeal and patient persistence of an unreserved interest. The gospel testimony
                                requires all this of everyone who names the name of Christ. In this way we accept the
                                opportunity to diffuse spiritual life and light, by which much good may be accomplished.
                                I trust that we may review with much pleasure, the work through which we, so recently,
                                have passed, and take courage in the assurance that many evils have been overcome, many
                                enemies of the cross slain, and many false spirits cast out. Such a gospel work as this
                                may entitle us to a<pb n="279" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> share in the promises, by which
                                we may receive a new name and a beautiful home in the City of our God. When the mind of
                                the Revelator was illuminated to see that most lovely abode, the Kew Jerusalem, as it
                                came down from God, out of heaven, he saw in the fulness of its glory, the heavenly
                                reward which was promised to those who had obtained a victory over the elements of the
                                world. It was the city of the living God, the abode of the meek, the merciful and the
                                pure in heart. We trust that in this review of the year so soon to close, our readers
                                may be able to find their own case so clearly illustrated that there need be no
                                hesitancy in accepting it. Add or diminish as may be required to suit the emergency but
                                do not fail to find time before the thirty-first day of December, to establish in the
                                heart, a determination to love God and to work righteousness during the year 1889. Write
                                out a list of moral obligations and then have the force of character to make them
                                practical. Go farther, �enter the spiritual realm and "Seek first the Kingdom of God and
                                its righteousness." "Deny thyself of all ungodliness and every worldly lust." There need
                                be no fear in accepting these few lessons in self-denial as in or out of the church,
                                they may have a very salutary influence upon the mind.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Contentment" TEIform="index"/>CONTENTMENT.</head><p TEIform="p">A happy lot forever mine, Impossible to e'er repine, The best must give content:

D., ATLANTA, SA.] We are very apt to
                                        seek some far fetched cure for our bodily ailments, and to overlook the simpler
                                        remedies, quite as effective it may be, which are to be found even in the
                                        humblest household. Common salt is one of the specifics for various diseases,
                                        which many lose the benefit of because they are not aware of its value. For sore
                                        or inflamed eyes, wash them in a weak solution of salt and warm water. This is
                                        also useful to remove the inflammation caused by extraneous substances in the
                                        eye. For sore throat and a hacking cough, take one salt-spoonful of salt, two
                                        tea-spoonfuls of vinegar, to half a goblet of cold water (icedwater preferable;)
                                        sip this frequently and relief will be felt at once. This same preparation will
                                        remove nausea, and settle the weakest stomach. It is also be eficial in attacks
                                        of colic. Nothing is more useful in sickness than a small flannel bag filled
                                        with salt. For toothache, colic, or diseases requiring warm applications, it is
                                        invaluable, as it retains its heat a long time ; and it is greatly to be
                                        preferred to hot, wet emollients, which soon get cold and uncomfortable The bag
                                        and all can be put on a tin pan and warmed in the oven ; but it is better to rip
                                        a small hole in the bag, and empty the salt out into the pan to heat. After it
                                        is hot it can be put back with a large spoon, and the hole sewed up in a moment.
                                        We have recommended this to several of our friends while they were suffering
                                        severe pain, and we have had the satisfaction of knowing that they experienced
                                        almost immediate relief from it. We knew it prescribed years ago for a case of
                                        severe colic. The effect was magical; and ever since the saltbag has held an
                                        honored place in our domestic pharmacy. A mixture of ice and salt, in proportion
                                        of one to one-half, applied to the head frequently gives instant relief from
                                        acute headache. It should be tied up in a small linen cloth,<pb n="280" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> like a pad, and held as near as possible to the seat of the
                                        pain. A tea-spoonful of salt, dissolved in water, and taken every hour or two,
                                        beginning six or eight hours before a chill, will often prevent it, in
                                        intermittent, or what is known as chills and fever." I once succeeded with this
                                        simple remedy in an obstinate case, where quinine, arsenic, and all the ordinary

                                        prominently forward�that fish is a brain food of great value, and an exceedingly
                                        good diet for invalids, and that ice is always pure, no matter how filthy the
                                        water from which it was formed. Nor is it at all certain but that the profession
                                        has held, at different times, these same^sadly erroneous beliefs ; indeed, it is
                                        feared that some even yet cling to the fish as an article of diet especially
                                        created for the sick room. The truth is that fish, as a brain food is worth no
                                        more, nor as much, as many other foods, and, as an article of diet for sick
                                        rooms, in the majority of cases, is absolutely injurious. Relapses have been
                                        caused frequently by fish when given after fevers and nervous complaints. Loss
                                        of weight followed a fish diet, and very promptly. It should be stricken from
                                        the diet card for the sick rooms. To convince the average man that ice is or can
                                        be filthy is a hard task. But it can be done, and the people should be taught
                                        that ice may be as unfit for use as water, and for the same reason, that
                                        freezing does not remove all impurities, nor kill disease germs. It is true that
                                        some of the frozen matter is eliminated in congelation, but not all. The fact
                                        should be proclaimed that ice from stagnant pools or water that contains refuse
                                        of any kind, is not fit for use, that it may breed disease and death.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Health and home" TEIform="index"/>Health and Home.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="False counselors" TEIform="index"/>FALSE COUNSELORS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">[Contributed by Wm.

Ed.] At a
                            time of so much angry feeling, selfishness and self-seeking, we desire to bring together
                            earnest people of all classes, who wish to set the promotion of God's Kingdom of
                            righteousness, peace, and love, above all selfish considerations of party, sect, or personal
                            convenience. We are not in any sense a sect: we do not enter into theological discussions,
                            or hold religious services, or interfere in any way with the work of the Churches. We are an
                            Ethical Society founded on a Christian basis, and having for its only condition of
                            membership "an endeavor, in all things, to render faithful obedience to the spirit of
                            Christ." We are a League of Justice and Love, inspired by a longing for higher spiritual
                            life ; we hope to become a Universal Bkotherhood�conscious children of one Father, and
                            servants of one Master who was willing to become Servant of all. 680 men and women have
                            joined the Society since its formation in March, 1886, all of whom have come in without
                            argument or discussion, attracted solely by the soundness and simplicity of its cne rule. We
                            believe that 10,000 earnest people, with their hearts firmly fixed upon righteousness,
                            working quietly and patiently in their various circles, and availing themselves of ail
                            opportunities of promoting human righteousness and human happiness, would soon work a moral
                            reformation in the land. Should the Society take root in other countries, it might serve as
                            a connecting link between nations, as well as between Societies and Churches, and thus be
                            the means of fostering healthier and kindlier feelings among people of all kindreds,
                            nations, and tongues. While affording many opportunities to our members for co-operating
                            with each other, we allow to all the fullest freedom, so long as they use not their liberty
                            unworthily, but as servants of Christ. All that is done among us is done spontaneously, and
                            without persuasion. The Society is called "The Christian Kingdom Society." The name
                            "Kingdom" is used because it suggests the idea of "obedience to law," rather than that of
                            "uniformity of opinion," and because it was the term almost invariably used by Christ, whose
                            mission was to establish God's Kingdom of heaven upon earth. We make no additional demands
                            on the time or energy of those who are alre dy working in the Kingdom of God, but the fact
                            of such workers accepting membership among us will strengthen the hands, rejoice the hearts
                            and revive the spirits of many. Membership of the Society does not in any way increase our
                            responsibility or the claims<pb n="282" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> of Christian brotherhood,
                            but it tends to force them in upon our attention, and it is hoped it will enable us by
                            mutual encouragement, suggestion, and assistance to discharge them better. Our organization
                            is simple, but hitherto it has worked well. We have no public meetings or lecturers : we
                            rely upon the individual efforts of all our members. We hope, therefore, that those who hear
                            of the Society will pass on the message to friends and acquaintance, and do what they can to
                            influence others in daily life. We make no personal appeal for funds, but all contributions
                            will be thankfully received by the Treasurer, Mr. Edmund Waller, Harrow Eoad Branch of
                            London and County Bank, and all receipts are signed by Treasurer and Secretary. Should you
                            feel in sympathy with us, we hope you will not hesitate to communicate with the Secretary,
                            or with some member of the Committee. What the age needs most of all is not more light, or
                            more lecturers, but more resoluteness in our efforts to be loyal to the light and knowledge
                            we possess. Leaflets will be forwarded to any who desire fuller information.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Smith, Alex H." TEIform="persName"/>ALEX. H.

                                    more fiercely. Kind words make other people good-natured. Cold words freeze people,
                                    hot words scorch them, bitter words make them bitter, and wrathful words make them
                                    wrathful. There is such a rush of all other kinds of words in our day, that h seems

                                    out of his sour, morose, unkind feelings. We have not begun to use kind words in

                                    Mecca of two devout followers of the Prophet. Abouk journeyed on foot; Selim was
                                    mounted on a camel. At night-fall both the pilgrims had reached a spring of water in
                                    the desert, where grew a few palm trees. They prepared to spend the night together.
                                    "It is a long and tedious journey," said Abouk. "On the contrary, it is short and
                                    pleasant," answered Selim; "I was cheered by a mirage on the horizon, wherein I saw
                                    the spires and temples of the Holy City." "There was no mirage, no Holy City to be
                                    seen !" angrily declared Abouk; "there were, instead, legions of venomous ants in
                                    the sand, that bit and poisoned my flesh." "Not a single ant was on the desert,"
                                    rejoined Selim. The two pilgrims were quarreling fiercely, when a good priest, also
                                    journeying toward Mecca, came up. He* listened to them patiently. "Peace my
                                    brethren," he said, at last; "let us leave these questions until to-morrow night to
                                    decide. In the meantime, let Selim go on foot, and Abouk ride the camel." They
                                    consented to this exchange of places. On the next night it was Abouk who had seen
                                    the glorious visions, and found the journey pleasant, and it was Selim who had been
                                    bitten by the ants. "My brothers/' said the priest, "we are all going to Mecca,
                                    whether we walk or ride ; but Selim can not see what Abouk sees unless he stands
                                    where Abouk stands. It is well to change places occasionally."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Argonaut" TEIform="index"/>Argonaut.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our model" TEIform="index"/>OUR MODEL.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">We are the clay, and thou our potter.

.     PROF. COOK. HEARD PROM.
Pkof. Cook lately wro*e : "Having studied
man and his relations fifty years, and having
read Dr. B. B. Foote's 'Plain Home Talk,' I
say disinterestedly and emphatically, that it
is worth its weight in gold; naj , gold cannot
measure its value to humanity. It is such a
book as only such a healthy, well-balanced,
magnificent brain can produce. Dr. Foote is
one of the few doctors who, in his writings
and practice, seeks to cure, not kill; to save
and prolong life, not obstruct, poison or destroy it; to teach people the structure, functions, facts, forces and relations of the human
brain and body, teach them the significance
of life and how to make it healthy and happy
also how to make the most of it. Its information, instruction and advices in regard to
parentage, marriage, social and sexual functions and relations ; its facts and laws of mental, magnetic and temperamental adaptation
in marriage and parentage that children may
be healthy, happy and viable, etc., etc., make
it more valuable to suffering humanity than
my poor words can express. _ What a vast
amount of saving information for the people ;
a large book of 900 pages for only $1.50'."
