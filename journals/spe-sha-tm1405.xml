TEIform="index"/> WHAT IS LIFE?</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Perkins, Abraham" TEIform="persName"/> ABRAHAM PERKINS. </byline><p TEIform="p"> What is life? It is very much what we make it. If our soul purpose is to make the principles
                            of honesty and truth the guide and governor of action, we shall reap the fruits of those
                            principles, which are always love, peace and joy, without amalgamation or the relation of
                            any spirit akin to hatred, malice or strife. No foe, foreign or domestic, can enter to take
                            away or destroy known justification, the reward of honest living. Jesus said,�"The kingdom
                            of God is within you." It " cometh not by observation." No greater heaven is possible to be
                            enjoyed, than that arising from the knowledge of eftbrts purely honest, and from faith made
                            practical by works of obedience; and no hell more severe, han that arisinr: from the
                            knowledge of disobedience to the light of conscience. God is enthroued in the soul of man
                            for judgment, according to the testimony of Jesus ;�"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are
                            remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained." John, xx., 23.
                            Again, by Paul:�" Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?" 1 Cor. vi., 2. No
                            man can change the order of this tribunal, which is established by a mighty hand for the
                            justification or condemnation of our deeds ; and no man feels the approbation of his works,
                            unless his conscience approves ; neither does he feel condemned, unless in his own heart, he
                            is convinced he is in the wrong. Our own hearts are our accusers, whether our tongues
                            confess or do not confess. No greater evidence of truth can be obtained, than that coming
                            from personal experience. We know God through<pb n="98" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>our senses by the objects
                            of His creation. The evidence of a Supreme Being is from what we behold,�what we see, hear
                            and feel; and no evidence is more palpable, than that which comes through man, His image.
                            Hence our duty is obvious from the evidences every day before us, from the necessities of
                            the occasion, the demands of the circumstances. These circumstances man himself often
                            creates, and should be able to control. In life, there exists no condition that would
                            justify a breach of divine law. A penalty is attached even to the sin of ignorance ;
                            suffering must follow, even if but few stripes are inflicted; there must be repentance lor
                            every deviation from truth and right, which sooner or later must come to the knowledge of
                            the soul. Therefore how absolute the necessity that we live in sunlight, that we know the
                            truth as it is, that we are not in darkness and under deception, that to us life is made
                            real, that our profession be not a pretense, a fraud, a sham, that in us be no blemish or
                            taint of hypocrisy, that we be seen as we are and truly be, as we seem to be ! Such and only
                            such are the subjects of the kingdom of heaven ; the elements of which, neither defileth,
                            maketh a lie or in any sense worketh iniquity. AVho then can confidently claim to be the
                            heirs of the kingdom, the children of Zion ! Whosoever can, let him cry aloud that he may be
                            heard, if there are to be found ears to hear. Let him have the moral courage to declare his
                            faith, and by example give evidence of Christian character, that his life is hid in Christ
                            and his relation of the resurrection order. Enfield, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Religion" TEIform="index"/> RELIGION. </head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Witham, Maria" TEIform="persName"/> MARIA WITHAM.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Can religion be illustrated and its power brought to bear upon the world apart from its

                            our sincerity, but a religious life forbids suspicion and puts doubt at a disadvantage. No
                            science can ward it off. We acknowledge the truth and claim those divine principles which
                            are effectual in bringing the heart and life into such perfect sympathy, that all Avho are
                            governed by them, present to the world the image of godliness. Enfield, Conn. </p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Prayer" TEIform="index"/> PRAYER. </head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Offord, Emily" TEIform="persName"/> EMILY OFFORD.</byline><p TEIform="p"> A POET has thus very correctly defined prayer: "Prayer's the soul's sincere desire. Uttered
                            or unexpressed; The motion of a hidden fire That burns within the breast. Prayer's the
                            simplest form of speech That infant lips can try, Prayer's the sublimest strains, that reach
                            The Majesty on high. " " When Jesus Avas on the earth he exhorted his disciples to pray
                            without ceasing, but how many of those who profess to be his followers today regard this
                            admonition, though so very important? The object of prayer is to free the mind from earthly
                            care and lift it above the din and confusion that distract the sense, into an atmosphere
                            that is pure and clear, a region of peace and serenity, where the soul may enjoy a foretaste
                            of angel communion and gather a spiritual influence around it, that shall be as a wall of
                            protection when storms of temptation and trial arise. The human heart is insufficient of
                                it-<pb n="99" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>self to withstand these, even the Stoutest and bravest at times
                            quail beneath the rod of adversity. Therefore Wisdom teaches us to rely on the guidance of
                            the Infinite Hand, and listen to the still small voice of God, the conscience, which is best
                            felt and best heard in the sacred and silent hour of prayer. Ah ! who can estimate the good
                            done under the influence of a prayerful spirit? But alas! how often is the hour of prayer
                            spent in mere ceremony, leaving the heart untouched aud the soul as barren as before. How
                            many precious opportunities passed by unimproved, golden moments wasted that can never be
                            recalled. One of the first Believers said, "every breath is continual prayer to God. "
                            Sincerity of heart and fervency of spirit are always well rewarded. God is ever "ready to
                            pour out His blessings upon those who earnestly seek never with-holding from souls that
                            which is for their best good. If we ask in faith bowing in sweet submission to His will, we
                            are sure to receive. Good angels are ever near and ready to aid those who are striving to
                            rise in the resurrection of Christ. Our blessed Mother Ann, when on �earth, many times spent
                            whole nights in fervent prayer and soul labor to gain the gift and power of God to enable
                            her to overcome evil, by which means she gained complete control over her own spirit, and
                            could at times silence her opposers. Blessed victory ! there is none greater than that of
                            self-conquest, and this is gained only through humiliation, watchfulness and prayer. Mt.

                            philosophies that have ruled mankind for ages, are smitten with transition and decay, and
                            are passing away. New ones are demanding an audience in the interests of humanity. The times
                            call imperatively for nerve and spirit, perception and wisdom, and devoted intelligent
                            pioneers in the vanguard of the invincible army of the onward mighty march of Mind. The
                            pulse of a new inspiration is beating in the life channels of the thoughtFill contemplative
                            world. The errors, inconsistencies, and imperfections of past systems and methods, resting
                            like an incubus upon the republic of intelligence, binding its energies, crushing its
                            aspirations, and dwarfing its healthy growth, by an iron-bound conservatism are being
                            repelled by restive spirits Avho are putting forth their god-like energies to liberate
                            themselves aud the race, from the dominion and influence of their paralyzing, deathly coils.
                            People are becoming, more and moi-e, alienated from speculative creeds and dogmas, whether
                            in theology or philosophy. The churches and clergy of all denominations, are losing their
                            hold on the confidence and affections of the masses. People are wearying of seeking in the
                            fanciful, baseless idealism of Utopia for substantial goodness and perfection.<pb n="100" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>Mankind are becoming independent in thought aud judgment, and arc assuming the
                            prerogative to decide for themselves, in matters pertaining to their present and eternal
                            welfare. Dictation is distasteful, and coercion repulsive to them. But these were the rules
                            of the past: "Do it if you will, if not, we will compel you. " Now compulsion is opposed,
                            and coercion discountenanced by progressive minds, and incentive is preferred as the motive
                            power to draw and hold the human heart to the right. This is God's plan, and why should man
                            reverse it? The aim of enlightened reason is, to discover the basic principles on which rest
                            the development and success of the human mind, and to use the processes emanating from these
                            principles in the culture and education of the immortal soul. Partial aims and narrow
                            conceptions, do not answer the demands. Those who endeavor to build systems on such a basis
                            will surely fail, as they surely ought. A sound system of education includes the entire
                            requisitions of intelligent immortal beings, and these should be placed at their command as
                            soon as individuals become sufficiently matured in mind to appreciate their advantage and
                            use. In the brief period of our earth life, we can master but little more, if any, than the
                            rudiments of the encyclopedia of knowledge, but how many endeavor to take even the
                            initiatory degrees ? And how few there are who encourage the acquisition of knowledge at
                            all. Our first steps taken in the domain of intelligence, were in the nursery and home of
                            our infancy. Our garnered stock of valuable ideas, we gleaned from the objective world, and
                            not from books, luring the first years of childhood. We saw the accumulated furniture,
                            finish, and tapestry, the inmates and associates of our father's and mother's hou;e. Our
                            parents taught us to lisp the names of the objects and persons that had become our familiar
                            associates, and eventually to notice their forms, qualities, and differences, and to name
                            them. We had learned to express our thoughts according to the model of our exemplars and
                            fireside teachers, long before we took our seat in Pedagogue Hall. We had made some progress
                            in studying the lessons and the problems in the grand volume of God's handy works, spread
                            out before us on the beautiful pages of the attractive book of Nature, artistically
                            illustrated by the skillful Designer and Omniscient Creator of the universe of worlds. We
                            had become familiar with our native brook and rivers ; vales and dells ; hills and mountains
                            ; fields and forests ; beasts and birds ; flowers and fruits ; and the starry realm within
                            the boundary of our horizon and scope of vision ; before we knew that the alphabet and books
                            possessed any significance, contained an item of information, or were of any practical
                            benefit. Man in his pristine state, had not even the advantage of the fireside education.
                            Living, undoubtedly, like the animals, (who were but a trifle his inferiors,) without
                            shelter save what the grand majestic forests, awning rocks, mountain caves, overhanging
                            cliffs, and vine-embowered dells afforded him; and clad only in his native dress ; all the
                            knowledge he gained came from the silentteachers of his daily surroundings, and his
                            imperative demands, which were few and simple. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                Mar., 1884. </dateline><p TEIform="p"> Beloved Editor ;-The Manifesto is more and more interesting. Much good may be gained by
                                reading it. The article on Confession agrees with the experience of all who have proved
                                it. Other writers are doing good by their labors of love. "VVe should look, carefully,
                                to the cultivation of the spiritual interests. I have observed, Avith concern, a growing
                                tendency to give the outward too much supremacy. This is a mistake, and during my long
                                experience I have witnessed with sorrow its fatal effects upon the soul. In the earlier
                                part of my life I was exercised in the acquisition of outward science and know quite
                                well its tendency when it becomes a basis of action instead of being subordinate to the
                                highest spiritual development. I view with much anxiety any leaning toward science as a
                                basis for true religion. Man is ever between an innermost and an outermost, and when he
                                leaves the first for the last, he becomes divested of all true spirituality. However
                                much he may clothe himself with the intellectualism of spirit, he remains still
                                intellectual or animal and the Divine Spirit or religious love mature and its
                                development is entirely lost from sight. He then goes on in his delusive idea of
                                supremacy while he is only an intellectual man. We have thought that he was only two
                                thirds of a man, in this state, instead of being a whole one. No doubt all outward
                                knowledge may become useful when guided by the divine mind, but without this it will
                                work more and more evil for humanity. This is the dark gulf that man has to pass through
                                from ideal to essential being. We can only obtain this most desirable of all things by
                                submission to God's order as established through the spirit of Christ. There can be no
                                misgivings if we seek first the kingdom of God, when all that is necessary for us in the
                                intellectual and physical will be added in due time. As I have been a partaker of a
                                monthly feast since our paper started on its beneficent errand to humanity, I thought I
                                would let you know how much I approve of our little missionary.

                                their faith, and are we the last to speak a good word in behalf of a cause to which we
                                owe so much? All! believe me�Your daughter F. is more genuine in her consecrations, and
                                more fervent in her devotions than might sometimes be apparent. If we remember correctly
                                you placed us at the foot of the class and said that we were either the most honest, or
                                the most indifferent to the Christ principles. " Except a man forsake all that he hath,
                                he cannot be my disciple. " We understand, that no reserves of any name or nature can be
                                tolerated in a genuine Christian, but how few Christians there are !�because " Straight
                                is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life. " Who will ever reach this

                                    enrolled<pb n="103" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>with the few or the many who will know no surrender in
                                the glorious work of conquering self. We speak not as one unacquainted with human
                                frailties, but as one who means to find "salvation, and will know no defeat. We
                                understand that the religion which Jesus, the Christ, taught and lived, was a consistent
                                one, therefore, whoever would preach effectually must reduce theory to practice in daily
                                life, as did Jesus. The gospel which he administered was a saving grace and so apparent
                                was this salvation to men that they acknowledged him to be the Savior of men, and all
                                who become his true disciples must follow the pattern closely. Although "I may not reach
                                the height nor depth of God's great love to me, " yet this is our faith, our strife and
                                aim, and by our faith and our works shall we be justified. We could say much more in
                                behalf of our beautiful gospel faith, " our heart's dearest treasure, " indeed, the only
                                treasure worth possessing, but it is unnecessary.�Enough has been said to prove to you
                                that we have no sympathy with the selfishness that clings as naturally to the

                                elsewhere. It all belongs to Babylon. One phase of selfishness is just as good as
                                another, and we do not wish for any of it. But as Heaven cannot be reached by a single
                                bound, we are content to work out our salvation by the good old way of the Cross and
                                self-denial, just as our Parents have done before us, with none of the modern revisions
                                which culminate in shams; and what is more detestable than a shammy Christian? Before we
                                close, let us say a word about our position in the class, which mortified us a bit, but
                                did no harm, as we were sure we should not stay at the foot very long, if there was any
                                way to get to the head. In the meantime we had one consolation, and that was, that the
                                Teacher generally stands pretty near the foot of the class, so the place did not seem so

                            pleasure's pinions sped. I fancied all was well with me, No dark clouds gathered in my sky;
                            But joys as bright as rainbow tints Were in imagination's eye. I grasped them, but the grasp
                            was vain, Not satisfied, I still pursued; But like the " Ignes-fatui, " They further on were
                            always viewed. Something then whispered to my heart"� 'Twas reason's calm, dispassioned

                            earth, my child, a shadow is, All of the substance lies beyond; Then why so greedy to
                            possess, Or of unreal pleasures fond? The sweetest flower of Spring decays, The fruit of
                            Summer cannot last,� While Autumn's mournful passing breeze Declares, 0 man, thus life is
                            passed! Then look above the things of sense; By faith explore the goodly land,� The
                            Christian's true inheritance, Who taste pure love at God's right hand. Passion then spoke :
                            Yet longer wait, There's time enough to heed the call, Come, try once more, the tempting
                            bait, I did so, but the end was gall. Then in my heart, I firmly said : To reason's voice I
                            will attend, And gather me a precious store To feed on when this life shall end. Nature
                            shrunk back from such a course, And plead with eloquence for life; Its language had
                            surprising force, And most deterred me from the strife; But nerved anew, I took the field,
                            Conferring not with flesh and blood; True self-denial was my shield, And all my trust in
                            Daniel's God. I gained the victory ! young friends ; Myself I fairly overcome ; And blessed
                            is that soul who stems The current, just as I have done. The days I've spent in pleasing
                            self, As blank leaves in life's pages seem ; But those I offered to my God With pleasing
                            recollections teem. So if you seek for happiness, Plant well your feet on virtue's soil, And
                            in this life you will receive An hundred fold for all your toil. " Canterbury, N. H.

                            origin, for it is distinctly enunciated in the first chapters of Genesis. There the story
                            may be read how Chaos was changed to Order, and how the lower forms of life preceded the
                            higher, culminating in the appearance of man. But science has chosen not to be satisfied
                            with this account of the origin of things; while accepting the idea of the appearance of
                            forms of life in an ascending scale, in successive periods of time, it denies separate acts
                            of creation, asserting that all life, man included, originates from one primordial organism.
                            The late Charles Darwin, in his great work, " the Descent of Man, " has accumulated an
                            immense mass of facts, apparently confirm- <pb n="105" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>ing that theory. Learn,
                            then, O man, whence thou art sprung! This is the animal that first was, from which all life
                            originated, according to Darwin. It is an animal inhabiting the sea, permanently attached to
                            a support, incapable of locomotion; a little brown leathery sac ; without eyes, ears, brain,
                            heart or vertebra,�the lowest form of life. But Darwin fails to demonstrate whence the spark
                            of life that animates that humble creature. Is not the principle of life the same in all
                            forms, the highest as well as the lowest? This is the immediate ancestor of man, the famous
                            " missing link. " Neither Darwin nor anybody else has ever seen it, but according to
                            science, it ought to exist somewhere. It is covered with hair, both sexes having a beard;
                            ears are pointed and capable of being moved; the foot is prehensile and the body provided
                            with a tail. The males possess great, formidable, canine tet'th. It is arboreal in its
                            habits and has its home in warm, forest-clad land of the Old World! One of the strong points
                            insisted upon, in fact the pivotal point of the theory ; for the author himself designates
                            it but as a theory� is the law of inheritance, the operation of which accounts for all the
                            diversified species of animals and races of men. Under that law, in conjunction with the law
                            of natural selection, individuals distinguished by some physical peculiarity, relating to
                            structure, voice, color, etc., were unconsciously selected and favored by their fellows to
                            propagate and transmit those peculiarities to their posterity. Now, every one knows that the
                            peculiarities of parents are frequently transmitted to their offspring, but it is not
                            generally known that such variations are sufficient to have ever produced a new species of
                            animals or a new race of men. Man may artificially create a new breed of chickens, like the
                            Plymouth Rocks, for instance; but as soon as man ceases to interfere and they are left to
                            natural conditions, they will revert to the original stock. The same materialistic line of
                            reasoning is pursued in the treatment of virtue, morality and spirituality. Temperance,
                            charity, benevolence, honesty, chastity, aye, even the Golden Rule, it is affirmed, is the
                            natural result of the social instincts of man. Darwin from personal experience and other
                            information, proves that most of the savage races are given to extreme licentiousness, and
                            that infanticide, especially of female children is a common practice with them, in order to
                            keep down the population. Therefore, he concludes infanticide to be a beneficial practice!
                            He goes further, and says : "If men were reared under the same condition as hive-bees, there
                            can hardly De a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a
                            sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile daughters
                            ; and no one would think of interfering. " Of celibacy, Darwin sneeringly speaks as a "
                            senseless " practice, stating however, that since it requires great self-command, it has
                            been honored as a virtue from a remote period. It is startling to note the complacency with
                            which the foremost scientist of the century speaks of child-murder as being beneficial and
                            justifiable, and to witness, at the same time his cool contempt for celibacy, which is the
                            only justifiable and moral solution of the population question. Indeed, the apostle of
                            evolution condescends to admit that " the belief in God is ennobling, " but he is very far
                            from admitting his personal belief in the existence of God, or to acknowledge Him as the
                            cause of life and its phenomena ; that would be unscientific, I suppose. The present high
                            state of morality among civilized nations, Darwin attributes to experience and reason, by
                            which man has become convinced of the beneficial effects of virtue, has therefore formed
                            virtuous habits and transmitted them, and he thinks that these habits will become
                            permanently fixed by inheritance. Here is a nevr theory of the Millennium : Man will be
                            virtuous by inheritance ! It is submitted for the reader's consideration what the
                            consequences would be if for one single generation all influences that now work for virtue
                            and morality, were withdrawn, and the virtuous impulses of the rising population consisted
                            solely of what it had inherited ! Would not the race sink at once below the level of the
                            dark ages? Under the providence of God, by the aid of revelation, a large portion of the
                            human race, having been irresponsible savages, have<pb n="106" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> become
                            accountable, moral beings. But they need all the aid which can be derived from the
                            accumulated experience of the past, or which present opportunities oft'er, to enable them to
                            maintain the upward march of progress ; and nothing can be of greater advantage to humanity
                            than the blending of rational religion and rational science. It is to he regretted that
                            science in its revolt against theological tyranny has become so largely a godless
                            philosophy, and grave apprehension exists that in its turn it will become as dogmatic and
                            intolerant as theology lias ever been. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            history of the successive steps by which women will yet become American citizens. It is only
                            a matter of evolution�time. God created man in his own image in the image of God created he
                            him, male and female created he them. But politically, woman is not yet created. Man has
                            existed and ruled, by virtue of his superior physical force. Wars, and rumors of wars,
                            constitute the backbone of his history,�all human history. When woman exists politically,
                            with man, there will be Peace ; the council of peace will be between them Wars will cease to
                            the ends of the earth, and the nations will learn war no more. Kindreds, tongues and people
                            will be linked together by so many interests, that no two nations can war each other without
                            warring with all the nations of earth at the same time. And, to all the non-interested,
                            national spectators, the impending quarrel will look as insignificant as such quarrels

MILLER NOT DEBARRED BY SEX. An impartial examination of her qualifications as master of a vessel ordered. </head><p TEIform="p"> Washington, Feb. 2.�Secretary Folger to-day wrote to the Supervising Inspector General of
                            Steam Vessels as follows in regard to the application of Mrs. Mary A. Miller, of Nhw
                            Orleans, for a license as the master of a steamboat plying on the Ouachita Eiver : "A woman,
                            Mary A. Miller by name, seeks to be licensed as a master of a steam vessel on the inland
                            waters of the United States. I know of nothing imperative in the reason of things, in
                            natural law, in public policy, or in good morals, why a woman, if she is skilled, honest,
                            intelligent, hardy and prudent enough, may not have command of a steam vessel, and navigate
                            it, and manage and conduct the business carried on with it. To do that, is to be a master of
                            a steam vessel. There is, however, statute law upon the subject. "The United States Revised
                            Statutes, Section No. 4,4,58, says : ' That the Board of Local Inspectors of Steam Vessels
                            shall license and classify the masters of all steam vessels ; and that it is unlawful for
                            any person to serve as a master on any steamer who is not thus licensed.' Section No. 4,439
                            says: 'That whenever any person applies to be licensed as master of a steam vessel, the
                            Inspector shall diligently inquire as to his character, and examine the proofs which he
                            presents, and if they are satisfied as to his character, etc. etc., shall grant him a
                            license to serve as a master.' Doubtless these sections speak in the masculine gender. If it
                            be said that, therefore, they do not contemplate the licensing of a person feminine, it is
                            no more technical and close to reply that they are statutes in derogation of the common law,
                            by which, or not in a contravention of which, any person, whether female or male, may paddle
                            her or his own canoe, or steer or conduct her or his own vessel under sail or driven by
                            steam. Being in derogation of the common law, these statues are to be strictly construed. If
                            then, the power to licence being couched in the masculin) gender, they do not permit the
                            licensing of a person of the feminine gender, so the prohibition against serving as a
                            master, being couched in the masculine gender, does not prohibit a person of the feminine
                            gender. "But I am not crowded as close to the wall as that. It has been held by courts that
                            statutes 'vhich speak of males [as of peers,] and confer personal privileges, include
                            females [as peeresses] though only males are mentioned ; but still nearer to the heart of
                            the matter :�The United States Revised Statutes, Section No. 1, gives definitions, and says
                            : That words imputing the masculine gender may be applied to females; so that Section No.
                            4,438, when it speaks, that when it is unlawful for any person to serve as a master on any
                            steamer who is not licensed, means and says ;hat it is as unlawful for a woman as a man to
                            serve without a license, but in as nv.:ch as its anguage is a negative pregnant, it is quick
                            with the implication that a woman as well as a man, who is licensed, may thus serve, and
                            Section No. 4,439, when it speaks, that when <pb n="109" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>ever any person applies
                            to be licensed the Inspectors shall diligently inquire as to his character, etc., etc.,
                            means any person, female or male, and her as well as his character, etc., etc. THE
                            SECRETARY'S CONCLUSIONS. "I see no reason then, in unwritten or in written law, why Mistress
                            Miller may not lawfully demand an examination, and if she prove herself duly qualified, have
                            a license to serve as a master of a steam vessel. Nor is there need of talk, pro or con, on
                            social status, or ' Woman's Rights,' so called. Having been put on God's footstool by Him,
                            she has the right to win her bread, in any moral, decent way, which is open to any of His
                            toiling creatures. She chooses to do so, as the master of a steam vessel. It is an honest
                            calling. If she is fitted for it, though clothed in skirts rather than breeches, she has a
                            right to follow it, and no man should say her nay. " Let the local inspectors, putting
                            behind the small thought of her sex, without antagonism and without partiality, make
                            diligent inquiry as to her character, carefully examine her and the proofs she offers, and
                            if they are satisfied that her capacity, her experience, her habits of life and character,
                            warrant a belief that she can be safely intrusted with the duties and responsibilities of a
                            master of a steam vessel, let them grant her a license, according to Section No. 4,439. "

                            to age he supported its laws By a life of strict purity, faithful anri true; To speak of his
                            virtues, seems justly his due. His heart of affection with tenderness rife, Would feel
                            others' griefs, and help sweeten their life; Whatever his calling, or burdens to bear,
                            [spare; He wrought with full purpose, no strength would he The aged and feeble, his
                            sympathies knew; The youthful and erring, he taught how to do To find sweet forgiveness from
                            sorrow and sin, By prayer, faith and labor, the victory win. The lambs of the flock, How I
                            love them! he'd say; My treasures, my interest, my charge every day; I pray for them parly,
                            I pray noon and night, Their growth in the gospel is my soul's delight. O, blest Angel

                            presence, where peacefulness ruled, And talked of our home in the heavenly world! Kich
                            counsels that thrilled thro' the hearts of the good, Rang out in his voice, as God's
                            quickening word; The strong and the weak, shared alike his kind care; Who called at his door
                            found ready help there; Refined in his manners, words fitly he used, So fearful of wounding
                            the already bruised; So full of sweet charity, blessing and peace, His vestment was purity,
                            never to cease! We'll not call him back to earth's weariness now, For blossoms unfading
                            encircle his brow: His laurels of honor he's won by the cross, But his richest gain, proves
                            our deepest loss.

                            that man is peace. " We have now met to pay the last tribute of respect to our beloved
                            Elder, who has come to the close of life without a murmur or regret. We cannot wrestle with
                            fate nor trifle with its blows. We feel that this is but the sickle stroke of the good
                            reaper, whose garner is the immortal spheres of love and light. His lamp which was ever
                            filled and burning, will light him onward; it cannot go out on his beautiful transfer to
                            other and more glorious scenes. Though the years of our departed Brother were over four
                            score, we would gladly have retained him yet a little longer for his strength to Zion,
                            through his godly example, and his patient, wise and forbearing spirit. By the presence of
                            such ones among us, we are led into fellowship with the unseen of higher life, and are made
                            to breathe a purer air, while we are conscious of a blessing which passes from such lives
                            into our own. If there is aught to love in life, there is something to mourn in death. Our
                            beloved Elder was endeared to all who knew him ; his presence was beautiful, his absence we
                            deeply feel. His wide-spread fame, gave him the reputation of possessing many excellent
                            qualities. He was a noble type of manhood. " Mark the perfect man. " It is well known, that
                            the stature of the perfect man is attained only by slow gradations of travail, study, effort
                            and patience. In his life-course he persistently kept the peace, and was saved by his
                            righteousness. The more we look into his inteiior life, the more are his virtues displayed.
                            He was Sound in judgment, pure in principle, and great' in mercy and love. As a spiritual
                            leader, he was unsurpassed in faithfulness and close adherence to gospel rule. He taught
                            what he really practiced, unostentatiously and confidently. From the age of twenty one he
                            was the choice of the people to officiate as an Elder, and he accepted the duties in a calm,
                            quiet, and subdued manner, as did our Savior, when he walked with men, while in the visible
                            form. We can never forget the pleasure we have often experienced in his public
                            ministrations, when words failed to express the ever-welling fountain of the Christ baptism
                            and life. Even his silence communicated more of the spirit of God, than would a trumpet
                            voice, or a tongue gifted with eloquent speech, without his knowledge and goodness. He was
                            clothed with inspiration and from the depth of his earnest heart his language was altogether
                            lovely in wisdom and power. True principles were early engrafted in him. They grew with his
                            growth, making him a radiant star, and a model Christian. As we are mortal in our
                            sympathies, so are we in our strength of endurance. It is but human to mourn our loss of one
                            of the best our Community affords. God's heritage exists on the vitalizing influence of such
                            souls, whether in the mortal form, or obscured from our sight. It seems especially fitting
                            for the day and circumstance, that we should .levote this hour to thoughts in memory of our
                            much esteemed Elder Amos, whose travail and career is so interwoven with his various
                            positions in the general cause of our adoption, associated as he was with the Ministry and
                            Elders in different places. His disinterested and wise example will stand as a monument of
                            glory and as a tower of strength. Our remembrance of him is honor and esteem, as he goes
                            with his character into the eternal world. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. </p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Visiting and helping the needy, is religion, and true worship" TEIform="index"/>

                            as with a coat Of mail, that knows no brooding thought, nor fear Of threat'ning storms that
                            lower. The ebon clouds of stern adversity May hang above, and screen the golden beams Of
                            life's effulgent sun; biit Hope ne'er waning Ever shines within; giving glimpses of that

                            heavy waters oft may flood Their hearts in Alpine torrents; the cragged Mount of difficulty,

                            constant as the Polar star, shrink not; but bravely climb The rocky steep, defy all rising
                            fears For well they know the intervening shadows Soon will pass away like misty clouds
                            Before the rising sun; and dangers seeming' Insurmountable, will vanish 'neath the feet Of

                            adverse lines that fall across all lives Are sent of God; to teach our human hearts Life's

                            our immortal being, and fit Our souls for that eternal heaven of joy And happiness, we all
                            are seeking here; For what would be the joy of heaven, if not Attained by struggle, toil and
                            self-denial? E'en as the tender seed must struggle 'neath The darksome soil, oft-times

                            all. Then let our hearts be true ; For God is just; and they who work in his Appointed way,

                            faithful, who has earned the respect of all who knew her, and faithfully performed her whole
                            duty on earth,�now enters the new life. Is she dead? Or has she merely laid aside the mortal
                            part, as we would lay aside a garment for which we have no more use? Jesus said, " I am the
                            resurrection and the life, he that believeth on me though he were dead, yet shall he live. "
                            I believe our sister is with us, that her spirit will hover over us, urging us to persevere
                            in the good work, to be true to the moral grandeur of the cause in which we have enlisted,
                            and to have faith in God who alone giveth victory. When I see one after another of our
                            faithful veterans and burden-bearers of Zion, leaving us for their spirit homes, their
                            places vacant in our already depleted ranks, it fills me with sorrow and anxiety, and
                            prompts my soul to entreat more fervently our Heavenly Father to hasten the work of
                            redemption, to call mankind from their transient pleasures and vain aspirings, that they may
                            prepare for themselves garments of righteousness and peace, although numbers do not always
                            constitute strength. For " the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. " But
                            it is in the rigid adherence to the p-inciples of righteousness, integrity and truth. In not
                            being swerved from the path of stern duty, by the combined efforts of the world within or
                            without; cultivating universal love for all and malice toward none. Stretching forth our
                            hands and hearts to the poor, giving due heed to charity and friendly kindness, binding up
                            the broken hearted, assuaging the grief of the mourner and, at all times, administering the
                            truth. If this be our life devotion, though our numbers be few, yet when we assemble in
                            Christ's name, He will be in our midst to bless. Let us not compromise one single vital
                            principle, giving the enemy vantage ground. We can conquer though the conflict be
                            singlehanded and alone. Who has not admired the heroic struggle of the brave three hundred
                            Spartans, contending the narrow pass of Thermopyle, against the innumerable Persian host,
                            whose very arrows darkened the sun? Shall we be less valiant in a much more<pb n="112" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> glorious cause? " If God be for us, who can be against us?" Let us take
                            courage and contend valiantly, and victoriously for the right. "For the righteous shall
                            nourish like a palm tree, and shall grow like the cedar of Lebanon. For He shall give his
                            angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy way. The Lord is our defense, and God is

                            are enabled to give of the Public School under the patronage of the Shakers in this town.
                            The enrollment for the year just completed was seventeen, and although whooping cough did
                            whatever it could to reduce the average, it was as good or better than any other school in
                            our charge ; and what we said last year in reference to discipline and exactness of
                            teaching, is true also of this. The readiness with which new systems of teaching have been
                            adopted and carried into effect, is indicative of the conscientious diligence of the
                            teacher, and has been productive of much improvement in the school during the past year.
                            Especially we would give the pupils much credit for the proficiency they have attained in
                            the systvm of letter-writing and punctuation. The exemplary behavior we have invariably
                            noticed, seems to be the outgrowth of self-respect inculcated by the every day teachings at
                            home as well as in the school-room. One of the sisterhood remarked, and to us it told
                            volumes, "We never whip our children, if we cannot get along without that, we return them to
                            their parents." Susan M. White. Feb. 21, 1884. Ch. Sc. Com.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="White, Susan M." TEIform="persName"/> Susan M.

                            should be our daily prayer. " The bread of God is he that cometh down from heaven and giveth
                            life unto the world. " Surely, no rational person believes that the physical body of Jesus
                            ever came down from heaven. It is mind and spirit that constitutes the real man. Jesus,
                            identifying himself with the quickening spirit, or "Lord of Heaven," said, "I am the bread
                            of life; whoso eateth of this bread shall live forever. My flesh [body and substance,] is
                            meat indeed, and my blood [life] is drink indeed. It is my meat and drink to do the will of
                            Him that sent me." Therefore the food of the true followers of Christ, is to do the will of
                            God, made manifest in His order, and implies a daily, or continuous revelation, producing a

                                you give too little thought to the influence you are daily exerting. Let your examples
                                be for good and not for evil. Keep yourselves "unspotted from the world." " Wear but one
                                face, and let that be an honest one. " Reach after the highest realities. Be true, pure,
                                Christ-like. Struggle for spiritual redemption. Your highest attainment is a virgin
                                life. Strive for it with soulearnestness. It is your privilege to wear the Christian's
                                crown. Deny yourselves for it. No crown without the cross. Let your lives be a protest
                                against wrong. Wrong-doing brings trouble, misery and death. Every time you do wrong,
                                you lose a measure of your self-respect, and mar the beauty of the true manhood and
                                womanhood, which it is your privilege by a holy life to attain. On the contrary, every
                                time you do right, you store durable riches and add worth to your character?. Your

                            friends and strangers who visit our Community and are often taken into our Schools and
                            places of business. Q. Are you happy? Do you love your home? Do you think you will always
                            stay with the Shakers? Ans. We are early instructed to use good manners, to treat every one
                            with politeness giving a civil answer to all civil questions; but to our childish mind this
                            manner of questioning, by strangers, hardly seemed polite. We could see no reason why we
                            should not love and be happy with the friends who had been more to us than natural parents
                            could have been, for they not only provided physical comforts and mental culture but also
                            labored with an enduring patience to inspire our young minds with a love for the beautiful
                            life of our Savior. When younger we did not know as we now do that children, educated in
                            this Community are considered somewhat as are those who have been placed in Charitable
                            institutions, and persons not understanding the religious principle which prompts Believers
                            to receive children into their homes might think it possible for the little ones to suffer
                            from a lack of love and kind treatment as they sometimes might in those places. TVe.
                            however, have only a youthful evidence to give, and to give this truthfully must first admit
                            that we have been faulty. More than seventy times seven we have asked the forgiveness of our
                            friends and up to the present hour have never met a refusal; nay,�more than this, the
                            perfect kindness with which this blessing has ever been granted fully, assured us that the
                            hasty word or unkind action was forgiven and forgotten by our friends. Encircled with so
                            much love and Christian solicitude could any ordinary child be other than happy? Could she
                            picture in her mind an ideal home, or associations that could be better? We think not, and
                            although this parental care often fails to make reliable and permanent members of all the
                            children who have shared this blessing, still, they continue to sow with Christian goodness
                            the precious seed in every little heart that is drawn by the Father, even though they may be
                            no more promising than those who have already gone out; "For they know not which shall
                            perish nor which shall be spared to bloom.'' In answer to the question, Do you think you
                            will always stay with the Shakers? we can say, "As the twig is bent the tree is inclined. "
                            If childhood is impressed with the beauty of the Christian life, as taught by this people,
                            and are able to be baptized with the spirit of the same, we will abide very naturally within
                            the percincts of its principles, and in growing older our ambition Avill be to establish a
                            Christian character and to become trustworthy members of Society. Canterbury, N.

                            and exalt Christian principle in our lives. As we, grain by grain, conquer a worldly pride
                            and ambition, we find ourselves, in the same ratio�clothed upon Avith the beauty of humility
                            ; as Ave deny self, we grow benevolent; in seeking to be impartial, we become universal in
                            our loAre and sympathy. In whatever virtue one strives to excel, by the grace of God,
                            downward tendencies are Aveakened, and " Evil is overcome with good. " The fleshly
                            inheritance is wasted, and the kingdom of God opens to our view, proving the truth of the
                            text�" If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine. " The religious teacher
                            Avho would effectually impress his charge with the beauty of living the Christ life, must
                            himself be imbued with the spirit of Christ, to warrant his doctrine effectual, his example
                            safe and his influence spiritually attractive. It is a poor Christianity which* has to watch
                            itself lest it betray sensual Ioa'cs or Avorldly tendencies. The truthful man need not guard
                            his lips lest he speak falsely, or the pure man his deeds, lest he appear unseemly ; for if
                            the heart is directed toward the kingdom of God, the effect of its influence upon other
                            minds will be to lead thereunto. Those Avho have experience in the Christian warfare of
                            self-denial, who haAre really fought the battles of the Lord, through the testing discipline
                            of life, are the only competent Christian leaders. Whoever attempts to preach Avhat he do2s
                            not practice is like unto " one beating the air, " or as " a sounding brass and tinkling
                            cymbal, " Avithout the effect of the vitalizing poAver. "Let all Avho name the name of
                            Christ depart from iniquity. " Let them " put their hands at Avork, and give their hearts to
                            God, " in earnest desire that the "kingdom come" on the earth, and the will of God be done
                            by every Christian professor, so far as his light and knoAvledge may extend ; and then will
                            the harvest be at hand. Said a good sister one day, " If there is one good aspiration more
                            to be coveted for our Church and for all other churches in America, it is this,- -" To
                            hunger and thirst after righteousness" until we may be filled. Are there many Avho can sing
                            the beautiful psalm of David in these days and sympathize in his spiritual longings�"As the
                            hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God ! " " My soul
                            thirsteth for God, for the living God.'' We predict that until this longing preA*ails in
                            every Christian church, especially in our own, there will be few Pentecostal seasons
                            realized, and few souls saved unto God. At a recent meeting of the Century Club in N. Y. :
                            four religious theories Avere discussed, as the great question of the day is being asked,
                            "What shall avc do to be saved?" Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism and Agnosticism Avere
                            brought forAvard by their respective advocates, and each held up sa<pb n="115" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/>the
                            redeeming feature of the age, and by which all men may be saved. In all probability these
                            same orders may require several more seasons for the ventilation of their peculiar views
                            before all men will decide to accept either one as an infallible standard, and then throwing
                            the others entirely aside. The divine authority of the Roman Catholic Church and if the Pope
                            may answer the demand of that people, and shorn of the persecuting spirit, it may be
                            privileged to do much good. The Protestant Church, fragmentary in its existence, has its
                            basis on the Bible, but in many matters of vital interest is fouud to be wonderfully near
                            its mother church. Judaism has the credit of an ancient name and as here represented would
                            be called very liberal, admitting as the � speaker did, that there was good in every
                            religious order that had morality for its basis. The Agnostics have what they term a
                            scientific and humanitarian Church, but think that the] day for religious churches is past.
                            Of course they have a perrect right to form a Church agreeably to their own taste, and if it
                            has no religious principle to govern it, ihey may perhaps, bring in a little science to
                            occupy the place. We may suppose that these representatives of the several forms of
                            religious belief satisfied their own minds with the illustrations which they had given, but
                            we have learned that a religious faith and a religious life are quite different, the one
                            from the other. The apostle renders this unquestionably plain, "Show me thy faith without
                            thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works." " He that is slow to anger is better
                            than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city. " These
                            theological views as generally presented, bear about the same relation to religion as the
                            chaff does to the wheat. All the churches assume to preach peace and yet they advocate the
                            use of the sword. The spirit of Judaism is full of war. The religious history of either sect
                            is one of cruel and bloody persecutions. The Jews were even spiritually instructed in their
                            cruelty. "Blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers te
                            fight." It would be difficult to reconcile this spirit with the advanced thought of the day
                            and denominate them peace-loving churches, or to believe that they are willing that all
                            should grow into the knowledge of the truth and be saved. Either might be reconciled to have
                            all men saved by passing through their narrow and selfish gate while the one in the
                            ascendancy with this dominant love of power, would rule the others with a rod of ironTo do
                            unto others as we would that they should do unto us, has the sound of a kind regard for the
                            welfare of man. All that are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons and daughters of
                            God. It is this divine spirit that brings the redeeming feature and not the dogmas of any
                            particular church. </p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Ever complaining, nothing is right..." TEIform="index"/>

                                        efficient. A jaded man coming home at night from a longday's work, a growing
                                        youth losing two hours' sleep over evening parties two or three times a week, or
                                        a young lady heavily " doing the season, " young children over-fed and with a
                                        short allowance of sleep, are common instanees of the victims of " cold. "
                                        Luxury is favorable to chill-taking; very hot rooms, soft ehairs, feather-beds,
                                        create a sensitiveness that leads to catarrhs. It is not after all, the " cold "
                                        that is so much to be feared as the antecedent conditions that give the attack a
                                        ehance of doing harm. Some of the worst " colds " happen to those who do not
                                        leave their house or even their bed ; and those who are most invulnerable are
                                        often those who are most exposed to changes of temperature, and who by good
                                        sleep, cold bathing, and regular habits preserve the tone of their nervous
                                        system and circulation. Probably many chills are contracted at night or at the
                                        fag-end of the day, when tired people get the equilibrium of their circulation
                                        disturbed by either over-heated sitting rooms or under-heated bed rooms and
                                        beds. This is specially the ease with elderly people. In such cases the mischief
                                        is not always done instantaneously, or in a single night. It often takes place
                                        insiduousty, extending over days or even weeks. It thus appears that " taking

                                        to be of real value, exercise should be regular, and, if possible, in the open
                                        air, and sufficient each day for the wants of the system ; but never excessive.
                                        Extremes are always dangerous. Gymnasiums have caused the breaking down of
                                        hundreds of young men. Fearing to go out in inclement weather is a vain fear.
                                        There may be a day occasionally during the Winter when it might be prudent to
                                        remain indoors, but with proper attention immediately afterward no well person
                                        -- while exercising is likely to be the worse for v; a thorough drenching or wet
                                        feet. Air is the best of all blood-purifiers, and the more thoroughly the lungs
                                        do their work, the purer the blood, and the less liability will there be to
                                        disease. I believe that the chief cause of pneumonia is breathing impure air,
                                        and next to this over-eating. Both tend to befoul the blood. The victims of this
                                        disease are principally among " good livers, " who do not take sufficient
                                        exercise in the open air. The disease seldom attacks those whose occupations
                                        require them to spend much of their time out of doors. The main object of
                                        exercise, then, is to compel the breathing of as much air as is required for the
                                        elimination of effete matters from the blood, and the reward is an almost
                                        certain immunity from all forms of disease.</quote></cit></p></div3><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Prayer is one of the laws of nature..." TEIform="index"/>

                            religious home, we have prepared the following brief summary. Further information may be
                            obtained by addressing any member of the order. 1. The form of government in the Society is
                            adapted to the different orders of which it is composed : its powers and authorities growing
                            out of the mutual faith, love and confidence of the members. 2. No one is excluded from the
                            privilege of becoming a member on account of poverty ; nor will they be accepted because of
                            wealth. 3. Plain and explicit facts will be laid before the investigator. To become a
                            member, is a voluntary concession of the individual. 4. Those who accept the privilege to
                            reside with us, as Avell as those Avho visit the Society as inquirers, are expected to
                            regard the rules of the family where they are entertained. 5. By the principles of this
                            Society, no believing husband or wife is allowed to separate from an unbelieving partner,
                            except by mutual or legal agreement. G. Parents that become members are not required to give
                            up their children : but they will be requested to see that the children keep the rules of
                            the family. Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by the
                            request or consent of those who have the lawful right over them. 7. No corporal punishment
                            is approved in the government of the Society, nor any external violence exercised on any
                            rational person. 8. It is expected that the children admitted into the Society, will receive
                            an education suitable for the general management of business. 9. Probationary members may
                            retain the lawful ownership of their property, but the interest accruing therefrom will be
                            devoted to the benefit of the Society, until by their own free will, and the consent of the
                            Trustees, they shall consecrate said property tc the support of the family where they
                            reside. 10. The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to
                            the time of their membership. 11. Those who dispose of their property to relations in the
                            Avorldly order, should remain with those relations. 12. A person wishing to become a member
                            of the Society, must rectify all his wrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims. 13.
                            Those who ask for admission to our Home are supposed to be in search of more truth and
                            light, hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church, is the confession of sin to God,
                            in the presence of a witness. 14. Those who have dedicated their property, and afterward
                            withdraw from the Society,�according to the law of justice and equity, there can be no
                            ground for retraction. 15. To live as Brethren and Sisters in the gospel of Christ, we can
                            hold no private correspondence. All communications sent from or received into the family,
                            whether printed or written, will be subject to the examination and advice of the Elders of
                            the family. 16. The leading authority of the Society is vested in a Ministry, consisting of
                            two Brothers and two Sisters. Elders and Trustees are also appointed. These orders
                            constitute the general government, of the Society, in all its branches.</p></div2><pb n="118" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Books" TEIform="index"/> Books and Papers</head><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dietetic reformer" TEIform="index"/>Dietetic Reformer

A TKAGrlO EVENT.
A JFather'8 Despair ami  Self-Inflicted
Death.     His Son's final Rescue,
Too Iiate to Save His Parent.
The graphic occurrence that is described
below is one of the most remarkable episodes
in the domestic history of America. It is absolute truth which can readily be verified.
The inhabitants of the pleasant town of
Cortland, N. Y., were shocked one morning
by the announcement that Mr. Clinton Rindge,
one of their most prominent citizens, had
committed suicide. The news spread rapidly
and aroused the entire neighborhood where
Mr. Rindge was so well and favorably known.
At first it seemed impossible that any one so
quiet and domestic could do so rash a deed,
and the inquiry was heard on every side as to
the cause. The facts as developed on investigation proved to be as follows :
Mr. Rindge was domestic in his tastes and
took the greatest enjoyment in the society of
his children and pride in their development.
And indeed he had good reason to be proud
for they gave promise of long lives of success
and usefulness. But an evil day came. His
youngest son, William, began to show signs
of an early decay. He felt unusually tired
each day, and would sometimes sleep the entire afternoon if permitted to do so. His
head pained him, not acutely, but with a dull,
heavy feeling. There was a sinking sensation at the pit of his stomach. He lost all relish for food and much of his interest for
things about him. He tried manfully to overcome these feelings, but they seemed stronger
than his will. He began to lose flesh rapidly.
The father became alarmed and consulted
physicians as to the cause of his son's illness,
but they were unable to explain. Finally
severe sores broke out on his arms and he
was tiken to Buffalo where a painful operation was performed resulting in the loss of
much blood but affording little relief. The
young man returned home and a council of
physicians was called. After an exhaustive
examination they declared there was no hope
of final recovery and that he must die within
a few days. To describe the agony which
this announcement caused the father would
be impossible. His mind failed to grasp its
full meaning at first; then finally seemed to
comprehend it, but the load was too great.
In an agony of frenzy he seized a knife and
took his own life, preferring death rather than
to survived his idolized son. At that time
William Rindge was too weak to know what
was transpiring. His face had turned black,
his breath ceased entirely at times, and his
friends waited for his death believing that the
fiend   Bright's disease   of the  kidneys, from
which he was suffering, could not be removed.
In this supreme moment William's sister came
forward and declared she would make a final
attempt to save her brother. The docters'interposed, assuring her it was useless and that
she would only hasten the end by the means
she proposed to employ. But she was [firm,
and putting all back, approached her brother's
side and administered a remedy which she
fortunately had on hand. Within an hour he
seemed more easy, and before the day was
over he showed signs of decided improvement. These favorable signs continued, and
today William B. Rindge is well, having been
virtually raised from the dead through the
marvelous power of Warner's Safe Cure, as
can be readily verified by any citizen of Cortiand.
Any one who reflects upon the facts above
described must have a feeling of sadness.
The father, dead by his own hand, supposing
his son's recovery to be impossible; the son
restored to health to mourn the loss of his
father and the agonized relatives with a
memory of sadness to forever darken their
lives. Had Clinton Rindge known that his
son could recover he would to-day be alive
and happy, but the facts which turned his
brain and caused him to commit suicide were
such as any one would accept as true.
However sad this case may be, the truth
remains that thousands of people are at this
moment in as great actual peril as William
Rindge and in as great danger of causing
misery if not death to their friends. Liver
and kidney diseases are become the most
common and' most dangerous of any or all
modern complaints. They are the most deceptive in their beginnings and horrible in
their final stages. They are far more deceptive than Consumption, and enn rarely be
detected even by skillful physicians unless
a microscopic analysis be resorted to, and
few doctors understand how to do this.
Their slightest approach, vr possibility of
approach should strike terror to the one who
is threatened as well as to all his o" her
friends. These diseases have no distinct
symptoms, but come in the form of lassitude,
loss of appetite, aching muscles and joints,
dull headaches, pain< in the back, stomach
and chest, sour stomach, recurring signs of
cold, irregular pulsations of the heart, and
frequent dizziness. If neglected, these symptoms are certain to run into chronic kidney
and liver or Bright's disease, from which
there is sure to be a great amount of agony
and only one means of escape, which is by
the use of Warner's Safe Cure. The importance of taking this great remedy upon the
slighest appearance of any of the above
symptoms cannot be too strongly impressed
upon the minds of all readers who desire to
escape death and pain and prolong life with
till its pleasures and blessings.AD VERTISEMENTS.
