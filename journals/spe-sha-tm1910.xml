CAPACITY, 1,200 DOZEN  PER   DAYPRO&RESS OF MENTIONS SINCE
1845.
In the year 1845 the present owners of
the Scientific American newspaper commenced its publication, and soon after established a bureau for the procuring of patents
for inventions at home and in foreign countries. During the year 1845 there were only 502 patents from the U. S. Patent Office,
and the total issue from the establishment of
the Patent Office, up to the end of that year,
numbered only 4,347.
Up to the first of July this year there
have been granted 406,413. Showing that
since the commencement of the publication
of the Scientific American there hav..�
been issued from the U. S. Patent Offitv
402,166 patents, and about one third moi iapplications have been made than have been
granted, showing the ingenuity of our pe< pie to be phenomenal, and much greater
than ever the enormous number of patents
issued indicates. Probably a good many c f
our readers have had business transacted
through the offices of the Scientific American, in New York or Washington, and anfamiliar with Munn & Co.'s mode of doinii;
business, but those who have not will be interested in knowing something about this,
the oldest patent soliciting firm in this country, probably in the world.
Persons visiting the offices of the Scientific American, 301 Broadway, N. Y., for
the first time will be surprised, on entering
the main office, to find such an extensive
and elegantly equipped establishment, with
its walnut counters, desks, and chairs to
correspond, and its enormous safes, and such
a large number of draughtsmen, specifiearks, all busy as bees, reminding one of a large banking or insurance office, with its hundred employees.
In conversation with one of the  firm,   who
had commenced   the   business   of   soliciting
patents in connection with the publication  of
the Scientific American,  more  than   forty
years ago, I learned that his firm   had   made
application for  patents   for  upwaad of   one
j hundred thousand   inventors  in  the  United
States,   and   several    thousand   in   different
I foreign   countries,   and   had   filed   as   many
I cases in the Patent Office   in a single  month
| as there were patents issued during the   enI tire first year of their business career.    This
I gentleman had seen  the  Patent Office   grow
from a sapling to a sturdy oak, and  he mod| estly hinted that  many  thought  the   Scientific American, with  its   large   circulation,
had performed no mean share in   stimulating
inventions and advancing the interests of the Patent
Office.   But it is not alone the patent soliciting that
occupies the  attention of  the   one hundred persons
employed by Munn & Co.,  but a  large  number  are
engaged on the four publications issued   weekly and
monthly from their office, 361 Broadway, N. Y., viz. :
The Scientific American, the Scientific American Supplement, the Export Edition of the Scientific American, and the Architects  and Builders
Edition of the Scientific American.   The first two
publications are   issued every week, and  the  latter
two, the first of every month.

                            regular and the marching and dancing were more moderate. Previous to this there was not much
                            order observed among the Brethren and Sisters, in the occupation of a special place, but a
                            Christian care was taken not to trespass upon the privileges of each other. The meetings on
                            the Sabbath were generally in the Church, and open to all who wished to attend. The
                            Believers occupied a standing position, and arrauged in ranks, with the Brethren on one side
                            of the central line of the room and the Sisters on the other. The first ranks at the head of
                            the meeting were separated about four feet, while at the other end they were some ten feet
                            apart. The many violent manifestations of power which had attended the religious exercises
                            of the Believers before the forming of the Community, had become less frequent and gradually
                            faded away. This public service of which we have been speaking was attended by the several
                            families except those in the Church. This family held their meeting in the afternoon, but
                            did not admit any persons who were not members of the Community. The exercise known as
                            Square Order was introduced at this time by Father Joseph. It was a matter of much earnest
                            exertion for the Believers to perfect themselves in this form of worship. Forms that had
                            been laid aside, were occasionally revived, as some one or ones were moved by the
                            inspiration of the hour, and in this revival they shared the ministration of the divine
                            spirit. In 1774 the Square Order was omitted, and in 1776 all exercise in time of worship
                            was discontinued during a term of two years, and by the advice of Father Joseph a season of
                            rest followed. The time in worship was now occupied in exhortations to live "soberly,
                            righteou�ly and godly in this present world." On many of these occasions the assembly would
                            unite in singing one of the solemn eongs and then retire. It was a remarkable change to
                            bring about in so limited a space of time, and is a manifestation of the union and love that
                            pervaded the order. During this period of five years the religious services were of a very
                            solemn character. The revival gifts had ceased; no general exhortations were given, and if
                            any word bearing upon the life work of the Believers<pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> was spoken, it was
                            the gift of the presiding Elder. The early Believers in their seasons of revival were not
                            particular as to the time when the assembly of worshipers should be called together, but
                            accepted any time during the day or evening, when it was most convenient. Living as they did
                            in different parts of the town or state, this was the only way that could prove satisfactory
                            to them. But after the organization of the Society more system was o! 'served and regular
                            hours appointed for every meeting that was to be attended. For several years a meeting was
                            held in the early morning, in which speaking, singing and other exercises formed the order
                            of the service. In 1798 the Square Order was again introduced and at the beginning of the
                            year 1800, the meetings assumed a much more active form. The gift of exhortation was
                            encouraged, and the spirit of praise and prayer found expression in many honest and faithful
                            souls. The year 1805 is made memorable on account of ihe wonderful work of the Lord that
                            came to the people of Ohio and Kentucky. Three missionaries were seut from the Church,
                            Benjamin S. Youngs, John Meacham a:ul Issachar Bates, to preach the faith that had been
                            received by the Believers. The journey of more than a thousand miles was made on foot and
                            attended with many privations and hardships. The Brethren knew they were under the blessing
                            of God, and that a fruitful prosperity would attend all their labors of love for God and his
                            people. It was a great sacrifice for the family to make and the farewell of the Brethren was
                            one of deep sorrow, commingled with joyThe letters that were subsequently received from the
                            Brethren, gave an account of the great revival and of present progress of faith among the
                            people. Hymns were composed in the spirit of the work and sent to the Believers in New
                            Lebanon. They were read and circulated and sung. Zeal awakened zeal and the life of the
                            gospel was manifested more freely among the people. In the summer of 1807 the singing of
                            hymns was fully established in the Church, and the worship now consisted, especially, that
                            at the close of the day, in singing a hymn, and the exercise in the Square Step.
                            Exhortations were frequent and a great change took place as the worship became more actively
                            spiritual and less formal. A hymn entitled "Gospel Trumpet," was composed and formed quite a
                            promiuent feature in the hour of worship. More active exercises were introduced and the
                            solemn songs, without words, were laid aside. In 1810 the singing of short songs or those
                            having only one verse was introduced. Words were also selected from the exhortations made in
                            time of worship, and these were arranged to music and used with much satisfaction. 1 his
                            soon led to the writing of anthems of various lengths, which in many instances took the
                            place of hymns, as the introductory siuf ing for the season of vvorship. Some elementary
                            lessoos in music were taught, at this date, as but. very few peisons had any knowledge of
                            the rules of music. All the songs and tunes were learned by the ear and re-<pb n="219" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> tained by the memory. After the more universal introduction of hymns and
                            anthems, with music attached, it became quite a labor to learn and to retain all that were
                            brought forward. Visitors to and from- New Lebanon, also became interested to learn one or
                            more new hymns or anthems, to take to their own homes. In the year 1815 an anthem was
                            written and the music attached and then sent to the Believers in Ohio. This was the first
                            instauce where an anthem set to music had been forwarded to a western Society. The knowledge
                            of music gradually increased in the several Communities and in 1819 an exchange of several
                            pieces was made between the Society of New Lebanon and Union Village. No singing schools had
                            been established and but few of the singers engaged in the study of music. The round notes,
                            only were used, but by some were considered very obscure. In the course of eight or ten
                            years, a great improvement was made in the writing of music and the round notes were thrown
                            out of use. The Community at Harvard, Mass., suggested the using of letters for uotes, and
                            this manner was adopted. The various length of the notes were designated by capitals,
                            italics, etc. This was soon followed by another degree of improvement, in the use of small
                            letters, and by attaching brevitures and other characters to indicate the length of the
                            notes. This system originated at New Lebanon. The modes were used as formerly written until
                            1835, when there was a thorough reform made in the system of music, which was generally
                            adopted by the Believers. A small work was published in 1833 entitled, "The Rudiments of
                            Music." It contained 158 pages. In 1842 a music book was published by the Society of New
                            Lebanon. The Society at Enfield, Conn., rendered much assistance by the writing and
                            publishing of articles on the science of music. By the use of the letters of the alphabet,
                            it was thought unnecessary to retain the staff, and that gradually was thrown out of use,
                            and by the year 1858, it was rarely used in any of the communities. We now return to the
                            form of worship as used in 1817. It required great care to retain the forms of exercise, to
                            walk or to march in a body, across the room, and to keep a regular step and correct time,
                            was a work of much anxiety. A programme of the leading hymns and anthems to be used during
                            the week wa3 brought forward and read in the meeting of Sabbath, P. M. The selection was
                            made by the Elders of the family, or by any of the interested singers. Several forms of
                            exercise were introduced from time to time, but did not long continue in use. In 1822 more
                            freedom was given to the speaking, during the hour of worship which proved both pleasant and
                            profitable. Sometimes the whole family would march into the highway and while in the
                            enjoyment of some beautiful songs, pass on to the Center Family and share with them a union
                            gift. In 1827, a new spiritual wave passed over the Community and gave life and zeal to the
                            season of religious service. Gifts of repentance, of love, of simplicity and of new songs
                            abounded. It was a baptism of gospel fire, the good effects of which lasted for several
                            years. In all of the beautiful gifts there was,<pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> however, a measure of
                            sorrow, as it had the effect of throwing off the dying and dead branches, which at one time
                            were so promising of life. In 1837 a new era commenced as the windows of heaven and the
                            avenues cf the spirit world were opened. Gifts of visions, of revelations, of inspiration
                            and of spiritual songs were among the heavenly treasures that were showered upon the
                            Believers. Messages were spoken and written, and the number of inspirational Hymns and
                            Anthems, largely increased. This manifestation of the spirit, made its first appearance,
                            among the children, in the Community at Watervliet, N. Y., while they were engaged iu
                            religious devotion. Some of them passed into a trance state, and became wholly unconscious
                            of all external surroundings. The visionary sight which had opened their spiritual eyes,
                            unfolded most beautifully the invisible things of God. In this new life they were attended
                            by spirit guides, and taken from place to place as one would be while on the earth. The
                            attendant, spirit guide would, sometimes, hold conversation with those in the body auj ask
                            and answer questions through the oue that was entranced. Persons falling into this visionary
                            state or accepting any form of inspiration were from this time designated as ''Instruments."
                            This work soon manifested itself iu an older class, and young men and young women were
                            baptized into the new element of spiritual life. The work began to assume varied and strange
                            forms, and was looked upon with surprise and astonishment by more mature minds. Tht
                            influence had come among them, as an uninvited guest, but had earned on its introduction, a
                            most cordial welcome from every person. The gifts and exercises attracted the attention of
                            all and captivated the feelings of the whole assembly.

                            gain; Inspired with the beauties of everything new, We're anxiously looking for something to
                            do. As we enter the field of labor and toil, Whether mental or physically tilling the soil,
                            All manual labor whatever it be, Has always been health and interest to me. Surrounded by
                            guardians who're gentle and kind, To aid and direct through the journey of time; We shun
                            many evils we meet on the way, If we are but careful their voice to obey. What comfort and
                            peace as we journey along, Our souls reaching upward, our hearts growing strong; 0 beautiful
                            home with the pure and the blest,� A heaven on earth a home of sweet rest. 0, who would
                            exchange a life that is pure? Or who would not crosses and trials endure? Than dwell in the

                            with you ; Come ease or come pleasure, come sorrow or pain, My heart's entwined with you to
                            ever remain. The pathway of life is quite rugged we know, And sometimes grows rougher as
                            onward we go; But keep the eye single for truth and for right, We'll press through the
                            darkness and land in the light. Though many may miss and get on the wrong track, The soul
                            that's in earnest will never look back, But onward keep moving as true as the clock Till
                            firmly established as truth and the rock. And when life's journey is finished and gone, And
                            we are at peace with ourselves and each one; We'll count o'er the blessings of life and its
                            joy, When there's nothing of earth our peace to annoy. And then if the angel of truth can
                            record, Well done, come and enter the joy of thy Lord; The battle well fought and the
                            victory is won, Come in faithful servant, thy work is well done. Then what of the struggles
                            and toils of this life, They vanish in haste like the dews of the night; All earthly
                            afflictions disappear as a scroll, And leave just the spiritual body and soul. Away on the
                            wings of victorious love, To rest in tne mansions of Heaven above; Leave a life here ob
                            earth for a life there in God, With Father and Mother the Christ and our Lord. Mt. Lebanon,

                            Appearing on earth for the good of all mankind to lift them tip from sin and the lower order
                            of passion which is bringing all to one sad end. This only true system of religion is to
                            transform man into the image of heavenly saints. Like a great ship set off in a rough sea,
                            it had to break the waves of opposing elements of the world and with Satan's hosts, which
                            has ever been combined for its over-throw, as we learn from the Testimonies of the Life,
                            Character, Revelations and Doctrines of Mother Ann and the Elders with her. O what a
                            glorious gospel we have s:iven us through their tribulations for our good. Let us shout
                            praises to God for these precious truths given to us, which are truly glorious in their
                            origin. Glorious in their aim, glorious in their conquests�God owns them, angels smile upon
                            them, saints rejoice in them, and devils dread them. But my dear reader, though this Holy
                            Gospel be so glorious, so benevolent, and so energetic in its nature, none can by any means
                            share its triumph but those who accept it in their faith, enjoy it in their hearts and
                            practice it in their lives. To accept the Gospel of Christ, Christianity, is to believe and
                            accept Christ; to follow in his footsteps, in accepting his teaching, precepts and examples
                            these must go together in our lives. And every man stands in the way of the gospel, who does
                            not accept Christ. Christ said, "He that is not with me, is against me and he thatgathereth
                            not with me, scattereth abroad."<pb n="222" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> The Gospel has evidently suffered
                            greater loss at the hands of many wh:&gt; claim to be its friends than from those who have
                            sworn hostility to it. Many, too many, indeed, have made it a cloak that they may be the
                            more efficient to accomplish their work of ruin. The dagger concealed in the heart of the
                            hypocrite is more to be feared, than the uplifted hand of the open foe. Brethren and
                            Sisters, the Christ whom ye have received is a Shield. Keep him between you and the world
                            for every one who receives Christ, is made a voluntary, resolute agent on his own part, a
                            determined, moral hero, who works, who strives, who fights, in prayer, that he may overcome
                            self. To such, Christ is a present help in time of need, but he helps no oue to live a
                            Christ life who does not try to help himself, and abides in no oue who does not abide in
                            him, but whose desire is to give and to bless, to make men better and Christ-like, and labor
                            to transform the whole earth into God's kingdom. This Christian spirit, breathed into the
                            heart by the Holy Spirit, finding expression in all forms of benevolence, in all efforts to
                            elevate the race, and spread the blessed Gospel to all mankind is the only true
                            Christianity. Paul was so filled with this burning Christian love, that he regarded the
                            claims of humanity upon him as a debt�and am a debtor both to the Greek and the Barbarians.
                            Both to the wise and the unwise.�Yea a d.btor to the whole world. Not to the rich only, but
                            to the poor, not to the Greek only, but to the ignorant barbarian�and am in debt to all is
                            the language of Paul's great heart of love for all mankind. Shall we not labor for this
                            spirit of Christian love and then fulfill the command of Christ; he says, "Go ye into the
                            world and teach the gospel to every creature." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            those who stand with the Lamb on Mt. Zion,�becoming Virgins. They learn the song of the
                            Lamb, have the Di'me of God written in their foreheads, and are redeemed from both the first
                            and second earth. These constitute the white clouds of the New Heavens, "I looked and behold
                            a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the M&gt;n of Man�she was a daughter of
                            man�having on her head a golden crown, and in her hand a sharp sifkle. To her it whs said,
                            "thrust in thy sharp sickle and reap, for the time has come for thee to reap, for the
                            harvest of the earth is ripe." And the earth was reaped. This is the first
                            resurrection�Shakers, who are in the New Heavens. And another Angel came out of the Temple,
                            having a sharp sickle, who w;is commanded "Thrust in ihy sharp sickle, and gather the
                            clusters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe. And the Angel thrust in
                            his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
                            Wine Press of the wrath of God, and it was trodden without the<pb n="223" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> city."
                            It belonged to the New Earth. This was the Second Resurrection from the first earth to the
                            New Earth. It was the "Song of Moses." '"In the days of these kings the God of heaven shall
                            set up a kingdom�a Republic not in name, but in reality�and it shall break in pieces all
                            other kingdoms, and stand forever." He will have come whose right it is to reign in justice
                            and truth, henceforth he that would rule over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
                            The Rulers of the "first earth" government were conquerors and Kings, with Lawyers, Doctors,
                            Priests and a literary and monied aristocracy, to support them, all living as paupers, upon
                            the labors of the "common people." There has been antagonism�perpetual war�between the
                            rulers and the ruled. The people "cursed their God and their king and looked upwards for
                            redress, and it came at the American Revolution. The "first earth" is passing away and being
                            supplanted by the "new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness." Its rulers are chosen by the
                            sovereign peo pie to rule in their name and as directed by themselves. This is the first and

                            our house, as we had long been intimate friends, aud while speaking of a law suit, soon to
                            be brought forward, he remarked, "You need not fear, you will get the case. The wicked
                            cannot prosper. They will try to afflict and do all they can to overthrow the work of the

                            Stephen you have faith in the mission of Christ, why do you not obey it? "I have faith,"
                            said he, "and I should have obeyed it. I have seen and conversed with your Mother Ann." 1

                            Aun and confound her. On account of my advantages for a good education they thought I could
                            do it. Mother, aud the Elders received us very kindly, and we were soon engaged in
                            conversation. Mother Ann spoke of the evils that were abroad in the world. Some
                            philosophers, said I, think that what people call evil, is real goodness. Mother Ann then
                            referred to some of the sins that abounded in the world, and said, "Are not these, evils?" I
                            soon found that I could not obtain the least advantage and was glad, to excuse myself and
                            leave the place. At the time of this interview I obtained faith in the life of Christ, but
                            as I was a young merchant I did not wish to forsake the worldly prospect before me, nor to

                            rich ; That they were sent to preach the works of � peace, And they have filled the earth
                            with war of words; That they were sent the messengers of love, And they have driven love out
                            of their creeds ; That they were sent to teach men not to lie, Nor tremble when their duty
                            led to death.<pb n="225" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> O for that Christ again! He�He who would dare To tell
                            the Churches how they lie and cant, And talk of serving God�and serve themselves ; And talk
                            of saving souls�to save their "cause:" And pare and narrow God's divinest truth, Until a man
                            can hardly be a man And member of a Church. ***** Already Christ is coming. Hear ye not The
                            footfalls of the Lord? He tramples down The cruel hedges men have built about The gate that
                            leads to heaven. He rends the creeds, And give- their tatters to the merry winds. He does
                            not come as bigots prophesy, To choose a handful and to d ... the rest, To found a
                            Jewish-Gentile kingdom here, And roll the world into the past again. He comes the Spirit of

                            false in o.reed, And all that makes the boor and mars the man Shall pass away forever. Yes,
                            He cohies To give the world a passion for the truth; To inspire us with a holy human love :
                            To make us sure that, ere a man can be A saint, he first must be a man.</p></div2><div2 type="biography" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Testimony of Joseph Main. no. 2" TEIform="index"/>TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH MAIN. No. 2.</head><p TEIform="p">While in this state of mind, I heard reports about a singular and strange people, who taught
                            a new system of religion. The accounts given of them were various and very remarkable, and
                            seemed to excite much attention among all classes of people. What to make of them I could
                            not tell; but it appeared evident that there was something wonderful among them, or they
                            could not excite such general attention. I therefore determined to go and see for myself,
                            whether they were really good or bad people, and to act accordingly. V\rhen I came there, I
                            was still at a loss what to think of them. They were indeed a very singular people ; their
                            religion was new and strange to me. I disputed them some ; but to no purpose ; they were
                            able to comprehend and answer me. This confounded me still more. I concluded I had better
                            stop and wait till I could discover what they were. And being in a great labor and concern
                            of soul, I did not feel disposed to cavil about things which I could not understand. I
                            tarried several days, and was in a serious aud conscientious labor ; for I felt my soul at
                            stake. All the spiritual sensations of my former experience had left me, and all my past
                            hopes of salvation had failed. And though I had made a public profession of the religion of
                            Jesus Christ; yet I was blinded with antichristian doctrines, corrupted by their practices,
                            and deeply lost in sin ; like thousands of others in this day, who know not the pure gospel
                            of salvation, nor the power of eternal life; and I was, convinced that if I could not find
                            relief, I must sink into despair. As I was passing through a room where Mother Ann was, 1
                            saw her sitting in a chair, and singing very melodiously, with her hands in motion ; and her
                            whole soul atid body seemed to be in exercise. I felt, as it were, a stream of divine power
                            and love flow into my soul, and was convinced, at once, that it came from Heaven, the source
                            and fountain of all good. I immediately acknowledged my faith, and went and confessed my
                            sins, honestly and conscientiously. I could then say with the apostle, Sin appeared
                            exceeding sinful, even beyond expression. Indeed it felt so loathsome and hateful to me,
                            that I<pb n="226" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> resolved at once never to commit another ski. After this I went
                            and righted all my wrongs, aud set out, once for all, with a determination to live a
                            righteous life, according to the counsel of God through these strange people, whom I verily
                            found to be his true witnesses. In so doing, I have ever found protection; yea, in obedience
                            to the counsel of God, through Mother Ann Lee, and the Elders with her, my soul has been
                            saved from sin. This answers the very purpose for which Christ came into the world ; tht.t
                            is, "to save his peoplo from their sins." I then received the gifts of God in very deed ;
                            aud they became an abiding treasure in my soul. J was greatly blessed of God, and received
                            the gifts of vision, prophecy aud revelation, and also the gift of healing. These gifts are
                            sufficient to confirm the Believer that this is the second appearing of Christ. But the
                            greatest gift of all is, salvation from sin. I thank God that I am able, from personal
                            knowledge and acquaintance, to bear witness of the purity of the lives and characters of
                            Mother Ann aud the Elders. I have been with them frequently, in various places, at all times
                            aud seasons, aud well knew the manner of life they lived ; and can testify before all men,
                            that I never saw any thing in them, which gave me the least cause of jealousy that they
                            indulged themselves in anything contrary to the strictest principles of morality, purity and
                            holiness. On the contrary, they always bore a powerful testimony against every evil, in word
                            aud Jeed. Their faithful labors were constantly employed in purging out sin and all manner
                            of impurity from among the people, aud in ministering the gifts of God, and teaching purity
                            and holiness wherever they went. The unfaithful were reproved aud admonished with the most
                            heartsearching power; while the faithful were encouraged and filled with heavenly comfort
                            and consolation. Their testimony was so plain and pointed against the corrupt nature of man,
                            that many who were determined not to take up their crosses, became the violent and bitter
                            opposers of this testimony ; aud therefore levelled all the arrows of their spite and malice
                            against the Mother of our redemption, unto whom was committed the oracles of God for the
                            salvation of a lost world ; and from whom I have received the gifts of God, and the baptism
                            of the Holy Spirit, as really as ever the apostles did at the day ot Pentecost. From that
                            same blessed Spirit in Mother Ann aud her successors in the gospel, my soul has often been
                            filled with heavenly blessings, even to overflowing. Thus have 1 ihank of I he waters of
                            life, aud been fed and nourished with the bread of life, for more than forty-six years. 1
                            hese things are not the dreams of iinagiuatiou, but substantial realities, which are well
                            known to every faithful Believer, who truly follows Christ in the regeneration, ltwho walks
                            not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." And all such cau bear testimony to these things,
                            according to the measure of their travail and experience in the work of the regeneration.
                            But, however different the gifts and manifestations of Di\ iue power to diffei ent
                            individuals, yet the Spirit is one and the same in all; as saith the apostle :� 1'There are
                            diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit." 1 Cor. xii., 4. Every<pb n="227" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> true
                            Believer is led and governed by the same Spirit, which is the Spirit of Christ; and thus we
                            become one with Christ, as he is one with the Father. As the blood, which is the life of the
                            body, circulates through every member of the body ; so the Spirit of Christ, which in
                            Scripture is sometimes called the blood of Christ, circulates through every member oi' the
                            bodj of Christ, and is the life of his body, which is the Church. Every true and faithful
                            Believer is a member of that body, and receives strength and nourishment from it. These
                            things being well known to us by living experience, and having been confirmed beyond the
                            smallest shadow of a doubt, through a period of many years, we feel ourselves fully
                            qualified to bear testimony thereof to our fellow creatures ; and therefore they need not
                            think it strange that we are able to do it with so much boldness and confidence : for the
                            evidence of experience is the strongest proof that can be given of the truth of any
                            principle whatever. New Lebanon, 1826.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Male and female principles in deity" TEIform="index"/>THE MALE AND FEMALE PRINCIPLES IN
                            DEITY.</head><p TEIform="p">The writer in the Methodist Recorder, who criticises Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith for saying
                            "Our Mother God," does not show himself to be better acquainted with the ancient language
                            than Mrs. Smith doej. If he had more information he would know that different words applied
                            to the Deity signified different things in Him. When God is regarded as having more
                            power�not brute power, but spiritual power�one word is applied to Him. Then the idea
                            conveyed his regard to Truth. And this is the masculine, element in the Deity. And Truth is
                            the masculine attribute in God, or Truth is God Himself in the old Testament. But when
                            another attribute in Him is considered, then, in the original language, another name is
                            applied to Him. The additional element or attribute regarded, giviug another appellation, is
                            Love. This is the female principle in the Divine Being. These two elements in the Divine
                            Being constitute the Jehovah of the New Testament, and the Lord Jesus Christ of the New
                            Testament. Or God in the New Testament is Love, while Jesus is truth. In the text, God is
                            Love. '0 TIipos agapa esti,' love is in the feminine gender, though Theos is masculine. In
                            the Old Testament, where the Deity imparts the two qualities of truth and love to the race,
                            as the race is composed of the male and the female, the result is called "man," not a man,
                            but mau. God created man in his own image, in the image of Gou created He him ; male and
                            female created he them. Then "male and female" constitute "�man" There is a male man and a
                            female man, both created of God in his image. In the original, the race name of Adam is
                            given to the male and female, which constitutes the race. Ish is the name for a man, Isha is
                            the name for a woman, but Adam is the name of the race, constituted of male and female. Thus
                            is the race female created�not the woman that was formed of the ribs of Adam. This woman was
                            the one that deceived Adam. She was formed of Adam's rib, not created in the image of God.
                            She was a form of Adam's<pb n="228" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> rib, or she was the self-hood of Adam, the
                            selfishness and the self-conceit of Adam, or the race, under the seductive influence of the
                            serpent�Nature, the self-hood that is in love with the things of the senses. This is the man
                            that tyrannizes over the woman�is the sinner that sternly and stubbornly refuses to her the
                            simple justice that is her axiomatic and inalienable right�the right to say how she shall be
                            hung, if die she must, at the bidding of her tyrant. The full argument to sustain this view
                            cannot be given here, but it stands on an impregnable basis of the clearest criticism, a
                            criticism based in the highest reason and in the nature of things. God is called Elohim all
                            through the first chapter of Genesis, because the Truth is represented as acting. But in the
                            second chapter, where the Deity is represented as acting by Truth united to Love, He is
                            called Jehovah, or Lord God. Here Love, the female element is considered in relation to
                            truth. The higher element is added to the lower one, when Elohim becomes Jehovah. The male
                            element comes first and makes preparation ; and then the female element, the higher one,
                            comes last or second. Love is first in excellence, but truth is first in action. God is
                            love. Jesus is truth. Jesus was begotten of God, born of a woman, and made externally one
                            with the Father by Glorification. God is love. Jesus is truth. The Holy Spirit is a
                            proceediug from God, dwelling in Jesus ; and it was not given till after Jesus was
                            glorified. The Holy Spirit is not he, as the writer in The Methodist Recorder, erroneously
                            affirms. The Greek word for Spirit is in the neuter gender, while Holy is an adjective. The
                            Holy Spirit is not a person, but is the Divine Proceeding, emanating from God as love and
                            J-esus as truth, the feminine and the masculine principles which constitute Deity, making
                            Him the Divine Man. The love-element in God is second in activity but first in excellence;
                            but woman, who represents the love-element is neither as such, superior or inferior to man
                            as such. Each is the equal of the other by virtue of the sexconstitution. Woman, as such,
                            acts from love and truth ; and man, as such, acts from truth and love ; while the two things
                            are so adjusted as to make male and female exact equals us images of God. As equals, in a
                            state of society which is Christiau, equal rights, justice, equity and privileges will be
                            awarded to both sexes. Less than this is uot Christian, is not justice, is contrary to
                            natural rights and to the equity that is called conscience. If there are differences in the
                            sexconstitutions, in a truly Christian state of society, the tastes of the individuals will
                            guide in selection of callings and iMiiployments. That woman may fail to attain her own
                            ideal bv having the elective franchise, the writer, one of the masculine gender, has not a
                            single doubt. But by having it, she may succeed in removing from the statute books some laws
                            too cruel and infamous to be justly characterized in the use of language. Give her, her
                            axiomatic rights, and let her use the rights for the good of her sex and for the elevation
                            of the race as she deems best. For a thousand years man has played the tyrant, leaving the
                            race the victims largely of the lusts, passions and ambi-<pb n="229" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> tions to the
                            vast detriment of our kind. Now give woman the opportunity of mere naked justice, and let
                            her have a word to say where man has signally failed. Cease to withhold in the grasp of the
                            tyrant, her clearest rights and let time afford results. No man of thought and heart can or
                            will fear consequences. �J. M. Washburn, Terrell, Texas.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><index level1="Washburn, J. M."

                                    and that more strength is coming ; for unto him that hath shall be given. But "a
                                    little strength" does not remain inactive. Wherever there is a little strength there
                                    is obedience�''�And hast kept My word." It is vain to talk of being endued with
                                    power from on High, if that power does not lead to obedience to the Word. There must
                                    be "fruits meet for repentance;" and one fruit of "a little strength" is this : that
                                    God's Word will be kept. True enlargement of heart is ever followed by obedience. "I
                                    will run in the way of Thy commandments, whea thou shalt enlarge my heart." Psa.
                                    cxix., 32. Neither does "a little strength" remain silent. It testifies: and its
                                    testimony has to do with a Name�the Name that is above every name�"Ami hast not
                                    denied My Name." Wrhere there is "a little strength," reproach will be suffered for
                                    the Name. It will be confessed and honored accorded the chiefest place, even in the
                                    midst. Unto that name shall the gathering of the people be. Where there is "a little
                                    strength," and the Word kept, and the Name confessed, the fragrance of that Name
                                    will go forth like spices on the breezes. Amen; so be it, Lord. Though but a "little
                                    flock" with only a '�''little strength,"1 we would seek, during the "little while."1

                                The History of the Church at Mt. Lebanon...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">The History of the Church at Mt. Lebanon, which has appeared in several numbers of the
                                Manifesto, brings forward some very important points, well worthy of a careful and
                                studied inspection. It was a new, religious work, the outgrowth of a deep, spiritual
                                interest for the prosperity and .happiness of humanity. The first Elders, or witnesses,
                                who came to us with the word of God, had been the favored recipients of that inspiration
                                which led them into prayer, and into that form of gospel life which is so fully set
                                forth in that inestimable sermon on the mount. It had been shown to them through their
                                religious experience that the lovingkindness of God was extended over the whole world,
                                and all who walked uprightly would be made partakers of his boundless love. It had also
                                been shown to them that the selfishness of man had become one of the strongest elements
                                of his being, and that in the development of this quality, evei^thing standing in the
                                way, must be sacrificed. Mine and thine seems to have been the watchword upon which all
                                business transactions were carried forward and the foundation upon which all worldly
                                interests were established. Thousands and thousands of years had faded away, while this
                                element, in the character of man had been in process of development. Its right to
                                command and to demand had been acknowledged throughout the whole world, and neither
                                civil nor ecclesiastical authority moved to place a barrier in the way, or to define any
                                limits to the acquisitions which were made. in God's good time, however, came the
                                spiritual messengers of his word. It was the kingdom of Christ. Jesus had already warned
                                the selfish, rich men that their accumulation of treasures would waste away by moth and
                                rust, and had given lessons for the living of a better life. Mother Ann Lee and the
                                Elders, in their love and zeal for God and humanity, through revelation and inspiration,
                                had revived the testimony which, had been thrown aside, so carelessly, and urged upon
                                their hearers the necessity of making a full consecration to God. It was a heroic work !
                                a wonder in the earth ! ! That any man or woman could rise so far above the selfishness
                                of their own hearts and give their lives to God, that others might live TEIEl-IMCS.<pb n="231" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> more happily upon the earth, was indeed, a great wonder. It was
                                the ;'strait gate," the "narrow way" and but few went in thereat. We need not look with
                                surprise upon the fearful journey which these Elders made, but rather with surprise as
                                we learn that they were able to maintain their Christian testimony in the midst of such
                                a fierce persecution. It was the privilege of the Elders to lay the foundation for a
                                more successful community than had ever been known, and their successors in the Ministry
                                carried the inspirational work on to a high state of perfection. This form of
                                consecration, this ignoring of every selfish claim and giving to God all that one
                                possesses, brought them into the Church of Christ and gave them an assurance, that in
                                this, God would be their God, and that they would be his sons and daughters. Father
                                Joseph Meachain, the leading spirit in the work of organizing the Community, followed
                                the inspirational teachings of the Elders, and successfully consummated their work. With
                                "one accord" the people gathered to the new home. They came out from the relations of
                                the world, sold their possessions, dedicated their souls to God, and gave all that they
                                possessed to the gospel work. No higher incentive could inspire the minds of men. In
                                this they were laying down their lives for their friends, and yet, the foundation
                                remains sure. Those of the present day who build miist stand on the same foundation and
                                build with materials equally as pure in the sight of God, and in the same spirit of
                                consecration, if they think to acquire a corresponding success in this world. An
                                amalgamation of the two orders can never work satisfactorily. "No man can serve two
                                masters." The old inheritance with its mutual associations, the customs and practices of
                                the children of this world, cannot otherwise than result in a failure, to an individual,
                                to a family or to a community. Indeed, it Avould seem that the admonitions which have
                                been given in a past age might be, even at the present time, sufficiently vital to
                                protect any church from failing into those conditions which will ultimately result in
                                its entire failure. Father Joseph and his faithful, zealous co-laborers entered the
                                gospel work with an assurance that they could and would endure to the end, and be among
                                those living witnesses who would see the salvation of their souls. They were crucified
                                to the world, as was the apostle, and they were assured as positively, as they were
                                assured of the existence of God that the gates of hell could never prevail against that
                                work which had its foundation in the spirit of truth, nor against those who put on the
                                whole armor of God and kept the faith. To the present generation is committed this
                                sacred trust, and it should be made a savor of life unto life. God's blessing cannot
                                otherwise than attend those who "put their hands at work and give their hearts to God."
                                The promise can never fail. It is to be a hundred fold of houses and lands and gospel
                                kindred in this world, and in that which is to come, eternal life.<pb n="232" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/>

                                Theological notions are of far less value than religion or practical righteousness, and
                                in order to be saved from the sins of the world, one must live a life consecrated to God
                                and to his people. Through the kindness of a friend we are able to distribute several

No. 2.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Gerhard, Frederick" TEIform="persName"/>Fred'k. Gerhard.</byline><p TEIform="p">Now let us hear what a murderer said, at the last moment before his execution, about the
                            death-penalty. A physician�consequently an educated man�had murdered, some time before, a
                            girl whom he had pre~ iously seduced, and he was condemned to death in Cleveland. Standing
                            under the gallows, he addressed those present, saying, among other things, the following: "I
                            will concede, gentlemen, that life is a precious gift, and that it must be protected; and
                            that, if anybody murders, human nature's natural ininstinct demands his life. Consequently,
                            if the people of Bedford had killed me at the time I committed the deed, I would have said
                            it was not inhuman, and was done in passion; but if, after six months of deliberation and
                            preparation, people demand my life, then they are murderers. "What would be the most
                            advantageous for you, gentlemen�to put this rope around my neck, or to send me to the
                            penitentiary, to keep me there as many years as you may deem prrper; to dismiss me then as a
                            penitent, so that I might use for the benefit of my fellow-men what little of talent and
                            power the Creator has given me? "Capital punishment is annihilating. One life is as good as
                            another. I admit that; but what advantage will my death bring about? None. I do not even
                            remember the moment when, in madness and drunkenness, I found a mark for the pistol. Still,
                            such is law. This law, however, is made by man, and is not the law of God. "I do not enter
                            into the land of annihilation, but into the land of progress, and whilst I acknowledge the
                            law of Ohio, I say that it is foolish and vain Or do you think that, because this rope puts
                            an end to my life, crimes will be prevented? The same influences which surrounded me will
                            cause the same effects in others, and no example can prevent this. I submit to the law of
                            the land, and leave you. I hope that this execution will be an example for everybody, not in
                            favor of capital punishment, but to demonstrate its folly, and that you may reflect on
                            this." The way in which this man has reasoned out his rejection of the rightfulness of the
                            death-penalty well merits attention. It indicates the sole moral purpose of any punishment,
                            namely, the reformation of him who has committed a crime. Or can it be doubted that even the
                            worst criminal may arrive at intelligent remorse and honest re pentance? And when he thus
                            repents, honestly and truly, is he not then a reformed man? And if such reformation is
                            possible, have we then the right to deprive him, who has sinned, who has committed a crime,
                            of life, and to cut him off from repentance and reformation? Ample experience in
                            penitentiaries furnishes the proof that it is not necessary to destroy the criminal; that,
                            on the contrary, he may, by judicious treatment, be reformed, be led to true repentance, and
                            his guilt be thus properly expiated: God does not want the death of the sinner, but that he
                            repent and reform. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, there is more joy in heaven over one
                            sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance."�St.
                            Luke xv., 7. The intimidation theory, the idea of kill-<pb n="233" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> ing the one in
                            order to strengthen thereby the virtue of others, is an absurd perversion of all moral
                            thought. Of all the means for exercising good moral influence on society, this one of
                            shedding human blood, or of killing in any way a human being1, is probably the most
                            mistaken, the most dreadful and revolting. The most efficient protection of life is its
                            sacredness; and this sentiment is weakened by every execution. The great Roman philosopher,
                            Cicero, expressed himself as follows on capital punishment: "Far be the death-penalty from
                            us, far its executors and implements; for every mention of it is painful to a free man." And
                            in the criminal work, "The New Pittaval," Vol. 27, we find the following passage : "When the
                            champions of capital-punishment enter the lists for it armed with one well known quotation
                            from the Bible�"He who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall Ms blood be shed"�it is just as if
                            something were decided as of right, on the strength of one passage in a code, though it were
                            an insult to the sense of justice of a whole nation," But if it should be thought necessary
                            to secure, besides the only moral end of any punishment, some deterring effect in the case
                            of those crimes called deserving of death, this will be reached in the surest way by prompt
                            adjudication. Do not procrastinate proceedings for murder for months and years, but have
                            punishment follow as speedily as possible. Yet do not condemn to death, but to imprisonment
                            for twenty years, or for life. That will have a really deterring effect, and will bring to
                            their senses people of violent nature predisposed to crime. But can confinement for life be
                            justified even in the case of murder? The law allows for every misdeed or crime a time of
                            limitation, after the expiration of which the culprit can no longer be held responsible. In
                            almost all countries this limitation is fixed at twenty years for murder; and if a person
                            who has committed murder cannot leg lly be punished after the lapse of twenty years, ought
                            not, then, the maximum penalty fur murder to be twenty years? Had the culprit succeeded in
                            escaping judicial prosecution for twenty years, he would then be entirely free, and could
                            not be touched. Would it not be fair, then, when he has not evaded punishment, but has borne
                            the penalty during twenty years, to restore his liberty to him just as much as if he had not
                            been punished at all ? A further argument against the death-penalty is furnished by the many
                            judicial murders, the many condemnations of innocent people, which criminal "history
                            reports. It is bad enough if innocent people are condemned to imprisonment, their innocence
                            established only after the lapse of months or years, and are then restored to liberty. But
                            how�and that, too, has occurred often,�if an innocent person is condemned to death,
                            executed, and his innocence found out only afterward? Life on'je taken cannot be restored.
                            Frederick the VHse says : "Nothing is easier than to take human life." But is it right? Can
                            we restore it to him, should he be innocent; and would we not be criminals toward him in
                            that case? And when experience teaches that in all countries sentences of civil and criminal
                            courts are every day set aside, as unjust by higher courts, and when this is clear proof of
                            the human weakness of judges, who, nevertheless, are undoubtedly honest as a rule�cultivated
                            men, well-versed in law, who certainly have no intention of doing wrong�and when one sees
                            how the decisions differ, dare one, under these circumstances, expose a human life, be it
                            that of the vilest criminal even, to the vacillations of human opinion? But whoever does not
                            believe that many really innocent people are executed, need only look into the transactions
                            of the English Society for the abolition of capital punishment, by which it is demonstrated
                            that in two hundred years, about two hundred innocent people have been butchered. And this
                            by no means includes the many hundreds who�as previously shown�were hanged in England in
                            former years for theft and other minor crimes. I myself am in possession of a list of more
                            than sixty cases, where people were sentenced to several punishments, innocently, and this
                            list I have collected in only a few years. Another argument against the deathpenalty is the
                            repugnance of many jurors to giving a verdict of "guilty" against a murderer, because they
                            know that the sentence<pb n="234" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> entailed thereby will be that of death, and
                            their human feeling refuses to deliver a fellow-being up to death. Kather than do this, they
                            give a verdict of "not guilty," and in this way, criminals deserving punishment often
                            escape, to the great, injury of society. It was said before that in modern times all
                            torturing of convicts has been abolished by law; but has this been done, so far as custom is
                            concerned? How often has it occurred in places where decapitation is still effected by the
                            axj, that the siroke missed, the instrument burying itself in the shoulder instead so that
                            the unfortunate creature had to be executed under additional tortures! And how innumerable
                            are the instances in the United States, where hanging is still practiced, in which, owing to
                            the bungling of the hangman, the culprit had to go through the process of hanging iwo or
                            three times before being allowed to give up his miserable life! In McKean Co., Pa., in 1879,
                            a murderer had in this way to undergo the operation twice ; at Sioux Falls, Dakota, in 1882
                            another one three times, and a third one, a boy of eighteen years, in Georgia, in 1883,
                            twice; and between the two operations an hour expired before he was dead. Are not such cases
                            alone sufficient to give every person of feeling a perfect horror of capital punishment? But
                            executions have still another dark side; it consists in the blasphemy of the priests. They
                            represent to the condemned that they will enter now directly into heaven, and be received by
                            Christ; there stands the culprit, instead of being deeply humiliated by the sense of his
                            criminality, actually jubilant, and rejoicing that he will soon be with Christ, and that
                            Christ will receive him with all glory ! Is not that rank blasphemy? The priests who seduce
                            these miserable sinners to such fantastic visions, ought, instead, to exert all their
                            influence to induce them to really repent of their bloody deeds. Such a conversion, at the
                            moment of going to the gallows, is utterly worthless, and nothing but a self-deceit and a
                            deception of others. True, serious, profound and saving repentance can be arrived at only
                            gradually, and will never show itself in jubilant outpourings under the gallows. And to what
                            scandalous, outrageous, immoral behavior on the part of the public does not a condemnation
                            to death lead ! The condemned receives from all sides proofs of sympathy, women and girls
                            present flowers and delicacies; and people importune those in charge to allow them to see
                            the condemned or to exchange a few words with him. It is a glorification of crime. Many an
                            honest, poor fellow, on the other hand, is allowed to die in his lonely chamber; for him no
                            sympathy is felt, and nobody sends him dainties. However much it may be in accordance with
                            the spirit of modern times not to bury the body of the culprit any longer, as formerly, in
                            the spot receiving the offal of the shambles, but in the cemetery, where so many sinners are
                            lying�even such as have not been condemned judiciously�it is, nevertheless, very unwise, on
                            the other hand, to give executed criminals public and pompous interment and obsequies, as is
                            often the case, particularly in the United States. This, too, is a glorification of crime
                            and must make an impression on the lower classes�those from which criminals mostly come�not
                            conducive of good morals. The fact that in 1878, the executioner of Berlin gave a grand
                            dinner, accompanied by music on the day of the execution of Hoedel, who had fired on the
                            Emperor; and the other fact, that twelve hundred�actually twelve hundred�people applied for
                            the position of hangman of London, which had become vacant by the death of Marwood�these
                            facts, I say, ought to fill our century with burning shame. When will the old barbarism,
                            belonging to the dark past, be finally cleared away, and capital punishment be abolished
                            everywhere? When will the Legislatures of all the states of the Union, and of all foreign
                            countries at last consider it their sacred duty not to tolerate the death-penalty any
                            longer? When will citizens, called for jury duty, refuse to serve in murder cases so long as
                            the murderous law of capital punishment exists ? When will judges insist earnestly on the
                            abrogation of the murderous law, which surely has often caused them bitter qualms of
                            conscience? When, finally, will rulers recoil<pb n="235" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> with horror from lending
                            their assistance to an execution, refuse to commit themselves, and aid directly in
                            premeditated murder? Or is an execution, perchance, not a real, premeditated murder, murder
                            in the first degree? According to the laws of all civil ized countries, every premeditated
                            and intentional killing of a human being is murder in the first degree. Well, then, are not
                            premeditation and intention to the greatest possible extent the preliminaries of every
                            execution? Even in those times when capital punishment was still considered as something
                            indispensable, the executioner, the hangman, was considered dishonorable, and no decent,
                            reputable man would shake hands with him, or would drink with him, or enter into any
                            connection with him. And this shrinking from him sprang from the truly human feeling of
                            horror at a man who could be bought with money to slay his fellow-men. And should we,
                            perhaps, try to palliate executions by saying that the law of the state exacts them? There
                            is a higher law than all Statelaws, and that is the law of common human morality, which we
                            find laid down in the precepts of the most diverging confessions. Already ihe old Mosaic
                            law, known as the Decalogue contains the commandment: "Thou shalt not kill:" and the same
                            injunction we find in the Koran, as well as in the law-books of the Hindoos and of other
                            creeds. Bad State-Laws must be annulled.� Civilization has put an end to former still more
                            horrible modes of capital punishment, such as breaking on the wheel, impalement, quartering,
                            burning at the stake, &amp;c, and has simplified executions ; but the nineteentli
                            century, which has already given birth to so much progress, ought not to come to an end
                            without having abolished also this last horrible remnant of capital punishment, and without
                            having expunged it from the law-books of the civilized world. Away, then, with this relic of
                            a long-passed dark age. this mockery of the civilization of our century, this blot on our
                            generation! Every one who has human feelings in his breast, every one who still recognizes
                            even in the criminal the human being, the unfortunate, erring fellowbrother, ought to lift
                            up his voice, to assist in attaining this noble, this truly human end. I repeat, the
                            foremost and only moral end of any punishment is the reformation of the criminal; and for
                            this high purpose capital punishment does not only not answer, but has even the
                            diametrically opposite effect; for the so-called conversions which the priest forces upon
                            the condemned in the last hours or moments, in plain view of the gallows and in the face of
                            death, are no real reformations, but mere outward forms, by whic h the priest thinks to
                            fulfill his duty. Reformation requires time and calm reflection uninterrupted by external
                            influences. He who is once slain can neither reflect nor reform any more. It cannot be
                            predicted or asserted of any criminal, not even of the worst, that he is incapable of
                            reformation. Even the worst criminal may repent�repent profoundly; and he will and must
                            repent, if he be only given time for mature reflection, and subjected to impressions, whose
                            influence is in that direction. Repentance brings forth reformation, and to make the latter
                            possible, the criminal's life lias to be preserved Confine him for many yea"s ; but do not
                            take his life, do not cut him off from the possibility i f repentance and reformation, from
                            the recovery of his better self. We have no right to do that! I have above referred to the
                            fact, that the opponents as well as the advocates of capital punishment can base their
                            arguments on the Bible; and further I have referred to two texts, which have also reference
                            to the deathptenalty, and declare against it. But I must repeatedly call the attention of
                            those, who l�ok to the Bible as the only fundamental law for all actions of man, to the
                            beautiful teaching, which we find in Ezekiel xxxiii., 11: "I have no pleasure in the death
                            of the �&gt;icked, but that the wicked turn from bis way and live.'' I have no doubt, that even
                            those, who until now have been advocates of the deathpenalty, if they consider well all the
                            arguments fur its abolition, laid down in these lines, cannot but become opponents to it. I
                            repeat, our nineteenth century, which has put an end to the inhumanity and brutality of
                            slavery, should not go to rest without also abolishing the inhumanity and useless barbarism
                            of the death-penalty. Let us work for this noble end !<pb n="236" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/></p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mt.

                                not, in my remembrance, had such a season as the past. For eight consecutive days we
                                could do nothing in the hay field, and in July we had rain for fifteen days. Not a
                                single Sabbath have we staid at home from public meeting on account of rain. [Good !
                                such a record as that is worthy a place in the Manifesto. Attend the public Service, and
                                if it rains, dress accordingly. Ed.] Now, if we take fifteen rainy days and four
                                Sabbaths out of a month, we have only twelve days left. This makes the farmers look
                                rather blue. To see much of the labor of the season, with the fertilizers and manures
                                that were spent on the potato crop,� so great a loss, to say the least, is quite
                                discouraging. Some of our sheep have been destroyed by the dogs, and all in all it makes
                                a mournful story. In the near future all this sadness may be turned to sunshine, and our
                                notes to joy. D O. Aug. 27. Sister Amelia has a night blooming Cereus, and at 9-30 P M.,
                                she cut off a flower that was nine inches in diameter. By placing it on the ice, it kept
                                fresh all the next day and could be placed on the table at meal time. The plant has
                                produced three flowers this season. On Sabbath August 18th. Elder Calvin G. Reed and

                                this world. Rich and poor, alike, may drink the living waters, and herein lies the
                                difference between the bounteous love of God and the partial selfishness of man. Does

                                is converted into a fashionable resort, where those may gather who are able to pay for
                                the privilege of drinking its medicinal waters. Thus, the blessings that should be free
                                to all, are reserved for the few. How different the waters to which the inspired prophet
                                so generously invites us! What a welcome sound to every spiritually thirsty soul, a::d
                                how passing strange that so few find their way to the fountain? Why is it? Ah, there is
                                a price to pay, n"t of money, not of earthly treasures, but of something far dearer to
                                the natural heart, the sacrifice of the carnal life. The same price for all. Yet how
                                mean the price in comparison with the treasure gained. What sublimity in the words of
                                Jesus to the woman at the well of Jacob. "Whosoever shall drink of this water shall
                                thirst again : but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never
                                thirst: but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up
                                into everlasting life." John, iv., 13, 14. Then if we thirst for these waters will they
                                not be given us? For we have the promise, "Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye

THE MANIFESTO.
ALDEN'S MANIFOLD CYCLOPEDIA.
Careful examination shows that in many
respects this remarkable work is superior to
any of its competitors, especially in its
adaptation to popular use; its combination
of an unabridged diction try with the ordinary features of a cyclopedia of universal
knowledge is unique. The definitions and
pronunciation of the words are clear and accurate, the illustrations are excellent, the
topics are thoroughly treated and embrace
the results of the most recent investigation*
and discoveries. Then, too, the extremely
low price places it within the reach of all.
The eighteenth volume is fully up to the
high-water mark of its predecessors. It is
especially rich in its biographies. We find
sketches of Hall and Haves, the Arctic explorers ; John Hall and Robert Hall, celebrated clergymen; Hallam and Herodotus,
great historians; Haller, the philologist;
Alexander Hamilton, the statesman, and Sir
William Hamilton, the scientist; Handel
and Hadyn, the musical composers; Hannibal, the foe of Rome; Hegel, the philosopher; Heine, the poet, Hengstenberg, the
theologian; Herschel, the astronomer, and
many other men of renown. Among important articles in other lines are Hallucination ;
Hand; Hanseatic League, the famous trade
union of the Middle Ages; Harbor: Hartford Convention, unique and famous in our
political history; Harvard University; Hav;
Hayti; Heat; Heart; Heaven; Hell; Heredity; Heresy; and Hieroglyphics. The
forty volumes in which this great work will
be completed will make a splendid library.
The price, which must advance as the work
nears completion, is wonderfully low. If
received before Oct. 15, 1889, $17.90, will
pay for a full set in cloth binding, or $25.90
for the half morocco style. A specimen
volume which can be returned if not satisfactory, will be sent for 60 cents in cloth, or
85 cents in half morocco. John B. Aldkn,
