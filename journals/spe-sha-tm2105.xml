A CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
Some six months ago we began the publication of our reprint of the famous Encyclopaedia Britannica in 25 Volumes, which
we issued at $1.50 per volume. The price
of the English edition always has been
and still is $8.00 per volume, and the
Scribner edition $5.00 per volume in the
cheapest binding.
That the public appreciate so great a
bargain is shown by the fact that over
half a million volumes of this reprint have
been sold in less than six months.
This elegant new edition we still offer
at the same price, $1.50 per volume. This
is the greatest bargain ever known in books.
Better still, we will deliver the set complete on small easy payments, to suit the
convenience of customers.
Eemember this is not an abridgement,
but the great Edinburgh ninth edition,
reproduced page for page, with important articles on American subjects rewritten to date by eminent American authors,
and new maps, later and better than in
any other edition.
Special Offer.�We claim that our reprint compares favorably with the high
priced editions in every respect, and in
respect to maps, and strength and beauty
of bindings is superior to them.    In order
that this claim may be tested by a person
al inspection we make the following proposition: We will furnish volume I. at
60 cts.�a fraction of actual cost;�if sent
by express. Add 40 cts. postage if wanted
by mail. Amount paid for Volume I. will
be credited on price of set when ordered.

Any Article that has outlived 22 years of competition
and imitation, and sells more
and more each year, must
have merit. Dobbins' Electric Soap, first made  in  1869,
is JUST THAT ARTICLE.      Those
who use it each week, and
their name is legion, save
clothes and strength, and let
soap do the work. All that
we can say as to its merits,
pales into nothingness, before
the story it will tell, itself, of
its own perfect purity and
quality, if you will give it one
trial. Ask your grocer for it.
He has it, or will get t. Try
it next Monday.
There are many imitation
-N . -t>. Electric Soaps in which electricity plays no part. Dobbins' is
the original one, all Magnetics, Electrics,
and Electro-Magics ara fraudulent imitations. Ask for Dobbins' Eiectric, see that
our name is on every wrapper, and if any
other is sent you by your grocer, when you
order ours,�send it back to him.

Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 5. ./Eneas M' Callister, in
                            a letter dated May, 1802, speaking of the work in North Carolina, observes, "The like
                            wonders have not been seen, except in the Kentucky Revival last summer, since the days of
                            the Apostles. I suppose the exercises of our congregation last winter, surpassed any thing
                            ever seen or heard. I think it sometimes would have been well, if they had been kept and
                            never told."* ****** It is certain, the natural man rereceiveth not the things of the spirit
                            of God, for they are foolishness to him; hence, Christ instructed his disciples not to cast
                            pearls before swine; for the same cause, so little has been published abroad concerning the
                            deep things of G-od, made manifest among the people called New-Lights : and for the same
                            reason, these things can be but slightly touched at present. That the power was supernatural
                            by which such multitudes were struck down, required no arguments to prove ; and had they
                            never risen again, there might have been some reason for charging it to the devil: but who
                            has power to kill and make alive again? could any one with the rationality of a man, suppose
                            that any thing short of the power of God, could suspend the functions of animal life for an
                            hour, a day, or a week, and again restore them with additional brightness ? Is nature able
                            to assume such apparent changes, as for tens and fifties, moved at the same time by the same
                            instinct, to forget the use of every limb, and fall prostrate no matter where, and yawn, and
                            gasp, and expire in a cold sweat ? This belongs not to nature, and as little does it belong
                            to nature to exempt her sons from wounds and bruises, broken limbs, and aching heads, in
                            case of such repeated and dangerous falls as were common among the NewLights. Least of all,
                            could nature extend to their resurrection, after an hour, a week, or a trance of nine days.
                            Who wants a miracle to arouse their faith, and fix it on the sacred truths recorded in the
                            Scriptures ? let him recognize the camp-meeting, let him find the man or woman, whose
                                immortal<pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. part for hours and days traversed the
                            regions of eternity, while the breathless body lay as a spectacle of terror to surrounding
                            friends. The learned expositor of Scripture, and the one whom he opprobriously terms an
                            Infidel, are equally baffled with the falling exercise : the one upon his Irypothesis, that
                            there never was such a thing as a miracle in the days of the Apostles; and the other, that
                            there never was to be any such thing after. All their experiments and researches were in
                            vain, to reduce this operation to some natural cause. Their feeling the pulse, changing the
                            situation of the person, applying smelling bottles, bathing with camphor or cold water, and
                            letting of blood, could never make half the discovery in the case that those made who came
                            with their barrels of whiskey to retail to the multitude. By such it was abundantly proved,
                            that the readiest way to keep clear of this extraordinary exercise, was to drown the soul in
                            debauchery and vice. Many circumstances, confounding to the wisdom of man, attended the
                            exercises mentioned, which for sake of brevity have to be omitted. However extraordinary
                            these things were, they were not considered by the people as the most evidential of a work
                            of the true spirit: something much greater was commonly expected to succeed their
                            resurrection, of greater importance than any thing that went before. The word of exhortation
                            is ranked among the apostolic gifts, and as such it was considered by the New-Lights. This
                            gift was generally expected on the occasion of rising from the before mentioned trance, and
                            such expectations were very commonly answered. The exhortations delivered on those occasions
                            by all ranks and colors, but especially by small children, were so evidential of a divine
                            power, so searching to the conscience, and so wounding to the sinner, that the most
                            obstinate unbelievers have fallen down, like those of old, and confessed that God was of a
                            truth in them. It required a spirit more incredulous than that which has commonly been
                            called infidelity, to deny a supernatural agency in the case of such pathetic and powerful
                            addresses from little children, not only unlearned, but also of the most bashful and
                            unpopular cast of mind. Such little ones, of eight or ten years of age raised upon the
                            shoulders or held up in the arms of some one, in the midst of vast multitudes, would speak
                            in a manner so marvelous and astonishing, that persons of the most rugged passions would
                            dissolve into tears. Professors of the foremost rank, confess that hitherto they had been
                            total strangers to that heavenly sense and feeling, which distinguished a child of God. So
                            deep were the effects of truth, delivered in the simple language of a child, of which the
                            following may serve as a short specimen. "O the sweetness of redeeming love ! O if sinners
                            knew the sweetness of redeeming love, they would all come to the overflowing fountain!" The
                            general gift of exhortation was to search out the state of the sinner, convict him of sin,
                            and warn him to fly from it. They often came so pointed, even to naming out the person and
                                pub98<pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> licly arraigning him for specific crimes, that evil spirits,
                            whose work is to cover iniquity, and conceal it, were stirred up to great fury. Those
                            possessed with them, would come forth in a great rage, threatening and blaspheming against
                            the author of the revival, and bold as G-oliath, challenge his armies to a rencounter. Could
                            nature, without bloodshed and slaughter, overcome beings so fierce? Or must it not be
                            something supernatural? To see a bold Kentuckian, undaunted by the horrors of war, turn pale
                            and tremble at the reproof of a weak woman, a little boy or a negro ; to see him sink down
                            in deep remorse, roll and toss, and gnash his teeth, till black in the face ; entreat the
                            prayers of those he came to devour, and through their fervent intercessions and kind
                            instructions, obtain deliverance, and return in the possession of the meek and gentle spirit
                            which he set out to oppose; who would say the change was not supernatural and miraculous ?
                            Such exorcisms, or casting out of evil spirits, are justly ranked among the wonders which
                            attended the NewLight. Nor could the man once delivered from the Legion, go home with
                            greater joy to tell his friends what great things Jesus had done for him, than many returned
                            from these encamping grounds, to announce to their former companions, their happy change. To
                            what has been said it may be objected, that many who were converted in this extraordinary
                            manner, gave no lasting evidence of a real change, but returned again to their former
                            courses ; and as they testified that they were all actuated by one spirit, if some were
                            mistaken, why not the whole? I answer, the work of God is one thing and the opinion formed
                            by the subject of it, another. If it should be granted that many, or even all, were mistaken
                            as to the immediate effect of the work, this would not alter the work from what it was. If a
                            foolish person should take grain when it was only in the blossom, and say it was ripe, and
                            commence reaping, binding and stacking it, this would not prove that the plowing and sowing
                            had not been well done by a good farmer. Spiritual life is of a growing nature, as well as
                            vegetable and animal life. If many, zealous to increase the number of their disciples, did
                            deceive the generality with a vain persuasion, that a short scene of conviction, light and
                            comfort, comprehended all that was contained in the new birth, and cut them off from any
                            further growth, this did not prove that their impressions had not a proper beginning, or
                            were not of the genuine kind. Obj. 2. If this great appearance of union and general
                            communion was of God, why did it not increase? Arts. Why did not that union and communion
                            increase which existed among the Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Herodians and
                            Syrophcenicians, who followed Christ into the wilderness and encamped there day and night ?
                            The reason is plain, the foundation of a lasting union could not be laid until the rubbish
                            was cleared out of the way, and as this was the first work then, so it was in the late
                            revival. Those who followed the true light were united in breaking down and burning<pb n="100" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> that which was old and decayed, and this had to be done before they
                            could unite in building up that which is sound and permanent. A union in the first case,
                            although it is productive of greater division, is both a shadow and a sure pledge of that
                            union which follows in consequence. Obj. 3. But what do you make of those who testified that
                            they had got all the rubbish destroyed, were carried above all sin, and temptation, and
                            pain, and never should suffer again, were higher than Elijah, perfectly blessed and filled
                            with the fulness of Grod. With all this so united in heart that they never could part, and
                            yet after all, turn to hate one another worse than ever, and live as loose and wicked as
                            others ? So that they could afterward say ;� "Ah! where am I now! When was it or how� That I
                            fell from my heaven of grace? I am stripped of my all�I am brought into thrall� I am
                            banished from Jesus' face." Do not such changes prove that their extraordinary light was all
                            a delusion ? Ans. If so, the same argument will prove that every dispensation of light, both
                            under the Law and Gospel was a delusion, for after the brightest manifestations there was
                            always a falling away. Did not the whole camp of Israel fall away after the giving of the
                            law upon mount Sinai? Did this prove that the light which they saw and all the signs and
                            wonders that preceded and accompanied it was delusion? David, Solomon, and all the Kings and
                            people of Israel fell away; and how often was this chosen generation brought under judgments
                            and banished into captivity, not to prove that their extraordinary light had been all
                            delusion, but the contrary. John the Baptist decreased and his followers came to nothing.
                            All that had followed Jesus for three years, forsook him and fell away in the hour of trial.
                            If this was not sufficient according to the above objection, to prove their light a
                            delusion, you may add the universal apostacy that prevailed through the long reign of
                            antichrist, in which there was none that did good and sinned not, no not one. (to be
                            continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Progress" TEIform="index"/> PROGRESS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Offord, Emily" TEIform="persName"/> Emily Offord.</byline><p TEIform="p">Ever since the old, old story was told and believed, of the perfect origin of Adam and his
                            tremendous fall, whereby the whole race was ever afterward to be cursed, the tendency has
                            been to look upon the past as superior in evei-y respect to the present. Every generation
                            sighs and wishes back the good old times that used to be ; as if the world and everything
                            pertaining thereto, was always on the downward road to destruction and misery ; which idea
                            seems wrong. It is the offspring of a false theology. The world moves onward and upward.
                            Humanity develops, progresses, improves. Knowledge spreads abroad, and wisdom and love
                            increase. Of this we have abundant proofs all around us. Progress, though gradual, is
                            certain ; ancient myths and superstitions no longer inthrall the minds of men as they have
                            done in times<pb n="101" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> past; honest doubting, patient investigation, and sound
                            reasoning unveil the truth, let in the light of God and obliterate them. In past ages the
                            world was largely controlled by fear. The fear of offending Deity and consequently being put
                            into inextinguishable fire ; hence, they readily accepted any means of escape proffered
                            them. The ignorant and superstitious of all classes and ages down to the present time, were
                            and are attracted to and excited by the marvelous and miraculous. These stir the emotional
                            part of man's nature, and in the childish state bear mightier sway than aught else. A child
                            reads stories and believes them merely because they are in the books ; but intelligent minds
                            seek to know the whys and wherefores and do as the prophet said, reason together; and this
                            candid reasoning and scientific research is evolving in the era of common sense ; the fear
                            of might giving place to love of right; and when people learn of, and acknowledge the
                            Heavenly Mother as well as the Heavenly Father, and woman finds her proper sphere and stands
                            co-equal with her brother, the wheels of progress wrill roll more rapidly, the reign of
                            peace be much nearer, and truth will indeed triumph gloriously over error. The world moves
                            forward truly, and no less in religion than in science, although many are bewailing the low
                            spiritual state of the sectarian churches ; all of which probably began with a measure of
                            the spirit of grace and truth, but becoming fixed and creed bound, they had no opportunity
                            for spiritual growth, and when an organization ceases to grow dissolution begins. The
                            churches endeavor to derive sustenance from old and time worn theology, and therefore
                            literally starve the people for the lack of a living inspiration and present revelation of
                            light and truth. Why should they not pass away and give place to something better? And what
                            is true of others is also true of this, the Shaker Church. Like causes produce like effects.
                            But one great blessing vouchsafed to Zion, is that her people are not creed bound ; our
                            gospel teaches endless progression. Light is ever beaming brighter, truth and wisdom
                            gradually unfolding to every sincere, earnest seeker within her borders. Every opportunity
                            is given for soul growth ; it only remains for each individual to labor and struggle, and if
                            necessary, to wrestle as did Jacob of old with the angels, to gain increasing righteousness
                            and maintain a living church. The gospel requires from time to time, greater sacrifices,
                            more cross, and greater self-denial, with increasing testimony against error, as proof of
                            advancement in the spiritual life. True religion is practical and logical ; it takes
                            cognizance of every act, spiritual, intellectual and physical; it teaches us to observe
                            physiological law as being the law of God ; that if these are disregarded, suffering and
                            disease will ensue as the just penalty ; that they are not imposed upon us by an offended
                            Deity, but are the consequence of violated law. Effect follows cause as sure as night
                            succeeds the day. It teaches us how, when<pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> and what to eat and drink,
                            and what and when to refrain from eating and drinking ; and in the ever unfolding of God's
                            spirit will call upon us to leave off from our tables some articles of diet which are now
                            deemed indispensable ; and it will require us to thoroughly masticate our food before
                            swallowing it, and thereby save us from dyspepsia and its concomitants. Good ventilation
                            will also be included ; thus our religion will save us from sickness which is much better
                            than doing wrong and getting sick, and then wanting to be cured in some miraculous,
                            incomprehensible way, and allowing us to go on sinning (or violating law.) It is
                            antichristian to try to be saved in our sins; the gospel saves from sin, and this is the
                            only salvation worth seeking. The increasing testimony will require the sacrifice of all
                            superfluities in dress, and no less the pernicious habit of tight lacing. All things will be
                            done to the honor and glory of God and the upbuilding of true and noble manhood and
                            womanhood. The selfish principle of me and mine will then be brought into much more
                            subjection so that no one will think of owning even a plant any more than they now do of
                            carrying a purse. Flowers, those beautiful emblems of virtue, so fitly called the "stars of
                            earth," will be ours to enjoy in abundance through consecration ; by cultivating them for
                            the sole purpose of beautifying our gospel homes, ornamenting and brightening the whole
                            household of faith, and not to foster personal selfishness. The church of Christ's second
                            appearing has always been and must ever be a progressive institution; thus it lives to-day ;
                            but if the testimony does not continue to sound forth with an increase, and its members
                            become inert, what will save it more than others from ruin ? Nothing short of a renewal of
                            the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and an ever present revelation of God's truth, and
                            strict obedience thereunto, will keep it alive, and promote its growth and glory ; but
                            herein its light may shine forth as a city set on a hill, its power be felt by honesthearted
                            souls hungering and thirsting for righteousness, and Zion's numbers be augmented and her
                            strength renewed. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            thou gloriest in, and callest by the several names of individuality, personality, identity
                            and ego, are only softer names for pure selfishness; separateness from God. Let me look
                            solemnly into this matter of At-one-ment, so boldly asserted by my Savior, Jesus Christ. If
                            Jesus and the Father were, and are one, then I and my Father ought also to be one. Because
                            Jesus prays that "they all may be one, (meaning his disciples) as Thou, Father, art in me,
                            and I in Thee; that they also may be one in us. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have
                            given them, that they may be one, even as we are one."�Jno. xvi., 21, 22. Verily, here is a
                            theme of mighty magnitude. When I have put off, ignored, and once for all, absolutely and
                            irrevocably abjured my little egotistic self, I am utterly stripped of all consolation from
                            a selfish source ; then it is that I am forced to calmly sink into the "divine inmost" of my
                            being, shunning all resources of outward comfort and selfish satisfaction or excitement.
                            Down in the indescribable recesses of my being, I reach a point where I am not apparently,
                            but actually, merged into the infinite possibilities of the Infinite God. Here, having laid
                            down my selfish life, I take it up into the infinite, eternal life of God. What is left of
                            me, has become "the Word, and the Word is with God and the Word is God ; the same which was
                            in the beginning with God." Here the plenitude of power and energy is mine to possess; not
                            at all for my own aggrandizement, gratification or glory, but for the good and assistance of
                            others for all time and all eternity. In that state I know the spirit is able to say, not
                            only to that sycamine tree, but to every disease of body or soul, ' 'Be thou plucked up and
                            cast into the<pb n="104" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> sea" of negations and they shall obey. The source of
                            Divine Love (God) is to be discovered in the deep, soundless silence of private meditation
                            and retirement from all outward objects, and utter, passive surrender of one's self to the
                            higher affinities of the Universal, the serene depths of the All-Good. But this discovery is
                            only the incipient step of the initial process to the possession of the same. After this
                            sublime discovery comes the solemn ordeal of preparation for its enjoyment. My own will,
                            which desires self-gratification, must be totally abandoned in all directions. My time,
                            instead of being devoted to selfpleasing and emolument, must be devoted to the promotion of
                            comfort and peace for others. My appetites and unworthy proclivities must all be left
                            behind, and labors and interests of benevolence toward others, foes as well as friends,
                            substituted in their place. My selfish interest in a salvation for myself and a few others,
                            must give place to, and be merged in the salvation of all souls in all worlds. When this is
                            accomplished, the everlasting assimilation to the Universal Good (God) will be found to have
                            taken place. No sorrow, no fear, no pain nor agony, physical, mental or spiritual, disturbs
                            the peace of that realm of Infinite Love. No impatience nor despair can disturb the calm
                            waters of existence forever. "When we see all that is carnal, All that men call good and
                            great Sacrificed for tilings eternal. Matters of a better state; If lie's not a good
                            Believer Who makes such a sacrifice, Then was Christ a grand deceiver, And the Scriptures,
                            pointed lies." Then the evil one shall come but shall find nothing in me whereof to create
                            torment or unrest. Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be within me, and I shall need to go no
                            more out to seek for a fugitive peace among the frivolities of Time, nor the rudimental
                            pleasures of sensuous things. Be assured that all this unspeakable glory is attainable in
                            this life ; even absolute immunity from sorrow, sickness or unrest; even eternal peace and
                            content.

                            Manifesto that the little band of Believers at Sonyea are still holding the fort and
                            enjoying the usual amount of the comforts and blessings of life. Glad to hear that brother
                            Clark is improving, hope he will soon be able to assume his wonted place. I was shocked to
                            read the account of<pb n="106" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> the lynching of the poor Italians at New Orleans
                            recently. Shall such a spirit of hatred and revenge be allowed to run riot, scattering death
                            and destruction everywhere? Public sentiment may possibly excuse the lynchers but if so the
                            fact will be a terrible condemnation to that sentiment. Expediency wrhen pleaded in
                            extenuation of such gross and heinous crimes becomes most absurd and ridiculous. Such
                            outbreaks are but the natural fruit and results of the selfish, lustful lives men choose to
                            live. It shows that beneath the smooth and fair exterior there is a force at work powerful
                            enough to disrupt all political and social bands and engulf our boasted civilization in the
                            chaos of despair. I tremble for our country. I am alarmed for the free institutions founded
                            by our fathers in equal rights and justice to all. New Orleans has succeeded a treaty of
                            Justice by a flagrant violation of our Constitution, the superior law of the land. This is
                            as the alarm of danger, only an index of the hidden and powerful forces which threaten the
                            present conditions. Will the alarm be heeded, will men open their eyes to the light of day,
                            will they see in the formation of society the very elements of disintegration and death ?
                            The cure is in their own hands. Eliminate selfishness, recognize the actual equality of the
                            rights of mej, assume a universal brotherhood, abolish individual property, accept common
                            property and the foundation is laid on the everlasting rock of righteousness, upon which may
                            be constructed, by the faithful observance of the laws of our being and the practical
                            enforcement of the Golden Rule, a structure which shall stand in beauty and pride, truly the
                            light of the world. Let us hope these repeated warnings may lead to the hoped for
                            consummation. I have no news of importance to communicate. My health is as usual, the
                            weather is warm but damp and showery. I hope you may all continue well and that the coming
                            season may be a profitable one in every way to you. Give my love to all not forgetting a

                            slow, And in our hearts we feel and know, Sweet rest is coming yet. Thus they are drifting
                            away, away, In vain may our mourning be; We see them glide out on the silent tide, And their

                            her brow, Bespeaking joys untold. She hath slipped away and we feel her loss How we loved

                            alms, let not thy right hand know what thy left hand doeth."� Bible. F. WORTHINGTON. There
                            are many people who give money to some charity simply as a shrewd policy to better their
                            business, or to gain public confidence, as the best means toward some selfish end, taking
                            care always that their so-called charity shall be advertised as widely as possible. This
                            fraudulent species of philanthropy is what Jesus sought to warn his followers against.
                            Because the possible realization of the worldly end sought, is all the reward such acts can
                            receive, either here or hereafter. "Verily I say unto you, they have their reward." But all
                            good deeds, words and actions springing from a desire to aid others or comfort them,
                            received the highest approbation of the Teacher. The giving of money is a great and powerful
                            means of doing good, but there are many wa}?s without the giving of money. There are no
                            souls so poor, but that they may become rich in good works for Christ and God.<pb n="108" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> Society is composed of an infinite variety of natural characters. Some are
                            rich, some are poor, thousands are paupers, thousands are helpless ; many are young and
                            strong, many are old and infirm. And there are many grades of intelligence ; all having some
                            useful quality in which they may excel if cultivated ; yet all are made of one flesh and
                            blood, and all controlled by the supreme laws of the Infinite. But spiritually all souls are
                            equal. The soul of the poor outcast is as valuable in God's eyes as that of the king. And
                            both may become of equal value to God and society for good ; providing the Holy Spirit moves
                            and tempers the action of each. In cases of great calamities, like a large fire or an
                            earthquake, how quickly the race and caste prejudices of human nature are forgotten and all
                            mingle together as one. The grave awaits alike high and low, strong and weak, black and
                            white. Now all these varieties'of human life can be equally valuable in .God's service in
                            their places and ways. Nature consists of infinite varieties unconsciously aiding each
                            other. The oak gives support to the ivy. The woodpecker extracts insects from the growing
                            trees, which otherwise might become numerous enough to destroy them. There is a strong
                            tendency with many, in our day of newspapers and telegraph and rapid transit, to think that
                            it is only now and then some very popular and highly gifted persons whom the world calls its
                            great men, that can do much for God or humanity. At a casual glance, it indeed looks that
                            wray. But if we consider more closely, we will see that these same great men have been
                            dependent on the efforts of thousands before them. What of the teachers who taught them? Of
                            the self-denying father and mother, and of others perhaps, of whom the world does not hear.
                            These great men are doing the work God intended for them if they are actuated by his spirit;
                            but not a more important one than thousands of the toiling, humble, unnoticed servants of
                            the Teacher, unknown to the world, but not unfelt. They will be known in eternity. The
                            flight of the eagle as it soars around the lone cliffs of the sea, or the rocky crests of
                            the mountain, is sublime, grand, majestic. But the sweet songsters that enliven our woods
                            and meadows in the spring and summer are remarkable neither for their size or gaudy plumage.
                            The widow who cast in her two mites has been preaching charity to millions for centuries.
                            Some of the greatest events of history for good or ill, have resulted from some apparently
                            trifling occurrence. From the ranks of the humble and the fire of affliction have sprung
                            some of the strongest Christian characters. Occasionally a brand is plucked from the depths
                            of infamy and becomes a pillar of strength to others. Gough and Murphy, once notorious
                            drunkards. Gough and Murphy the powerful temperance advocates. Baxter and Bunyan, once
                            abandoned blasphemers ; Baxter and Bunyan, gifted and staunch advocates for
                                righteousness.<pb n="109" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> In a purely worldly sense, only the strong can
                            succeed. But it is the will and desire of God to bless the weak and afflicted, to aid the
                            strong; thus to prepare all who will desire and ask it, for a blessed eternity beyond. This
                            blessing is open to all who may work for it. To the toiling laborer and grimy engineer; to
                            the educated and the ignorant; to young and old ; to the wayfarer and to the sinful. God is
                            able to save the soul even unto the uttermost. Mount Lebanon, N.

                                    in sight, And to the ark she wings her flight. Heavier the cross, the easier dying:
                                    Death is a friendless face to see; To life's decay one bids defying, From life's
                                    distress one then is free; The cross sublimely lifts our faith To him who triumphed
                                    over death. Thou crucified: the cross I carry, The longer, may it dearer be; And

                            </head><p TEIform="p">Those wonderful manifestations of occult power which occurred during the time of the
                                Kentucky Revival, are quite beyond the ability of religionists or even philosophers to
                                determine the source from whence they originated. Many scores of worldly-wise men
                                stepped forward to explain but were forced to retire into their own darkness. Those
                                only, who are spiritually impressed can know of the gift of the spirit, or can rest
                                assured in the depths of their souls, that God has, in loving-kindness, made them heirs
                                of his goodness and love. That the Revival took place and held as its willing or
                                unwilling subjects, the wealthy in common with the poor, where all were involuntarily
                                forced to act very much alike, as did the strong man of mature age and the little
                                children of not more than eight or nine years, is one of the most remarkable exhibitions
                                of religious sympathy and zeal that has a place in modern history. No revival, operating
                                upon the mind of man to encourage him "to live soberly, righteously and godly in this
                                present world," has since that date, been recorded as its superior, or even as its
                                equal. Thousands gave their testimony of the good work that God's love had wrought in
                                their souls, and how it had saved them from the sins of the world. The republishing of
                                this astonishing manifestation, which extended through North Carolina, Kentucky and Ohio
                                must awaken a deep interest in the minds of those who are susceptible to religious
                                impressions. Men and women are not specially inclined to welcome that which humiliates
                                them before their friends, that forces them into conditions over which they would weep
                                like children and into relations which may destroy even their hard earned property. It
                                is "God that moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform," to which the spirit of
                                love in man responds. The healthy, growing mind cannot be otherwise than actively
                                engaged in the things that pertain to the affairs of this life.<pb n="111" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>
                                Ruled as the human race is, by the faculties of the mind, a village, a city or even a
                                whole state may be involuntarily moved to act, and we say that the spirit is in the air.
                                Indeed, it is. If the lower faculties predominate, it may be the work of a mob or of an
                                army, when all the brutal qualities are aroused and men and women become brutally cruel
                                in their deeds of horror. If a love for humanity and for God's law is in the ascendency,
                                religious enthusiasm and the work of righteousness follows as naturally as peace and
                                prosperity follow a well disciplined mind. On the passing away of this grasping
                                selfishness and tyranny which is ruling so largely the souls and bodies of men, and this
                                we pray, may speedily take place, we may hopefully look for righteousness to come
                                forward and a reign of peace and religious prosperity to manifest itself among men.
                                Mankind are going up, and not down. They are moving onward toward God, the Father of
                                light and the dispenser of all good gifts. Already, since "In the beginning" if the
                                stories of antiquarians and of our own historians are of any account, man in his best
                                estate has become quite like a child of God, if we compare him with those who lived with
                                Noah, or with those of a thousand years ago. Even the earth has grown to be a paradise,
                                and the "thorns and the thistles" that cursed the Eden of old, are giving place to
                                flowers and fruits, which are far more acceptable. Here comes the backward movement. For
                                thousands of years, men of religion have been told to love their friends and to hate
                                their enemies, and that hate was manifested with a vengeance, and their fiendish cruelty
                                toward each other would be more bloodthirsty and revengeful than that of the wild
                                beasts. So slowly has been the up grade movement toward righteousness, that even after
                                men called themselves Christians and disciples of the Prince of Peace, they exhibited
                                the most savage barbarities of their ancestors, and credited themselves with doing a
                                good thing for that special God whom they served. It has taken a great many revivals to
                                change the current of men's minds and to hold them up as well as it has, and do we
                                wonder at what transpired in that remarkable outpouring of spiritual life in Kentucky.
                                If God's voice and hand ever moved mankind to do anything, it must have moved those
                                people, as they testified of the blessings of an honest life, confessed and forsook
                                their sins, and condemned in themselves all that was contrary to the law of God. The
                                religious revival that moved over New England at an earlier date, and awakened hundreds
                                and hundreds of people, to think more seriously of the mission which man<pb n="112" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> 
                                had received of God for the benefit of humanity, gave unmistakable
                                evidence of its divine origin, as it turned many of its subjects from a worldly and
                                ruinous career, into that Christian path which leads to practical righteousness. The old
                                inheritance is laid aside and those treasures of God that moth and rust cannot corrupt
                                are being placed in the new heavens. This is the work of spiritual growth in the soul,
                                the new life that constitutes the revival and leads us on from degree to degree till we
                                become the perfected children of our God.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/>NOTES ABOUT HOME.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mount Lebanon, New York" TEIform="index"/> Mount Lebanon, N.

                                in April Manifesto, and it seemed meet for the times, as Manifesto Editorials always
                                seem to me. The average temperature of March for Mount Lebanon and the mean temperature of
                                the same for Canterbury, as given in April, makes a difference of seven degrees, between
                                the two, which makes me think there is a difference between the mean of two extremes and
                                the average for the month, since Canterbury is only about fifty miles further north,
                                according to the maps, and an average of seven degrees colder, than we had, must be
                                severe. The merry singing of birds this morning, the first I have heard this season,
                                seemed homelike, because they tell of genial skies and vernal blooms, and agreeable
                                warmth, arrived to clothe the earth again with her mantle of green, of multiform
                                texture,-� also to renew her friiitfulness with producDSTortli Family. April 15. "No
                                time to lose, the moments have a voice, Calling to duty as a lasting choice. Swiftly
                                they're fleeing and bear a record clear, Of deeds good or evil in this earthly sphere.
                                Scatter the seeds of virtue day by day; Embody the truth, it will not pass away. And to
                                labor for others is of virtue to thee, Increasing thy treasure in eternity." Of all the
                                seasons, spring is the most important. If the farmer, or gardener fails in duty now, he
                                will have affliction and trouble all through the summer; at harvest time vexation, and
                                for winter, unpleasant reflections. tions that reward industry, and gladden the hearts
                                of all living creatures. Since April came in, snow has fallen to the depth of twenty
                                inches, so reported, and though it melted fast, and has continued melting, about six
                                inches remains. Our farmers put several acres of grain into the ground before the last
                                snow. It is having a cold bath and perhaps it will make a quick start, after its white
                                shroud departs. Brother Henry and the men are improving the time at trimming apple
                                trees. With the return of mild weather, our people are getting better of their coughs,
                                colds, influenzas and rheumatics, which are being relegated to limbo where they belong.
                                What is home, if it is not where all rational needs are supplied, and all proper wants,
                                physical and moral, intellectual and spiritual, are satisfied. And where, when duties
                                are all performed in their season, we feel peace and rest, in harmony with environment.
                                A wise attention to the little duties, ten thousand times repeated, each in its proper
                                connection with the daily routine, never neglecting the greater ones, fertilizes life's
                                garden and feeds the fountain of content within, while all unnecessary, superficial and
                                transitory wants are denied and banished, by the satisfaction which flows from industry
                                and a justified conscience. Saturday it rained and snow is going fast. ' *<pb n="113" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> The season appears to be opening very satisfactorily. Have just commenced
                                to work the land. On the 3rd we had the greatest snow storm of the season; there fell
                                about eighteen inches. It has now about all disappeared. Elder Frederick, who on the 1st
                                fell upon a very sharp axe, cutting a terrible gash in the calf of the left leg, is
                                doingvery nicely. However it does not at all agree with his active life habits to be so
                                closely confined. The tendency seems to be to develop the nervous system. "There are no
                                accidents in Christ." Truth. And our gospel travel is not yet complete. What a glorious
                                sight it will be upon this earth, a body of people living in a section of country where
                                the weeds are all subdued; where there are no destructive animals or insects; where the
                                seasons come in perfect harmony and wh ere all the people not only have complete control
                                of their spirits, but of their bodies too. No accidents, no sickness, no premature
                                deaths and no burdensome old age. The battle against dirt, moth and rust, is now being
                                fought by our valiant Sisterhood, and things look favorably for complete victory. Our
                                Ministry are expected at their mountain home to-day. In kindest love. D.

                                the time when some of us would like to go on a visit, where house cleaning is not known.
                                This wrestling with contrary stove pipes, beating dusty carpets and kalsomining the
                                walls is not very conducive to peace of mind. The only consolation is, that two or three
                                of the good Sisters are generally near, and impart so freely their advice, that one
                                would think they understood the whole business, and of course it will not do to get
                                excited. So we put on an extra amount of pressure on the safety valve of patience and
                                all goes well. We have not done any ploughing as yet. Snow remains on the ground and it
                                freezes every night. We are making fences. Are selling some of our potatoes at three
                                dollars and twenty-five cents a barrel. Our tomato plants look well. We shall have about
                                six thousand plants to set this spring. We have closed the sawing of logs at our mill,
                                this season, and think the business has been profitable for us. J. B. Second Fainily. We
                                have not much to write at this time. The latter part of March was warm, and the wood for
                                the coming season was sawed and stored away. We commenced ploughing, when lo! April
                                stepped in and clothed the earth with a mantle of snow about twelve inches deep. This
                                put a stop to ploughing for the present; but as there is other necessary work to be done
                                we need not be idle.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hancock, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Hancock, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p">April 10, 1891. Time, which is ever on the wing, again brings the period in which it is
                                expedient to collect "Home Notes" for the excellent pamphlet that so abounds in wisdom,
                                and gives such universal satisfaction. There is, however, in our section, little of
                                interest to record. Health has been an abiding guest with us through the winter, which
                                is cause for deep thankfulness. In one or two instances La Grippe attempted to put in an
                                appearance, but being rebuffed soon left. The April number of the Manifesto is, from
                                cover to cover, so replete with articles of superior merit, that distinguishing
                                preference seems hardly possible. "Plome Notes" do indeed have the right ring, are
                                always refreshing, and serve to bring us into closer communion with gospel kindred. The
                                feathered songsters still seem to<pb n="114" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> tarry in their southern homes,

                                remuins enshrouded in snow. One of our aged Sisters, Anna Pool, of the Second Family, on
                                the morning of the 9th ult. had the misfortune to fall on the slippery flag-stones and
                                break a bone of the left arm near the wrist. The doctor who is in attendance thinks it
                                is healing finely and considers it a remarkable case, as she is in her ninety-third
                                year. He claims there is not to be found on record, a case where a broken bone has
                                healed on a person so advanced in years. A large amount of wood is being sawed and split
                                both for market and home use. While we enjoy the delicious maple syrup that we are
                                making in very small quantities, we are reminded of the toiling ones in our sister
                                Societies, (particularly those in New Hampshire,) who are manufacturing such large
                                quantities of both syrup and sugar, and we wonder how so much labor can be accomplished.

                                if you think best so to do. Notes about Home seem to be read, and no doubt will be so
                                long as our interests are identical. The pocket of ore found on the land owned by this
                                Society is one of the deposits which belong to the Salisbury vein. This vein is first
                                found near the north line of Berkshire Co., at the head waters of the Housatonic river,
                                and runs in a southwesterly course through the county and along the west line of
                                Connecticut and east line of York State. Its extent is about ninety miles. Ore has been
                                discov ered in sections this whole distance, although some beds are too poor to pay for
                                working, while others are very rich in iron. Four years ago this spring, parties
                                commenced underground mining on our land a little east of the village, near the railroad
                                station. Here they dropped a shaft about one hundred and thirty feet into the earth.
                                This shaft is six by eight and timbered from top to bottom. From this they drift away
                                into the ore. They are now working four levels. The bottom level has been extended
                                between two and three thousand feet, and still forces good ore. The Company have lately
                                sunk another shaft one hundred and fifty feet deep near the lowlands on the line of
                                their underground works. As the top of this last shaft is some forty feet below the top
                                of the old one, they will be able to extend more drifts under these present works. The
                                depth of the ore has not been determined as yet, but the Company are satisfied that they
                                are working on the top of the deposit. They have erected a large building over this last
                                shaft and placed in it their engines, washers, pumps, &amp;c. At the present time
                                they are taking out about eight hundred tons of ore per month. When their new works are
                                completed they intend to work nine or ten levels and mine seventy-five to one hundred
                                tons per day. The Railroad Company have run a track out to their works so as to load
                                their cars where the ore is taken out, without any extra hauling. The ore is taken to
                                Chatham, some eighteen miles, where their furnace converts it into pig iron. The grounds
                                are loaned to the Company for a term of years with an agreement that there shall be a
                                certain amount of ore mined each month and a monthly payment of Royalty made to the
                                Society for every ton taken. We are able to say that thus far the Company have lived up
                                to this agreement. The expense of mining the ore is borne by the parties without any aid
                                whatever from the Society. On the 2nd inst. we observed the Proclamation sent out by
                                Governor Russell for a day of Fasting. Had meeting at ten<pb n="115" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> o'clock
                                A. M. The afternoon was devoted, as is the custom of Believers, to putting things in
                                order. As the snow had nearly all disappeared we thought it a good time to put away our
                                sleds, and did so. The next morning, to our surprise, we found sixteen inches of
                                beautiful white snow had fallen during the night; we had not any use for it except to
                                fertilize our land, therefore we agreed that it could disappear just as soon as it
                                pleased. House cleaning has already commenced and where there is a particle of dust or
                                one fly-speck, the good Sisters think it will not do to let it remain. Therefore,
                                brooms, brushes, and soap-suds are in motion. Good health favors us at this date. In
                                kindest love. Your Brother. Ira R.

The bluebirds were with us as early as the first of March. A short time ago
                                our supply of roots which we had been feeding to our milch cows failed, in consequence a
                                surprising decrease of milk and cream. Note. We must raise more roots, carrots and sugar
                                beets the coming season. We raised last summer and fed this winter about nine hundred
                                bushels. We must make it twelve hundred this season, and raise squashes, soft shell for
                                early feed, and thus have roots till grass comes again. Ensilage is no doubt an
                                indispensable feed where milk production is the only object sought, but in butter
                                production it seems to be inferior to good corn fodder cut fine and fed with roots,
                                grain, and clover hay. We have for some weeks been engaged in spring work. T. Stroud.

                                work the land, the ground freezes, snow falls and winter holds on. The third of April
                                four inches of snow accompanied with high winds and cold air. We are improving the time
                                cleaning up door-yards and buildings, trimming trees, hauling lumber, mixing fertilizer,
                                preparing seed and machines for work as soon as the season will permit. Our new
                                Aspinwall Potato Planter has come, and we are rejoicing in the prospect of time and
                                labor to be saved thereby. We have fixed over and painted the tin roof on engine house
                                and dairy, and are repairing other out-buildings. We have a gift of cleaning up and hope

                                blessings are free. The bright sunshine, the welcome rain, water, air, health, and above
                                all, the gospel is free. Free salvation by the cross. We are invited to drink of the
                                water of life freely. We have always abundant occasion for praise and thankfulness, and
                                it is befitting that we join in special strains of thanksgiving unitedly as well as
                                individually. We should be thankful for pure companions, for the comforts of a peaceful
                                home and social life, and for religious privileges and spiritual blessings that cannot
                                be measured. Offering thanks is acceptable to God and healthful to the soul. "Enter into
                                his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto Him and

                                also rob small plants of sun and air. To make chickens grow, feed wheat as soon as they
                                can eat it. Mashed potatoes, corn and oats, (ground) can be given them to advantage.
                                Ground meat should be given them once a day. Confined fowls should not be fed much
                                fattening material, but give them a proportion of lean meat or scraps. D.

                                will not only be seen within our household, but it will be a living missionary to many
                                who are looking into a knowledge of these principles. All who have known Elder Giles
                                have seen that he has made the principles of Shakerism a perfect success in his life.
                                And now as he has been called up higher, may his pure mantle rest on his successor,
                                Elder Joseph Holden. For more than thirty years I have been closely associated with him
                                in the duties of life and have always found him a stalwart for the principles of our
                                blessed Mother's gospel and just the one to receive the blessing, strength and success
                                of a dear brother. What have we to fear if God be on our side? Don't let us leave our
                                alabaster boxes to be broken over our dear ones after they are laid in the coffin. Let
                                us break some of them now and let the perfume fill the air, and make glad the hearts of
                                those who are carrying along Zion's burdens. We are often exhorted to make our home
                                attractive, to throw out sunshine and cheer in every department of life. If the kingdom
                                of heaven is within us why not let some of it out and share together as Brothers and
                                Sisters. They who tread life's pathway ever bearing on their faces an expression of
                                cheerfulness, are radiant ministers of good to mankind. They scatter sunshine on all
                                they meet, depression and gloom fade away in their presence. On Thursday the 2nd we had
                                one more heavy fall of snow, so we resorted to our sleighs for traveling. A blizzard
                                visited us in the evening and broke down one of our large fir trees and tore down six

                                the buds on the maples. Winter has held the "right of way," over the wood to be burned
                                and the garments to be worn till within a few days, when a change of temperature has
                                been announced. Large numbers of robins and bluebirds have returned after a long
                                absence, and seem very much at home. The sugar harvest is over. Two camps have been in
                                operation and some hundreds of gallons of nice maple syrup has been secured. At the camp
                                in our family one Brother and two young men have taken charge of some 300 trees. They
                                kept one yoke of cattle at the camp and when not engaged in the hauling of sap, they
                                were made useful in hauling a supply of wood for another year. This camp has furnished
                                some 190 bbls. of sap and some 98 gallons of syrup and for this pleasant luxury we shall
                                be made happier during the whole year. The Honey Bees are yet imprisoned in the cellar,
                                and as they eat less honey while held in close confinement, it is a point in economy to
                                hold them till the return of spring is made a certainty. Xo honey can be obtained till
                                the last of May, and not even any bread till the catkins are in flower, so that the
                                thousands of active little bees if away from the cellar, must be fed daily or there is
                                danger of their falling into bad habits. In accordance with the time-honored custom of
                                the early fathers, our Society regarded the proclamation of Governor Tuttle of N. H.,
                                and enjoyed a very satisfactory meeting. Such seasons of religious communion are always

                                a reader of our little messenger, that not only our Societies, but others also, look
                                with interest to the Home ]S"otes. At first, one might think it odd that a stranger
                                outside the gates should be especially attracted to these simple facts, simply written,
                                on our home affairs, no "doctrines" included, only as every word spoken or written has
                                its influence.<pb n="117" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> Yet a second considerate thought tells us they
                                really are an indicator, possibly an educator, regarding the home life of the only
                                Community that has, as yet, sustained the relationship of brothers and sisters in
                                Christ. Those who study the "Signs of the Times" declare that in these latter days there
                                is much thought given to this mode of living, for a class who are satisfied with the
                                experiments others have made in the "old way" and desire a "new way." So it becomes our
                                duty (which Frances Willard says should always be written with a capital D) if not
                                always a pleasure, to delineate as we may, the homely topics which interest us in the
                                New Creation.. Our maple harvest has been immense, almost a continuous flow, or rather
                                "drop in the bucket" since April 1st; very little rain to adulterate, making it
                                unusually pleasant. The market is flushed with sweet, so the purse will not be made to
                                extend on this score, but if all, big and little, have not had their "sufficiency full"
                                it will be their own fault this season. Health of our family has been unusually good all
                                winter up to date, no "grippe" here. We have concluded our home in the valley is fully
                                as healthful as those on the breezy mountain top. House cleaning and painting has seized
                                us early so will probably subside in proportionate good season, in time to attend to our
                                friends should they be kind enough to make us a call. E.

                                things heard and unheard, remembering that "The sweetest songs are those That few men
                                ever hear And no men ever sing. The clearest skies are those That furthest off appear To
                                birds of strongest wing." The severe, steady winter is believed by many to be a
                                forerunner of peace, plenty and prosperity to the farming community through the medium
                                of fruit abundant and generous farm crops. Garden making with other forms of enterprise
                                is the advance march of to-day. Grape vines were pruned in season, some fruit trees have
                                been shorn of dead and dying branches, a few worthless trees have been hewn down, making
                                way for more profitable ones should such be planted in this or future generations. The
                                sunny days revive the vision of the much needed house cleaning, when we<pb n="118" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> shall go armed from morn till evening with brush and broom and water to
                                follow, removing all objectionable objects that accumulate during the season of much
                                dirt and dust; though we have never heard of a season yet that has escaped dirt and dust
                                in some form, and never anticipated conditions so pleasing while we are inhabitants of a
                                country composed of said material. But the world that lies just a trifle beyond, The
                                country no mortal hath seen, Is a world we imagine free from all blight, And ever,
                                forever serene. G. D.

                                with that unwelcome visitor La Grippe. We had quite a number of severe cases. The
                                weather has been cold and rainy with occasional slight snow falls. On the morning of the
                                6th inst. an inch snow fall greeted us, which quickly vanished in the bright morning
                                sun. Reports were that most of the fruit was killed, but we learn from good authority
                                that it is not. How thankful we should feel, for fruit is one of our great resources of
                                livelihood. The Kentucky river is quite high; a steamboat passed Shaker landing on its
                                way up the river, a few days ago, with a calliope on it. A company of young Sisters went
                                down to see and to hear, but it had not returned. But they were rewarded with a glorious
                                view of towering cliffs decked in their spring-tide robes of beautiful fragrant bloom.
                                Thoughtful hearts and loving hands brought the pretty wildflowers and brightened the
                                rooms of those less fortunate. It is "whispered in the air" that great improvements are
                                under consideration here. We hope soon, to give a more definite account. May success and
                                prosperity attend all indefatigable workers. The farmers are thankful to see a few
                                sunshiny days at last. M. J. Our season is very backward, as March and April have both
                                been wintry and the frequent rains have prevented the farmers from plowing. It now gives
                                promise of warmer weather. We are trying to do our best, although the laborers are few
                                who are at work in the Lord's vineyard. We have resolved to be faithful and keep the
                                gospel lights brightly burning, that others may be welcomed to our gospel home. We shall

The writings of
                            Charles Fourier, in many respects vague, chimerical and impracticable, contain certain great
                            generalizations which appealed to the rational, reformatory spirit of his day, and while few
                            could follow him in his arbitrary analogies respecting the origin and destiny of the visible
                            universe, there were many who saw in his writings a prophecy of a purer, freer and more
                            righteous social order. But Charles Fourier drew his inspiration from the philosophical
                            rather than the theological source, and therefore, to such men as Adin Ballou, he did not
                            seem to furnish the inexhaustible spiritual requirements necessary for so radical a social
                            change as he advocated. The labors of the famous Frenchman, therefore, resulted rather in
                            opening the doors of general social reformation to other original thinkers, than in winning
                            proselytes to his own particular scheme. The same was largely true also of the efforts of
                            Robert Owen, who as an enterprising and philanthropic manufacturer, distinguished himself at
                            New Lanark, in Scotland, as a radical reformer in the realm of industry and social science.

WHERE RICHES ARE A BLESSING.
We are too pronetomeasure a woman's
worth by her condition in life. Only last
week I saw the wife of a well-known New
York millionaire enter one of the great
hospitals of the town. After a bit, curiosity tempted me to follow, and for two
hours 1 watched that woman going
through the wards of the sick, dispensing
here some dainty from a maid's basket,
there a smile, and again a cheery word.
All the patients knew her, and in a dozen
instances did I see the striken sufferers kiss
her ungloved hand in gratitude, and close
their eyes as a silent little prayer went up
for this woman who, so bountifully blessed
herself, did not forget that there were others less fortunate. And this is not an exceptional case, but one which you can see
in the hospitals and institutions of the
great cities of our land almost every day.
Many a millionaire's wife is to-day sustaining the hands of the noble band of
women who are striving to bring sunny
spots in the lives of our working girls. Of
course, there are women of vast worldly
means who live within themselves, regardless of the want which exists at. their very
doors. But because such women�fewer
than the average woman believes�unfortunately exist, it is unfair to judge all rich
women alike. Because the church has
within its doors people who it would be
better were they on the outside, is no criterion by which to judge the thousands of
God-sainted men and women who are benedictions to the world at large. Too little
credit is given the wealthy classes for the
good which is often done with the riches
at their command.�The Ladies' Home
Journal.

From millions of customers, during the past years,
comes the verdict that VICK'S SEEDS never
disappoint. Why waste time, money and patience on
others, when you can buy the BEST at same price?
Make no mistake this year ; send io cents for Vick'S
Floral Guide, deduct the io cents from first order,
and it costs nothing. It is better than ever; ioo large
pages, colored plates, grand novelties worthy of
cultivation.     Cash prizes giooo and $200.                ^
