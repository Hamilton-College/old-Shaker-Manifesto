                            one of the principal supporters of the gospel testimony in America. He was born in Cheshire,
                            England, and was a man of respectable character, and a member of the Methodist Church. On
                            receiving the faith as made known through Mother Ann and the Elders, he became a zealous and
                            faithful Believer. He was gifted in visions and revelations, and was an especial medium in
                            the gift of healing. His wealth permitted him to be of great help to the Believers, even in
                            a temporal view, and it was through his liberality that the little company were enabled to
                            cross the ocean, from England to America, and subsequently to establish themselves in a
                            permanent home in this country. He was known as a very honest, conscientious and upright
                            man, and faithfully maintained this name through lifeHe deceased Feb. 27th 1799 at the age
                            of 7G years. David Meacham was a resident of the town of Enfield, in the State of Conn.,
                            where he owned a farm. He was a man of religious impressions, and hearing of the revival of
                            the word of God among a people in the vicinity of Albany, he made arrangements to<pb n="122" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> visit them in the month of January 1781. Mother Ann and the Elders received
                            him very kindly, and soon made &amp; favorable impression upon his mind, through the
                            intelligence of their profession. During this visit David became as one of the family, and
                            saw the people in all their daily duties. In the religious service he became fully convinced
                            that the spirit of the living Christ had taken up its abode with them. Their testimony was
                            pointed against the sins of the world, and an encouragement for truth and righteousness. At
                            the close of the service he obtained an interview with Mother Ann and the Elders, and more
                            particularly informed them of the object of his visit. Mother Ann remarked, "David, God has
                            called you to take up your cross and to obey the gospel of Christ. You should make an honest
                            confession of your sins to God, and then forsake them forever, and in obedience to this
                            spiritual light, God will have mercy on your soul." David accepted the gift. It was a
                            revelation of the spirit of God to his soul. He now saw with distinctness the strait and
                            narrow path in which he must walk, as an evidence that he had renewed his life to God. On
                            the following day, Mother Ann again spoke to him in reference to his privilege. "If you are
                            faithful to take up a full cross against pll sin, God will make you able to preach the
                            gospel to the children of this world. You will meet with a great deal of opposition, even in
                            your own home, but you must not be ashamed to own and to testify to your faith before all
                            men. God has called you in relation to the people where you live, and if you are faithful,
                            he will raise up those who will love and honor him." On his return home David met his
                            father, who was an Elder in the Baptist church, and informed him of the journey that he had
                            made. An inquiry was soon made about the religious people in Watervliet, and what he thought
                            of them. David replied, "They are the only people of God, and the true church of Christ upon
                            the earth. " This sudden departure from the religion of his father was received with
                            astonishment. "My son," said he, "you are deceived ; you are deluded. " Several ministers
                            were called in conference with a hope of reclaiming the young man, but to no purpose. After
                            several months of spiritual warfare with the priests and people, and the severe opposition
                            of his father, he had the great satisfaction of seeing the blessed fruits of his consecrated
                            labors. The testimony of the gospel found a permanent foundation in the hearts of many of
                            the people in and near the town of Enfield. It was a feast of good things to David, as he
                            could, with joy, witness the passing away of the old heavens and earth in the midst of so
                            great a noise. In May, 1780, Mother Ann and the Elders visited the towns of Washington,
                            Grafton and Harvard in Mass., and Enfield in Conn. David had long wanted the Elders to visit
                            his home and the pleasant anticipation was about to be realized. He had hoped to enjoy the
                            company of his gospel friends for a few days, but in this he was to be disappointed. The
                            Elders had been in the place but a short time before there were rumors that a mob was
                            gathering to molest them. To prevent anything unpleasant, the Elders thought it prudent<pb n="123" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> to leave the place, as soon as they could conveniently. The Elders
                            made another visit to Enfield on the first of March, 17ft2, and remained ten days. A part of
                            this time passed very pleasantly and satisfactorily, but on the second week a mob of two
                            hundred persons stationed themselves before the house and threatened violence to the persons
                            of the Elders unless they left the place, immediately. In Oct. 1782, the Elders made a third
                            visit to Enfield under the charge of David Meacham. Soon after reaching his house, however,
                            a fierce mob from the town of Somers, surrounded the building and iuhumanly committed many
                            acts of violence. This might, very properly,' be recorded as a religious persecution, as the
                            leaders of the mob were baptized professors of the church, and respectable (?) men in
                            society.| In June 1783, David was in company with the Elders in the town of Shirley, Mass.,
                            when a mob had gathered to molest the Believers. He passed among them without fear, and
                            through the kindness of his remarks obtained a good influence over many minds that had come
                            to do mischief. The leaders of the mob on learning this drove him into the house and forbid
                            his preaching to any of the company. David followed the mob at the time that Father James
                            Whittaker was tied to a tree in the town of Harvard and so inhumanly scourged with rods.
                            During this shameful proceeding, David was thrown to the ground and held there, by several
                            of the persecutors, till the whipping was finished. �f A more extended account of this mob
                            violence will be found in the article which speaks of the journey through Preston, Windham,
                            Strafford and Enfield. He was also at the trial of. Mo I her Ann and the Elders before
                            Eleazer Grant, a justice of the peace, in New Lebanon. In order to get David out of the way
                            a warrant was issued to seize him, under the pretence that he had cruelly abused one of his
                            own children. This malicious act soon ended in a mock trial and David was set free. This
                            very worthy Believer occupied an honorable position among his townsmen, as upright and
                            honest, and by his wealth stood independent of any favors that might be offered. On his
                            acceptance of the armor of Grod, he became a bold and valiant soldier of the cross of
                            Christ, and was for many years, at a subsequent date, the senior Trustee in the Church of
                            the Society at New Lebanon, N. Y. John P'arrington resided in the town of New Lebanon, N. Y.
                            At the age of twenty years he made a visit to Watervliet to see Mother Ann and the Elders,
                            of whom he had heard so much. He was at this time under deep religious impressions, and
                            receiving the full approbation of his parents, he went to test the "virtue and efficacy" of
                            the religion of the Elders. This was in May, 1780. John made a visit of several days, during
                            which time he was deeply interested in all that he saw and heard amonsr o this new order of
                            people. The testimony of confessing and forsaking all sin had been clearly set forth by the
                            Elders so that every one present knew what it was to bring their deeds to the light and to
                            be joined to the Lord in one spirit. He subsequently reported that he had enjoyed everything
                            that met his obser-<pb n="124" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> vation, and was really baptized into a new spirit.
                            He now made arrangements to return to his home in NeAV Lebanon, and informed the Elders that
                            he should try and amend his life. To this the Believers replied ;�"All of your promises and
                            resolutions to that end are very commendable, but by an honest confession of all sin, you
                            will be better able to bear your cross and to renew your life to God. " The love and
                            confidence which had grown in tthe mind of this young Believer toward Mother Ann and the
                            Elders, gave him all assurance in their word, as his trustworthy, spiritual advisers. He had
                            also become convinced that this was the requirement of God, and said he, "I undertook it and
                            made as honest a confession of all sin as I was able at that time. " He then returned to his
                            parents and became a zealous advocate of the word of God, and an able supporter of the
                            principles that governed the work. "Mother Ann's industry, prudence and economy," said he,
                            "were equal to her humility aud charity; so that in all things she was a pattern of
                            godliness and gave the evidence that she was a Mother, indeed, in every good word and work.
                            As the Lord Jesus set an example of righteousness to all men, and instructed his disciples
                            to follow m his footsteps, in order to find acceptance with God ; so Mother Ann set an
                            example of righteousness to all women and instructed all her followers to take up the same
                            cross in order to find their relation to Christ." The incident related of John Earrington
                            which took place while Mother Ann and the Elders were visiting at the home of his father is
                            peculiarly characteristic of the man. He did not hesitate to face a mob of lawless
                            characters that were in front of his father's house. When they seized him, instead of
                            fighting them, he cried out " Love, love," and his tormentors cried mockingly, "love, love."
                            As they increased their grip, John cried still louder, "More love." This so frustrated those
                            who had John in charge, that they allowed him his freedom. He then delivered his message to
                            them, and went into the house. When the Church was organized at New Lebanon, and the people
                            established in the community relation, John Farrington was appointed the senior Elder, and
                            for many years commanded the love and respect of all who lived in the Society, and to a
                            great extent, of those who were not of the order. \ (To BE CONTINUED.) X For an

TEIform="persName"/>ALONZO G. HOLLISTER.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Natural things typify spiritual things. In Christ, the offspring of God, is both Bridegroom
                            and Bride. Jesus manifested the Bridegroom. The second in order, is the manifestation of the
                            Bride. In a discourse delivered Christmas eve, before the Parker spiritualist fraternity in
                            N. Y. City, after referring to the birth of a certain male child eighteen hundred and
                            eighty-five years ago, the speaker remarked parenthetically, "What a pity to the race that
                            it was not a female child, so that, the influence of its name might have increased the
                            lustrous kindness and patient gentleness of that portion of the race which best exemplify<pb n="125" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> those loving qualities which render religion essential." This
                            reference to woman and her implied capacity is an encouraging sign of the present growth of
                            intelligence and liberal opinion. How brief the period, since her brothers or sisters have
                            been willing to accept woman as a religious teacher, except for childhood. And how many even
                            now, feel a lack in this line which their male teachers cannot supply to their heart's
                            content? One sufficient reason why the heaven anointed woman could not appear eighteen
                            hundred years ago and make her impress on the ages following, was the darkness and blindness
                            of the human race, which required a man's strength and lion like boldness, aided by the
                            superior advantage of position which education and custom accorded the male teacher, to open
                            the way�by creating an atmosphere, or moral element and sentiment, in which woman's higher
                            mental and spiritual faculties could find activity, and unfold her capacity. This having
                            been accomplished through the anointed Jesus and his disciples, and the revolution of the
                            ages, on the twenty ninth of February, A. D. seventeen hundred and thirty six, the woman
                            child was born, who, after she had grown to maturity and was baptized with the Holy Spirit,
                            freed herselt from all earthly bonds, became a religious teacher and leader out of sin,
                            (thus reversing the example of the first woman we read of,) dispensed apostolic gifts,
                            opened the way to the tree of life, revealed in her own character the Motherhood of Deity as
                            Jesus revealed the Fatherhood, and became that example to all the Daughters of God who seek
                            the highest excellence, that Jesus is to the Sons. Through her labors, suffering, and
                            self-sacrifice for the good of others, the daughters are now able to stand on equal footing
                            with the sons. She testified "The fullness of the Godhead dwells in womanhood bodily. " She
                            said of herself "I am Ann the Word." "No man is my head but Christ Jesus, he is my head and
                            Lord. " Ann means grace, or a gift. The first appearing of Christ beginning in a man, it was
                            necessary that the second appearing should begin in a woman, to make man and woman equal on
                            the Christ plane of life. Ann testified that she saw a thousand in the world of spirits, to
                            every one she saw in the body. She frequently testified of seeing spirits rise from the
                            dead, (spirits dead to the Divine life and ignorant of the things of God,) and come into the
                            resurrection which is in Christ. Her immediate companions and supporters were gifted with
                            seership in like manner, and all testified that the gospel of the kingdom of God was and is
                            preached to spirits x&gt;ut of the body; "That they may be judged according to men in
                            the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit. " Also that spirits receive and obey the
                            gospel, and travel to that degree of purity as to be clothed in white robes. Ann finished
                            her work in the body in Sept. seventeen hundred and eighty four, over one hundred years ago.
                            Ann, her brother William, James Whittaker, John Hocknell and others, preached the gospel to
                            spirits, and frequently made serious labors with them to teach them the right way. Others of
                            our faith have done the same. These people were " put to death in the flesh," death to the
                            natural, rudimental life which binds to earth, and were "made<pb n="126" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> alive in
                            spirit," as Peter says of Jesus, "in which also he went and preached to spirits in prison,
                            who aforetime were disobedient, when the long suffering of God waited iu the days of Noah,
                            while the ark was preparing. " 1 Peter, iii., 19. This prison is a state. Any one that is a
                            slave to appetite, or passion, or to any evil habit, is a prisoner spiritually, in that
                            state and degree to which he is enslaved. If he is ignorant too, of his own higher powers,
                            and of the means of escape, he needs somebody, or a wise intelligence distinct from himself,
                            to aid him. To open the prison doors and give the needed aid, to set the example and spread
                            the light of a higher life, and also to minister the life to those willing to receive it, is
                            the mission of Ami Lee and her disciples. She testified that she saw Jesus Christ and
                            conversed with him daily face to face, as one friend converses with another, and I never
                            heard of any one who knew her intimately, feeling disposed to question her testimony. She
                            testified to having seen the Apostles and Prophets, and her disciples, of all ages from
                            infancy to gray hairs, including preachers and many heads of families, and some of
                            collegiate education, believed her message, and renounced the honors, riches, pleasures,
                            rewards and ambitions of the world, to practice her teaching through life. I recently saw a
                            question that was asked and answered at the Banner of Light free circle, as to what became
                            of the body of Jesus, after it was entombed. The same question being asked of Ann Lee, she
                            answered that it was dissolved, and each part went to its own element. It is evident from
                            the New Testament record that great spirit power was manifested in those days, sufficient to
                            accomplish anything necessary to convince honest inquirers, same as there is now. About a
                            year after the opening of her testimony in America, she reproved some for their hardness and
                            unbelief, and referred to the unbelieving Jews in Christ's first appearing. Said "Even his
                            own disciples after he rose from the dead, though he had often told them he should rise the
                            third day, believed it not. They would not believe that he had risen because he appeared
                            first to a woman ! So great Avas their unbelief that the words of Mary seemed to them like
                            idle tales ! His appearing first to a woman, showed that his second coming would be in a
                            woman. " She often said "' I feel the blood of Christ running through my soul and body,
                            washing me ; Him do I acknowledge as my head and Lord. " Christ, observe, is spirit, and his
                            body is not dead but living. "The blood is the life thereof."

                            if they do not find that power of God, which saves from sin, the reason is obvious ; they
                            have not made the sacrifice which the gospel requires. They have not forsaken all that they
                            had, and their own carnal lives, also, which includes their lusts, their appetites and their
                            passions in every form. There is still a fixed determination in their minds, as there was in
                            the case of Ana-<pb n="127" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>nias, and Sapphira, to hold back a part of the price,
                            to use for the gratification of some indulgence, in that which the gospel of Jesus Christ
                            does not allow. Finding they are not saved from sin, they doubt the saving power of the
                            gospel, and hold fast to their most easily besetting sin. At the same time they pray to God
                            that He would help them to overcome those darling sins which they daily roll as a sweet
                            morsel under their tongues with a determination to continue in them. Why should they try to
                            deceive themselves or others? The wages of sin always was death. God is not mocked. What a
                            man soweth, that shall he also reap. The gospel of Christ if lived, practically, always did
                            and always will save the soul from sin. This was the mission of Jesus,�To save his people
                            from their sins : not in their sins, as this is not the salvation of God. A sinner must reap
                            what he has sown. The hand of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save all who come
                            unto Him in the way of his appointment. Whoever lacks wisdom in these things, let him ask of
                            God, in his appointed order, and it shall be given him, for He giveth to all men liberally

                            and Religion. Nothing but sheer ignorance in any man could suggest such a possibility. To
                            completely disprove such a statement, and annihilate at once all the silly arguments based
                            upon it, it is only necessary to say, that all truth is of, and from God and God cannot
                            antagonize Himself. If this is not so, there is no truth, no reason, no sense, no anything.
                            The faculty of Reason (which is merely a comparison and mental manipulation of ideas already
                            possessed, and derived mostly if not wholly from external experiences) is a verity and a
                            useful one. But the sublime faculty of Intuition with its inspirations and sequences is just
                            as much and as really a verity of consciousness as the other, and infinitely more reliable.
                            Pure reason cannot conflict with pure Intuition, because both are of God and agree with the
                            Supreme Intelligence and any two things, which agree with a third, must agree with each
                            other. False reasoning and false Inspirational Intuitions growing out of undeveloped mental
                            and spiritual conditions need not be nimed in this essay. They are not verities but
                            phantasms. Through the sublime faculty called Intuition, the most sublime and stupendous
                            truths have been suggested to man in all past ages, of his history and still continue to be
                            and will forever. They photograph themselves upon the dial plate of his consciousness
                            instantaneously, before slowly plodding reason has time to manipulate the"m or even look at
                            them through her mechanical lens called Logic. But give Reason and Science time enough, and
                            they will be found uniformly on the side of the sublimer faculty of Spiritual Intuition, and
                            never in conflict therewith. All truth as comprehended by finite man, must necessarily be
                            more or less tainted with the feculence of error and the beautiful process of Evolution will
                            be necessary to gradually fan away this feculence throughout all time and through<pb n="128" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> The the interminable cycles of Eternity The canons of logic may answer the
                            purpose of dove-tailing arguments to gether in order to reach a certain given and often
                            foregone conclusion. Bu without the help and kindly co-operatior of Inspirational Intuitions
                            did the cok cast steel canons of logic ever satisfy any mind? And if they did what kinc of a
                            mind was it? It was a cold-blooded angular temperament, all intellect and not one bit of
                            emotional sentiment or kindly and charitable warmth of spirit. Such are metaphysical
                            monstrosities. We need not wish to belong to that category of intellects. The best mode of
                            development we can adopt is to become if possible equally perfect, physically,
                            scientifically, spiritually. An excess of life�intellect�or emotion is sure to be disastrous
                            sooner or later. But if philosophically developed as above suggested, there is no danger not
                            even a possibility of any antagonism or conflict resulting between our Eeligion and our
                            scientific attainments. In fact this is the way to "seek first" (and last) the kingdom of
                            Heaven and its Righteousness, and the only way. Any development different from this whereby
                            any one or more of these three dapartments of our being is sacrificed to the others, must
                            result in arrested development of the neglected departments and hideous monstrosity.
                            Happiness and bliss arise from the practice of temperance in all directions and excess in
                            none. Let us learn and practice every physiological law and keep our health at a standard
                            which will enable us to labor for the good of others. Let us learn all possible science
                            which will in any way directly or indirectly do good to our Brethren and Sisters temporally
                            or in-tellectually. Let us learn and practice all manner of religious truth which can be
                            brought practically to bear upon the progress of our Brethren and Sisters in holiness and
                            happiness ;- -all that will comfort them in affliction, cheer them in forsaken hours ; all
                            that will enable us to weep with the sorrowful�rejoice with the jojful�all that will make us
                            forgive and love our enemies as readily as our friends. And let us once and forever shut
                            down on this nonsense about a conflict between science and religion and rather look upon
                            them as counterparts in the Divine Scheme of Providence to help us on to higher and higher
                            attitudes of happiness and glory ; as two sides of the same shining road leading to the
                            sublime presence of "Him who inbabiteth Eternity ;" whose dual name and nature is Wisdom and

                            fawning flattery of favorites, failed to give her soul peace. One moment spent aright would
                            have been more precious, than the seventeen days of banqueting and entertainment at
                            Kenilworth Castle, when the hands moved not on the dial from the first hour of the feast.
                            But, " Time and tide wait for no one," however great and exalted their position among men;
                            and if human beings squander their precious life in sensual pleasure, they will find at its

                            longings of the immortal spirit. Those who gather to themselves groat riches, often suffer
                            poverty of soul, and feel at the close of their mortal career, that all is vanity, and
                            vexation of spirit; because great abilities have been used to subserve earthly purposes, to
                            gratify ambition and avarice, at the expense of their nobler faculties, which have been
                            dwarfed and buried in materiality. When such pass the border land into the inner realm of
                            being, leaving all, wealth, emolument, fame and grandeur, they feel a blank in life ; an
                            utter destitution of spirit; a realization that they will stanrj, perhaps, on a par with
                            their humblest servant; for, in the land of souls, all distinctions are leveled, save
                            absolute worth. Our eternal mansion in the heavens, can only be built by good deeds. Our
                            inheritance there, is the substance of virtue practiced here. They do not vainly strive, who

                            good. Strength of character is not mere strength of strong feelings. It is unyielding
                            resistance to whatever would disconcert from without, or within. Character is eternal,
                            hence, the necessity of commencing in childhood, being constant in youth, devoted in
                            manhood, thus wisely maturing in age, a character free from all blight. Finally in thought
                            and act, so live that daily growth of soul and body, may ever tend in the direction of
                            perfection. Canterbury, N.

I), the empire was being assailed from all
                            sides ; in Britain, France and Spain, in Asia, Africa and Hungary, war raged universally.
                            Though a most able and determined ruler, he found the task too great to govern such a vast
                            territory single handsd. He therefore divided the government with three associated governors
                            ; and after having reigned for twenty one years, he resigned his august office and betook
                            himself to raising cabbages, enjoying more genuine happiness in this simple employment than
                            he ever did while wearing the imperial crown. His successor, Constantius, also divided the
                            empire, taking for his share Britain, France and Spain. Before his death, which took place
                            at York, he appointed, in 806. his son Constantine, the subject of this sketch, his
                            successor. Constantine was born at Naissus, in modern Servia. His childhood and youth were
                            spent amid stirring scenes of camp life and warfare. His education was wholly military. At
                            the early age of seventeen years, we hear of his distinguishing himself in Egypt, and later
                            on in Persia. His talents were such as to procure him the enmity of Galerius, one of the
                            associate Caesars, who discerned in him a possible future rival for power, and who therefore
                            sought to destroy him. Constantine had to flee for his life to his father in Britain. He
                            remained nine years in England after his father's death, ruling with vigor and wisdom. Then
                            trouble began. Maxentius, whose residence was at Rome, not being satisfied with his share of
                            government and aiming at universal dominion, made war upon him. Constantino was compelled,
                            in self-defence, to appeal to arms. Successively he defeated, not only Maxentius, but four
                            additional claimants for the imperial throne. In 328 he was sole emperor of Rome. For
                            fourteen years he controlled the complicated affairs of government with a degree of energy
                            and statesmanship that compels admiration. His brilliant generalship forced the barbarians
                            to respect the frontiers; and his political sagacity and vigorous administration restored
                            the internal relations of<pb n="131" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> the empire to order and prosperity. In two
                            particular instances was his remarkable comprehension of facts, and his ability to
                            understand the signs of the times, displayed. The city of Rome had become utterly corrupt;
                            its vast population approached two millions in number, the majority being paupers and slaves
                            ; it was divided into turbulent factions whose contentions seriously interfered with orderly
                            government These considerations induced Constantine to make Constantinople the capitol,
                            where he could create conditions suitable to his purposes. The future proved his wisdom; for
                            Constantinople remained the seat of the Eastern Empire for more than a thousand years afte,r
                            Rome had fallen before the Goths. Constantine recognized Christianity as a lawful religion.
                            He has often been charged with being the originator of the system uniting church and state,
                            and lurid imaginations have declaimed with much turgidity of enunciation, endeavoring to
                            identify him with the anti-christ of the Apocalypse, or something dreadful of that sort. It
                            is a most unjust accusation, not at all supported by historical facts. After Constantine had
                            defeated Maxentius at the Milvian bridge, the Roman senate met him in procession and
                            conferred the dignity of Pontifex Maximus, i. e. chief-priest, upon him. Nor was he the
                            first in whose person supreme political and religious power was united. We find all through
                            Roman kistory the closest possible attachment of ecclesiastical and civil maiters. Romulus
                            was priest as well as king, and so were all his successors. Under the republic thep^estly
                            offices were sought for and obtained by politicians in the same manner as other offices. The
                            senate decreed the erection of the temples, provided for their maintenance, and paid the
                            salaries of the priests. When Hannibal was threatening Rome, the senate ordered four persons
                            to be buried alive to appease the angry gods ! ^Constantine was head of the church, not by
                            usurpation, but by time honored law and custom ; he was the heir of a system thai had been
                            growing for tea centuries�not the inventor of it ; and being a patriot and a man of much
                            common sense, he used the great power placed in his hands by circumstances, or if you
                            please, by Providence, to the best of his ability for the good of his people. He was little
                            concerned what form religion assumed, but he insisted upon order in the state. . He had
                            perceived that the worship of the gods had lost its hold upon the people #t&gt; a large
                            degree, especially among the educated classes. Cato the 8toic had said long ago that one
                            augur could not meet another in the street without laughing. He had also perceived that
                            Christianity was a power of too much magnitude to be suppressed; for in spite of three
                            centuries of persecution it had steadily grown in influence and importance. When he
                            therefore recognized it as the state religion, he did so as a statesman and for political
                            reasons�with its ethics and doctrines he was in no wise concerned. Julian, his successor,
                            attempted to re-establish paganism, but failed ignominiously; thus again the soundness of
                            Constantine's judgment was demonstrated. In answer to the accusation that he himself was not
                            a Christian, it may be said that he did not profess to be one.<pb n="132" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> All
                            that is known about it is tint he was baptized on his death-bed, which may have been an
                            incident somewhat analagous to what took place in our time. When Ulysses 8. Grant lay
                            unconscious in one of the crises that preceded his final dissolution, his friend, the Rev.
                            Dr. Newman baptized him with water. When told afterward of what had been done, he is said to
                            have remarked: "O, well! its all right; I have thought of this thing before. " The
                            diflTereu.ee between Grant and Consiantine is the difference between the 4th and 19th
                            centuries. Both were great men ; both did the work of their day and time with energy and
                            devotion. Christianity and civilization are under great obligations to them ; yet neither of
                            them cared for the form of religion, and neither the first Christian emperor, nor the great
                            American general, were Christians according to the high standard of the New Testament. But

                            while the balmy warmth of mid-day sunshine made it seem that summer was giving autumn a
                            place with reluctance, and lingering regret. The country through which we rode was rich with
                            beautiful orchards, where the trees fairly bent beneath their burden of fruit; these were
                            succeeded by fields where the story of a plentiful harvest was told by heaps of yellow corn
                            and golden pumpkins. Even the golden rod and frost flower made the roadside gay, while the
                            woods were gorgeous with every hue that can charm the eye and captivate the artistic soul.
                            At length we came to our destination and " I knew by the smoke that so gracefully curled
                            Above the green elms that a village was near And I said if there's peace to be found in the
                            world, The heart that is humble may look for it here." And we were in Shaker Village, there
                            was a feeling of peace and rest in the very air We went to the Second Family and were
                            received with such a genuine welcome that I felt like one come home after long years of
                            wandering. We were subsequently shown into the neatest of neat rooms to await our dinner
                            which they told us would be prepared very soon. Sister Nancy who came to show us to the
                            dining room in simple hospitality made us kindly welcome. I cannot give the bill of fare�
                            suffice it to say, the viands were abundant and appetizing and we did the good things before
                            us ample justice. After dinner the Eldresses came to show us around the buildings where
                            everything was in perfect order. We entered one room where some young sisters kindly sang
                            for us while one of them played the cabinet organ. At my request they also very kindly sang'
                            me an old fashio .ed melody which made the years so melt away, that I could almost fancy
                            myself again a Shaker sister like themselves crowned with the snowy cap and wearing the
                            quaint kerchief. They then conducted us out through the garden where although most of the
                            produce had been already harvested there was much left to admire. There were barberries
                            growing in abundance the largest I had ever seen some of which they gave us. I have n^jne
                            yet the fruit still being red and perfect. Returning again to the office which was our
                            starting point we parted from them with a kind farewell and a cordial invitation to visit
                            them again. The entire interview could not have lasted two hours yet as long as memory shall
                            keep its place in my heart I shall remember the noble Eldress and her gentle companion
                            Sister 11. yea and love them too. When we started homeward I felt I was leaving dear
                            friends. I could not but feel that theirs was a peace which the world could neither give nor
                            take away. We left the dear sisters with a blessing and a kind good night.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="C., A. P." TEIform="persName"/>A.P.

                                morality, of science or of religion, we as Christian Believers have an imperative duty
                                before God and man, which can never be compassed by any spirit of less magnitude than
                                that of the revelation of God's love. In the Babel influences that are so thoroughly
                                operative in the world of today, the voices of the scientifically religious and the
                                religiously scientific are heard on every hand, and those who would willingly work are
                                often paralyzed through fear of an uncertainty. In the effort that some make to reach
                                the kingdom of God by passing along by the side of the broad way, every device is sought
                                out that shall contribute one ray of support to their fallacious hope, while the simple
                                life of the cross of Christ and the practical righteousness which that life brings is
                                iguorautly or carelessly thrown aside. That we live in a wonderful age is not to be
                                denied and that there may be some lessons eminently worthy for us to learn, cannot be
                                denied. The history of the world in its every department where nature is manifested, is
                                treasured as of inestimable value for the perusal of the present generation. It may well
                                be called the storehouse of what has transpired during the creation of God, and it may
                                at the same time enlarge the mind of man with much earthly wisdom. Its place is ass
                                legitimately arranged in the economy of God's plan as are the gifts of greater value.
                                The whole of creation is a beautiful miracle of law and order which has never been
                                solved. It is one of the "great things, past h'ud'ng out. " But the lessons of
                                self-sacrifice, of love and of righteousness should be garnered with equally as much
                                interest and preserved for present and future benefit with the same assiduous care. If
                                the good words that have been spoken are never lost, then the good deeds may be, without
                                doubt, quite as imperishable, and we have urgent need to harvest into well disciplined
                                minds, all that comes within our circle of spiritual action. As we learn that God is the
                                same yesterday, today and forever, so is all that is of God. The manifestations of words
                                or deeds of three thousand years ago, if they were the outgrowth of that wisdom which
                                comes from above and tend to "ways of pleasantness and to paths of peace," they can
                                never grow old. I low much we need their influence. In securing these treasures we
                                secure imperishable riches and the confusion of tongues, so like the mist of the morning
                                soon vanishes, and the highway to the kingdom of God becomes as plainly and as clearly
                                set forth in the souls of the righteous as ^h,Q glory of the sun at THE JUNE,<pb n="137" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> noonday. Having this knowledge of the kingdom, we ask, Why? Why should
                                any one who has left the "house of bondage " ever return to Egypt to acquire knowledge (
                                ?) in righteousness ? Why neglect the treasures of God at our own threshold, to gather
                                those on the shore of the dead sea? Herein is the mystery. The listening to the
                                multitude of discordant voices that so strongly arise in favor of their own respective,
                                selfish whims or anti-religious traditions, is equally as mysterious. Like the plague
                                frogs that fell upon the homes of the Egyptians, these conditions may, for a season, not
                                only prove] quite annoying but may to our great sorrow work a permanent injury. Let us
                                have the confidence of the Apostle who accepted into his soul God's truth and light, and
                                through this made his life one of practical righteousness. A confidence that shall
                                inspire all who are engaged in the same divine work, to declare, "We know we are of
                                God."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary. </head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Eating too much" TEIform="index"/> EATING TOO MUCH.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> The average farmer and farm laborer are chargeable with two failings, which
                                        injure health and shorten life, both heir-looms of the highly barbarous feudal
                                        ages just referred to. They eat too much and bathe too little. Some of the food
                                        is objectionable as to the quality, but the quality is less harmful than the
                                        quantity. The farmer's outdoor life gives him a vigorous appetite, and not
                                        enough re. straint is exercised against an excess. His table drinks, too (which
                                        may be classed as part of his food,) are also objectionable, being very
                                        generally strong tea and coffee. The drink failing is particularly prevalent
                                        among the females. When a person regards strong tea or coffee as an absolute
                                        necessity for a meal, it is, in itself, a bad sign. An appetite for an unhealthy
                                        stimulus is fastened on the stomach, and the path to disease is short and easy.
                                        Nature's simplicity is gone, and in its place are nervousness, changing moods,
                                        and a tendency to enjoy other stimulants, such as the most highly seasoned foods
                                        and condiments, and, not infrequently, intoxicating drinks. Children are brought
                                        up to tea and coffee, and the whole range of condiments, along with pie and cake
                                        to any extent, and their tender stomachs are disorganized at an early age. Then
                                        when a dangerous disease sets in�dyspepsia, heart-burn, frequent colic,
                                        flatulency, nausea, etc., the child is " weakly, " unable to work, and an early
                                        death is regarded as "an inscrutable dispensation of an all-wise Providence. "
                                        There are thousands today half broken-down, prematurely old, complaining that
                                        "food does them no good, " or that it " distresses them," and who are running
                                        after the doctor, or swallowing quack medicines, who could yet be cured by a
                                        proper system of diet. Some, it is true, are too far gone, and yet hardly one in

                                ways of right, and crowned, at their goals, with the prerogatives of power, can make us
                                really noble and blessed. Truth, good, and beauty are the divine philters, given by the
                                infinite Lover to souls masquerading here in the flesh, to make them love Him. The

                                which serve as symbols to convey to our intelligence and affection communications of
                                power, wisdom, and love? from the infinite One. All that appears to sense is the speech
                                of God ; all that is, to spirit, is the meaning of that speech. But to earn by toil, to
                                receive by grace any valuable boon, it is a preliminary necessity that we become
                                personally conscious of our want of it. As soon as we begin to feel sharply our defects,
                                and covet the possible supply, the path of progressive attainment opens before us, and
                                our energies are strong to their appointed tasks. A story is told of an Eastern king who
                                had a lovely daughter, idolized by him, but blind from her birth. She had grown up to
                                maidenhood, and been kept sedulously ignorant of her great misfortune. One day, an old
                                sage came to the court, who promised the king that he would give his child her sight.
                                But he declared it to be indispensable that she should first become conscious of her
                                blindness, that she might intelligently co-operate in the needful process. The king
                                sought to prepare her. "My child" he said, "you know that your feet are to walk with ;
                                your hands to touch with ; your ears 'o hear with ; your nose to smell with ; your
                                tongue to taste with ; but others can also see, while you are blind." "Blind, father,"
                                she a.ked, in wonder; "what is that?" "My child, " he added, " what do you think your
                                eyes were made for?" "Oh," she replied, " when my heart is full, the tears always come
                                into my eyes ; and that I suppose is what they are for." With the tenderest painstaking,
                                the king and the sage succeeded in awakening in her the consciousness of her defect; and
                                at length, to her unspeakable astonishment and delight, vision was given her. This
                                principle holds true for all the multitudes of the world. While the vain, the prond, the
                                insensible, impoverished and blinded by their incompetent self-sufficiency, remain
                                unblessed, the modest seekers, and suppliants, who clearly feel their own deficiencies,
                                are enriched, more and more, with the choicest blessings of heaven. The devout comrade
                                of nature, and lover of men, whose heart and imagination have been touched by a mystic
                                feeling of the Infinite, hungers and thirsts after God, weeps in solitude over his inner
                                poverty and loneliness, seeks for God through long years of darkness and sorrow, and
                                finally, reaches that experience of the divine fellowship, whose peace is deeper than
                                plummet of thought ever sounded, whose bliss is higher than hint of language can reach.
                                This condition opens to us all the heights and depths of immensity and eternity. It is
                                the sole key to those transcendent marvels of experience, of which such strange hints
                                glimpse out at us, in the writings of the Mystics. For the human soul is a centre of
                                being which opens, outwardly, into the illimitableness of the material creation, and
                                inwardly, into the spiritual boundlessness of God. But, to become what we are meant to
                                be, to grasp the noblest possibilities of our state and lot, and make them real, in
                                living fruition, we must emancipate our spiritual faculties from every enslavement of
                                hatred, every constriction of dead habit, every fetter of fear and live in this universe
                                of God, as fresh observers and worshipers.<pb n="139" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> The h'rst lesson to be
                                learned, in reaching this conclusion, is docility. A vital and watchful docility is the
                                one virtue for every pupil in the school of life, preliminary to all the other virtues.
                                It is the highroad of advancement towards every'perfection. The difficulty of acquiring
                                and keeping this spirit, the precious fruits it yields, and the fatal penalties of its
                                failure, constitute a lesson, in its whole extent not one man out of a million
                                appreciates. How many painters, singers, preachers, writers, there are, whose
                                productions at fifty or sixty, are no better than they were at thirty or forty.. It
                                cannot be that they had so .early reached perfection. And how many gifted, ambitious
                                persons there are, whose one fatal fault is, unwillingness to take what they feel to be
                                the humiliating attitude of docility before others, and learn from them what they need.
                                There is a story among the Hebraic traditions�a little ethical apologue� about one
                                Peter, a poor ignorant teamster, who, dissatisfied with his hard life of drudgery,
                                prayed that he might be allowed the comfort of a walk in Paradise. An angel appeared,
                                and offered to grant his wish, if he would promise to study with docility whatever he
                                saw there, and to utter no criticism or censure ! Accepting the terms, he joyfully
                                accompanied his guide. The first thing he noticed was that the houses of the inhabitants
                                were made of transparent gems. "Why," ho exclaimed, "this is a great defect; there can
                                be no privacy ; you are all exposed to public gaze," The angel, with a slight frown and
                                a warning finger, replied, "They who are free from sin and guile, need no concealment.
                                The glory of God is rather in exhibiting', than in hiding.

Among the many parables which Jesus spoke to the multitudes who thronged to hear
                                his beautiful sermons, is the following :�A certain man had two sons, the younger of
                                whom one day asked his father to divide his property and give to him his share, as he
                                wished to travel. The father complied with his request, though with many misgivings, and
                                the son departed with brilliant prospects in view. While his money lasted, he was
                                surrounded with friends, but being of an extravagant nature, his property was soon gone
                                and with it these new acquaintances. Just at this time, a terrible famine arose in the
                                land, and being left entirely friendless, he had no means of support. Hungry, weary,
                                forsaken, the poor outcast reviewed his imprudent course, and though he knew his present
                                condition was the consequence of a false step, he was still too proud to return and ask
                                forgiveness. He determined to find a situation, and work for a living; but he was
                                thwarted in this plan, for like many others equally destitute, he failed to find an
                                opening into business. What should he do? At last, he applied to one of the citizens
                                there, but was coolly told he had servants sufficient. On after thought, however, he
                                said, "You may go into my fields and care for the swine I am raising. " The young man
                                thought it all over. Brought up in luxury, every want supplied by the kindness of a fond
                                father, must he now come to this? In the strength and pride of young manhood, must he
                                stoop to this menial service ? It was either accept or perish, and almost desperate, he
                                agreed to serve the man. Slowly and sadly he went into the fields, almost stricken with
                                remorse and disgrace. He thought longingly of the home of his childhood, of the
                                blessings which he had<pb n="140" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/>shared within its sacred precincts, and then
                                he wondered if his father would recognize him, should he see him in this miserable con
                                �dition. How he had blighted the hopes o Ms kind parent, and what a poor return he had
                                made for the tenderness which hac guarded his childhood and the paternal love which had
                                blessed his youth ! What a terri ble mistake he had made ! But could he not now atone
                                for the sin ? Thoroughly rep?nf ant and humble, he wept bitterly, for it was not without
                                a struggle, that the wanderer decided to return to his father, confess his transgression
                                and pray to be torgiven. With lightened steps he took his homeward journey, and it was
                                with a grateful heart that he came in sight of the home he had deserted but a few short
                                weeks before, yet how much had transpired in that time ! His father's love had not
                                diminished during the absence of his son, but he had worried and prayed and suffered
                                over his wayward boy. He had been longing for his return for many days, and the watchful
                                eye of the good old man saw the prodigal when he was still far from the house. Hastily
                                catching up his hat, he hurried out, and in a few moments, father and son were again
                                united. How sweet to the paternal ear was the humble confession of his child. His soul
                                warmed with compassion, and upon reaching home, he clothed him with the best his house
                                afforded. His joy knew no bounds. His son had returned, and he intended to make him feel
                                that he was still in his father's blessing. The servants were commanded to spread a
                                sumptuous feast. "Spare no pains to make the best, " the father said, and in a few hours
                                the guests were seated to a meal which would have suited even an epicure; then imagine
                                how luscious to the eyes of the famished boy ! Music, dancing and every other possible
                                enjoyment were included, and arrangements were made for a very pleasant entertainment.
                                The elder son, who had been away during the day, heard the music before he reached the
                                house, and he called one of the servants and asked what was going on. On being told of
                                the return of his brother, he was angry and refused to join the merrymakers. The father
                                then came out and entreated him to unite in the feast; but he said, "I have served you
                                all these years unmurmuringly ; I have never willfully displeased you, and yet, with all
                                my faithfulness, you never provided an entertainment for my friends, and never rewarded
                                me with a tangible proof of your affection. But when my brother returns, he who has
                                spent so much of your property and disgraced your name, you have displayed the best to
                                welcome him. I consider it very unjust that you should treat him so much better than me.
                                " How Christ-like the gentle reproof of the father! " My boy has wandered and returned,
                                was dead and is alive again, lost and is now found ! Is not this sufficient cause for
                                great rejoicing? Ah, my son, learn to subdue the jealousy of the heart, and remember '
                                There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.'" </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, Jessie" TEIform="persName"/>Jessie Evans.

Be brief. This is the age of telegraphs and stenography. 2 Be pointed. Don't
                                    write all round a subject without hitting it. 3. State facts, but don't stop to
                                    moralize. It's drowsy business. Let the reader do his own dreaming. 4. Eschew
                                    prefaces. Plunge at once into your subject, like a swimmer in cold water. 5. If you
                                    have written a sentence that you think particularly fine, draw your pen through it.
                                    A pet child is always the worst in the family. 6. Condense. Make sure that you
                                    really have an idea, and then record it in the shortest possible terms. We want
                                    thoughts in their quintessence. 7. When your article is complete, strike out
                                    nine-tenths of the adjectives. The English is a strong language, but won't bear too
                                    much "reducing." 8. Avoid all high-flown language. The plainest Anglo-Saxon words
                                    are the best. Never use stilts when kegs will do as well. 9. Make your sentences
                                    short. Every period is a mile stone, at which the reader may halt, and rest himself.
                                    10. Write legibly. Don't let your manu script look like the tracks of a spider hal:
                                    drowned in ink. We shan't mistake any one for a genius, though he writes as crab
                                    bedly as Napoleon. 11. Always have a heading for your arti cles; and if you wish to
                                    rebuke a vice, or an error, mention its name, and don't whip all around a stump,
                                    without bringing your whip-lash directly upon the object of your article.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Reminiscences" TEIform="index"/> REMINISCENCES.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Shepard, Harriet" TEIform="persName"/>HARRIET SHEPARD.</byline><p TEIform="p"> As the wounded oyster lines his shell with pearl, so would I by gentle affection make the

                            cease to grow ; then why do wepine at the inevitable ills of life, or crave ompassion when
                            we suffer? It has been said, Dews of night are diamonds at morn, so the ears we weep hear
                            ni.-iy be pearls in heaven; nd we have little cause to mourn over the wreck of hopes, when
                            it opens the heart to a righter sunshine, whose warm light melts its ee to running streams,

                            nlightened the world by their brilliant acquirements, had embarrassments to overcome,
                            bstacles and perplexities to remove and only as they regulated their efforts by intellectual
                            strength did they gain knowledge virtue or power. One of our ancestral poets had for his
                            proverb "The resolute fortune favors. " An American divine says, " In great and good
                            pursuits, it is honorable, it is right, to use that kind of omnipotence which says I will
                            and the work is done. " Poverty is truly the cradle of genius, man obtains no excellence
                            without labor. As has been said of the New York Institute for the Blind, may it be said of
                            other Christian Institutions; that it seems to be a paradise, where purity dwells; peace and
                            content rule all hearts, and love is their guardian angel. North Union.
