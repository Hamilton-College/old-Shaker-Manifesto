Lebanon, July 1888" TEIform="index"/>Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., July, 1888.</dateline><p TEIform="p">Elsie York and Jessie Evans. Beloved Gospel Sisters :�Your joint letter of the 17th. ult.
                            came as a welcome memento of friendship from my dear Gospel friends in Canterbury. I may as
                            well acknowledge that I have a latent desire to visit Canterbury once more, before I go
                            hence. I want to come as a simple visitor, just to exchange kind greetings and gather union
                            as a precious treasure to carry with me into the Church in the Spirit world. In all the
                            visits�excepting one to Watervliet when quite a young Believer�that I have ever made to any
                            Society heretofore, it has been as a preacher, a theologian, an expounder of doctrine to the
                            world, in public meetings &amp;c. I was much burdened, and brought much burden to
                            others. That phase has passed, for better or for worse. I acted my part. Now, I am putting
                            off ihe harness, and coming down gradually� "gracefully," may be�to my individual selfhood.
                            Like a tree-roosting turkey, at the close of the day, looking upwards, stretching its neck
                            and measuring the distant height, until confidence is gained that it can accomplish the
                            upward flight to its resting place, where neither "'the little foxes" nor the big foxes can
                            reach it�so am I looking upwards, thinking and fluttering my spirit wings, awaiting the
                            decisive moment to rise from earth and all its scenes, to my home in the spirit world. I do
                            not run as uncertain nor go beating the air with my spirit wings aimlessly, but I feel as
                            sweet an assurance of being met by kind, loving friends in the world to come, as I do that I
                            shall be thus met when I make my last earthly visit to Canterbury. I also realize that, in
                            both cases, I shall be an object of charity, dependent upon kind friends who feel that it is
                            more blessed to give than it is to receive and that the less, the recipient, is of the
                            "better blessed." To begin with, I am deaf! Do you know what that implies, what it means to
                            be in meeting and see that your Brethren and Sisters are speaking and not hear what they
                            say? To be hungry, siltiug at a table loaded with good things, of which all but yourself are
                            freely partaking, and enjoying the social union from which you are shut out? In a word, I am
                            dying of simple old age. Yet I am joying too, rejoicing in the race I have run. Was not that
                            what I was born for, to grow old and go to my rest in other spheres? And to go to my work in
                            the world that is above this world, as manhood and<pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> womanhood are above
                            childhood? "1 have fought the good fight"�the battle of life, and accept the result
                            cheerfully, joyfully and thankfully. Truly, have not "the lines fallen to me in pleasant
                            places," as compared with thousands, yea, millions of my fellow human beings, who bad as
                            much right to life, and to life as a blessing, as I had? So I am glad of all the days I have
                            lived upon earth, and like a ripe apple, am ready and willing to drop into the hands of the
                            Orchardist. Upon reading this effusion, you will exclaim "Well! sure enough, Elder Frederic
                            has become a querulous old man, but still, T wish he would come, for we should like to see
                            him as a humanitarian curiosity." Why not? All phases of liumau life are of interest to the
                            Christian scientist and philosopher�the Believer. Jesus noticed natural children, as he did
                            the lilies, and he loved them for their primitive though negative innocence. Vv hy should
                            not Second Appearing Disciples be interested in the second childhood of those who have spent
                            their lives in the Resurrection Order of which Jesus and his disciples could only prophesy.
                            They have been working out a salvation that gives them a positive innocpnce of which the
                            innocence of childhood is a beautiful type or symbol. Having suffered in the flesh, by
                            ceasiug from sin, they are raised in thp likeness of Him who said, "1 am the resurrection."
                            "Other sheep have I also that are not of this fold," Jesus said; may it not be so at the
                            present time? Are not the fields white unto the harvest? The last of the seven vials has
                            been "poured out into the air, causing voices, lightnings, thunderings and earthquakes, so
                            great and mighty that the like has never occurred before since men were upon the earth." The
                            American Revolution was but the beginning of those earthquakes now convulsing the nations.
                            The lower strata of humanity�the great mass�who have been governed by fear and pressed down
                            by the despotic monarchies and aristocracies and by the capitalists and p"iesthoods, are
                            being educated, beginning to think and to reason, causing a general upheaval. Capital and
                            labor are contending for their "rights," but do not know what they are ! They will learn by
                            and by. Between the axiom, "The king can do no wrong" and "the sovereign people" possessing
                            "inalienable rights," there is a great gulf that is being bridged by education. The people
                            are cursing their gods and priests and the governments which "bear rule by their means" and
                            are looking upwards, whence the light proceeds that is enlightening the earth. At present,
                            all is war; anon, it will be peace. Sister Elsie speaks of "articles" I have written, and
                            mentions " Cruelty to Birds." That has been much copied. When I wrote it, "The Sun"
                            published it in New York ; then it appeared in the Albany, Hudson, Pittsfield and Boston
                            papers. Being in New York a week or two since, 1 did not see the "dead birds" on a single
                            person. I suppose that article happened to come just as the fashion was changing, Sister
                            Jessie sends love and blessing ; that it is appreciated, she may rest assured. I shall be
                            pleased to see and wish I could hear, all the company of whom she speaks. It will not be my
                            fault if I do not make at least "the informal call" she suggests. With kindest love of our
                            order to yourselves and as far as it will go before it is all spent, Your Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F. W." TEIform="persName"/>F. W.

                            The Grospel is a healing power to soul and body. It holds the Angel World iu harmony. We
                            cast our eye towards that abyss where people are wallowing in selfish indulgences, and we
                            sec the suffering darkness aud ignorauce into which it plunges them, tuid our souls cry out,
                            O Lord how long shall die inbred foe triumph. We realize that our escape even iu a degree is
                            the free gift of the Father and Mother, to whom all souls are alike precious. Hence the
                            mighty responsibility we are under to impart this boon of salvation to contrite souls around
                            us. Not by conforming to the groveling passions of men, but by maintaining the superior
                            life. The natural order is rudimental, its subjects are undeveloped spiritually. The
                            Heavenly is more refined and the souls of all aspire towards the elements of purity. We must
                            enter by the door. None are too great to be humbled. Man, unregenerated, can on ly see in
                            his own sphere. He cannot penetrate the realms beyond where Jesus aud all the purified
                            dwell. Neither can spirits iu eternity comprehend the superior life only as they travel to
                            it. Spiritualists of our day, whom we respect, who talk of blending flesh and spirit, have
                            not dissolved the tie that exposes them to passion. The manifestations of those spirits with
                            whom they come in rapport are in character similar. Hence false Christs aud false spirits
                            assuming to be angels of light. "By their fruits ye shall know them." Jesus loves the souls
                            of all mankind, but his spirit is out of sight of the proud, the vicious and vain. There is
                            a wide separation which must be overcome to reach that bliss that flows from a pure life.
                            The broad foundation of Christian brotherhood is based upon equality, and we cannot enter
                            with our selfish passions and possessions, our partialities and evil habits. Our spirits
                            cannot ascend thus encumbered. Watervliet, N.

                            Strive for the wealth that's not of earth, Secure a fame of holy worth. Profess but little,

                            is, that Jesus, by his birth of Mary, was the beginning of the New Creation�the subject of
                            Isaiah's prophecy, "I create New Heavens, and a New Earth." Isa. lxv ; 17. Also the prophecy
                            of Jeremiah, "The Lord hath created a new thing in the earth ; a woman shall compass a man."
                            Jer. xxxi; 22. " And, He who sat upon the throne said," ' Behold I make all things new.'
                            Rev. xxi., 5. But, this is evidently a mistaken understanding of the subject, for the
                            following reasons. Jesus said "Except a man be born again, he cannot be my disciple." Jno.
                            iii., 3. This is equivalent to saying / have been born again. But, that this was not a
                            material, but a spiritual birth, is manifest from the instructions of Jesus to Nicodemus, "
                            Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How
                            can a man be born when lie is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and
                            be born?" Jesus answered, "Except a man be born of * * the spirit he cannot enter into the
                            Kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the
                            spirit is spirit. The wind b^oweth where it listeth, and thou hearest tha sound thereof, but
                            canst not tell whence it ccmeth, nor whither it goeth, so is every one that is born of the
                            spirit." John, iii. It is thus manifest that this birth into the Kingdom of God,�the Christ
                            Kiugdom, of which Christ is its heavenly Lord, is not to be entered except by a spiritual
                            birth, and, it was this birth of the spirit which made Jesus its Lord, and the first born of
                            this Kingdom� this New Creation.�The Jesus unto whom Mary gave birth was flesh and blood.
                            This flesh and blood said the Apostle Paul, "Cannot inherit the Kingdom of God." 1 Cor.,
                            xv., 50. Jesus Christ is called, "The first born of every creature." This could not be true
                            of Jesus, when simply born<pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> of Mary ; for millions had been born of woman
                            as was Jesus, before Mary gave birth to him. But, some have argued, " This had reference to
                            the way he was begotten." Well, in reference to this, Jesus was called " The first begotten
                            of the dead." Rev. i.. 5. This certainly could not justly apply to the begetting of the
                            physical body of Jesus, because, be could not have been physically dead before he began to
                            live physically ! Nor could it apply to the physical body of Jesus at all, since that body
                            of Jesus, which was born of Mary died nearly two thousand years ago. If Jesus, by his birth
                            of Mary was the beginning of the New Creation, then he constituted all there is of the New
                            Creation, not only its "first born" but its only born ; for, the world has no record of auy
                            similar or annlogous births to that as recorded of Jesus, from the day of his birth unto the
                            present time. It is, therefore, evident, that Jesus had to be born again of the spirit, in
                            order to become the Christ, for, it is Christ that is the Lord of the "New Creation." And, "
                            If aay man be in Christ, he is a new Creature" of the New Creation.�Thus the new birth is a
                            birth of the spirit into a new and heavenly life ; and, this birth Mary did not give to
                            Jesus ; he received this, by his baptism of the heavenly dove. Into this Christ spirit many
                            may be born, and become New Creatures in the Kingdom of God ; but it would not be
                            practicable to be born into Jesus�the Jesus which was simply born of Mary. But, we are told,
                            that, " If Jesus erred any time after his birth of Mary the Second Man and the New Creation
                            would have fallen also." This conclusion is simply from the false basis, as before shown,
                            calling Jesus, before he was born again of the spirit, "The first born of the New Creation."
                            "The new Man." "The Lord from Heaven." "The Quickening Spirit." But, all these appellations
                            and characters refer to Jesus, the Christ. That is, to Jesus, after he became baptized with
                            the Christ spirit, and was born agaia, of the spirit. Again we are told, by some professed
                            Christians "There is not the slightest hope of the successful imitation as such a life as
                            Jesus' in the spirit, by such fleshlings as ourselves. We are carnal; he is spiritual." But,
                            here is the hope, promise, and prospect, of better things, "If any man be in Christ, he is a
                            New Creature ; behold, old things are done away and all things are become new." Thus,
                            becoming New Creatures, the members of Christ's Kingdom are no longer " Carnal fleshlings."
                            And to the members of Christ's Kingdom Jesus said, " If ye abide in me, and my words abide
                            in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, in my name, and it shall be given you." And, to
                            such souls Jesus further said, "It is my Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom."
                            And, yet agaio, "The Kingdom of Heaven is within, (or among) you." Thus it is manifest, 1.
                            It is possible to be in Christ, and become New Creatures. 2. It is possible for " Christ" to
                            be in us, " the hope of glory." 3. That a Creature of this New Creation is not a beiug yet
                            in the corrupt nature of the fleshly man, but, a soul born of the spirit, and by this
                            baptism, become a son or daughter of God. And, all such constitute the Children of the
                                New<pb n="30" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> Creation, the subjects and inheritors of the Kingdom of Christ.
                            Of Jesus, the Apostle Paul said, "Wherefore, in all things it behooved him to be made like
                            unto his brethren." And, u He took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
                            Abraham." This constituted Jesus, a man of the world ; and, it was iu this capacity only
                            that Jesus, as such, could be tempted. And, that he was thus constituted, we have the
                            declaration of his own mouth, thus. " Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world." What
                            world? Not the nations of the earth ; nay, in no wise! But the worldly nature of man iu
                            himself. And, He could not overcome in himself that which he did not possess ! Thus we have
                            the encouraging assurance that we, too, can overcome the world, as Jesus overcame, and set
                            us the example, and become what St. John voiced, thus ; "Behold now are we the sons of God ;
                            and, it doth not appear what we shall (arrive to) be, but, we know, that when he (Christ)
                            shall appear we shall be like him." 1 John, iii., 2. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Follow me" TEIform="index"/>FOLLOW ME.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilson, Mary L."

                                behalf of the needy human family, and have had a personal acquaintance with a number of
                                most estimable men and women both, who at some time in their lives were members of your
                                society Prior to my coming to California, about twenty two years ago, 1 met some of your
                                New Lebanon family, and somehow have the impression that you were one of the number.
                                But, be that as it may, I was deeply interested in your society, and particularly
                                because its founder was a woman ; and earnestly wished for an opportunity to visit
                                    your<pb n="31" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> place and become better acquainted with the practical
                                application of its principles, which I understood somewhat. But the opportunity never
                                came, and I drifted off thousands of miles away from any organized body of your people.
                                But in all these years, T have never relinquished the hope entertained of visiting your
                                family some day, and the intimate acquaintance of one of your family at Watervliet has
                                perhaps tended to keep alive that early desire. She was then known as Cornelia Rogers,
                                now Mrs. Powers, a widow, and her visit to my home at this time is the immediate cause
                                of my sending you this letter. We have been, for some days, engaged in earnest
                                conversation regarding your people, and the beautiful work of love and charity which you
                                have been doing, in your own quiet way ; and it has led me to address this appeal to you
                                to make an effort to establish one of your families on the Pacific coast; and why not in
                                California? I have been, since a mere child, a school-girl in my teens, working for the
                                betterment of society, for the emancipation of women, for the redemption of mankind from
                                the fruits of sin, and the servitude and degradation resulting from false teachings,
                                ignorance and superstition. During all this struggle, I have ever felt that your order,
                                and similar associative efforts, have been potent factors in accomplishing much of the
                                results of liberalism which have come to the world the past thirty years. And nowT I
                                think your work should take a wider range, and the influence for good which I know has
                                radiated from the several families you have founded in the Atlantic states, should be
                                exerted in this new and prolific field of the Pacific. So forcibly am I impressed with
                                this idea, that I would even undertake a journey to New Lebanon to confer with the
                                Ministry upon the proposition, if desired ; or�what is better still�I would take great
                                pleasure in extending most heartily to you and as many of your people as you might send
                                out here to California, my humble hospitality, and such knowledge as I have of this
                                wonderful state and its unparalleled resources should be cheerfully imparted to you. I
                                will be very glad to hear from you in regard to this matter, and to know if my
                                impressions meet with any response from you. There is a vast field in California for
                                just such kind of work as your self-sacrificing people can do ; particularly amongst the
                                young; and, as there is not now, to my knowledge�and 1 doubt if there ever has been�one
                                of your order west of the Rocky Mountains, it would be a great satisfaction if I should
                                be one of the humble instruments to induce you to establish a family on this coast. You
                                will confer a favor upon me by sending me a copy of the Life or history of Mother Ann,
                                and I will remit the amount for the same, when I write again. Hoping to hear from you
                                soon, I am, very truly yours,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Gordon, Laura de Force" TEIform="persName"/>Laura de Force Gordon.</byline></div3><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Reply" TEIform="index"/>REPLY.</head><dateline TEIform="dateline"><index level1="New York, Mt.

                                ult. is at hand. We are very much pleased with the tone of your letter ; it touches a
                                chord in our hearts that vibrates in harmony with our own enthusiastic de1888.<pb n="32" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> sires, that the truths revealed in our Society may at no distant day
                                extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. "For this Gospel must be preached in all
                                the world for a witness unto all nations, then shall the end come." The end of what? Of
                                wars, civil, political and religious, of social strifes and contentions ; of pestilence
                                and famine ; of inequality and monopoly ; of poverty and crime ; of intemperance and
                                sensuality ; of slavery and generation. It has come to us ; and we rejoice with an
                                exceeding great joy, that "the lines have fallen to us in such pleasant places." While
                                we recognize a great army of truth-loving souls, like yourself, who are working so
                                persistently for the advancement of the race, advocating peace principles, temperance,
                                equality, women's rights &amp;c, &amp;c, we are not without hope that eventually
                                a new earthly order will arise, wherein use and not abuse of the procreative faculties
                                in man and woman will be observed, and wherein right makes might; even as now exists a
                                heavenly order of peace and righteousness, revealed and established by divine wisdom and
                                love. It needs the one to sustain the other ; and we confidently look to this class as
                                being forerunners of the all important work of redemption in which we are engaged. Are
                                we looking iu vain? Is our purblind vision obscured that hides the cloud fringed with
                                the silver lining? "Where there is no vision the people perish." Nay, our sight is clear
                                : The vision shows us wheels revolving in the right direction- �wheels within wheels�
                                all moving toward the One Great Center. A tangible proof of such advance is seen, when
                                in a comparatively new state like California, women are filling offices of trust,
                                becoming lawyers, doctors &amp;c, &amp;c. Woman is beginning to rise in the
                                dignity of her calling to assei t her Godgiven rights. And that right does not call her
                                from her owu sphere that she is destined to fill either, indeed, if she work
                                successfully, she must keep within it. The Maternal Spirit in Deity is "brooding upon
                                the face of the waters"� r, spiritual Mother. It is this beautiful spirit that calleth
                                aloud from the citadel of truth to the daughters of earth in tones of love and
                                tenderness ; angels catch the sound and reverberate it from hill-top to valley, and from
                                ocean to ocoau. As many sin-sick, sorrowful hearts have been made glad thereby, and
                                filled with her love to-day, so will many more rejoice iu the emancipation and liberty
                                she giveth from the terrible yoke of bondage to man's lust, and his power to oppress ;
                                as well as from her own corrupt nature, that makes her worse than a slave to his baser

                                cannot warrant the establishment of a Shaker Society in California, or in any other
                                place at present. We very much doubt of finding faith among the people, even in the
                                Golden State, to practically carry out in their every day lives the principles embodied
                                in the everlasting Gospel that we preach�the final test in the judgment to which all
                                souls must be brought either in time or eternity. In the meantime we bless you in your

                                it is an impracticable one : the<pb n="33" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> future must decide. If you could
                                so arrange as to place in the public libraries our books and pamphlets, and thus lay
                                before the people the great truths therein contained, we will agree to furnish a
                                sufficient amount. We herewith enclose a few slips for your own perusal ; and will send
                                as you request, the "Precepts of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders." It is a new edition

                                Elder F. W. Evans whom you address is now in his 81st. year and as you will see is still

                                Manifesto" to Henry S. Glubb attracted my attention. It gave the best and fullest
                                exposition of the Creed of Shakerism I have ever yet seen. After pondering over its
                                contents in my own mind, I thought that I had seen the name before, then I recollected
                                that in 1882 I had received a letter from you to be given to Mr. Holyoake when he
                                visited this country that he would pay your Community a personal visit; and that it
                                contained the information you knew of him in England. That letter was delivered
                                personally according to your request. Mr. Holyoake's time and business here was too
                                limited to visit any of the Shaker Communities though urged by me to do so. The means at
                                his command were not enough to fulfill his mission, which was to write a book on
                                "Emigration to the United States ;" it fell through for want of means. He is yet
                                laboring in the cause of Cooperation at the age of 70 years with all the zeal of a young
                                enthusiast, and his letters to the "Cooperator's News" are the most brilliant of any
                                that appear in that journal. He is gifted with a fund of descriptive perceptibility,
                                endowed by few men as a writer which always make his letters the most desirable of all
                                others in the News. A testimonial is being raised for him by friends and admirers in
                                England and America to place him beyond the reach of want when no longer enabled to earn
                                his bread by tongue or pen. The English people, as ever accord but scant justice to
                                their best and truest friends ; but the admirers of his consistent course amongst the
                                upper classes have giveu liberally to the fund. The Rev. William I. Potter of New
                                Bedford, Mass., is the American Treasurer. Mrs. Thompson has given $100, and some other
                                friends smaller donations. Fifty-four thousand copies of Mr. Holyoake's portrait were
                                struck off for the readers of the News some mouths ago. I secured two copies, one of
                                which I enclosed to you which I hope you have received, your name being remembered by me
                                on seeing it in the "Manifesto." Hoping I may soon hear from you again. Thanking you for

                                letter sooner. I am thankful for your appreciation of the correspondence in the November
                                number of the Manifesto ; I shall feel amply repaid if a little good has been done by
                                it. George Jacob Holyoake I never was personally acquainted with, further than as a
                                lecturer at the Branch Tottenham Court Road, John St., London. I was a member then of
                                the Branch, and I appreciated him, as well as other lecturers on socialism very highly,
                                being then an ardent admirer and advocate of the principles of socialism. George, when
                                in this country, lectured in the town of Holyoke, twenty miles from here, and I went to
                                hear him. | I was theu introduced, and had a pleasant interview with him. It was very
                                interesting to hear him tell how cooperation took its rise in England. After the wreck
                                of all our efforts at Community-building, cooperation is evidently all the practical
                                outcome of socialism; i. e., the phase of it up to 1845. Previous to my joining
                                Shakerism, I became i convert to the theosophy of J. P. Greaves as practiced at Ham
                                Common, in the neighborhood of Richmond, Surrey. Greaves affirmed above and beyond mere
                                physical socialism, because his views were higher and embraced more truth. If you are
                                not acquainted with its theory, I may, at some future time, give you au insight into it.
                                It touched somewhat elaborately on the question of spirit regeneration, as a prime
                                essential to give the socialist power to obtain a nature that would enable him to
                                practice his principles. It completely showed up the unfitness of Robert Owen's
                                philosophy to found a new state of society ; as far as mere theory went it was an
                                advance from Owen's basis but it was equally impracticable. Finding myself baffled in
                                all my efforts, my attention was next directed to the Shahers. I found in them all the
                                substance of what&gt;Owen and Greaves had put forth, and nothing was then left for me but
                                to close in with Shakerism and thus realize all the good I had a conception of; and I
                                can assure you, my friend, there has been no barren results in pursuing this end. I
                                united with this Society in the year 1845, and have not yet seen the moment I had cause
                                to regret doing so. I see no reason why all socialists may not finally arrive at the
                                same if they would ouly be true to their best light giveu iu that movement. I thank you
                                kindly for the portrait of G. J. Holyoake; he is a veteran, the most practical of all
                                socialists, and lias been more successful than Lloyd Jones, who died of a brokeu heart
                                caused by the failure of his plans of cooperat:on. It would be pleasing to us to hear
                                from you again at your convenience. You do not inform us if you are a socialist, yet I
                                should judge you to be friendly to the cause, although not of the modern stamp, which,
                                from repeated failure, and because the light of socialism is as yet only related to the
                                Animal Intellectual has become the hot-bed of all vain attempts to force a new state of
                                society into existence. The Shakers have stood because they deny self, the socialists
                                fail because they do not.

TEIform="persName"/>Sarah J. Burger.</byline><p TEIform="p">It has been said that the ''Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath." We read in
                            the Scriptures, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day thou
                            shalt rest." Not that any day is of itself holy, but that it is necessary to set apart a
                            portion of time for physical rest, and for the exercise of our religious feelings, in
                            devotion, prayer aud praise. Sabbath, from the Hebrew word Shabbath, literally means rest
                            from labor. The divine institution of the Jewish Sabbath was held sacred by the ancient
                            people ; they not only kept the seventh day holy, but they had numerous sabbatical seasons,
                            in which they were taught to fulfill their duty to God and man. Since the Christian era, the
                            day of rest is called the Lord's day, because it is held in commemoration of the
                            resurrection of Jesus. Sabbath and Sunday are used as synonymous terms, but are different in
                            meaning, the former denotes the institution, the latter is a name given by the Romans in
                            honor of the Sun which they worshiped on the first day of the week. No day is especially
                            holy only as our deeds make it so, it is therefore good to have a day especially
                            appropriated for spiritual culture, and for the exercise of all the better faculties of our
                            being. The mind thus withdrawn from temporal duties, which in a great degree claim our
                            attention, can now fully realize that we are immortal beings, and not destined to be wholly
                            absorbed in materiality. And as all have a right to choose their own day, and worship God
                            according to the dictates of their own consciences, no matter what the form may be, if there
                            is a reaching out in the soul after Divin^ ity, that feeling should be held sacred and
                            should command our highest respect. Truth, knowledge and spirituality, are unfolditig
                            humanity and leading them up to grander planes of thought and life. When mankind become so
                            progressed that they will devote all their powers for good to beneficent purposes, the earth
                            will be blest with a perpetual Sabbath ; God's kingdom shall bt; with men and righteousness
                            and peace will abide forever. Mt. Lebanon, N.

It hardly seems possible that twelve months have elapsed since
                            we were making so many good resolutions, and were so sure that the future would bear a
                            better record than the past. But today as we sit meditating at the close of the Old Year,
                            and as it were on the verge of the New, we realize either in joy or sorrow, how much success
                            has attended our efforts. Perhaps we have felt, at times, in days past that we have been
                            left alone, or without the special tender words of sympathy and encouragement, which
                            childish years demanded, and upon which we then so much depended. To-day as we look back we
                            can trace a gentle hand that was guiding and a watchful eye ever anxious to see which path
                            we would choose if left to our own strength. Or, if we have fallen among thieves did we not
                            find the "Good Samaritan," or did not the "Good Samaritan" find us ? and is this not a proof
                            that we were not entirely forsaken ? Let us gather all the lessons we can from our past
                            successes and failures, as a means of help and encouragement for another year, which we must
                            commence at ouce for " Time and tide wait for no man." We must begin now to write with care

                            is note-worthy difference in the application. Matthew records the exhortation, "He that hath
                            ears to hear, let him hear." Mark adds the admoni tion of the Savior. "Take heed what ye
                            hear." But in Luke, the what is1 changed to how, and we read, "Take heed how ye hear."
                            Bringing these three passages together, we have this as the law in regard to hearing. 1. God
                            having given us faculties to hear and to comprehend the truth, and having sent his
                            messengers as ministers, and we may add, his messenger as the Manifesto, to proclaim it. It
                            is the duty of every one to hear and read when they can. 2. As there are many false
                            teachers, and we may add many false heralds, we must be careful as to the kind of teaching
                            aud reading we seek. Every Believer will have to be on his guard or he will find himself
                            floating off with the tide of the world. It is not enough for him to attend only upon the
                            claims of the preaching and reading of the gospel, he must see to it that it is the true
                            gospel, and as it comes from God he must hear it in the right spirit; not receive the truth
                            into stony ground, or on a heart that is as hard as a beaten path or amid the briers and
                            thorns of worldly care, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the word. There is a great
                            deal said aud written about preaching, and is it not time that we should look at the other
                            side ? It is said that in many cities and towns that the number of church-goers is very
                            small, and that the non-church-goers excuse themselves by saying that the church services do
                            not interest them. But this excuse is of no account. Christ told his disciples to go into
                            all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Paul writes, "By the foolishness of
                            preaching" (that is by what seems foolishness to the carnal world,) "�to save them that
                            believe." Again he says, "Faith cometh by hearing," and "without faith it is impossible to
                            please God." We may learn from history that truth and righteousness have extended and
                            triumphed in the world only where the gospel was faithfully preached. But let us go a little
                            farther after the truth. Shall a man quiet his conscience because he may listen to one who
                            claims to be a preacher, though he ignores the great truths of the gospel? Shall he remain
                            with those who deny the divinity of his Lord? Shall he hear those who scoff at the solemn
                            announcement, "The soul that siuneth, it shall die." Shall he hear those who prostitute the
                            Sabbath to catch a gaping crowd, who instead of preaching Christ, give a lecture on some
                            political issue of the day? Shall this continue to be the life of the worldly church ? Then
                            there is a greater work for God's people, and if we can see our duty and our work. God will
                            come to our help aud many shall be added to our number, who will help us on the way. If the
                            Master should come into our gathering would not his first and most earnest admonition be,

                                    certain Western town, and among those who joined the church, was Allie Forsyth, a
                                    little fellow twelve years of age. His mother was a widow, and had removed four
                                    years before from their home in Vermont, to this town in Wisconsin. On the Sabbath
                                    evening of the day when he joined the church, Allie was sitting in the twilight with
                                    his mother, when she said to him : "Allie, tell me what led you to be a Christian.
                                    Was it your home teaching, your lessons in Sabbath-school, the preaching of your
                                    pastor, or has it all come in some other way?" Looking up into his mother's face he
                                    replied : "Mamma, it was neither of these. But do you remember when we were coming
                                    from St. Albans to live here that I wanted to ride on the engine with the engineer?
                                    You were afraid to let me till the conductor, whom you knew well, told you that the
                                    engineer was a remarkable man, and that I was just as safe with him as in the parlor
                                    car with you." Then continued Allie: "When we were ready to start from the station
                                    where I first got on the engine, the engineer knelt down just a little bit, and then
                                    got up and started his locomotive. I asked him many questions about its different
                                    parts; and the places and things we passed, and he was very patient in answering.
                                    Soon we stopped at another station, and he knelt down again before we started. He
                                    did this before leaving every station, and I asked him after a while what he was
                                    doing. He looked at me very earnestly and said: 'My little lad, do you ever pray?' I
                                    replied, 'Oh, yes sir! I pray every morning and evening ' 'Well, my dear boy,' said
                                    he, 'when I kneel down I pray. There are, perhaps, two hundred lives now on this
                                    train intrusted to my care. A little mistake on my part might send all, or many of
                                    these souls to eternity. So at every station I ask my Heavenly Father to help me. He
                                    has helped me, and in all the years I have been on this engine not a single human
                                    being of the thousands that have ridden on my train, has been harmed. I have never
                                    had an accident.'" For four years the life and words of tbat praying engineer had bi
                                    en constantly present with this boy and became at length the means of leading him

                            three cents, belonging to one of them, suddenly disappeared in the snow. Try as we would we
                            could not find them, and the boys finally gave up the search, much to the disappointment of
                            the one who owned them. The next day, I chanced to be going by the spot, when suddenly I
                            spied the three coins we had been looking for. The snow which had covered them the day
                            before had melted,' and there they lay in full view. I seized them and put them in my
                            pocket. I thought of, the candy I could buy with them, and how fortunate I was to have found
                            them; and when conscience wouldn't keep still, but insisted on telling mt what it thought of
                            me, and above all, what God thought of me, I just told it to be quiet, and tried to satisfy
                            it by saying that Charlie B- - - - - -had given up thinking about his three cents by this
                            time, and that the one who found them had the right to them. "Well, I spent the money, ate
                            my candy, and thought that was the end of the whole matter. But I was never more mistaken.
                            Years passed on. I grew from a boy into a man, but every now and then "those three cents"
                            would come into my mind. I couldn't get rid of them. They would come. How| ever, in spite of
                            them, I had all along a strong '� desire to be a good boy, and to grow up to be [ a good
                            man�a Christian man. This desire grew stronger and stronger, for God never left me, and so I
                            gave myself to Him. Now, perhaps, you may think my trouble was over. j But no; every now and
                            then, "those three I cents" would come into my mind as before.<pb n="41" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>
                            Especially when I would try to get nearer to God, there were "those three cents" right in
                            the way. At last, I saw what God had all along been trying to make me see, that I must tell
                            Charlie B- - - - -that I had taken them ! To be sure, he was a man by this time, and so was
                            I, but no matter, God told me as plainly as I am telling you now, that till I had done this,
                            He could not bless me. So. then and there, I sat down and wrote to Charlie, inclosing in my
                            letter twenty-five cents�the three cents with interest. Since then I have had peace, and God
                            has blessed me.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Unity" TEIform="index"/>UNITY.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hyzer, F.

                                duration, and his time was spent, largely, among a class of people who recorded but
                                little of what he may have said, or of the wonderful signs that he brought forward as
                                evidence of his divine calling, yet the brief account of a life, so thoroughly devoted
                                to righteousness, so filled with self-renunciation and so consecrated to spiritual
                                attainments, which has been preserved to us is a source of great consolation, and from
                                which many, very many lessons may be learned that will serve to make one wise unto
                                salvation. It is of but little consequence to us that religious sects have multiplied in
                                the earth, and have asserted a divine right to mark out a plan of salvation. Unless this
                                plan, as well defined as it may be, is found to be in harmony with the cross of Christ,
                                it cannot possibly be "the way, the truth and the life." From the first introduction of
                                man upon the earth, agreeably to historical evidence, God has been recognized and a
                                religious influence has been manifested among men. Sacrifices have been made,
                                self-denial has been imposed and rites and ceremonies have developed with the race. When
                                Jerusalem was in its glory, these ceremonies were very elaborate, while the beautiful
                                adornings of the temple and the garments of the gorgeously arrayed priests were among
                                the wonders of the age. And the Jews were God's peculiar people. To this people he had
                                committed his word and made known to them his divine presence. With the advent of Jesus
                                Christ came a wonderful change. Instead of becoming a priest and officiating in the
                                great temple, surrounded by so much splendor, he chose rather to hold his religious
                                service on the mountain or in a boat by the sea-shore. Instead of having the kings and
                                princes, arrayed in their "purple and fine linen," to listen to his discourse, he had a
                                few, poor fishermen, who toiled early and late to earn their daily bread. The temple
                                with its rich adornings was not appreciated as being of special value as a place for
                                worship, and where men could more readily be led toward God. Not even to be a resident
                                in the holy city was thought to confer any rights or privileges upon the devout
                                worshipers within its sacred limits. Jesus cast aside all this ostentation and glitter
                                and gave his disciples to<pb n="43" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> understand that neither mountain nor
                                temple were essential, but that those who would worship God must do it in spirit and in
                                truth. And from that date the disciples of the lowly Nazarene have been found among
                                those who have forsaken the customs and fashions of the world, and have conscientiously
                                given their lives to God. No one for a moment could entertain the thought that the
                                calling of a disciple would lead him to become a recluse and ignore all the advantages
                                of a progressive, civilized and highly cultivated age. That type would be a poor apology
                                for a man, and a much poorer one for a Christian. We think of Jesus as one wko was
                                deeply in earnest, and thoroughly determined to establish among men, a knowledge of the
                                kingdom of God. He passed from city to city and from village to village, teaching by
                                precept and example the incoming of that righteousness, which should make the kingdoms
                                of this world to become the kingdoms of our Lord. Without a fixed habitation "he went
                                about doing good," among the Jews, the Samaritans, the Phenicians and other nations,
                                preaching the acceptable day of the Lord. To those in need of spiritual care he was the
                                minister of "good news and glad tidings." Can we do less than this and maintain the
                                claim of true discipleship before our divine Teacher. All this brings us to the humble
                                mission of doing good among men; and our life work, if successful, must be so well
                                defined and so in harmony with the Cross, that it may be "known and read of all men." If
                                we are aggressive against the evils that are in the world, we should not lose sight of
                                the evil and the worldly element within our own sphere of action and which may well need
                                our constant attention. To be in Christ is to be separate from the world, and whatever
                                we have or whatever we do will be under the influence of that spirit.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Necessity of bathing" TEIform="index"/>THE NECESSITY OF BATHING.</head><p TEIform="p">The fact that so few persons take regular baths seems to be due largely to a lack of the
                                proper knowledge of the structure and function of the skin. The skin is the largest
                                single excretory organ of the body, and the health of the individual largely depends
                                upon the proper performance of its functions. It is only necessary to examine the skin
                                over the end of one of the fingers with a good pocket lens to become convinced that it
                                must have some great function to fulfill. If, now, a section be made perpendicular to
                                the &gt;urface, and examined under a high power jf the microscope, this structure will be
                                resolved into many different elements. One of the first things noticed i.-&gt; the great
                                number of minute tubes, about one-four-hundredths of an inch i i diameter, twisted into
                                coils in the deeper parts, extending through the entire thickness of the ekin, and
                                opening on the surface. On some parts of the body there are as many as 2,700 in each
                                square inch; and it has been estimated that the total number of sweat glands in the
                                human body amounts to several millions. If all these coiled tubes could be unraveled,
                                their entire length would measure about two and a half miles. Physiologists state that
                                when the skin acts in a healthy manner, there are over two pounds, or pints, of fluid
                                given off by these glands every 24 hours. It is now more readily understood how we can
                                so easily "catch cold'' from chilling this vast excreting surface, and throwing all this
                                excretion back into the<pb n="44" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> body. The importance of kpeping the
                                openings of these glands on the surface clear and free, therefore, cannot be
                                over-estimated. Proper bathing and friction are positively necessary, that the channels
                                for this vast amount of fluid may not be clogged, for "a perfectly active skin means a
                                great deal toward a perfectly active general system." Besides these, there are other
                                glands, which are of especial importance, as some of the most annoying diseases of the
                                skin have their seat in them. We refer to the glands found in connection with the
                                hair-follicles. The secretion from these glands is of an oily nature, and if the skin be
                                healthy this secretion is perfectly fluid at the temperature of the body. If, however,
                                the openings of the glands become clogged, from neglected bathing, their work is thrown
                                on other organs of the body, the skin becomes dry and hard, and slow disease follows.
                                From this very brief accoiint it is clearly shown that a neglected pkin means endangered
                                health, while an active, healthy skin means a great deal toward an active, healthy
                                general system. It must follow, therefore, that an unhealthy skin bears a close relation
                                to such affections as Bright's disease, dyspepsia, rheumatism and the long list of
                                internal inflammatory complaints. While it is true that every house cannot afford its
                                expensive bath room, and while the simple sponge bath is far from satisfactory, yet now
                                that efficient, cheap, and durable portable baths, both light and compact, are
                                extensively advertised for sale, there is no excuse for neglect of this important law of
                                nature Every house, surely every home, should have its bath, in health invaluable and in

                                        strength, and applies the whip instead of nourishment to her poor, exhausted
                                        frame. Any honest, intelligent physician will tell her that there is more real
                                        strength and nourishment in a slice of biead than in a quart of beer; but if she
                                        loves stimulants it would be a very useless piece of information. It is claimed
                                        that some of the lady clerks in our own city, and those, too, who are employed
                                        in respectable business-houses are in the habit of ordering ale or beer at the
                                        restaurants. They probably claim that they are 'tired,' and no one who sees
                                        their faithful devotion to customers all day will doubt their assertions. But
                                        they should not mistake beer for a blessing or stimulus for strength. A careful
                                        examination of statistics will prove that men and women who do not drink can

C. Brainard.] Man unchristianized is more savage than wild
                                    beasts. Civilization without the gospel refines his methods of cruelty, but scarcely
                                    abates the passion itself. War is its phenomenal expression, its culmination. All
                                    forms of selfishness, robbery, oppression, injustice and savagery, lie back of and
                                    beneath and are contained in the spirit of war. In unorganized society, each man is
                                    a terror to his neighbor: next above this condition, tribe lurks to destroy tribe;
                                    then nations rush upon each other to rob and ruin. "Whence come wars and fightings
                                    among you? Come they not hence out of your lusts that war in your members? " The
                                    seat of wars is in human depravity, in cruelty of heart, which can be changed only
                                    by our agency. Christ lives in all reforms within the heart and works out, and as
                                    hearts become benevolent and just, laws and customs change. The United States leads
                                    all other nations in opposition to war and all nature helps us in our endeavor. The
                                    Nation favors arbitration rather than force to adjust difficulties, because so many
                                    of our people accept in their hearts the spirit of Christ, which opposed and
                                    condemned violence. This spirit has already mitigated the evils of war and rendered
                                    them less frequent, but as yet, they are by no means cured. The greatest nations in
                                    Christendom are armed to the teeth and keep up a perpetual growl and menace toward
                                    one another and often rush at one another with the fury of demons. Two forces
                                    especially assist our nation to rescue the Old World from the terrors of war. The
                                    spirit of invention lias so increased the cost of armaments that war means
                                    bankruptcy. This force is constantly increasing and bids fair soon to be so vast
                                    that no people will be able to endure it. Since the year 1855, just upon the close
                                    of the Crimean war, up to 1887�a period of thirty-two years the army and navy of
                                    Great Britain cost nine hundred and twenty-five million. Eight hundred and fifteen
                                    thousand six hundred and fifty-five pounds sterling! Can. the mind of man grasp such
                                    a gigantic sum and contemplate it satisfactorily in all its bearings? Nearly
                                    $5,000,000,000! The other force comes from our rich soil and the ingenuity of our
                                    people in producing labor-sa\ing machinery. We are undermining the aristocracy of
                                    Europe by cheapening the rental values of their estates. Our bread and meat lift up
                                    the toiling millions and pull down the ruling lords and as the former come up and
                                    the latter come down, the ability, incentives and "assions for war decrease.
                                    Feudalism and all forms of aristocracy are favorable to barbarous contests, but
                                    democracy logically desires peace. Tru^ democracy springs from the sentiment of
                                    human brotherhood and that is born of the Gospel, and of that only.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Strive to do good, rather than be too conspicuous" TEIform="index"/>

When each Christian

                                    ease, and sensitiveness about appreciation, and a desire for publicity, but an

                                    artisans and professional men will throng to the churches. All admire genuineness.
                                    People will go where men are transformed by their religion. The power of God evident
                                    in you and me will draw others to the place where we worship. That power will
                                    manifest itself in as many different ways as the power of God in nature. It will
                                    make things bend, not toward building up a denomination or a church, or doing things
                                    as the fathers did, but toward getting hold of men as they are to-day. The church,
                                    in the spirit of Jesus Christ, must always be seeking an opportunity, at cost of
                                    time and effort, of wealth and suffering, to go to those who will not come to it,
                                    and to go in such a way that it shall prove that He who came not to be ministered
                                    to, but to minister, is still going about doing good. An eloquent writer says : 'The
                                    church is to tell men that if God was a Redeemer of old, He is a Redeemer now; that
                                    if He was the Judge of kings and priests and nobles in old times, . . . He is so
                                    still. The church is to tell men that if God in other days took cognizance of the
                                    bag of deceitful weights, and of the sins of the employer who kept back by fraud the
                                    wages of the laborer, He does so still. The church is to teach men that society
                                    exists for the sake of the human beings who compose it, not to further the
                                    accumulation of capital, which is only one of its instruments..... The church is to
                                    declare that the spiritual and eternal kingdom which God has prepared for them that
                                    love Him is about men now, and that they may enter into it; and that his government
                                    of this spiritual and eternal world does not make Him less interested for the earth
                                    which He has formed for the habitation of man, in which He watches over him and
                                    blesses him, and which He desires that he should till and subdue according to the
                                    command which He gave him on the creation day.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Herald and star" TEIform="index"/>Herald and Star.</bibl></cit></p></div2><!--

THE PUBLISHING AND PATENT OFFICES  OF
THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.
Perhaps some of our readers have visited
the extensive offices of the Scientific American, at 361 Broadway, New York, but
many have not, and to such the following account may be of interest. A correspondent
who recently had this pleasure informs us
that he was greatly surprised at the magnitude of the establishment. It suggested to
his mind an enormous insurance company at
banking house. At the main office, which is
principally devoted to the patent business�
forming as it does so important a part of the
establishment�may be seen the members of
the firm and their able corps of examiners.
Ready access to the principals is afforded to
every one; and here may be seen inventors
from all parts of the country showing their
models and drawings, and explaining their
inventions. The models left by inventors
form a large and interesting collection, and
are kept in a room by themselves. The
large corps of draughtsmen who prepare the
patent drawing are for the most part experienced mechanics, electricians, or engineers,
some of them having been connected with the
U. S. Patent Office. Most of the correspondence is carried on by type-writers, and this
necessitates a separate department, where a
number of experienced female type-writers
and stenographers are constantly employed.
The dark room, where the photographs of
the patent drawings are copied, and where
the photographs for the architectural department are developed, is also on this floor.
On the floor above may be found the editorial rooms, compositors'and subscription room,
and the engravers' departments.
The Architectural Department occupies
the top floor, and here may be seen the manager of this department, and also a number
of draughtsmen at work preparing the plans
and general designs for the Architect and
Builder edition of the Scientific American which is published monthly, and has attained a wide spread circulation. The printing of the paper is carried on in a separate
building. At the entrance of the main office,
which alone occupies a floor space of 60 by
165 feet, may be seen one of Prof. Draper's remarkable recording barometers, with which
instrument a complete record is kept of the
atmospheric changes. This barometer was
built specially for the Scientific American,
and is a remarkably fine and sensitive as well
a very expensive instrument.
Some idea may be had of the extent of the
business done at the office of the Scientific
American when we state that over on? hundred persons are employed by Munn & Co.
on their several publications and in their extensive patent departments.
