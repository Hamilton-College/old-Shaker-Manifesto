                            it found the Shakers with a faith that neither allowed us to tight, to serve in hospitals,
                            or to pay for substitutes. To enter the army was to renounce our faith in Christ. To serve
                            with the wounded, was to restore the soldier 10 the use of the rifle and the sword. To pay
                            for substitutes was to employ another to do the work of human butchery for us. We hesitated
                            not a moment, but determined to take a firm stand upon the glad tidings, sung by angels at
                            the birth of Jesus : " Peace on earth and good will to men." We had long ago, in the days of
                            peace surveyed the whole field, counted the cost, and were prepared to stand by our faith
                            and meet the consequences. We were well aware that we would appear before men as. craven and
                            cowardly, as selfish and miserly, and as reapers of the spoils purchased by the blood of
                            patriots, returning no equivalent, To men of spirit among' us, it looked at times fearful;
                            but we determined tostand true. Pretenders left us to enter the army, this they were at
                            liberty to&gt; do. But there were among us, Godfearing young men, who took a straight
                            course, and one by one they were numbered among the drafted. One young* man was summoned
                            from the Society at Shirley, was examined and accepted. He returned home determined to
                            remain there and to place his whole trust in God. He prayed fervently, was sorrowful at his
                            prospect, and continued thus till an officer took him from the Village. When forced away
                                almost<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>heart-broken, he more than ever determined to stand on the
                            power of non-resistance and place his whole trust in Heaven. The first night he was placed
                            in prison with deserters, and in irons. Their curses upon the government, their ruffian-like
                            conduct, and their horrid oaths, so shocked him, and contrasted so fearfully with his own
                            Grod-fearing people at his quiet home, that it seemed to him like dropping from heaven into
                            the very hells of perdition. He would then have considered it a favor to have faced death
                            before the morning light. On the island he could not be persuaded or threatened into a
                            course to make him take his first degrees in the drill of a soldier, and was of course kept
                            in confinement. Finally, one of the officers designing to ayouse his fears, threatened to
                            have him shot, if he did not comply. He entirely mistook his man; he had lived a life which
                            had wholly disarmed death of its terrors ; and lie meekly replied, ''I would consider it a
                            great favor if you would shoot me, for I had far rather be shot than to be placed in my
                            present condition. " In'all this they could feel no Avillfuluess or rebellion. They saw so
                            clearly that it was the effect of acting from principle, that they liberated him, and
                            assigned him the duty of a waiter. He enlisted the sympathies of every one who knew his
                            case. They admitted his friends to visit him, and although he had passed one surgical
                            examination, they favored him with another. Last of all they released him on furlough, sent
                            him home, and never recalled him. Who doubts the interposition of kind heaven in the case of
                            this trial of faith, in this servant of the Lord ? Scarcely a society of our number, but
                            what met with similar trials ; but we had a God-fearing President, and others of like
                            spirit, at the helm of state who knew that the sincere children of God had been the
                            salvation of nations ever since the world began. The draft extending to all was right. But
                            the officials listened to rea.son why we could neither fight, or voluntarily pay an
                            equivalent, gave indefinite furloughs to all such, and sent them out of the service. This
                            was equally as right. And was not God's protection to be seen in this likewise ? In
                            Kentucky, a village of Shakers may be found at South Union, a few miles from Bowling-green,
                            where for a season, the rebel army lay. They Avere in want of everything, and the brethren
                            had much to supply their wants. The leading members had strong reasons to fear their raids
                            for plunder. They knew that they had planned such robberies, and were distressed at their
                            prospect of danger. They earnestly looked to Heaven for a protector, and one was raised up
                            from a quarter unexpected: the notorious Morgan,�the Commander at that place. He learned all
                            that was intended, and promptly stepped forward to the rescue. He issued immediate orders,
                            strictly forbidding any such proceedings. He informed his legions that he had long known the
                            Shakers, that they were harmless and unoffending, that they took no part with ei her side,
                            injured no man, and had no desire so to do, and none under his command should injure them in
                            any way. His strong iron will and unquestionable power shielded them, and they were thankful
                            to heaven for it. They viewed him as one that Clod raised up to help them in the day of
                                trouble,<pb n="243" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>and so do we. Rebel though he was, this will be held in
                            grateful remembrance by those he befriended. We never doubted, but gratefully acknowledged
                            that we shared largely in the civil blessings secured to this nation, by the noble heroes,
                            patriots and martyrs who fought and fell in putting down this bloody rebellion. And however
                            it may appear to men who do not recognize the '' wisdom from above" or the higher law, we
                            never doubted that we could do more good for this cause by obeying the word of God to us
                            than iu any other condition in which we could be placed. God would have saved even Sodom, if
                            five comparatively righteous souls could have been found in that wicked city. This nation
                            suffered to put down treason, on the worldy political plane, while the Church,
                            non-resistants, often suffered to obey their convictions and hold their standing on the
                            plane above. This patriotic and Christian struggle, beautifully blended to uproot treason,
                            and restore peace and prosperity to the land. As with others, that war greatly enlarged our
                            expenses, doubled our taxes, and entailed on us our part of the debt of this nation. If it
                            had been greater, we would have scorned to complain. If the authorities had attached
                            property to pay for substitutes, we would have sub-, mitted to it patiently. In the days of
                            the old Revolution, one of the Quaker lathers, who lived in Valley-forge, met] the
                            Commander-inChief when the army was in sore distress, and kindly said, "Friend George, my
                            religion . utterly forbids me, to use carnal weapons ; but it requires me to feed the
                            hungry, and cloth the naked, as far as I am able. Thee and thy officers, to the extent of my
                            means, may dine at my table ; and I will do what I can for thy soldiers. " It was kindly
                            accepted. This was the right spirit. We do not wish to boast of kind deeds, but present a
                            few cases in connection with this to show that the man of peace should be liberal even in
                            extreme cases. Our Societies gave liberally to the sanitary cause and to the freed men. We
                            shared with the soldiers in hospitals luxuries, provisions and money. In our Western
                            Societies, especially in Kentucky, they helped feed with a liberal hand, the armies of the
                            North. In South Union, a great grain-growing section, they dealt out large stores of
                            provisions to hungry troops, and submitted to some demands for horses, wagons &amp;c.
                            with as much good nature as any could have done. At the Society of Pleasant Hill, in
                            Kentucky, they witnessed the strife of conflict, cared for the wounded of both parties left
                            on their ground, fed bands of soldiers, and one morning, prepared and dealt out breakfast to
                            1200 cavalry men, and fed their horses. Boasting of such deeds is far from my intention, I
                            simply present them to show what the non-resistant man may do and stand upright. To close,
                            allow me to say that a Shaker Village is the best peace society in existence. Harvard,

                            identified with co-operative efforts, and also with communities having goods in common
                            during the past forty years, I would, for the benefit of those having aspirations after a
                            higher life than our present civilization affords, offer a few thoughts. A number of persons
                            uniting their labor and capital in any industrial business, is co-operation. The relative
                            conditions of rich and poor are not disturbed. The strong, are strong for themselves, the
                            rich, are rich for themselves. The one do not bear the infirmities of the weak, nor the
                            other the conditions of the poor. Co-operation may be just, but organically, it is destitute
                            of the benign- - - -the Christ element. Justice, is not goodness ; it is simply an exchange
                            of equivalents. Goodness illustrates itself in giving, but expecting no return. They are
                            organically distinct. The former may be an eye for an eye, or a stroke for a stroke. Or it
                            may be a pair of boots for a barrel of flour� a bushel of Avheat for two yards of cloth. The
                            latter returns good for evil, blessing for cursing. The former yields just acts, the latter
                            divine deeds. Capitalists may co-operate, and control the property of a country. The real
                            capital of a country is not gold, nor bits of paper. If there was no surplus of the
                            necessaries of life in the markets of the world, what would that which is called capital
                            amount to ? Nothing. Therefore, the actual capital of a country is the food and clothing and
                            other necessaries of life, which the laborers of a country have produced and have to spare.
                            If gold, silver, and bits of paper capitalists co-operate and control the real capital of a
                            country, they control that which does not belong to them. That which the laborer has
                            produced, should never, in the hands of others, he allowed to control him, nor affect
                            injuriously that which he has produced. Within the last century a number of wealthy men
                            co-operated and took possession (under the title of " The East India Company") of a great
                            country, containing millions of people. They controlled the land, and, of com&gt;e, the
                            laborer and what he produced. Holding absolute possession of the soil, they assume to be at
                            once�rulers�legislators�soldiers and merchants ; a combination terrible in power�it was hell
                            organized upon earth. The course they adopted, ultimated within the past i'aw years (under
                            the auspices of the British Government) in the destruction of millions of human beings.
                            Co-operators on a smaller scale, buy great tracts of land, monopolize it, and the contained
                            minerals, coal for instance, an article given for the general good of all. These
                            co-operators tax the community, and sometimes actually control legislation. Hence,
                            co-operation may be Satanic as above, and be just, as is the case with that form of
                            co-operation which attractsattention at present ; which createsproperty and distributes it
                            according to the power expended in creating it. Every infringement of justice is a Satanic
                            act. The priiiia facie evidence Is, tbat the<pb n="248" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> greater portion of human

                            have legislative protection, bounties, etc., afforded them ; so that a just state of things
                            may prevail. Communities having goods in common embrace the justice of co-operation with
                            this organic difference, that the strong are strong for the Aveak as for themselves, and
                            that the two great classes�rich and poor, are unknown. Such a community is a manifestation
                            of the Divine in man, even as slavery is of the Satanic. Every act of goodness is a divine
                            act. Man being capable of benign acts, is evidence that he has a divine life Avithin him ;
                            in a germinal state it may be. The incipient quickening of the divine in man, has been the
                            cause of efforts to establish communities having goods in common, organically embracing and
                            manifesting the benign or divine element in humanity. .lesus recognized this element�"be ye

                            is it that the noblest of men have not been able to establish communities having goods in
                            common ? They had honest hearts, ability and zeal, and other elements of success, yet they
                            failed. The non-success of communities, embracing a number of families, and the success of
                            the Shaker Order, led me to an analysis of human society. For, if physical things can be

                            society also be analyzed, and its forces and affinities ascertained, and thereby prevent, in

                            classify the materials to be analyzed; Human society presents itself in three distinct
                            orders. The just, the Satanic and the divine. The organic law of the just order, is love of
                            self, and neighbor as self. This order was represented by the Jews, and is beginning to
                            appear in the United States, " All men are equal,'' see also Homestead Bill, and other items
                            flowing from just principles. A Jew had as practical a right to land so that he might eat,
                            as to air so that he might breathe, an usury being forbidden, prevented the growth of a
                            moneyed firigtocracy controlling the products of labor, and arbitrarily changing their
                            value. The organic law of the Satanic, is love of self, at the expense of the neighbor. This

                            the property they create, standing between them aud knowledge, and trampling upon their free

                            begins to lose faith. " These are the words of that singular man Napoleon Bonaparte, who
                            although a slave to his own selfish desires, had a few grand qualities and eminent virtues.
                            The realm of religious thought and spiritual impressions, transcends the jurisdiction of
                            reason, and cannot be comprehended by it. Whatever may be said about the light of Reason, it
                            seems plain that Intuition is a higher, a brighter and a truer light, when kept trimmed and
                            burning. This faculty has not been, and is not, properly cherished and cultivated, an-d
                            therefore it is not the true and infallible guide it should be. The crude state of men's
                            morals, although not consistent with reason, is still more repugnant to this divine,
                            spiritual light called Intuition. Man, therefore, chooses for his guide and mentor, this
                            accommodating plastic principle which will furnish him a plausible excuse for his
                            short-comings, and which is quite reconcilable with his selfish independence. Another motive
                            leading so uniformly to Reason, is, that it is so easily counterfeited, there are so many
                            artifices, shifts and sophisms that her garb will fit nicely and by which so many
                            unchristian acts can be justified, which must be condemned by the unerring light abiding
                            with the child of God. We accept as true, the statement of a certain writer, that when man
                            was in his highest state of rectitude and uprightness, Intuition was his sole guide ; and<pb n="250" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>man at present need not scoff at this, and pride himself upon the
                            merits of that guide which so often leads him astray. Those noble beings had an unfailing
                            mentor so long as they heeded its behests ; but when he began to fail in this and to rely
                            upon his reasoning powers for guidance, this attribute began to fall into decay. Woman has
                            been truer to her divine nature, or, perhaps she had more of the divine in her nature ;
                            hence she is more keenly alive to eternal truths, and to the spiritual needs of her being.
                            Her perceptions of right and wrong in subtle, and difficult points, are quicker and more
                            reliable than man's. Ask her opinion and you get it readily ; ask her reason for it, and all
                            the reason she generally gives, is the proverbial woman's reason, "because." You laugh at
                            her, and if she says it is her intuition, you laugh again. You go to work with your
                            reasoning processes, and soon get sadly befogged ; or it may be that you reach the correct
                            solution of the matter, if so be you find she is right. Intuition transcends Reason, as the
                            sun transcends the moon. The former grasps and masters at once truths which the latter by a
                            long, slow process must arrive at. And other truths which Reason can never approach with all
                            her logic, Intuition has made her own at the outset. The cold light of Reason is not
                            favorable to growth of soul; but the tender buds of conviction expand and thrive in the
                            genial warmth of God's infinite love, and this is the fountain whence Intuition derives her
                            authority and power. Not that there is any clashing between these twp principles, their
                            light may blend as one, but after all Reason's light is but a borrowed light. Intuition is
                            the primary, the original light, a spark from the divine mind. It is through this part of
                            man's being that God has spoken in every age. There only could his word find lodgement. What
                            remained of this Godlike attribute, after all else had been prostituted to the god of this
                            world, offered the only means of communication between man aud his Creator. Every effort of
                            the powers above for the melioration of man's condition, always was, and always will be
                            through this channel. This is necessarily so, for man's Intuition is the quality that is
                            nearest to the heavenly world. His distance and loss from God is greater or less, according
                            as he heeds the call of this gentle monitor. No man in existence, reasoning from his
                            natural, unregenerate heart, is able to trace out the way of life. It is diametrically
                            opposed to every maxim in vogue with the world. It is foolishness to the wise, to the
                            philosopher, to the great in science and art, to the giant in intellect it is unknown, and
                            to the astute scholar it is a sealed problem. These all fail to see the better part, because
                            their point of vision is too selfexalted. But to the child-like, trustful humble seeker, the
                            saving truths of the gospel become as a part of his being. They are not difficult to learn,
                            and instead of appearing as a violation of nature's laws, they are manifestly a higher
                            development, a greater perfection of these laws. Enfield, N.

                            be improvement. There are infinitely more good ideas in the world than there are of their
                            own professors to work them out. This disproportion should be lessened. When a person has
                            earned his spurs by a life of self-sacrifice for others, " he is prepared to teach trom the
                            life, and what he says possesses a value, compared with which, the speculations of the

                            fictitious creations of fancy, to the positive affirmations of experience. Teaching and
                            philosophizing, that are not based on practice, are only a reflection, or distorted shimmer,
                            without life or substance. The constantly ascending prayer of the human mind is for light,
                            and light is continually coming, yet it is only by practice that we are enabled to learn
                            anything beyond the simplest rudiments. This may be illustrated by the story of a lad
                            apprenticed for seven years to a blacksmith, to learn the trade. He spent the term of his
                            apprenticeship looking on, to see how others did, and afterwards concluded to go to work. He
                            heated an iron according to rule and began to hammer. The by-standers asked him what he
                            would make. He answered that he did not know yet. As he continued hammering in one place,
                            the iron spread until it split; then he said he guessed he would make a fork. The
                            application is obvious. Doubtless he could have done as well in the first hour of his
                            apprenticeship, and the seven years might have given him a large store of valuable knowledge
                            by experience. So time is thrown away in idle dreams and speculation that action would make
                            fruitful of permanent values. Our esteemed friend Timlow, who has reformed many unruly young
                            vagrants and put them in a fair way to become useful and respected members of society, being
                            asked to explain his method of treatment, said the only way he knew was to go to work and do
                            it. Different cases require different treatment. He was learning all the time. We are so
                            constituted that we learn by work, and but very little to profit, only by work. Emerson
                            says, the step from knowing to doing, is a step out of the chalk line of imbecility into
                            fruitfulness. Doing costs jelf-denial, tests our powers and our knowledge, and enlarges our
                            growth. Overcome indolence, and lo ! all things are possible. That is, all meet and virtuous
                            attainments sought in the progress of the soul. Action that proceeds from proper motives,
                            converts light into life, and the life is self-luminous, like one of whom it is written, his
                            "life was the light of men." Labor and selfsacrifice, or self-denial, however contrary to
                            inclination, is the price of all mental and spiritual elevation, and of all advance out of
                            darkness into light. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            Journeys were subsequently made to Guilford, N. H. and Otsego, N. Y. In 1803 Issachar was
                            able to move -vith his family to the Society at Watervliet, as his wife had accepted the
                            faith and was anxious to be with the Believers. In December 180-i he was called to New
                            Lebanon, by the Ministry who conversed with him about the religious revival that for a few
                            years had been in progress in Ohio and Kentucky, and was finally chosen one of the three
                            brethren to go as a missionary to the then far West. The day for departure was the first day
                            of January 1805. They were furnished with one horse to carry their baggage, while the
                            brethren (Elder John Meacham, Elder Benjamin Youngs, and Issachar Bates) were expected to
                            travel on foot. Their route lay through New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D. C.
                            and Lexington Ky. They heard of the murder of Joseph Langford, and were informed of the
                            place and that the deed was written on a tree by Eock Castle river, Issachar says "I
                            expected to see some shocking expression written on such an occasion, but when we came to
                            the place we found to our surprise only these words, 'Langford's Defeat,' I shuddered. Is
                            this the world that I am in where murder is nothing but a defeat? " On the Sabbath they went
                            to hear Matthew Houston preach, and were much interested with his zeal for the truth. By
                            invitation the brethren spoke in several of the meetings and were received gladly, while the
                            people would say, ' This is what we have been praying for and now it has come.' On March 9
                            1805 they went to Springfield Ohio, and attended some of the revival meetings, but in a few
                            days passed on to Malcham Worley's where as Issachar writes, "we found the first rest for
                            the soles of our feet, having traveled 1,238 miles in two months and twenty two days. They
                            met some of the leaders of the revival work and very plainly informed them of the mission
                            upon which they had been sent. These ministers Matthew Houston, Malcham Worley, Richard
                            McNemar, Barton Stone and others were at first very attentive and listened with pleasure
                            till a full presentation of the cross of Christ was preached, when some of them showed their
                            preference for a worldly life and that they chose to remain in the pleasures of sin. The
                            Brethren now visited from house to bouse, and were gladly received. Samuel Rollins in his
                            prayer said, ' I thank the God of heaven that salvation is come. We thank thee O God that
                            thou hast sent a chariot of fire from the East, drawn by three white horses, to bring the
                            everlasting gospel to this land.' To meet the urgent requests to be present at the meetings,
                            the Brethren were obliged to separate and Issachar was chosen to go a distance of ninety
                            miles. He says, "On the 27th. of March I started on foot and alone, through the mud and
                            water, and waded one creek three times where the water was two feet deep. My feet became
                            very badly blistered so that it was with difficulty that I proceeded on my way. " The
                            ministers received him with many marks of outward kindness but they privately agreed, to
                            prevent him from having a privilege to speak in the meetings. Two of the ministers even
                            warned the people not to follow any man, and one went so far as to say, ' Don't believe what
                            man says, don't believe me for I have told lies, but keep your Bibles in your houses and in
                            your pockets.' The people however, demanded that Issachar should have the opportunity to
                            speak, which was soon granted and all gave excellent attention. The people during the
                            revival had been remarkably gifted in dreams and visions and much time was occupied in
                            relating these, as they were accepted as lessons having a reference to their own lives or
                            the lives of the people. One dreamed that he saw a minister standing on a stack of straw
                            preaching; the straw caught on fire and the minister fled, but a Shaker preacher sprang upon
                            the stack, and stood there and preached in the flames till the stack was consumed to ashes,
                            and received no harm. Issachar now returned to Ohio, on foot and alone, and reached his
                            destination in safety.<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>An active revival work was still in progress and
                            many came forward and honestly confessed their sins and devoted their souls to God and all
                            they possessed to the maintenance of the gospel cause. In April a camp meeting was held in
                            Warren Co., and a body of New Lights were determined to break down all before them, and the
                            poor inoffensive Shakers were denounced as deceivers, and as false witnesses. Issachar
                            thought that the tumult at Ephesus could not have been greater than it was in this camp
                            meeting for about one half hour. He says, "I was ordered to the bad place, from whence they
                            said I came, and was at the same time called many bad names. " The old soldier was not so
                            easily frightened. Pie had fought too many battles amidst the whizzing of cannon balls to be
                            frightened at this late date by a few theological shot from poor old guns. Richard McNemar
                            preached on April 28th. and took for his text, ' God forbid that I should glory, save in the
                            cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
                            world. ' It was now a time of great confusion. People came from a great distance to hear the
                            several ministers preach. By large numbers the Believers were kindly and affectionately
                            received, but a few of the ministers in their unchristian zeal made free to denounce them as
                            false prophets, seducers, liars, and wolves in sheep's clothing. Some persons are seemingly
                            obliged to use this coarse, boorish language, as their wild zeal runs away with their good
                            sense. In July of this same year Daniel Mosely, Elder David Darrow and Solomon King were
                            sent from the society of New Lebanon to aid the Believers in Ohio and Kentucky and were
                            received by them with great joy. In September 1805 Issachar returned to New Lebanon, on
                            foot, in order to obtain funds to purchase a section of land for the future society. The
                            distance was 776 miles and the journey occupied twenty one days. He remained at New Lebanon
                            several weeks, obtained the money $1040, and a good treasure of gospel love and in twenty
                            three days had walked back to Ohio where the Society of Union Village now stands. The land
                            was purchased and the next season " wh built a two story framed house 30x40 and moved into
                            it."' Issachar was a man of great faith and believed implicitly in the promises of God. He
                            was in the Lord's work and had no fear of what man might do. It was on this journey however,
                            that he had a test of his faith, and which at a later date he looked upon as a special
                            spiritual notice. While on this long and tedious journey from Ohio to New Lebanon, over an
                            unbroken country, his left foot and ankle became very much swollen and with such intense
                            pain, that it was with great difficulty he reached the public house where he was to stop for
                            the night. He was still two hundred miles trom the Society of New Lebanon and among entire
                            strangers. He writes in regard to this ; "At night I could obtain no sleep. In the morning I
                            found my foot so large that I could not wear my shoe only partially as a cover to my foot,
                            but I went limping along, wondering what I had better do. I thought I would get a moccasin
                            made, but if I do I cannot walk. I will buy a horse. I can pay $20 and get trusted for the
                            balance till I return. Well that will never do to get trusted after that manner, and I
                            cannot bear to have my foot hang without support, I will hire a man to take me in a wagon
                            and the Believers will pay him when I reach home, and I said aloud; that will do. Suddenly a
                            spirit voice whispered, Where is'your faith? I was in no condition to make a good reply, but
                            said abruptly, Faith ! I should just as quick think; of asking to have my leg cured if the
                            bone was broken! A voice Mrhispered, 'Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, it
                            shall be done.' I cannot describe my feelings, but it seemed to me that I gave my whole soul
                            into the name of Christ and asked.�In a moment I realized a change, and it was all over, my
                            foot was as well as ever. And how to express my thanks I could not tell; but I put on my
                            shoe and ran nearly three miles, singing as well as I could while on the race. People stared
                            at me as I passed them on the road, and no doubt they thought I was a crazy man; but I did
                            not care for that, I was so overjoyed that I had been healed.

                            necessarily to ignore the Old, but to more fully accept the New. The Old contains many good
                            things, but the New is divine. The Old is replete with prophecies, the New records their
                            grand fulfillment. The Old is fruitful of historical events ; descriptions of war, strife
                            and bloodshed intermingred with flashes of spiritual light warning a barbarous people to
                            refrain from cruelty and oppression. The New is adorned with the good news and glad tidings
                            of oeace, and advancing civilization. Out of the Old is drawn material for sectarianism,
                            polygamy, slavery and re-<pb n="255" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>ligious contention. From the New comes the
                            complete assurance of immortality and eternal happiness, proclaiming the Christ that was,
                            and is to be. Jesus of Nazareth was a student of the old scriptures, yet so divine was his
                            character, that he chose only the purest and best. Shakspeare, the immortal bard of Avon was
                            a diligent reader of the Old, but was not so choice in his quotations. As among the springs
                            of earth we choose the purest water, so should it be with what we read. Millions are spent
                            to flood the world with bibles yet what portion of its readers consider that "the letter
                            killetb, but the spirit giveth life" and light and knowledge. Will the time come when we
                            shall have a spiritual version Bible? let us hope so at least. A time when right o'er wrong
                            prevails, A time when none the truth assails, A time when all the old is gone, A time when
                            all things new are born. Canterbury, N.

                            give, for our success in the deliverance from the heritage of an earthly nature. Never, in
                            the history of the world, has so important an event as the mission of Jesus Christ, taken
                            place. It brought untold wealth of spiritual revelation, the highest standard of
                            intelligence and the cause of that knowledge and reformation which was manifested through
                            our Mother Ann Lee who uplifted the vail, and showed the true way of resurrection from a low
                            and sensual nature, to a higher spiritual existence, even on this earthly sphere, and also
                            how to prepare for our entrance into the realms of glory. We owe much to humanity,
                            especially to those who are with us. Those who need instruction, and are seeking for a
                            higher life should be our study and care and if we are true and sincere, we shall be the
                            builders who will reconstruct, on the grain by grain principle, the structure which is not
                            upright thus perfect and help to make life a bright and active one. If not active in every
                            good word and work, weakness and darkness will prevail. Well may those who have answered
                            this divine call enjoy a life of glad tidings and give unto others messages of love and
                            point to them the true way to journey. To thyself be true, inhale the divine atmosphere of
                            love and let thy whole heart be tilled with spiritual life. For augry words or frowns, you
                            can return kind words and sweet expressions, and being no longer subjects unto bondage, but
                            children of God, let us strive to awaken a spirit of lofty nature, and an influence so
                            grand, that all may feel the force of its pure elements, and look higher than earth, for
                            joy. The results, from so doing are the benefits derived from Shakerism. Canterbury, N. H. "

I. John, iv.:
                            16. Tins sublime yet simple sentence, so replete with meaning', so emphatically declaring
                            and summing up all Christian life and progress, comes home to the heart with the clear
                            incisive force of inspiration ; clearing away the mists of doubt and error from the mind,
                            dispelling the fog of old tradition and superstition and letting the clear sunlight of the
                            gospel shine into the soul. Love is the fulfilling of the law ; the embodiment of the golden
                            rule ;� the grand underlying principle upon which the whole superstructure of the Christian
                            character should be built ; if reared upon this basis it will withstand and endure whatever
                            trials may be brought to bear upon it. Love to God and love to our neighbor should be the
                            ruling motive in our lives, then shall we be found dwelling in God and abiding securely
                            beneath the shadow of his wings, far above the corroding cares, the petty anxieties, the
                            doubts and fears which so often annoy and perplex us. To gain this heavenly and blissful
                            dwelling-place, this angelic abode, this haven of rest from all strife, turmoil and unrest,
                            which is the heritage of the heart unsubdued and uuregenerated by the gospel, we must bear a
                            daily cross against every passion and propensity of a natural and carnal heart, and from
                            this life of self-denial and self-crucifixion emanate the rich blessings and comforts of
                            gospel peace and love. But when the refining is completed, when the dross is all consumed,
                            and we are purified from every stain and mar of sin, then shall we know the deep abiding
                            peace, rest, and satisfaction of dwelling in God and He in us. Beautiful rest! compared with
                            thee, how puerile, how insignificant, how utterly worthless appear the fleeting and
                            transitory honors and pleasures which the world offers to its votaries ! How should it rouse
                            us to action, stimulate us to higher endeavors, quicken us to renewed exertions, to know
                            that this wealth of the spirit can become ours, to know that we can blend with the angelic
                            host in their songs of praise and triumph through a never-ending eternity. Canterbury, N.

The pupil thinks enough, but he
                                    thinks loosely, incoherently indefinitely, and vaguely. He expends power enough on
                                    his mental work, but it is poorly applied. The teacher points out to him these
                                    indefinite or incoherent results, and demands logical statements of him. Here is the
                                    positive advantage the teacher is to the pupil. Let us suppose two pupils are
                                    studying the same lesson in geography or grammar or history. One reads to get the
                                    facts ; he fastens his eye on the page and his mind to the subject before him ; he
                                    makes the book a study, and acquires information from it; his object is to acquire
                                    knowledge. He attains this end. The other also studies the book, but while reading
                                    he is obtaining lessons in thinking. He does not merely commit to memory ; he stops
                                    to see if the argument is sound ; he analyzes it to see if the conclusion is
                                    warranted by the premises. The one who thinks as he reads is quite different, it
                                    will be seen, from him who simply learns as he reads. To read and think, or to think
                                    as one reads, is the end to seek. To teach to think is then the art of the teacher.
                                    The reader for facts gets facts ; he comes to the recitation seat and reels off
                                    those facts. His mind, like Edison's phonograph, gives back just what it received.
                                    While this power is valuable, it is not the power the world wants. The teacher will
                                    find Irs pupils come to the recitation to transmit the facts they have gained. He
                                    must put them in quite another frame of mind. Instead of recitations they must be
                                    made into thinkers. The value of the teacher is measured by his power to teach the
                                    art of thinking.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Teachers' institute" TEIform="index"/>Teacher's Institute.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Christian warfare" TEIform="index"/> CHRISTIAN WARFARE.</head><p TEIform="p"> Thk Christian life Has greatest strife Against the world within.

                            they hold their lengthy disputations on subjects that have but a trifle of influence upon
                            the present happiness or prosperity of mankind. It is not a new thing for people to leave
                            that which is very needful in life, and busy themselves about questions that are foreign to
                            their present duty. Many a life has been in deep anxiety about Adam and his management in
                            the garden of Eden, to the utter neglect of their own personal discipline or of the
                            protection which should have been thrown around others. Matters in religious history have
                            for a long time been a source of vexation as it is so di 111 cult to fix an exact date, or
                            to bring the several points in history to harmonize. But as the earth receives light and
                            these varied subjects pass under discussion, then the people will think. The people will
                            think. Why not? They are urged to read, read, read. Thousauds of books, pamphlets and papers
                            are constantly being spread out before them. The land is swarming with speakers Avho are
                            alive on every subject that can tingle or tickle the ears, and as a natural consequence some
                            few among the thousands will stop and think, and reason, and determine what may be for the
                            best. But it is said to be " an age of skepticism " and the common mind must be guarded, so
                            that oven the day of the Crucifixion must be established beyond a doubt, as one writer tells
                            us that it "is an important question and involves the harmony and integrity of the Gospels."
                            How wise it is that some one can tell usall about these things so that we may find a harmony
                            while reading the Bible. If a knowledge of the day and the hour when that remarkable event
                            took place would induce even the religious teachers to " beat their swords into ploughshares
                            and their spears into pruning-hooks, " it might become a matter of universal interest. It
                            may do no harm to know the exact time of all those biblical incidents which bear the date of
                            the first century, if luckily they can be ascertained, but it is of far more consequence to
                            �' live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world. " The harmony of the Gospels
                            must have a very loose attachment for each other if their worth in the mission
                            of'righteousness and brotherly love depends upon so slim a foundation as a historical date.
                            The word of God that is written in the hearts of his people has a living influence for good,
                            and this is pei-manently established, and we have only to prove our willingness to accept
                            it. Jesus might as well have attempted to establish the day that Adam left Eden, as
                            essential to the harmony of the books of the Old Testament and this would have been as
                            imperative as that the day of the crucifixion should be established that the people might
                            believe that Matthew and Mark were genuine records of the Primitive Church. The writings of
                            one of'the judges of the Supreme Court of the IT. S. should be pretty good authority for the
                            historical evidence which he brings forward to establish his point on this subject, but
                            Judge Bradley has found his wisdom wanting in that he is called in question for his
                            statement. He says that Jesus was cru-<pb n="259" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/>cified on the fifteenth clay of
                            the Jewish month. That the day was supposed to be Friday, but there is a possibility that it
                            may have been Thursday. Friday, however, is the day generally accepted and " that is the
                            almost universal understanding of Christendom. " It is interesting, at this late date, to be
                            assured of the ignorance of the Christian world during some two thousand years, in which
                            time they have had no satisfactory harmony of the New Testament books. "This inharmony has
                            made many skeptics and some of the best modern critics have been led to reject the Gospel of
                            John." Now a writer comes forward to make all the crooked places straight, to. turn the feet
                            of the Judge into the one safe way. The Romish Church as well as the Protestant is- also in
                            error and must be set aside, but the Greek church of 7G,000,000 souls who say that the
                            crucifixion took place on Thursday, is right. To have been crucified on Friday, the writer
                            says, makes even the evangelists at variance with each other, but crucified on Thursday and
                            on the fourteenth day of the month, makes everything perfectly correct, referring to his
                            time of lying in the tomb. "Crucifie:! on the fourteenth day in which the paschal lamb was
                            killed and in which as the great Antitype, our Passover makes him to have lain three nights.
                            Thursday night, Friday night and Saturday night in the grave, and all day Friday and
                            Saturday and a part of Sunday, and consequently to have risen on the third day. " Of course
                            this must be very important information and particularly essential, "in this age of
                            skepticism," when the exact day of the ciucifixion must be understood in order to have a

                            said he should "be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth ; " but from
                            Thursday night to Saturday morning hardly makes three days. If, however, it is proved, and

                                        having causes hero which are not equally active in any other parts of the
                                        civilized world. Indeed, our physical state in this regard is by no means
                                        creditable to our Christian civilization. The good Father has given us digestive
                                        powers amply able to so change our food, mysteriously, into the elements from
                                        which health and strength may be secured,�an amount to enable us to serve Him
                                        acceptably, and to be useful, the design of our introduction into this world of
                                        probation. No one can doubt this who intelligently examines the intricate
                                        mechanism by which this digestive process is effected; the lavish expenditure of
                                        the digestive solvents, almost<pb n="260" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> miraculously extracted from
                                        the blood just when they are needed, always adapted to present emergencies, if
                                        the system is allowed to remain in its normal condition. It is natural,
                                        therefore, to have our food fully digested, to be strengthened by it, and would
                                        always be so, our stomach, liver, all of our digestive organs serving us
                                        faithfully, at all times, aside from the many violations of the laws of our
                                        being, which are the laws of God as certainly as the laws of the spiritual
                                        nature. It becomes us, therefore, to learn how far we may innocently disregard
                                        any of God's laws thus abridging our usefulness, by making ourselves a nation of
                                        dyspeptics. How far may we innocently array ourselves against any of the laws of
                                        God, whether in the realm of ma" terial nature, or in that of thought and spirit
                                        ? Prominent among the causes of dyspepsia� for all of which we must be regarded
                                        as responsible�is our great haste in taking our meals, rarely, if ever, taking
                                        the necessary time, making this a special business, not to be disturbed by other
                                        matters. If it is important to eat, not as a mere animal gratification, but as
                                        we are commanded, all for the "glory of God, " it is a duty to eat as "a means
                                        to an end, " that we so promote our health as to be able to do the greatest
                                        amount of good in the world, glorifying our Creator. In this regard, we may
                                        safely follow the example of the higher orders of the brute creation, the
                                        ruminants&gt; patiently "chewing the cud, " without drinks, so carefully and
                                        faithfully combining it with *he saliva, in addition to its thorough division,
                                        that it is fully digested, as the Creator graciously intended. To do otherwise,
                                        to " bolt" our food, as do some of the lower orders, with far stronger digestive
                                        powers than ours, is to violate God's laws, enduring the penalty of indigestion,
                                        in the direct line of physical transgressions. If it is true that the digestive
                                        powers will correspond with the vigor of the body as a whole, generally, it is
                                        reasonable to infer that, if we hurry to our meals, exhausted by labor, the
                                        blood and vital force diverted from the stomach to the brain or limbs, they
                                        cannot be present with the digestive organs, at the time when particularly
                                        needed, from which fact the digestion must become correspondingly imperfect. The
                                        same must be true, if at the close of the meal, even if properly eaten, we
                                        return to our toils, instead of attempting to so modify our labors as to have
                                        more comparative ease just before and after the meals. One hour is usually given
                                        to the employed for their meals, in which time it is possible to secure a little
                                        rest devoting more than the usual time to chewing food, eating with decency. It
                                        is certain, however, that, just to the extent that we hurry in taking our meals,
                                        not half chewing and insalivating our food, or just to the extent that we waste
                                        digestive power by violent effort just before and after them, we must suffer the
                                        penalties of the violated digestive laws. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Watchman" TEIform="index"/>Watchman.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Taking medicines" TEIform="index"/> TAKING MUDICINES.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> Mischief is often done by the indiscriminate use of medicines.

                                        to be better; I took physic, and here I am! " The intelligent physician does not

                                        ; these are given to remove obstructions that interfere with the recuperative
                                        efforts of nature. If there are no obstructions to remove, the effect of drugs
                                        is to interfere with the natural and healthful movements of the machinery of
                                        life. Health is maintained by " good living, "�a term that comprehends a great
                                        deal. It consists in having good food, properly cooked, at every meal; clothing
                                        appropriate to the changing seasons ; and moderation in all things. Such a
                                        person might require no medicine during a long life. I must admit, however, that
                                        such an instance would be exceptional, even to one making the effort to live in
                                        that way. We cannot always procure well-cooked foods, nor can we always predict

                                        can aid nature in throwing off disease, by abstinence and such other prudential
                                        means as would occur to any thoughtful person, instead of eating heartily and

                                        medicines debilitate, and that drawback must be duly considered before taking
                                        them. Think of the quantities of pills that are used. Most of these are taken to
                                        relieve constipation. Unfortunately the relief is only temporary, and the doses
                                        must be repeated often, thus weakening the stomach and incapacitating it or its
                                        natural work. If medicine is used for Jie relief of constipation it is better to
                                        employ jt in suppositories, but a better plan than either is to cure the trouble
                                        by means of a proper diet and regular and active exercise or work in the open

                                        dyspepsia or colic, and continued through excuses and subterfuge-! that a
                                        depraved appetite strives to make plausible. The little household remedies have
                                        their uses, and they have also their abuses. There are occasions when such
                                        remedies as camphor, brandy, paregoric, laudanum, ginger, and pills and powders,
                                        may be of great service. The important point is to know when to use them; that
                                        would be perhaps once where they are ordinarily employed ten times. The best of
                                        all remedies�and every person should have a little constantly on hand�is common

                                        liquors and tinctures that benumb the stomach and retard healthy action. Rest,

                                        that this piece of refinement was derived from the Italians. The fact appears

                                        hastily gobbled up in five months-travels in France, Savoy, Italy, Rhoetia,
                                        Helvetia, (Switzerland,) some parts of High Germany, and the Netherlands. " The

                                        a thing that might have been spoken of before in discourse of the first Italian
                                        towne. I observed a custom in all those Italian cities and townee through which
                                        I passed, that is not used in any other country that I saw in my tiavels ;
                                        neither do I think that any other nation of Christendom doth use but only Italy.
                                        The Italian and also most strangers that are commorant in Italy, do ahvaies at
                                        their meales use a little fork when they cut their meate. For while with their

                                        fasten their forke, which they hold in their other hand) upon the same dish. So

                                        at least browbeaten, if not reprehended in words. This forme of feeding, I
                                        understand, is generally used in all places in Italy, their forkes being for the

                                        fingers are not alike cleane. Hereupon I myself thought good to initiate the
                                        Italian fashion by this forked cutting of meat�-, not only while I was in Italy,
                                        but also in Germany, and oftentimes in England since I came home ; being once
                                        quipped for that frequent using of my forke by a certain learned gentleman, a
                                        familiar friend ot mine, one master Laurence Whitaker, who in his merry humor
                                        doubted not at table to call me Purcifer,* only for using a fork at feeding, but
                                        for no other cause. " The use of forks was much ridiculed in England, as an
                                        effeminate piece of finery; iu one of Beaumont and Fletcher's plays, "your fork
                                        carving traveler" is spoken of with much contempt; and Ben Jonson has joined in
                                        the laugh against them in his "Devil's an Ass. " Meercraft says to Gilthead and
                                        Sledge, " Have I deserved this from you two for all My pains at court to get you
                                        such a patent� Gilthead�For what ? Meercraft�Upon my project of the forkes.
                                        Sledge�Forks ? What be they ? Meercraft�The laudable use of forks, Brought into
                                        custom here as they are in Italy. To the sparing o' napkins. " *Purcifer
                                        literally meant a slave, who for punishment of some fault, was made to carry a
                                        fork or gallows upon his neck through the city, with his hands tied to it, hence
                                        it came to signify generally a rogue; a villain.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Chicago eye" TEIform="index"/>Chicago Eye.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Books" TEIform="index"/>Books and Papers. </head><div3 type="book" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Phrenological journal and science of health" TEIform="index"/>Phrenological Journal and

                                Protection and Free Trade To-da}'. " Mr. Porter graphically presents exactly what voters
                                in both political parties want to know, the facts showing how free trade and protection
                                works at home and abroad, in the field and the workshop, lie shows how agriculture,
                                commerce and manufacturing in the United States, Great Britain, Germany and Holland have
                                been affected by these two economic policies. Mr. Porter's work will be appreciated by
                                business men, farmers and artisans who have no time to read a volume on the subject, but
                                who want a clear exposition of the condition of labor here and in European countries. He
                                takes decided Protective ground but makes a fair use of the official figures, which are,
                                at times, handled with dramatic . effect. Few are better equipped, by training, to
                                discuss this question than Mr. Porter. For several years a student of the industrial
                                progress of the West, and author of one of the most useful works on that section; for

                                to investigate the condition ot labor in Great Britain and the Continent. The words of
                                the author of the address on the Tarift' will carry weight with those anxious for a

MUSIC WITHOUT A TEACHER.
" Let all play now who never played before,
And those who've played before now play the more, "
BY USING
Sopor's Instantaneous Guide
TO THE PIANO AND ORGAN,
Which enables any persons, old or young, to play at sight, without previous study. It will teach you more
music in one day than you can learn from a teacher in a month.* The Guide is so very simple that "any child
ten years old, " knowing its A, B, C's, " can learn to play a tune in fifteen minutes. Its very simplicity commends it to all. Ever} house having a piano or organ should have one. It will prove an object of interest
and amusement to every member of the family where it finds a place. We don't expect to make you "stars,"
but start you and develop your capacity. Thousands will find it easy to become musicians when they once
get corn ctly started. This the Guide will do at once. Its sales extend from Maine to California, and from
Canada to Mexico. Every mail brings words of praise for it. A lady writes : " It ought to be in the reach
of every one. Thou.-ands will become interested in music who would never otherwise. My daughter learned
to play in 25 minutes." A gentleman who had listened for years to his wife and daughter without being able
to strike a note himself, learned to play 20 tunes one Sunday while his family had gone to church. A lady
writes : "Your Guide has brought much happiness to my family. My husband says it is the best purchase he
ever made. My children derive much happiness and pleasure from it." It is adapted to Piano, Organ, or
Melodeon. The best evidence of its merits are the large sales daily made by such leading Xew York houses
as R. II. Macy & Co., 6th Avenue and Fourteenth Street; Ehrich Bros., Twenty-foi.rth Street and 8th Avenue, and Ridley & Sons, Grand and Allen Streets. The Guides are sold in handsome folio sets, with twenty
(20) pieces of popular music, for $1. Ask your book and music stores for it. If they haven't it, make them
order it for you, or send direct to the Publishers, who will send it by mail, postpaid, on receipt of price.
Just think of it! Xl�e Guide and Xwenty (3O) l�i�*tes of Popular music for One Dollar.   You would pay more than that amount to any first-class teacher for one lesson.
