Athlophoros is a novel word to most
people who speak tho English language. The
Greeks used it centuries ag-o, meaning by it
"THE PRIZE-BEARER."
Athlophoros is the first and only
medicine which  has  carried  off the
prize as the perfect remedy for Rheumatism and NeuralgiaLike two relentless tyrants they have for
ages held their suffering victims in an iron
grip. These poor sufferers have been as slaves
in the power of their oppressors.
Athlophoros has entered the arena, engaged in conflict with the monsters, and won the
victory. As the competitors in the Grecian
games of old could win only by the most severe trials
of ability and endurance, so Athlophokos has won
the prize, not alone by giving temporary relief, but
by bringing an enduring cure, as well, to those who
have suffered the excruciating agonies of Rheumatism and Neuralgia;
Athlophoros is a novelty, not only
in name, but in its elements. It is unlike any preparation yet introduced.
Athlophoros acts on the blood, muscles
and joints, removing- the poison and acid from
the blood, carries them out of the system.
Athlophoros Is put up with consummate
skill, and contains nothing that can possibly
harm the most delicate constitution.
Now, do you want to suffer on and on?
or do you want to be well?
"Athlophoros" WILL Cure You
If you cannot get Athlophoros of your druggist, we will send it express paid, on receipt of
regular price�one dollar per bottle. We prefer
that you buy it from your druggist, but if ho
hasn't it, do not be persuaded to try something
else, but order at once from us as directed.

TEIform="index"/> WHAT IS TRUE RELIGION?</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Doolittle, Antoinette" TEIform="persName"/> ANTOINETTE DOOLITTLE</byline><p TEIform="p"> There be gods many " and religions many ; but only one true God and one true religion. Hence
                            we inquire : What is true religion? All peoples, tongues and nations have had their
                            religion, true or false. Pagan religion was one kind ; the ancient Jews had another form ;
                            the Budhists of the Orient, which are very numerous, have theirs. The Christian religion
                            (so-called, especially in America) is divided into sects and parties, chiefly classed under
                            two great heads or ruling powers, Catholic and Protestant, but, when summed up, called by
                            one name. Christian religion ! What shall we understand by the phrase ? Religion, when
                            defined, we conclude means the soul's reliance�something to depend and lean upon. Webster's
                            definition of religion, as far as it goes, is very good. He says : t; Religion is a high
                            sense of moral obligation, and spirit of reverence or worship, which effect the heart with
                            respect to Deity. " Add his rendering of the meaning of " Sanctity, which denotes purity of
                            heart and life, springing from habitual communion with God. and a sense of His continual
                            presence," and we think we get a good hypothesis, as far as theory can extend, of what
                            religion is and is designed to effect. In accord with a firm belief in any kind of religion,
                            so, to a large extent, will the life practices of its adherents be. Hope of reward and fear
                            of punishment have much to do with the religion of the present age. What in parlance is
                            called religion is often national, traditional and inherited. In Catholic countries,
                            ancestral religion, which comes<pb n="122" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> from parents to children, often goes
                            with them through life. Such persons, as a rule, do not think deeply nor reason for
                            themselves, but conclude that what their sires and grandsires believed must be true. It is a
                            trite saying; "Whatpersons have not reasoned themselves into they will not be likely to
                            reason themselves out of. " Ancestral religion, we find, is not generally effectual unto
                            salvation. Human beings, as a whole, are on the side of ease and self-indulgence. They like
                            what brings to them the largest amount of present pleasure and the least resfcraiut. Thus,
                            we see how easy it is for people to accept the doctrine of the atonement-�cne righteous man
                            living, dying, suffering for all, to expiate their transgressions of moral and spiritual
                            laws. People generally are beginning to understand, that physically, each individual must
                            suffer the consequence of his or her wrong doings, and that effects follow causes, and that
                            a "mysterious Providence ;' does not inflict punishment upon the bodies of human beings.
                            Diseases are often transmitted by parents from generation to generation, and in that way the
                            sins of ignorance or of willful delinquencies follow from age to age, to vex and torture
                            their progenies. Those entailed ills have to be borne as best they may, until outgrown by
                            adherence to physical law, which require patience and perseverence in well doing. ideal
                            religion, produced by erudite scholarship and largely discussed in the numerous churches of
                            our time, show eloquence, and as far as theory can go, could not well be surpassed, but how
                            much vital energy, effecting the life practices of those who listen to those finely-framed
                            speeches, let those who are able decide. True heart religion energizes the soul and is its
                            dearest and most valued friend ; and, when its mission is fully performed, it will permeate
                            the whole being, and really make the surrounding atmosphere redolent with healthful life and
                            beauty. Genuine religion cannot find full expression in words, but will manifest itself at
                            all times and in all places in the minutest deeds of life. It is the soul's panacea, the
                            tree of life to the spirit, and bears fruit meet for all needs. While prayer is the essence
                            of divine love in the human heart, its breath of life which cannot be expressed by any form
                            of speech, words detract from and lessen its potency, but, when unalloyed, it is the
                            cementing link in the golden chain that binds the finite to the Infinite. True religion and
                            prayer will form a perfect elysium where the soul can rest in God. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.

                            are equally applicable to the people of this present age, especially those who are naturally
                            endowed with spirituality in a sufficient degree to apprehend or realize that the kingdom of
                            heaven has been established upon earth. Those whose minds are sufficiently susceptible to
                            truth so that they can comprehend tile true significance concerning the life of Christ. It
                            certainly would be untenable for any one to maintain that mankind as a whole or that even a
                            majority;, have reached to such a state of spirituality that they are capable of realizing
                            what is required to be a true child of God's<pb n="123" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>spiritual kingdom. "The
                            natural man receiveth not the things ot the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him
                            ; neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned ! " How came man in this
                            tenebrous condition ? Why is it that the insipid gustation of sensuality is the
                            predominating desire of mankind? foi all are more or less tainted with abnormal animal
                            propensities which undoubtedly are the results of violations of natural laws. Yea, what we
                            are depends largely upon the influences and conditions preceding our birth, and largely upon
                            our course since birth. It is a statistical fact, that the majority who enter this life die
                            in infancy : Why is this ? Is it a wonder that the spiritual observation of mankind is so
                            deadened that it is seemingly impossible for the greater portion of humauity to even
                            apprehend spiritual truths? May the time soon come when the world will see the necessity of
                            adhering to the laws of nature, for as we look upon the world in its present condition we
                            can readily perceive why it is that nearly all anxiously choose a religion which gives full
                            license to their sensual nature. They apprehend not the dazzling light of truth which
                            proceeds from a Divine Father and Mother. Undoubtedly there are many who are susceptible to
                            spiritual truths, and they long for something higher and more elevating; animal pleasures
                            satisfy not their inward yearnings. What is the significance of theje desires ? It
                            demonstrates that they are prepared to enter a higher life and become heirs of the kingdom
                            of God. "The spirit and the bride say, come, and let him that heareth, say come, and let him
                            that is athirst come, and whosoever will let him take the waters of life freely." Therefore

                            attacked by another, who, when his assailant ran away, instead of pursuing him turned and
                            ran in the opposite direction until he came to the gate of a burial-ground. "Let him go
                            where he will, " said he, " I shall finally meet him here, and I will say to him," "My

                            and transmitting intelligence from generation to generation only by tradition ; the same as
                            is done by the savages of the present. I think it may safely be stated as an indisputable
                            truth, that all facts in science and art were first discovered by studying the relations,
                            movements, and results of the objective world ; and then by experiment, and repeated trial,
                            tested and confirmed, and finally placed on record for the benefit of mankind. This
                            primitive, natural method of education, is coming to be more and more, the accepted system
                            of the advanced and successful teachers of the present day. The educational systems of
                            twenty five, fifty, and a hundred years ago, have been weighed in the Philosopher's Scales
                            of practice, and found wanting. Those unacquainted with the mighty changes that have taken
                            place in the normal methods of teaching during the last quarter of a century, can have but a
                            faint conception of the new phases that have come over the thoughtful, intelligent masses.
                            Real education, is the legitimate unfolding of our faculties in the direction of ultimate,
                            substantial truth. Whatever assistance we can obtain to aid us in the prosecution of this
                            laudable pursuit, we should avail ourselves of, whether it be books, conversation, lectures,
                            or our own unflinching labor and research into the mysteries of the world and life that now
                            is, and which forms the vestibule leading into the invisible realms of knowledge, wisdom and
                            employment of the eternal future. The germs of man's present and eternal unfoldment,
                            physical, intellectual, ethical, and psychical, were planted in his constitution by the
                            Creator, at the period of his embryotic creation. However simple and crude, the primitive
                            manifestations of these powers were, they gave evidence of their origin, and showed the
                            commencement of a glorious future manhood. Although at first they developed slowly, yet
                            their progress was in the direction of success and perfection. Whatever ideas have been
                            impressed upon mankind respecting the character and constitution of God and of the spirit or
                            subjective world, they have been but the picturesque imagery of the object world as an
                            antitype. The ideal grace and exaltation of angels, the Edenic gardens and ambrosial bowers,
                            fountains, rivers, and fruits of Paradise, with all the perfections of life, society, and
                            conditions of the spirit world are but transformations of the natural world, arrayed in
                            their highest lustre, beauty and perfection. The religious conceptions of man have but kept
                            pace with his advancement in art, science, and civilization. These have been the noblest
                            exponents of his highest conceptions of God and the subjective world. Sculpture, painting
                            and architecture, more than any other art, exemplify man's purest ideal of Divinity, and the
                            exalted and sublime character of his own spiritual and religious nature. What grander
                            monuments of man's lofty ideal of the infinitude and eternity of God can well be conceived
                            than the almost imperishable pyramids of Egypt, the cities of Thebes, and Baalbec, all<pb n="125" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>built out of a pure religious devotion and adoration for the Creative
                            Power of the boundless Universe. In ancient times, apparently all man's skill was directed
                            in honor of religion. All the noted sacred teachers, prophets, and apostles, have drawn all
                            their illustrations of conditions and arrangements in the spirit world, as well as of the
                            states of its inhabitants, whether of happiness or misery, from similar states and
                            conditions intensified, of the objective world, the only one with which they were familiarly
                            acquainted. "How can we reason but from what we know, Of things in heaven above or earth
                            below?' Jesus Christ the acknowledged model divine Teacher, in the entire course of his
                            instruction on the subject of religion and spiritual development, drew all his illustrations
                            from earth life and the customs of the people he was teaching. If Matthew is to be credited,
                            Jesus did all his religious teachings to the people in parables. So similar did he picture
                            the subjective world in likeness of the objective, that we might be led to conclude that the
                            former is only an embellished edition of the latter. No one as yet has been able to give any
                            satisfactory description of the world to which we are all being swiftly borne, that makes it
                            different from this in its general aspect. None that have passed the bourne dividing the two
                            worlds, have ever returned with chart or map of the celestial sphere, to enable us to study
                            its Psycography. As to deductions of those treading this dusty ball, there is such a
                            diversity of opinions, we are left to rely on oar own conceptions and conclusions in the
                            solution of the interesting problem. We do generally agree that the most upright and
                            faithful, who obey the most strictly the voice of God speaking in our souls, will insure the
                            most present and future happiness. Mt. Lebanon, N.

TEIform="persName"/> MARTHA J. ANDERSON. </byline><p TEIform="p"> FROM the earliest history of mankind, in their association as families, tribes, clans, or
                            nations, some form of government, or vested authority, has been found necessary for the
                            protection of the law-abiding, and the punishment of those inclined to evil. The most
                            ancient form was Patriarchal. Every father held control of his own family and servants,
                            which, in many cases, amounted to a large household; and his word to them was more than
                            counsel, it was positive law. This custom still exists in the Orient, and among rude and
                            barbarous people elsewhere; but, in most cases where they have become numerous, they have
                            blended in tribal relationship, and are governed by chiefs. As these became powerful they
                            overruled weaker tribes, often founding nationalities and kingdoms. Absolute monarchy, the
                            first phase of civilized government, is where full power is in the hands of the Emperor ; he
                            rules according to his sovereign will. In some countries on the globe, where the light of
                            civilization has but dimly shone; both courtiers and subjects, of such rulers are but
                            trembling vassals, controlled by the caprice and vindictiveness of unrestrained passion and
                            will, void of Avisdom and reason. As nations progress, socially and intellectually
                            government is based on broad, righteous and philanthropic principles,<pb n="126" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>and the governed are allowed a voice in law-making. This power is exercised somewhat in
                            limited monarchies, such as exist in some of the states and kingdoms of Europe, where the
                            supremacy of the king, is prescribed by a constitution ; yet, in that amended form of
                            government, the machinery of state often plays into the hands of the aristocracy, and the
                            nobles rule on a grander scale of monopoly, of human rights and privileges. Another step in
                            advance, is where monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy are combined as is the case with
                            Great Britain, where in the houses, of Commons, and Parliament the representative law-makers
                            of the various classes of society meet. Some persons deem this the strongest and best of
                            human governments ; but, the love of liberty and increasing knowledge, leads on in the grand
                            march of the world's progress, and Republicanism with its broad basis for the universal
                            brotherhood of man, by the annihilation of caste and class, takes hold of the minds of the
                            masses, since its establishment and successful working on the free soil of America. " The
                            voice of the people is the voice of God," has rung through the courts and countries of
                            Europe ; till, like Sinai's thunders it has shaken empires and kingdoms to their
                            foundations, engendering revolution and anarchy; but, out of these, shall come forth order
                            and a more just form of government. "Forever the right comes uppermost, and even is justice
                            done. " Jefferson said ; "Where there is no government, there is no God. " This is true, the
                            godless elements of unprogressed human nature alone repel law, order and discipline. All .
                            man-made governments, are framed according to his narrow conception of Deity ; masculine in
                            spirit and administration, cold, philosophical and eheerless, they lack the true love
                            element. It will only be in the greater enlightenment, mental and spiritual, of the future,
                            when feminine qualities are acknowledged and infused into civil and religious systems, that
                            the grand ideal of social, civil and religious liberty will be attained. Government may be
                            classified under four heads. First, that of a family, which requires children to be subject
                            to parental guidance and instruction. Second, Civil. That Avhich binds the individual to the
                            maintenance of the laws of his country. Third, Ecclesiastical. Personal obligation to yield
                            to the authority of that organization which the people choose. Fourth, Self-government. The
                            restriction, voluntarily placed upon the unsubdued passions and propensities of unregenerate
                            man. Those who have advanced to this, have the law of God written within ; acknowledging a
                            Divine Theocracy, which supercedes all human governments. To such, it is easy to be
                            law-abiding wherever they are ; and, when associated in spiritual communion and relation,
                            self-love and interest become absorbed in the highest of human attainments; an organization,
                            which brings into harmony, for the well-being of all the noblest and purest gifts of
                            unfolded humanity. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. </p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I want to feel blest of God..." TEIform="index"/>I want to feel blest of God...

                            graces. This is a truth which we have reason to fear is not fully estimated by many persons,
                            but we should find here the best opportunity of doing good. Some seem to feel that they have
                            not much influence at home. Such have yet to learn that home is the sphere, not only of
                            duty, but of the best influences. It is natural to aspire after something great. Perhaps we
                            need to work more in oiir own vineyard, to know ourselves, before our influence can be very
                            elevating. This knowledge is gained by entering frequently into the closet of our hearts and
                            honestly, humbly pray for the graces of the spirit to abide with us. We can exert an
                            influence for good, and become bright and shining lights, and will be able by divine
                            influence to eradicate much evil and establish order, peace, joy and harmony in society.
                            There are some pleasures and influences which result from storing the mind with useful
                            knowledge, but enjoyments, and benefits greater, by tar, result from the cultivation of the
                            mind, and from the exercise and reciprocation of friendly feelings. The world is full of the
                            praises of some of the most elevated men and women, but without the parental influence,
                            which guided their youth, what would they have been? Their first lessons were received at
                            home. There they commenced their education of mindfand heart which rendered them eminently
                            useful in after life. Are we not indebted to the parents of those meritorious people for the
                            good influence which they exerted over them and through them, over a nation? John Quincy
                            Adams has been acknowledged to be one of the brightest ornaments of Massachusetts. His
                            Father was questioned with regard to the means by which his son was so early brought forward
                            and became so prominent and useful. The Father gave a description of the various means
                            employed in his instruction and adds, lie had a Mother. When Governor Briggs returned to his
                            seat in Congress, he told Mr. Adams that he had been reading the letters of his mother, and
                            had just found out the secret that made him what he was, "The old man eloquent." He replied,
                            with the liveliest emotions, that what ever there had been in his life which was good and
                            useful was to be ascribed to his mother. Let us take a critical view of his long life of
                            usefulness such as accompanying his father to Europe on a foreign mission, while in his
                            boyhood unparalleled activity, of spotless purity, of highest honor, brilliancy and
                            usefulness; then trace all this back to the honored mother, and consider the importance of
                            her influence. Tins is only one instance out of many. There are numerous accounts on record
                            of pious females exerting a heavenly and benign influence, not only on their own families,
                            but on all around them. Who can measure the responsibility resting upon parents and
                            guardians of children. The ornaments of society, are in no small degree, the result of that
                            maternal influence which has been tacitly and without being perceived, exerted in the
                            domestic circle. But influence is by no means confined to the parental sphere. A brother,
                            sister, or friend, may sometimes become as influential as parents.�Upon such, will great
                            blessings be pronounced. " Blessed are the Peacemakers for they shall be called the children
                            of God. " How careful and prayerful we should be, that we do not exert a wrong influence
                            upon society. Let slander, calumny, or anything that would hurt or wound the tender feelings
                            of another be banished henceforth and forever; no matter what grade or station we may
                            occupy, such traits of character are not justifiable. No community can be prosperous,
                            harmonious, peaceful, and happy, where such ruinous vices exist. Let us carefully, and
                            continually pray that we may so possess the spirit of Christ, that we can love and bless one
                            another with a pure heart fervently. Our influence then will always be cast on the right
                            side, and become what it should be, holy and acceptable to God.

                            And in true Believers his glory displays, As prophets predicted in primitive days. The
                            substance, predicted by figures and signs, lias drawn the attention of all the divines; And
                            many have labored with earnest desire, And looked for a kingdom that's revealed by fire. The
                            time has expired, the book is unsealed, The kingdom to thousands is truly revealed, And
                            many, like gold in the furnace, are tried, And brought into union with Christ and his Bride.
                            These two were anointed and suffered on earth, And travailed in union, and found the new
                            birth; They conquered the evil which Satan devised, And firmly established the Kingdom of
                            Christ. The language of all in the Kingdom is one, And by it are faithful Believers well
                            known, Xor can a deceiver, though many have tried, Dissemble the voice of the Bridegroom and
                            Bride. The true gospel language cannot be expressed, But by the Believer, by whom 'tis
                            possessed, 'Tis spirit and life, and can only be known By such as have gained it, and made
                            it their own. When infinite Wisdom unfolded her plan, Then Christ in his glory revealed it
                            to man, Here man by obedience, salvation obtains; And this is the language on Mount Zion's

                            plan so effective, and bring it to view, To slay the old man, and give life to the new? The
                            work is effected, the Kingdom's begun, And in it the language and spirit are one; We bless
                            the great work, and we own the first cause Which gave to Mount Zion her language and

                            That a Christianity which opposes a candid and free investigation of spiritual truth,
                            progress, and the emancipation of the mind from error; which opposes violence with violence
                            and hate with hate ; which allows its votaries to contend for honors and emoluments of the

                            the world, by natural generation ; which fails to repress sinful desires in the heart, and
                            to nip evil designs and practices in the bud; which fails to organize its subjects on a
                                social<pb n="129" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> basis of equity that will protect innocence, encourage
                            goodness, reward virtue, and secure the perpetual ascendency of justice, unity, purity,
                            holiness, chastity, charity and righteousness in the conduct and counsels of its leaders ;
                            that if such is Christianity, it is not the genuine Christianity of the wise and gentle
                            Nazarene, we think no one who has carefully and candidly investigated his life and doctrine
                            recorded in the New Testament can reasonably dispute. And if there is a people now on earth,
                            living the life and forming the character ascribed to him and hi^ first witnesses, we reason
                            that Christ must be present with and in them as much as it is possible for him to be present
                            with mortals, and it behooves those who are honestly and anxiously expecting Christ's second
                            advent, to seriously examine their credentials and testimony. Jesus foretold a total
                            apostacy, from the light and life of his first appearing, and the substitution of false
                            Christs and unauthorized teachers in his name. The Apostle Paul and the Revelations of John
                            confirm the same, while the history of the dark ages, the testimony of inspired witnesses,
                            and the prophetic numbers of Daniel and John, prove that this time has already passed.
                            Consequently a new revelation is absolutely necessary not only to revivify the truths of the
                            past so far as they are needed for present growth, but to set up on earth the kingdom of the
                            God of heaven, which is to consume in its progress, all other kingdoms (whether of beasts or
                            men,) and to increase in order, growth, and stability without end. Also to fulfill ancient
                            predictions, and vindicate the spirit that gave them. Hence our faith is not founded
                            primarily upon any record, but upon a new and present revelation of the same spirit, which
                            illuminates and is illustrated by the record, and by the character of its subjects. Thus,
                            the character of Ann Lee's revelation may be known by her own subsequent character and
                            teachings, and by the conduct of her disciples. At a period when intellectual skepticism is
                            stoutly laboring to discredit the historic evidence of Christ's first appearing, when
                            rational inquirers are perplexed as to what really constitutes genuine Christianity, and in
                            serious doubt- whether its reputed author was a myth or reality, lo ! it appears a second
                            time upon the stage of human life, and this time, contrary to all previous theory and mortal
                            expectation, it is made known by a woman. We know it to be the same by its fruits, and that
                            its mediator is no myth, the writer being for years acquainted with those who received their
                            faith and testimony direct from Ann Lee; people who had sought in vain elsewhere for that
                            deliverance from the galling yoke of their passions which they obtained by obedience to
                            Ann's testimony. She affirmed that she received her doctrine and testimony from the spirit
                            of Jesus, a part of whose earthly record we have in the New Testament, and concerning whom
                            she testified, " I have often seen St. Peter and St. Paul, and conversed with them, and with
                            all the Apostles, and with Christ Jesus, my Lord and head. For no man is my head, but Christ
                            Jesus, he is my Lord and head. " At Watervliet, in the last year of her earth life, she
                            testified in presence of a large number of people; "Christ is ever with me, both in sitting
                            down and rising up; in going out and coming in. If I walk in groves or valleys, there he is
                            with me; and I converse witli him as one friend converses with another, face to face." She
                            would sometimes say to those who addressed her as Madam or Mrs., " I am Ann, the Word." The
                            relation which she claimed as subsisting between her and Jesus was confirmed by other
                            reliable witnesses, and by her own conduct. Ann was a medium from childhood. According to
                            the testimony of her friends, she was industrious, discreet, truthful and upright, and
                            possessed a strong, practical common sense and good judgment in relation to the ordinary
                            affairs of life. She also possessed a knowledge and wisdom in spiritual things which enabled
                            her to compass the spiritual state of all who applied to her for aid or instruction. There
                            is evidence of this in the quality of her disciples, among whom were Baptist elders,
                            preachers, college graduates, business men and heads of families who had secured prosperity
                            and success in worldly affairs, and in the high moral charac-<pb n="130" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> ter
                            which these people sustained to the enc of their days. People qualified by their subsequent
                            training and guidance to make community life ; success, a desideratum sought by many without
                            success, for centuries since the overthrow of the primitive Christian coramuna church. These
                            were Ann's epistles seen and read for sixty years after her decease. Ann's good sense and
                            judgment are amply vindicated in the following Preceptive Teaching. "Put your hands at work
                            and give your heart to God. The devil tempts others, but an idle person tempts the devil. Do
                            all your work as you would if you had a thou sand years to live, and as you would if you
                            knew you must die to-morrow. Be diligent with your hands, for godliness doth not lead to
                            idleness. Be neat and industrious; keep your family's clothes clenn and decent; see that
                            your house is kept clean, and your food prepared in good order. Keep your dwellings, your
                            shops and your fields, and everything you possess in order. In the Spring of the year, every
                            faithful man will go forth and put up his fences, plough his ground, and plant his crops in
                            season, and then with confidence he may look for a blessing. But the slothful and indolent
                            will say to-morrow will do as well. Such a man never finds a blessing. So is he in spiritual
                            things. He will be slothful in the work of God, and will reap his reward. He that is
                            unfaithful in the unrighteous mammon, how can he be trusted with the true riches? Be prudent
                            and saving of every good thing. Beware of coretousness. Kemember the poor and needy, the
                            widow, and the fatherless. If you do not hear the cries of those who are in distress, God
                            will not hear your cries. You can never enter the kingdom of God with hardness against any
                            one; for God is love, and if you love God, you will love one another. You cannot make a
                            spear of grass nor a kernel of grain grow. It is by the blessing of God that these things
                            come, therefore you ought not to waste the least thing. If you improve in one talent, God
                            will give you more. God is a fountain of light, love and goodness, and no soul can truly
                            know God, but that will love Him. " From such instructions as these, impressed by example,
                            Ann's qualifications as a witness, may be in some measure inferred. Visions and Revelations,
                            concerning the spirit of Jesus have been common among the disciples of Ann, one of which,
                            the testimony of William Harlow, given at Mount Lebanon, in 1790, is here presented. Feeling
                            my spirit in union with Father Joseph [the presiding Elder] my mind exercised toward God,
                            and my sensations in the heavens, I saw the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, set up on
                            earth in this place, and it was the most glorious of anything I ever saw. The glory thereof
                            far exceeded the light of the gun, and shone at noonday as a great light; aiul I heard a
                            voice from heaven saying "The tabernacle of God is with men, and the Father and the Son have
                            come to dwell with them whom God hath called and chosen, and who are found faithful. " And I
                            saw the Lord Jesus sitting upon a great white throne. And I saw a number standing before the
                            throne, clothed in white. And I saw Mother and the Elders that were with her [out of the
                            body] standing between him that sat on the throne and Elder Joseph [in the body] and he
                            stood between them and the people. And they aowed down and worshipped God, and sang unto the
                            Lord, Hosanna to God and the Lamb; blessed is He who has given us the victory over the beast
                            and his image, and over iim that hath the power of death. And he who sat on the throne spoke
                            saying; "This is the first resurrection, and )lessed are ye that have part in it. Ye are my
                            witnesses. Ye shall reign with me on the earth. I have come to set up my kingdom, wherein
                            dwelleth righteousness, and I will )e a father to you and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
                            for ye testify of me in the world. " William Harlow deceased at Mount Lebanon while yet a
                            young man, highly esteemed )y those who knew him, for his manly Chris~ ian virtues. Mt.

                            verse of Matt, xvii., as spurious, anc also verse 11th of the xviii chapter. Matt, xx., 16.
                            " So the last shall be first and the first last; for many be called but few chosen." A very
                            happy change has been made in this place, and the passage now has nothing to do with the
                            condition of individuals as the words "for many are called but few chosen, " have been found
                            to be an interpolation. Matt, xx., 22 and 23. " But Jesus answerec and said, Ye know not
                            what ye ask. Ar; ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with
                            the baptism that I am baptized with?" The revised version now reads, " But Jesus answered
                            and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? "
                            The remarks referring to baptism in the 22 and 23 verses are now thrown out. It is
                            remarkable that the Bible transcribers should have been so officious as to enlarge to such
                            an extent, upon the say ngs of Jesus, and put into his mouth what they were interested that
                            he should say, to help establish their own peculiar theology. Matt, xxiii., 14. "Woe unto
                            you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence
                            make long prayers : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation." The whole of this
                            verse is crossed out although it is said to be found in some of the old MSS. This has been
                            read and quoted for two hundred years, and been the subject for hundreds of sermons while
                            purporting to be the words of Jesus and written by Matthew. Mark vi., 11. "Verily I say unto
                            you. It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that
                            city. "' So much of the eleventh verse is ei'ased. Was it written by holy men? Peter said
                            this much of some of the prophecies, " For the prophecy came not in old times by the will of
                            man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. " But the revision
                            corrects this for the better. " For no prophecy ever came by the will of man; but men spake
                            from God being moved by the Holy Spirit. " Mark vii. The whole chapter has been subjected to
                            a thorough ,-ifiing. Words and sentences have been liberally cast aside and still the book
                            is made better. Mark ix., 23. "Jesus said unto him. If thou canst believe, all things are
                            possible to him that belie veth. " The revision changes the sense very essentially by a
                            change of the sentence. It has been thought very important to punctuate a quotation exactly
                            like the text, but the revisors have taken unbounded liberty and of course, in many cases,
                            made very radical changes. The father here says, "If thou canst do a.ny thing," as though
                            there might be a doubt on the point, and a comma follows the remark. Then Jesus says, "If
                            thou canst believe, all things are possible." A comma follows believe. This makes a very
                            mild appeal to the faith of the man, who had brought the child, but the revisors change the
                            sense entirely, and make Jesus put forth, a cutting rebuke. "And Jesus said unto him, If
                            thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth, " As much as to say, Away with
                            your doubting! Mark ix., 29. Speaking of diseases that are to be healed by prayer and
                            fasting;�it now seems that Jesus did not advise the fasting, but said, " This kind can come
                            out by nothing, save by prayer. " The ninth chapter of Mark is well worth a careful perusal,
                            as the revision has many changes from the A. V. by which a better reading is obtained. Mark
                            xvi. From the eighth verse to the end of the chapter is considered spurious, as the old MSS.
                            have so many different readings. This takes away nearly all that Mark had to say about the
                            resurrection. This rejected section also contains several remarkable )assages which have
                            been very freely used in making strong points, for still stronger sernons. Luke iv., 4. "
                            Man shall not live by bread ilone" the remaining part of the verse, "but )y every word of
                            God, " is omitted as not beonging to the text. In the fifth verse the words, " into a high
                            mountain " are left out,<pb n="132" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> and in the eighth verse, "Get thee behind me,
                            Satan, " has met the same fate. In the eighteenth verse, " to heal the brokenhearted, " is
                            erased. This chapter has been singularly mutilated and it may take many years to reconcile
                            such changes in the minds of some Bible readers. Luke xi., 44. " Woe unto you. for ye are as
                            graves." Jesus did not say woe unto you Scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, as these names were
                            evidently added by some designing person in recopying the Testament. The word hypocrites is
                            not to be found in .the whole chapter. Luke xvi., !). " And I say unto you, make to
                            yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness : that when ye fail, they may receive
                            you into everlasting habitations. '� This important passage has been the subject of much
                            comment. The revisors have changed it a mere trifle. "Make to yourselves friends by means of
                            the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the
                            eternal tabernacles." This advice to make friends with the spirit of the world does not
                            sound like the testimony of Jesus, or the apostle. A better rendering is as follows :�Make
                            not to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, for they will fail, while ye are
                            received into lasting habitations. This certainly must have been the spirit of the Teacher.
                            Paul says, " Make no provision for the flesh, " " Whosoevc therefore will be a friend of the
                            world is the enemy of God. " Too many have already tried this same thing to the ruin of
                            their souls. Canterbury, N.

                            or draw lines of demarkation. I also would show my opinion, not dogmatically, but by way of
                            casting in my mite. Religion, is the germ of Divinity in us. All there is of us worth
                            talking about, latent it may be, you may call it the Soul, if you want to ; whichever you
                            call it, it is the element, in our mal-:e up, which connects us with the great hereafter.
                            Faith, is the Divine vlffiatus, vivifying the Latent Germ. Fanaticism, sometimes, usurps the
                            throne of Faith, producing unhealthy action. Belief,�the result of education, of dictum, or
                            of investigation. Sensible or otherwise, according to the progress of the age, and status of

                            minds, a kind of substitute for living faith and practical Righteousness.
                            Individuality,�Whether, in coming worlds, we retain our present individuality, or take other
                            forms, is not, an open question. We modestly leave it an open question, for others, to solve
                            for themselves, in their own way. The material of which we are composed beingunannihilable,
                            we are bound to exist in some shape. Should we, in coming worlds, retain our present
                            individuality, a life squared by living faith here, will be largely to our advantage there.
                            Should we take new forms of individuality, that individually will be like the material
                            elevated and refined, or otherwise, of which the new formation is composed. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                the history of Solomon's Temple. I presume many of my young friends have read in their
                                Bibles about the temple at Jerusalem, and that Jesus found persons there who sold sheep
                                and oxen, and how he made a small scourge and drove them out, saying : " Make not my
                                Father's house a house of merchandise. " John ii., 16. You may have wondered also, what
                                kind of a place the temple was, and by whom it was built? As its name implies, it was
                                built by King Solomon nearly a thousand years before Jesus was born, and required the
                                labor of 183,000 men for seven years. Previous to the building of this temple, the Jews
                                had worshipped at the Tabernacle, which was a movable structure, adapted to their roving
                                manner of life. After many severe battles, the Israelites took possession of the
                                kingdoms which God had promised Abraham. As the Jews became established they made for
                                themselves permanent dwellings and also made the House of God. David, who was king of
                                Israel, purposed to build a house for God, wherein should dwell the ark of the covenant
                                and made known his intention to Nathan, the prophet, who gave this answer, that while
                                God approved of his design, he could not permit him to build a house to his name,
                                because he had fought great battles and was a man of blood. By this we may learn that to
                                give to God an acceptable offering we must live in peace and love, one with another, for
                                if we " Love not &gt;ur brother whom we have seen, how can we love God whom we have
                                not seen. " David submitted to the will of God, but provided gold, silver, iron, brass,
                                timber and stone in great abundance. He also gave his son a pattern of the house and
                                with instructions how to build. Solomon was anointed king and in the fourth year of his
                                reign began to build the<pb n="135" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> House of God. As Solomon needed more
                                timber than his father had provided he made an agreement with the king of Tyre, that he
                                would give him a yearly supply of wheat and oil in exchange for cedar, fir and olive
                                trees. These were hewn by the Sidonians in the forests of Lebanon. Hiram complied, and
                                came to Jerusalem to assist Solomon. The temple was built of stone made ready before it
                                was brought to the place for use, and there was neither hammer nor ax, nor any tool of
                                iron heard in the house while it was in building. 1 Kings, vi., 7. Some of the stones
                                were forty feet long, thirteen feet high, twenty feet thick, all of white marble. A
                                description of this beautiful building may be read in 2 Chron. Hi When it was finished
                                the Elders and chief men in Israel assembled to dedicate it. The priests brought the ark
                                of the covenant out of the city of David, and placed it in the temple, under the wings
                                of the two cherubim. There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of the law which
                                Moses put therein at Horeb, more than four centuries before. This celebrated temple
                                remained in its glory about thirty-four years when the king of Egypt, carried away its
                                treasures. Under the Hebrew rulers, it fell into great decay, but was repaired B. C.
                                eight hundred and eighty nine. Nearly one hundred years after Ahaz removed the brazen
                                altar and placed a heathen altar in its stead. He also removed the brazen sea, brake
                                many of the sacred vessels and closed the temple. Hezekiah cleansed the temple and
                                restored all the vessels; but in the fourteenth year of his reign, he gave much of its
                                wealth to the king of Assyria. His son Manasseh reared altars unto Baal, in the temple
                                and led the people into idolatry. In the reign of Josiah he destroyed idolatry and
                                caused the temple to be cleansed and repaired. In the reign of Zedekiah, B. C. six
                                hundred and two, the temple was destroyed by the Chaldeans. The Second Temple. About
                                fifty years after .the destruction of the first temple, Cyrus king of Persia, was moved
                                by spirit-direction, and granted the Jews permission to return to tVieir own country,
                                and rebuild the temple. When the Samaritans heard that the children of captivity had
                                returned to Jerusalem and were rebuilding the temple, they formed a written accusation
                                against them and presented it to the king. In consequence of this, the Jews ceased
                                building, till encouraged by the prophet, and with the consent of the king, they again
                                commenced building the temple. Haggai prophesied that the glory of this second temple
                                should exceed that of the first; not as being more magnificent in outward appearance,
                                but because in that place God would manifest hie power and propagate peace unto all
                                nations. In four years the temple was finished, and although the treasures of the House
                                of God, which the Chaldeans carried into Babylon, had been restored to the Jews, yet
                                they could not regain some things which the first contained, and which constituted its
                                chief glory, and wanting these, no Jew would admit that it exceeded the former in glory.
                                This second Teirple stood unharmed nearly three hundred and fifty years, when it was
                                profaned and pillaged by the king of Syria. An altar of Jupiter then occupied the place
                                of the sacred altar. About three years after this, the Jews purified the temple and
                                restored to the Jews their worship. This second temple stood nearly five hundred years
                                when Herod the Great began to repair it. This was before the birth of our Savior. The
                                main building was completed in nine and a half years. It was in this building that Jesus
                                conversed with the Jewish Doctors when he was twelve years of age. Jesus went to the
                                passover of the Jews, and finding there, many persons engaged in selling cattle and
                                changing money, he made a scourge of small cords, and drove both the people and cattle,
                                from the courts of the temple, overthrew the tables, and poured out the changers' money,
                                and said to them that sold doves ; " Take these things hence, make not my Father's house
                                a house of merchandise.'' In the court of the temple, Christ taught the people, and
                                performed many miracles. According to Christ's prophecy, Jerusalem was besieged hj the
                                Romans, A. D. 70, and the soldiers made a fort of the temple, and finally sacked and
                                burned it. Canterbury, N.

                            of our Lord and Savior,�Christ, is the work of those who are effectually turning from
                            darkness toward the beauties of a spiritual light. Christ is above, and it is an upward
                            march toward the kingdom of peace that carries us away from the follies and sins that so
                            largely beset us. A glorious hope abides with us, as the morning dawn has so far advanced
                            that the heavenly pathway can no more be obscured. To run or to read is within the province
                            of each one, " Before us lies a fruitful field, Behind, a wilderness. " To stimulate
                            ourselves to stand steadfast in our high calling, now becomes au imperative duty. God's word
                            has not been au idle sound that we should forget from whence our blessings flow. We have
                            been called as devoted laborers in the fruitful field of our Heavenly Father's love. The
                            harvest, indeed, is great and an invitation is extended for living and active workers to
                            gather of the bountiful blessings that may now be found within the boundaries of this
                            spiritual kingdom. The great Teacher has wisely said,� If you are not faithful in the things
                            of this life,�in the abundance of temporal blessings that are prepared for you, how feebly
                            developed you will be to become stewards of the true riches. The usethat we make of the
                            first will more or less correspond with the use that we shall make of the last. To feed the
                            hungry, clothe the destitute and afford shelter to the weary is simply the voice of
                            humanity. " Inasmuch, said Jesus, as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my
                            brethren, ye have done it unto me. " A kindness in the dispensing of earthly blessings has
                            its sure reward, and if presented in Christ's spirit, a gift, even so trifling as a glass of
                            cold water will bear its corresponding recompense. But there has been a class of professors
                            who walked in other ways, and Jesus accepted their course as a lesson to his followers. They
                            gave no food to the hungry, no drink to the thirsty, nor sheltered those who were in need.
                            Selfishly looking beyond the sphere where their ministrations should have been, they
                            presented their gifts only as a form of godliness. How very much we need to learn from these
                            lessons of life, and to incorporate the good into our religious system. How very much we
                            need to study the spiritual necessities of the day in which we live and to be the good
                            Samaritans and the untiring messengers of love and peace to those who are walking in paths,
                            not illuminated by the love of Grod. Consecrated and devoted fathers and mothers have prayed
                            for and watched over us, and in turn it becomes our duty to p: ay for and watch over others
                            with a manifestation of the same loving, spiritual care. On the other hand, it is no less
                            our duty to contend against all forms of wickedness wherever they may be found, than it was
                            the duty of those who have preceded us in the gospel work. Equipped with the whole armor of
                            God, we have no reason to fear. The victory will be with those who trust in the Lord.

                            Journal and it is certainly a good omen to see that such an influential secular paper should
                            publish an article so fraught with practical Christianity, and with its thousands of readers
                            how many may be blest through its very efficient ministration. At first sight the
                            presentation of the terms so closely conjoined as Christianity and Cooking seem almost
                            ludicrous, as though the beatitudes could possibly have anything in common with the culinary
                            department. The truth, however, in reference to this is being better understood and the
                            careful preparation of food may largely assist in the development of moral tendencies, while
                            a neglect may as certainly tend to that which is immoral. A religion that does not include
                            the whole of man, his food, his drink, his clothing and his sanitary privileges as well as
                            his religious obligations must indeed be very defective. The many forms of theology which
                            have arisen from time to time have each in their turn accepted some of the Christian truths
                            and with these held more or less carefully to the laws of God that were given for the
                            well-being of the physical system. There was a time, however, when the people of God under
                            the leadership of Moses exercised great care in the selection and preparation of their food,
                            and if we are to accept the record which history has so kindly furnished, we shall learn
                            that the effect was magical. No such results have dawned upon any succeeding nation. As
                            unfortunate as it may have been, the Christian church, in this respect, can boast of nothing
                            superior to their Gentile or heathen neighbors. Christianity in offering a salvation to the
                            race must necessarily be as choice in its ministration to the body as to the soul. The very
                            close relationship Avhich they so carefully sustain, the one to the other, cannot be
                            ignored. It has been said, very truly, that " the adoption of the Christian idea leads to a
                            life that renews society and brings the true contemplation of God's works and the earnest
                            endeavor to realize his purpose concerning the human race. " There is, no doubt, but that
                            this was to be the ultimate of the work of Christ. To create all things anew, and to teach
                            that God's laws respecting the physical well-being of the body can be of no less value than
                            are the laws respecting the welfare of the soul. In the early history ol the race a
                            deviation from the Sinaic commandment was regarded so very wrong that it was termed an
                            iniquity, and passed from generation to generation. It certainly can be no less an iniquity
                            in a day when more light and more truth dawns upon the earth. The civilization of the age,
                            has in its upward march, been making some wise changes which must, indeed, be appreciated,
                            while Christianity as an order has only kept pace with those of her own country. This writer
                            who is certainly on the border land of the kingdom of light, further remarks ; �'' We have
                            tunneled mountains, we ^have bound continents together by steamships and telegraphs, and
                            have spanned them with railroads in order to bring food to us, and yet we do not know enough
                            about food to keep soul and body together with any great degree of comfort, fee h�w to make
                                the<pb n="138" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> body the most efficient instrument for the soul's higher
                            activities. " If an acceptable and a hygienic reform has reached us it will be one more
                            phase that will pleasantly foreshadow the anticipated millennial age, which is the hope of
                            every Christian mind. </p></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p"> Obituary notices should be brief and make direct reference to the life of the individual.

                            noble life now ended, Fame's highest niche doth till, Of consecrated service, Unto Our
                            Father's 'will, A Century's golden moments Life's tide hath borne away, Since first she
                            learned the lesson, Of Christ, the Truth, the Way. And childhood's faith obeying, When
                            sterner days drew near, With calm unchanging purpose, She walked the waters clear, Prepared
                            with faith unshaken Each sacrifice to make, However dear the idol, The Christian law, would
                            take. All through the weary night-watch, She asked for no repose, And when the opening
                            morning New toils of life disclosed, She, armed in stately queen-ness, Goes forth to battle
                            still, llesolved throughout the conflict To do her Father's will. Until the Peaceful
                            Victory, At last crowns human strife, And the Divine Afflatus, Becomes her breath her life,
                            And like the great Apostle Whose words vrere few and sweet O, love ye one another, Would
                            oftentimes repeat. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            thick, and the ceiling low, And seldom out doors did the old man go. He took no paper, and
                            in no book Of any sort was he seen to look. Yet he imagined he knew much more Than man or
                            woman had known before. They talked in his hearing of wondrous things. Of the dazzling
                            splendor of Eastern kings, Of mountains covered with ice and snow When all the valley lay
                            green below. They spoke of adventures by sea and land, Of oceans and seas by a cable
                            spanned, Of buried treasures ;�biit though he heard, He said he didn't believe one word !
                            And still he lives in his little hut About the size of a hickory nut, At peace with himself,
                            and quite content With the way in which his days are spent. Little it troubles him, I
                            suppose, Because so very little he knows, For keeping his doors and his windoMrs shut, He
                            has shriveled up in his hickory nut. And you, my dears, will no larger grow If you rest

But this is
                                    a great mistake. The moment we begin a bad habit of any kind that moment we begin to
                                    lose our power to act right, and the longer we continue in any wrong course, the
                                    harder it is to turn to the right. Nothing becomes fixed and real till it is done.
                                    It is the doing that forms the habit. Doing before it becomes a habit, requires
                                    effort, and sometimes repeated painful efforts. But doing, when it becomes a habit,
                                    is easy. When we do right, because it is right, we act from good motives. When we do
                                    this till it becomes a habit, the doing of good first becomes easy, then pleasant,
                                    and finally a source of real enjoyment. Good habits, from good motives are heaven.
                                    Bad habits, from selfish motives, are hell. A mixture of the two is neither, and
                                    cannot last; for finally, the good will cast out the evil, or the evil will destroy
                                    the good. No man can serve two masters. The habit of speaking the truth, of doing
                                    right, or being humane, lies at the very foundation of a large part of the happiness
                                    in this world. And very few persons realize, how much of our safety and enjoyment in
                                    this world, is simply the fruit of habits of good. Whatever, therefore, helps us to
                                    cultivate good habits, becomes important. And whoever neglects to give his influence
                                    and example in its favor, endangers the moral healtlu of society, and his own safety
                                    as well. It is vain to expect, that morality can prevail generally, apart from
                                    religion, to give it authority and approval. And public religious worship becomes
                                    our indispensable necessity, for preserving the moral health of the world. And it is
                                    for this reason that we have the command, "Neglect not the assembling of yourselves
                                    together, as the manner of some is.

                                When an Editor can encourage truth and denounce error, fearlessly and consistently as we
                                find it in the columns of the R. P. J. we may then look hopefully for a better phase of
                                spiritualism to spring up in the land. We are interested laborers in this field of
                                mystic influences, and accept with pleasure all that embodies light or increases our
                                intelligence upon this most valuable subject. Dreams and visions and divers other gifts
                                are among the blessings that have fallen to our inheritance, but they should be reported
                                in all truthfulness. That there may be spurious or sham-demonstrations conjoined to the
                                same company or that the credulous and over-anxious should sometimes be deceived by a
                                false light, is not a subject of surprise. In the exposure of these spiritual magicians
                                and their sham manifestations we most heartily commend the courage of the Journal as
                                fair in its treatment, and as an able advocate for the truth. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Phrenological journal and science of health" TEIform="index"/>Phrenological Journal and

                            greatest commandment is this, " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
                            with all thy soul, and with all thy might. " " If a man love me, said Jesus, he will keep my
                            Avords. " In Prov. we read, " I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall
                            find me. " I. F. Jesus said; "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
                            me, and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. " J. E. It is
                            written, " Eye hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
                            things which God hath prepared for them that love Him." O Love the Lord, all ye saints, For
                            the Lord preserveth the faithful; I will love thee, O Lord my strength. I. F. "He that
                            covereth his sins shall not prosper ; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
                            mercy. " " He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned and perverted that which was
                            right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his
                            life shall see the light. " M. K. " If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the
                            truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
                            and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. " L. S. "Beloved, if our hearts condemn us not,
                            then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask we<pb n="143" id="p27" TEIform="pb"/> receive
                            of Him, because we keep his commandments and do those things which are pleasing in his
                            sight. " E. F. Prayer to God. "Seekyethe Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while
                            He is near. Watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation." I. F. " For every one that
                            asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him thatknocketh it shall be opened. "
                            J. E. After this manner therefore, pray ye ; "Our Father, which art in Heaven, L. F.
                            Hallowed be Thy name. L. S. Thy kingdom come. L.D. Give us this day our daily bread. E. F.
                            And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. J. E. And leave us not into temptation,
                            but deliver us from evil, All. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
                            forever. Amen." J. E. The Scriptural examples of prayer, have, most of them, an unutterable
                            intensity. They are pictures of struggles in which more of suppressed desire i� hinted, than
                            that which is expressed. Recall the Avrestling of Jacob, " I will not let thee go, except
                            thou bless me :" and the strong crying and tears of M. K. Thy will be done on earth as j our
                            Lord�" If it be possible�if it be it is in Heaven. possible ! " ntt. Let all the earth fear
                            the Lord, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him, For his mercy is on them
                            that fear Him, from generation to generation. E. F. Let us hear the- conclusion of the whole
                            matter. All. " Fear God, and keep his corn mandments, for this is the whole duty of man."

A WOMAN'S WOES.
A Tale  of Suffering-,  with   a   Sequel  of
Happiness�Some Domestic
Experiences.
The following letter to the Kansas City
Times describing the striking, almost dramatic experience of an American lady is so
interesting and pictures so clearly the feelings and emotions of others that we reproduce it entire. It will be found very readable
and instructive :
Messrs. Editors :
Did I not know that this land is filled with
women who are unhappy and cannot tell the
reason ; are miserable when they have every
reason to be joyous, I should not venture to
address you this letter. I believe, however,
I can offer some suggestions that will be valuable to all women and invaluable to many.
When I was fifteen years old I presume I
was happier and healthier than moM giils in
America to-day. I haidly knew what pain
was except by hearsay. But the situation
changed suddenly and severely. I became
aware that something was underimnii g my
life. 1 felt strange sensations that would
conic and go and then return wiih g, eater
]><>wi r than before. My siik- pained me at
inie.- ami again 1 won d feel :i dull (idling between tiii' shoulders. I had darting pains
tii m.gli my tempi's  and a pivs-uiv on top of
a   ..;!�!       I   Iom   fleep,    ;ip|>ftite    and  flesh,
il \u\ friends feared I wa.- go ng into a d.c .11 . I know that the t\ i lings 1 then hail
a. ii t in ncownion occurrence among woiiK-n, imili y.iiing and old, but 1 did not realize what it meant at ll.at time, and so was
carelens-with whatresults, willi.ppear. From
ihi'ii iint.l wiudn the past two years I have
se -ii butf w comfortable days, and I am now
fifty-five years old.
A few years after the events above stated
my heart brgan to trouble me. At times I
would feel acute darting pains and a gurgling
as if water was forming. My entire right
side enlarged and I felt sharp cutting pangs
through my lungs and around niy shou'der
blades. I could only breathe in catches or
gasps and then with the greatest effort. I
was without appetite one day and the next
very hungry, but always constipated.    During all those years I did not know what these
troubles meant nor did I realize how terribly
they must end. Of course I tried to overcome them; consulted doctors and used
remedies, but it was of no avail. My troubles increased with the years ; I had a severe
pain in the small of the back; my teeth
became loosened ; my tongue swelled to twice
its natural size ; my gums were like sponges,
bleeding freely at times, and my lungs and
nose both bled on different occasions. At
that time I felt cold chills running up my
back and I constantly expectorated a brown
mucous   substance that was very offensive.
The fluids I passed were frequently like
bloody milk and then again almost solid albumen. For thirty years I did not know
what it was to be free from headache. Occasionally I would have a feeling of suffocation followed by hot flashes and a profuse
perspiration. God only knows what I suffered
for I cannot describe it. 1 only know that I
existed and that niy tired life was ebbing
away with nothing to arrest decay.
I was in this condition a little over two
years ago and neither myself nor niy friends
expected or hoped for anything but death.
Picture, if you can nearly forty years of
agony and you can umler.-tand why we felt
in that way. iiui a brighter day came. I
began a new umnm i of treatment, and I saw
new results. My pain became less intense.
The most severe >\ n>pton)8 decreased. My
hope revived and 1 sev nied awakening to
another life. 1 continued to improve until
my health and strength returned thus enabling me to carry out a desire which I consider a duty in willing you this letter and
saying that my life, health an 1 hope for crni lg years are due wholly to Warner's Safe
Cure, which has done wo.ndeis for me, and
also restored many of my friends.
Many who may read these lines will possibly think I am over-enthusiastic. Is it possible to be over-enthusiastic after being delivered from a life of misery and brought into
a world of comfort and happiness? Was the
blind man mentioned in the Bible, whose
sight was restored, too enthusiastic? The
fact is I am only doing what I believe to be
my duty in making my experience public, for
I know there are myriads of women  who areAD VER TIS E ME NTS.

speedy and permanent cure of Consumption, Bronchitis, Catarrh, Asthma and all throat and Lung Affections, also a positive and radical cure for Nervous Debility and all Nervous Complaints, after having tested its wonderful curative powers in thousands of cases, has felt it his duty to make it known
to his suffering fellows. Actuated by this motive
and a desire to relieve human suffering. I will send

"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and
by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast
tables with a delicatel}' flavored beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist
every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever
there is a weak point. Wo may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood

We do uot claim to cure consumption when thoroughly seated, but we do claim that thousands of lives
might be saved every year by the  timely  use    of Dr. Lawrence's Cough Balsam.
Many people imagine they have consumption, when in reality they only have a bad cold, which can
easily be cured by proper care and the right kind of medicine. We could fill columns with testimonials, but
do not believe in that way of advertising, our idea is to let everybody that is afflicted with a cough try
for themselves, cmd if not perfectly satis fled, return the empty bottle, to the dealer of whom it was bought
and n ciive their money back.
