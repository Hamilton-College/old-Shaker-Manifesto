                            spiritual truths set forth in the Shaker system are a portion of that Spirit? Can we doubt
                            that it has a God appointed mission to humanity? We think not. We have been accused, and
                            perhaps truthfully so, of hiding our light under a bushel. We may be at fault for the
                            widespread ignorance concerning our faith; but being a spiritual people, is it not, as Paul
                            declared unto the Corinthians? "The natural man discerneth not the things of the Spirit." In
                            this day all things pertaining to human welfare are subject to the most unsparing test of
                            investigation ; let us search and see what panacea for the ills of suffering humanity we can
                            offer. The foundation stone upon which the structure of Shakerism rests, the primal
                            principle that has held the system intact, is Virgin Purity, or in other words, a life of
                            celibacy. This principle has been kept unsullied for over one hundred years of successful
                            communism. How often are we confronted with the cry, "If all should become Shakers the race
                            would become extinct." But we believe the great sin of the age is the destructive force of
                            sensualism, and~'only by a return to the law of God through chastity in the relationship of
                            men and women, can human beings be delivered from the curses of want and disease, and the
                            great train of evils that so afflict modern society. "An angel came out of the temple crying
                            with a great voice to him who sat on the white cloud : send forth thy sickle"and reap, for
                            the harvest of the world is over-ripe ; and he who sat on the white cloud (purity) cast his
                            sickle upon the earth and the earth was reaped." We hold that Virgin celibacy is the harvest
                            of the world, and celibate communities, the garners into which the JULY <pb n="148" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 148 THE MANIFESTO. "wheat shall be gathered. When at least a small portion of earth's
                            inhabitants realize, that a life of Virgin purity is the higher lifethe God-like
                            lifecertainly there must be a law and purpose in it. Another primal principle is communism,
                            patterned after the Pentecostal Church. A community is the outgrowth of the divine in man;
                            it cin not exist in the worldly order, because the emotions and affections of the natural
                            man are antagonistic to it; it can only be sustained by being built upon the "Rock,"Christa
                            divine life, "loving the neighbor at the expense of self." Does not this present an ideal
                            vision to the soul? men and women who have gaiiKd the mastery over selfishness; risen above
                            all sordid and grasping ambitions; so inspired with a sublime love for others, that they
                            consecrate all they possess to the good of all, thus inaugurating upon earth that Kingdom of
                            Hi aven for which souls in all ages have prayed. In the distressing conditions that are an
                            outgrowth of our present system of civilization, we discern the vast fruitage of
                            selfishness; it is the mainspring of our savage competition, running through all industrial
                            systems, and its direful results, poverty and crime, are yet to be confronted by the higher
                            law of love. Here we see little communities, like green oases, dotting the land in various
                            sections, which have not only been delivered from wrong effects, but are removing the causes
                            and environments that produced them. Surely, this alone holds the "prophecy of better
                            things" for struggling humanity. We can but present a birds-eye view upon a few minor
                            points. Never having had a written creed we are not bound by any theological dogma;
                            believing in a continual revelation from Grod as the Spirit prepares human hearts to receive
                            it. Our religion, therefore, not only contains a vital element of progress, but we are ready
                            to accept the broadest interpretation of life, in the light of the highest truth. We believe
                            in God as Father and Mother, Wisdom and Love. This is not a strange idea, when all through
                            nature we perceive two distinct forces, positive and negative; from the centripetal and
                            centrifugal forces that hold the stars in their orbits, to the lowest forms of animal life.
                            When the maternal principle of Deity is universally recognized, we shall have more of the
                            love of God in the soul. Some one has said, that the civilization of a nation is known by
                            the development of its women. In a Shaker home the Sisters stand on a perfect equality with
                            their Brethren in all the affairs of life, both temporal and spiritual. The ballot has not
                            procured them their rights, but it is the liberty of Christ that has made them free and
                            equal, no rich, no poor, no high, no low; it is the virginity of their souls that has
                            enfranchised them. Is humanity prepared to receive the philosophy of Shakerism ? It is
                            neither fanaticism nor asceticism, but stands a bulwark against the surging, engulfing
                            flood-tide of sensuality;stands for the broadest interpretation of life, and for the fullest
                            unfoldment of the soul in the light of the Divine. Shak- <pb n="149" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 149 erism has given to the world a spiritual impulse. None can measure the force
                            of that divine, esoteric power that has gone, and is still going out from silent
                            unostentatious lives. There have been those among us, who, clothed with the prophet's
                            mantle, have foretold of a time when a wave of Pentecostal baptism would descend upon
                            humanity; then souls would flock to our homes as "doves to the windows ;" and we have been
                            waiting, (but not with folded hands,) for the fulfillment of the prophecy, that "God would
                            pour out his spirit upon all flesh." God and the angel world are rolling away the rock of a
                            base sensuality from the sepulcher.of the sleeping spirit; and obedient to the voice of
                            Omnipotent Love, it is coming forth in the renewed power of a risen humanity." Surely "old
                            things are passing away and all things are becoming new." In the many inquiries coming from
                            near and from distant lands, concerning our faith, principles and order of life, we have an
                            evidence that there is to be a renewal of the Christ baptism in another form. Our hearts and
                            our homes stand ready and open to receive the sin-sick and Godward aspiring soul, and fain
                            would we reach out our hands to bemired and struggling humanity. The call is,Come and
                            partake of the spiritual treasures stored up in the Kingdom of God. Shaker Communities are
                            established for the redemption of the race, and whosoever will may come. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            SUM one has been so interested in the "Address to Old Age," that was written by Sister Hannah
                            Bronson as to send it to us for publication. In memory of the dear Sister, who for many
                            years gave her life to God and to his people, we shal not only find a place for these few
                            lines but wil ad other interesting matter for the pleasure of many of the frends still
                            living who bear in fond remembrance the subject of this skech. Hannah Bronson was born in
                            the town of Norwich, Vt., Jan. 13, 1781. Fortunately for us we hav found sum autobiografical
                            notes which wil aid us very much in the illustration. "In my childhood I became frightend
                            when I lernd that everybody must die, and askt my mother if I should certainly die. My
                            mother very thoughtfully answerd, "Yes, my child, but if you ar a good girl and wil say the
                            Lord's prayer every night, you wil be happy after death and go to heaven." I carefully
                            regarded this advice for several weeks, but as I grew older I joind in the foolish
                            conversation of idle companions and became careless. In a dream I saw that the day of
                            judgment had alredy commenct, and <pb n="150" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 150 THE MANIFESTO. that I should
                            soon be calld to giv an account of how I had spent my time. I had red in the Bible that for
                            every idle word I must render a full account, and I knew I had spoken a great many, and that
                            for several years there was not much change. When I had reacht the age of seventeen years I
                            felt a conviction for wrong doing, and obtaind sum relief by again carefully reading the
                            Bible. At this time I made a resolv to forsake all my sinful ways. I attended the church as
                            often as 1 could, but its great distance from my home prevented my attendance only at long
                            intervals. Once while engage! in prayer and asking to know the wil of God, the spirit gav me
                            this answer, "Deny yourself, take up the cross and follow me." In 1798 I was baptized and
                            enterd the church with a full purpose of giving my heart to God, and in this I found a
                            measure of salvation. Subsequently I lernd of a revival that was being held but a few miles
                            distant from my home. I was anxious to attend, and to my surprize, found that sum of the
                            members of the Shaker Community had been present. On lerning that sum of the pepl had
                            accepted the faith as taught by the Shakers, I felt very sorry, as I had herd that the
                            Shakers were sadly deluded. Indeed, I was strongly prejudist against them, and yet was at
                            the same time quite anxious to hear them for myself. I now made arrangements with one of our
                            neighbors to inform me should the Shakers cum into that vicinity again. My father also
                            wanted to see and hear the Shakers, and in this he was like the Athenians, who were always
                            interested in new things. On the loth of January, 1799, several persons from the Communities
                            of Canterbury and Enfield were invited to our house, by my father. As they were engagd in
                            conversation I listend very attentivly. When opportunity offerd I also converst with the
                            Shakers and brought forward all the objections that occurcl to my mind, stil believing them
                            to be sadly in error in regard to a religious faith and life. The Shakers were very social
                            and plezant and wanted me to understand fully the object of their mission. On leaving us
                            they invited those present to visit them at their home in Enfield, and as sum of my frends
                            were expecting to make them a visit, I was invited to be one of the company. This visit
                            changd my mind, and I found myself among beutifully anticipated frends and became so wel
                            pleased in this new home that I had no wish to return to Norwich. However, I did return to
                            attend to sum bizness that was left unfinisht. Many of my frends and relativs were much
                            opposd to the course I had taken. My dres, my language and my religious observances were all
                            objectionabl. Two persons who had formerly livd with the Shakers, came to see me. One was
                            bitterly oppozd and made a great many unplezant remarks about my Shaker frends, while the
                            other spoke kindly of the pepl. A family living about one half mile from my father's had
                            joind the Shak- <pb n="151" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 151 ers, and were holding meetings in
                            their house. I visited them that I might attend the meetings. A storm detaind me from Sunday
                            til Tuesday, and when I reacht home my father and frends could hardly wait for each other,
                            in their anxiety to oppoz me. As I could find no place for an answer, I quietly busied
                            myself with sum work. A younger brother changd the subject by reading a few passages from
                            the Scriptures, and their reverence for the Book had, at this time, a good effect. In 1800
                            my brother and his family united with the Believers. I obtaind board with him and gave
                            instruction to his children and to those of another family. 1 subsequently movd into the
                            family of Bennett Libbey, in Strafford who livd at a distance of seven miles., Bennett was
                            very kind and his charity was unbounded. After the Believers had lernd that Bennett would
                            like to enter one of the Societies they made arrangements to cum to Strafford on the 3rd of
                            March, 1801 and assist us in the moving of our goods. We reacht Enfield quite late on
                            Saturday p. in. and remaind there til Monday, when we drove on to Canterbury. Bennett movd
                            into the house formerly owned by the Muffetts' and I reremaind as one of the family. After
                            being here a few weeks I movd into the family of Joshua Wright, at the "West Place," and was
                            appointed to teach the children of the Believers. As there was no scool-houz at this date I
                            was accommodated with a room in the blacksmith shop. As the opportunity for attending scool
                            was very limited thruout the town, the Believers were obligd to accommodate themselvs as
                            best they could for the benefit of their children. As a general thing they could spare but a
                            few hours in a day and but few weeks in a year for purposes of education. The pupils at the
                            Church family, were no better accommodated than were those in the smaller families, and it
                            was not til 1823 that the Community felt abl to bild a scool-houz and conduct the scool
                            agreeably to the town law. At the opening of the next term a much better place was provided,
                            and the scool was kept in one of the rooms of the family dweling. My next mov was into the
                            family of James Fisher to teach his children. As was the custom I movd from place to place
                            as occasion required. In 1805 I movd into the family of Jeremiah Garland. Here I kept the
                            scool on the driving floor of the barn. As the place was destitute of furniture, the
                            children were seated on the floor, except those who were fortunate enuf to find a box or a
                            block of wood. These children, in the summer scool did not weary themselvs with multiplid
                            studies, but had primers, Webster's speling book and the New Testament. Ink was too expensiv
                            to be bought, and what little was used was made from the berries found in the pasture. Very
                            little time, however, was given even by the oldest pupils to penmanship. <pb n="152" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 152 THE MANIFESTO. A short time, each day, was spent in the setting of card teeth, so
                            that the boys when tired of study were not left in idlness. The employment of children at
                            sum kind of work was not uncommon in the District scool, and the girls often biought their
                            sewing and knitting work. The time for play was generally during the intermission at noon.
                            This season I was taken sick and for several weeks was not expected to live. Thru the care
                            of a kind Providence and loving frends, however, I recivd a healing gift on the 16th of May,
                            and on the following Sunday attended religious service with the family. On receiving this
                            gift I refusd al medicin, and on the fiist day of June collected al the pils, powders,
                            drops, and lotions, and carried them to the physicians who had orderd them. Several persons
                            calld to see me, and were surprizd at my sudden recuvery. Dea. Zadock Wright said he was as
                            pleasd to see me, as he would be to see the President of the U. S.; it seemd so like a
                            miraculous recuvery. While living in the family of Brother Garland we attended religious
                            service at the West family, twice each week, and the walk up that steep hil to my home,
                            after a long evening meeting, seemd a great deal farther than it did going down. In 1806 I
                            taught scool in the West family and occupied a room in the laundry. I again became a member
                            of the family, and was appointed to care for the sick. My first patient was a daughter of
                            Bennett Libbey. She was fifteen years of age and wasting away with consumption. After
                            suffering for another month she past quietly to her rest. My care for the sick requird my
                            constant attention and much of the time, both day and night. On moving to the North Family
                            in 1818 I continued my labors at the Infirmary, and for several years, made this my only
                            buziness." Hannah Bronson was a beautiful sister in the Shaker Community. Her mind was of
                            the first quality. She possesst a fund of information, and took great plezure in extending
                            the same to others. She was gifted as a poetess and the Society has often shard the
                            blessings of her thoughts from her pen. In 1836 she was appointed Eldress of the Novitiate

                                1895.</dateline><p TEIform="p">Greetings to our precious little craft, its kind Pilot, and crew. Recently through the
                                kindness of Elder A. G. Hollister, I was the recipient of a number of valuable tracts,
                                so clearly exemplifying the life teachings of Jesus, the Christ, that it is surprising
                                that people seeking truth and salvation from sin, can not see it. Of coarse it means a
                                daily sacrifice and constant prayer, yet thousands have lived it, and do now, I trust,
                                and are numbered with the hundred, forty and four thousand virgins, who are redeemed
                                from the earth. That virgin life ! so singular to the majority, even though it was lived
                                by our Savior and who even declared that except we forsake the relations of the flesh,
                                father, mother, wife and children, we can not become one of his disciples. Upon this
                                principle the church of Christ is founded. It is the communion of our Lord, where all of
                                our possessions belong to the Lord, in which we can have no selfish interest. In
                                obedience to this system, our Church has prospered in all temporal and spiritual
                                blessings. The Church was to be the home of those who were convicted of the sins of the
                                world. It was free for the rich and poor; children were to be cared for in the
                                admonition of the Lord. The selfish and ignorant wonder at the choice that the Believers
                                have made. Their sense is wholly absorbed in the duties of a husband, a wife <pb n="154" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 154 THE MANIFESTO. and children. We have the record that Jesus was
                                tempted in all points as were his brethren, and is it reasonable to suppose that his
                                disciples will escape, the same trials? "Be of good cheer," said he. "I have overcome
                                the world." And the overcoming of the world is to forsake the relations which form it.

                            BUT it is also true that ignorance and conceit are closely connected together, and that the
                            ignorant hate him who is wiser than they. If one man, knowing more about the requirements of
                            his nature, and desirous to employ all his energies for the attainment of a higher state,
                            were to dai*e to assert his manhood and to rebel against the chains of fashion, could he
                            continue to live unmolested in his community? and if he were to emigrate to another, would
                            he not be exposed there to the same troubles? He would still come in contact with men who
                            hated the light because they were educated in darkness, who would misunderstand him, suspect
                            his motives, and persecute him; and woe to him if he had any human failings upon which the
                            snake of slander could fasten its poison fangs. Wherever darkness exists, there exists
                            abhorrence of light. Where ignorant man enters, there enter his imperfections. Wherever
                            ignorance resides, there are her attending angels, suspicion, envy and fear. Would it not be
                            more within the scope of true science to enlighten man about his true nature, than to invent
                            theories regarding the causes of phenomena which she does not know and which she can not
                            prevent? "That which is almost impossible by the unaided efforts of a single individual, may
                            often easily be accomplished by the co-operation of many, and this law seems to prevail in
                            all departments of nature. If a sufficient number of people were determined to retire from
                            the harlequin stage of the world and to turn away from the tomfooleries of a fashionable
                            existence, they may if they can harmonize with each other, form a power sufficiently strong
                            to repel the attacks of the monster which would devour them all if they were all separated
                            and unaided by each other. ' 'There have been at previous times as there are now, numerous
                            people who became convinced that there was a higher and inner life, and who desired to
                            surround themselves with such conditions as were most favorable for its attainment. Such
                            people were not merely to be found in Christian countries, but also among the 'heathen;' and

                            orders, monasteries, convents, and places of refuge have been established, where people
                            might strive to attain a higher life, unimpeded by the aggressions and annoyances of the
                            external world of illusions. Their original purpose was beyond a doubt very recoinmendable.
                            If in the course of time many such institutions have become degraded and lost their original
                            character; if instead of being places for the performance of the noblest and most difficult
                            kind of labor, they have become places of refuge for the indolent, idle and superstitious ;
                            it is not the fault of that principle which first caused such institutions to be organized,
                            but it is the consequence of the knowledge of the true nature of man and his powers and
                            destiny having been lost, and with the loss of that knowledge the means for the attainment,
                            the original aim was naturally lost and forgotten. "Such a degradation took place in Europe,
                            especially during and after the Middle Ages when, enriched by robberies and endowed by dying
                            thieves who wanted to buy salvation, they amassed great wealth and lived a luxurious life,
                            feasting on the fat of the land. They then knew nothing more of the conditions of a higher
                            existence; they became centers of attraction for the hypocrite and the idle. They passed
                            away their idle hours in pious amusements and in striving to gain material wealth. Instead
                            of being centers from which blessings should spread over the'country, they became a plague
                            to the land. They robbed the rich and vampire-like, they sucked the last drop of blood out
                            of the poor. They continued in this manner until the cup of their crimes was full, when the
                            great Reformation caused the downfall of many and the reform of the rest.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Social improvement society" TEIform="index"/>SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Allen, Catherine" TEIform="persName"/>(Leading paper by Catherine Allen.)</byline><p TEIform="p">Question. HOW far is it the duty of Believers, and to what extent will it be profitable for
                            them to co-operate with and sustain the various reform movements of the outside world, and
                            through what means should they co-operate? Answer. As a people, we believe we have received
                            revelations of spiritual truth which in some lines are in advance of any other religious
                            body, and this truth gives us power to lay the ax at the root of evil, which enables us to
                            live that new life wherein are embodied, as a whole, most of the reforms now in progress
                            among mankind. If this be true, we can only maintain our rightful position by leading the
                            religious thought of the world, which is always progressive; for it is only the husk of
                            theology which grows old, while in the kernel of true religion inheres a vitality which will
                            eternally renew and expand itself in the life of humanity, ever evolving from the dogmatic
                            and <pb n="156" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 15 6 THE MANIFES TO. superstitious to the rational and
                            comprehensive. If we have received light, is it for ourselves alone? is it not our duty to
                            let it shine? Every evil is a form of bondage. If we have found emancipation from one or
                            from many evils, then in obedience to the command to k'love one another," should we not do
                            all in our power to disenthrall our brother man? As part of the great life of humanity it is
                            impossible for us to advance alone. No separate good can an}'where exist, we can only live
                            by loving, by serving one another; therefore is it not vitally necessary to our existence as
                            a people to interest ourselves in every movement which tends toward reform and the general
                            progress of the race? As to active co-operation therewith, some will say;"We are too few in
                            number; too limited in means and not sufficiently educated in the required measure for
                            public work, either to honor our cause or to be helpful to those whom we would gladly
                            assist. Others may remind us of our calling to "come out and be separate" from the world,
                            fearing lest sympathetic action, even in a good cause, would lead us to condescend to the
                            standards of the earthly order and so we would lose sight of our own especial work. These
                            objections we will separately consider. First :As to our being few in number. The strength
                            of principle is not measured by the number of those who sustain it. One on the side of truth
                            is always a majority. We believe that to us has been revealed a testimony in whose potency
                            is the hope of the world for salvation ; should we not therefore embrace every opportunity
                            to publish it? and through channels most favorable for reaching leading minds such as would
                            open to us through efforts to support the many worthy movements of our time ? Second:Are we
                            too limited in means ? Shall we cozily enjoy the accumulated comforts which have been
                            bequeathed us through the sacrifices of those who sought "first the kingdom of heaven," and
                            in our abundance allow material interests to absorb those of a higher nature? If so, the
                            earth will kindly give us a burial place, while another people, braver, truer and less
                            selfish will herald our testimony to the world. Third :It is true that, as a people long
                            accustomed to seclusion, we are not at present educated in those lines which are necessary
                            to give us a leading or even helpful influence, where we would be glad to add our strength.
                            This is because so few among us have recognized our relation and duty to the outside world,
                            or have kept sufficiently informed of the many living themes and organized efforts for human
                            advancement, to be in touch with the new thought, new modes of expression and of action,
                            which would be essential for successful co-operation with leading minds of to-day. We must
                            allow our customs and habits of thought and life to be remolded, not in conformity to the
                            spirit of the world, but by the progressive spirit of the age, while we renew the sources of
                            spiritual life within ourselves, by studying and applying more closely those divine truths
                            which alone are the vitality of our Order. <pb n="157" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANCFESTO. 157 The
                            longer we refrain from this and from active expressions of sympathy with such movements as
                            tend to raise the standard of life in any direction, the less capacity we will have for
                            united action in our Community, and the less opportunity to make our life and principles
                            known to that of people to whom we look for the perpetuation of our Societies, also the less
                            prepared we will be to receive such as members. Fourth :Of the objection to assimilation
                            with the world. We think that the love of truth and of humanity which gives impulse to the
                            reformer, and that self-denial which is the underlying principle of every true reform, are
                            not of the world, but of the Christ spirit. All good is from the great central Good, the
                            goal of every progressive movement. Shall we then receive harm by affiliated effort with
                            those who are thus prompted? Lastly :By what means shall we co-operate with or sustain the
                            various movements with which we are in sympathy ? We suggest, by writing articles for such
                            publications as give them voice ; when petitions are to be presented to the Legislature or
                            to Congress, to sign our own names and use our influence to get signers among outside
                            friends; by cultivating ourselves in a clear and concise expressions of opinions so that we
                            ma}T occasionally be acceptable speakers at conventions. Although in intellectual
                            attainments we can not at present approach many of the workers in the fields of reform,
                            nevertheless there are many well organized societies who would gladly enroll us as honorary
                            or contributing members. They would look to us as a stronghold of moral and spiritual
                            strength if we would but extend to them the hand of fellowship. Could we not thus increase
                            our power for good without in any degree participating in the worldly spirit of party strife
                            and division, or otherwise departing from our most pure and holy faith? Are we fulfilling
                            our calling, or can we consider our past existence successful, if by the efforts of more
                            than a century there has not been conserved enough individual strength and vitality to
                            enable us now to take this step in advance ? Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            mind of any interested Christian, and nothing less, is quite evident. That it is a work
                            which intensifies the whole being and thru its demanding sacrifices, promises exalted
                            privileges, is at once an incentiv to do and to dare for the Kingdom of heaven's sake. John
                            the Revelator, thru the spirit of inspiration saw the aggressiv work of the Christian so
                            clearly illustrated that he presents it as a conqueror riding upon a beutiful white horse.
                            The warrior is equippt with a bow and arrows, as he goes forth conquering and to conquer.
                            The representation, is indeed, like a warrior upon the earth, and on this account may impres
                            itself more forcibly upon the mind, as a vivid picture of a living Christian in his duty for
                            his God. Some, however, may look upon it as a work in the spirit of the Lord, and
                            contemplate the time when the Kingdoms of the whole world shal becum the Kingdoms of our
                            Lord. Possibly the profetic order of life may see more clearly just how this is to be
                            accomplisht, and writh that form of solution it must now rest. The good apostl who had
                            consecrated himself to the spirit of Christ, has also illustrated this interesting feature
                            of his life in language not to be misunderstood, as he makes this record. "I hav fought a
                            good fight, and hav kept the faith." In these few words the whole of a religious experience
                            is most beutifully concentrated. Thru this contest with weapons not carnal, he had obtaind a
                            victory over all the enemies of God, and equally as essential, he had kept his faith in God,
                            that he might be protected and prosperd. This contest against evil and the securing of a
                            victory over the foes of our own household was so like a warfare against the enemies of our
                            common country that the apostl represented it in the language that was best understood. When
                            he addresses the Christian in the fulness of his life duties, he instructs him to make as
                            careful a preparation against the enemies of his own soul, as the Roman soldiers would make
                            against the enemies of their country. Nothing short of an aggressiv contest against the
                            worldly element, either at home or abroad, wil ever accomplish any satisfactory result for a
                            religious person or for a religious Society. It makes but litl difference how we may wish to
                            hav this religious system accomplisht, if we fail to act in accordance with its general
                            plan, <pb n="159" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 154 while it makes all difference in the
                            ultimate by the course we are led to pursue in its development. No one disputes the point of
                            the continuance of God's laws in the heavens and in the earth, or in the hearts of the
                            children of men. The sun, moon and stars go unerringly on their way, regardless of all the
                            wars and rumors of wars that may agitate the Kingdoms of this world. Seedtime and harvest
                            are with us agreeably to the early promise, and we share in all the blessings which they may
                            develop. Over all these wonderful works of God, and over many others equal]}' as wonderful,
                            man very fortunately has no control. The sunshine and the rain belong to no privilegd class,
                            and the just and unjust are made welcuni recipients of all these good gifts from the hand of
                            an over-ruling Providence. Whatever course may be pursued by an individual or by a nation in
                            the cultivation of selfishness, the race of man must be moving upward toward higher and
                            better degrees of goodness, and thru this, up to the Kingdom of God. These laws whether
                            adapted to our understanding or not, wil evidently move on without molestation. The
                            Christian's life interest, however, has all these blessings, and then we hav an extended
                            blessing, the basis of which is the spirit of godliness. This great journey with its trials
                            and burdens, is in all clearness up toward God, to a better disciplind order that shal make
                            men more like the sons of God, and this earth more like a home that is ruld in
                            righteousness. Jesus brought this work of the Kingdom into the very homes of all his
                            followers. It was like the voice of a trumpet that gives no uncertain sound. "If any man wil
                            cum after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me." This confirms the
                            testimony of the apostl who had receivd a disciplin in the life of Jesus the Christ. This,
                            said he, teaches us to deny ourselvs "of all ungodliness and every worldly lust." It
                            requires no studied effort to be abl to comprehend the full effect jf such a clear cut
                            declaration. No words ar wasted in the presentation, and no time need be wasted in the
                            transposing of a singl sentence. It is the unalloyd formula of the Christian religion, and
                            is the sure foundation of Christianity. It is the baptizm of the holy Spirit, and of fire,
                            which came with the Advent of Jesus the Christ. A neglect in securing this most important
                            treasure would be to any individual the falling away from a spiritual protection and equally
                            so, the wasting away of any society that has ever been blest with the revelation of light
                            and truth from God.</p></div2><pb n="160" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I look to thee" TEIform="index"/>I LOOK TO THEE.</head><p TEIform="p">"As the hart panteth after the waterbrooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God."Psalms,

                                cold weather for the month of May. Notwithstanding this, the cherry, plum, pear and
                                early apple trees which were abundantly covered with blossoms, escaped without injury
                                although we had several successive frosts. Sr. Anna Dodgson said we had twelve nights of
                                frost; we presume that an anxiety for her flowers seemingly intensified the cold. But it
                                was a curious fact observed by her, that just before sunrise the frost would gather on
                                the flat roof of the gas house when perhaps none was seen elsewhere. We attended our
                                first Society meeting June 9th and were blessed with many inspirational gifts from both

                                by the family. We are quite positive that the South family at Mt. Lebanon is the
                                Champion Chair Maker of the world. The work is of the very best and it is well known

                                of sale work in the line of sewing and knitting. The Brethren find employment in sawing
                                of lumber and shingles; some follow the Tailors' trade, and others work in the garden.
                                Our time is thus well rilled in performing the general work of a family of over seventy

                                of life it is grand and glorious to be able to have it said when we enter into rest that
                                we were worthy to be counted with those who are faithful. The boy who, taken prisoner
                                was ordered to sound the retreat on his bugle under penalty of death, and sounded the

                                some frosty nights, injuring gardens more or less according to the advanced condition of
                                the crops. We escaped with slight damage when compared with the loss of crops in some

                                powers that seek to hold down to the lower stratum of thought and life the expanding

                                prosperity, and as our little monthly paper is the only messenger to the distant lands,
                                we will send by it our kindest love to our gospel friends who are toiling for the cause

                                well requires rain soon, or we shall get a small hay crop. The Brethren have taken
                                advantage of the dry weather to shingle the meetinghouse which was built in 1794, and
                                the shingles have lasted until now. The boards of the roof were of excellent lumber,
                                evidently our early father's brought their best to build a temple to their Father and

                            preaching, or delightful music. Religion means, always has meant, always must mean, the
                            actual communion of the human soul with God in righteousness and holiness. And that kind of

                                    wrong of any and all questions in morals may be determined. Hence consistency on the
                                    part of persons who profess belief in the Christian Scriptures requires the
                                    rejection of all other standards so far as they may differ from the teachings of the
                                    New Testament. 1. No man is his own. Having been bought with a price, the man
                                    belongs to Christ, who bought him with his own "precious blood." 2. A man thus
                                    bought is bound to do as his owner commands, be the commands what they mayactive or
                                    passive, to do or to suffer. In thus obeying, the man in his body and in his spirit,
                                    glorifies God "manifests the life of Jesus in his mortal flesh," which is a
                                    "reasonable service." 3. A man has no right to endanger or lose his life except it
                                    be for the sake of Christcovered by command to do or to suffer, and governed by the
                                    Spirit of Christ. "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
                                    that hate you, and pray for them which despite fully use you and persecute you."
                                    "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus." "It any man have not the
                                    Spirit of Christ he is none of his"be what else he may. 4. A man has no right to
                                    give offense to any person. *'Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as
                                    doves." ''Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Church of God." 5. In
                                    associating with his fellows a man has no right to carry about his person deadly
                                    weapons. "The weapons of our warfare are not carnal." "Take unto you the whole armor
                                    of Godloins girt about with truthbreastplate of righteousnessfeet shod with the
                                    preparation of the gospel of peaceshield of faith helmet of salvationthe sword of
                                    the Spirit, which is the word of Godpraying always with all prayer and supplication
                                    in the Spirit." Thus armored "fight the good fight of faith""war a good warfare." In
                                    taking carnal weapons to defend himself a man thereby forfeits the protection of Him
                                    who said, "they that take the sword shall perish with the sword." Obedience to the
                                    Scriptures quoted will give to a Christian all the right of selfdefense which he can
                                    consistently claim, and no man in Christendom has any right not to be a Christian.
                                    "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." While
                                    obedience to Christ does not ensure against violence and death by wicked hands, yet
                                    it does ensure a divinely ordered protection which would not otherwise be afforded.
                                    If faithfulness be "unto death," the chief end of manto glorify God, is attained,
                                    and to enjoy Gud forewr is made sure. The "'glory" with which men cover themselves
                                    on a battle-field is but a bloody bubblean abomination in the sight of God"but the
                                    man who loses his life for the sake of Ciirist shall find it, and shall have given
                                    him "a crown of life." Self-defense or self-exposure is with the Christian, a
                                    question of small import when compared with the controlling purpose of life which is
                                    well expressed by the faithful Paul: "Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether
                                    it be by life, or by death." If faithful to Christ does not secure against death by
                                    wicked hands, then is it better "to depart and be with Christ" than to deny Christ
                                    and live a while longer with a tormenting conscience.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Christian Neighbor" TEIform="index"/>Christian Neighbor.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Blessed are they who do not run to the wood shed..."

                                Hastings is a work of some 225 pages. This separated nation is a brief historical
                                account of the Jewish people and written largely from a religious standpoint, with the
                                leading thought that they were at one time a race especially favored of God. The object
                                of the writer is to prove that God was the direct counselor of this nation and that
                                under this inspiration, Moses and other anointed officers directed the people by divine
                                commandment, and that their history throughout the whole earth is the most wonderful, in
                                every respect, of any nation that ever has or that now exists. To all biblical students

                                Heidelberg, and qualified himself for a lawyer. In 1848 he took part in the revolution
                                at Eome. When the Pope's rule was restored by French soldiers, William being proscribed
                                also in Germany, took refuge in Switzerland. He afterward emigrated to Brazil, became
                                naturalized and was made Judge of the only Court in the Colony of 10,000 inhabitants and
                                held this office for twenty years. He returned to Europe to visit his relations and then
                                came to the U. S. at the solicitation of his brother who desired his aid in publishing a
                                German paper. His belief in Communistic principles induced him to visit the Shakers of
                                Mt. Lebanon in the fall of 1884. In Dec. of that year he entered the Society with his
                                companion and has manifested himself a man of a clean spirit, and respect to the
                                discipline and regulations of the Community. He was gentle and peaceable and seemed
                                rather to submit to injustice, than engage in sharp contention. He was of the better
                                class of mankind, and we believe will be better prepared for his privilege here to
                                become a leader of that class to the higher truths of eternal salvation. A. G. H.</p></div3></div2><!--
