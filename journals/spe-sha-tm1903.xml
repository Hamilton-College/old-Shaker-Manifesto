                            her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." The inquiry arises, is this woman
                            typical of what all women may be? or is she in this case, an exceptional�an isolated
                            phenomenon r The human mind being capable of indefinite expansion, and of corresponding
                            elevation of life, leads to the assumption that all women may be so clothed�clothed with
                            divine energy, and be crowned with all the Christian virtues�with the practicabilities of
                            divine human life. Every star is a radiating focus, so also, is every Christian virtue. That
                            a woman so clothed should be a wonder in heaven, is evidence that the heavens are subject to
                            evolutionary elevations. Materialistic evolutionists are desirous to find evidence of
                            progress in creation, and for that purpose go down into the geological formations of the
                            past. No harm in that. If the lower forms of creation afford evidence of progress, the
                            higher forms of life should do so much more. Should men of science begin with themselves,
                            perhaps they would find that evolutionary capabilities are theirs, that they are in
                            possession of a higher, and of a lower human selfhood ; and that it is man's distinguished
                            and special prerogative to say which should govern ; we "being servants to that we yield
                            ourselves servants to obey." Men of science accepting this invitation may unfold themselves
                            into divine men, first, by subjecting all the cravings of their animal self-hoods to the
                            requirements of physiological and moral righteousness. Second, by loving the neighbor at the
                            expense of self. In thus unfolding, they would solve many, nay, all the pressing problems of
                            to-day. In these matters there is no time to be lost, it being noticed that it is the
                            educated, the men of property, the leaders of society, who by their various systems of
                            monopoly create criminals, and give birth to the anarchist. These leaders, instead of
                            monopolizing, and of denying to the hungry unemployed access to the elements of human
                            subsistence ; the way to these elements will be gladly opened equally to all. TheD, instead
                            of war, there will be peace. Instead of penitentiaries there will be communal homes. Should
                            these men happily unfold into,<pb n="50" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> and manifest the attributes of the higher
                            life, they will find, that in the heavens there is a Law of laws, a divine creative Force,
                            bringing willing souls forth into the likeness of a heavenly Father and Mother ; as was the
                            case with our ever blessed elder brother, Jesus the Christ. He was the first born of many
                            brethren ; as was also the case with our ever blessed Mother Ann the Christ, the first born
                            of many sisters. They were clothed with the virtues of the higher life. Hence, it was their
                            delight to be among their people as those who serve. We shall find in ourselves when so
                            clothed, the most satisfactory evidence that the heavens are the source and fountain of all
                            human progress, and of divine elevatious. 1 now turn to those who have been called into, or
                            providentially placed iu our communal homes. I have addressed those who are seeking to
                            unfold material thiugs, to unfold themselves into divine men, and to slough off the old man
                            with all his degrading lusts. Shall I ask you, are you clothed with divine energy? Is it
                            your labor by day and by night, to be crowned with the stars of heaven�the Christian virtues
                            ? Do you know them all one by one ? have you studied them? Is it the labor of your life that
                            these virtues be incorporated in your being? Does their radiance envelop your person? or
                            does your manner of going and spiritual attitude give a negation to these inquiries ? Being
                            clothed with the wedding garment is the only certificate of citizenship. "My son, give me
                            your whole heart." "He who is not with me, is against me." Communal homes can only be
                            sustained by a living exercise of the Christian virtues. Individuals fail because they do
                            not cultivate them. Because of a lack of these virtues the men-made communities of modern
                            times have failed. Where are they ? Where is "Brook Farm" with its high ideals, and its
                            cultivated men and women ? Where is the "Hopedale Community?" Its founder, Adin Ballou,
                            endeavored to give the marriage order opportunities to manifest "Christian Socialism." The
                            craving of the "lust of the flesh and of the mind" of the animal man swamped his labors.
                            Where is the North American Phalanx with its able men and splendid opportunities? Where is
                            the Russian Community of Oregon? Its members discussed themselves to pieces while
                            maintaining their sovereign individualities. The woman as above described was not there. In
                            organizing and maintaining communal homes, the presence of those who are clothed with divine
                            energy, and crowned with the stars of heaven�the Christian virtues, will be more and more a
                            necessity. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            were lowly ; but his soul was deeply toned to human needs. He was but a man ; but possessed
                            a soul so rich in gentleness and charity ; so full of love to all mankind, that God could
                            dwell within his soul, and work great and mighty deeds. Pure and stainless was his
                            life,�beautiful, true, and good ; and yet we crown him every day with thorns. Oh, how<pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> we pierce his hands and feet, and keep him crucified. When shall we
                            learn to love him as we ought. Not until we feel the need of living lives of goodness, truth
                            and love. It wns his life, and not his death, that makes us blessed. He is our.light to
                            heaven's courts ; and when we walk amid the poor and lonely, we shall feel him by our side.
                            We feel not his presence, because we go not where he walks. He is the way, the life ; and
                            when we feel no need of him to show us to the Father, we are not in the heavenly path. North

                            Almighty." Psa. xci., 1. This is one of the most sublime, poetical and profound passages in
                            the Bible. Deep proving and self-sacrifice alone will enable the Zion traveler to find this
                            "secret place of the Most High" and enjoy the invulnerable peace and safety thereof. The
                            road of selfabnegation and sorrow, and' sincere devotion to the good and happiness of other?
                            may not seem very pleasant to the beginner in this search for the "secret place of the Most
                            High," but will grow more and more bright and consoling the farther we progress in it. And
                            when one has once found this "secret place," this everlasting rest, no possible variety of
                            conditions, circumstances or external locality can evermore disturb the peace and serenity
                            thereof. Only get once beneath this "shadow of the Almighty" and nevermore shalt thou O
                            fainting, trembling mortal, "hunger or thirst, or the sun (of the scorching desert of sorrow
                            and adversity) light on thee, nor any heat." For that benevolent Hand under whose shadow
                            thou hast gathered i.s able at any and all times, to satisfy all thy wants and gratify all
                            thy Heavenly desires and holy aspirations forever. But what and where is this "secret place
                            of the Most High," this "shadow of the Almighty?" Jesus said "The Kingdom of Heaven is
                            within you," and also that it consisted of "righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy
                            Spirit." And Paul inquires who shall ascend into Heaven or descend into the deep to bring
                            down Christ or bring Him up, but<pb n="52" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> declared Him to be nigh to us, evea in
                            our hearts�that Word, which the Apostle John declared was in the beginning and "was with God
                            and was God." If God and Christ be in our hearts the Kingdom of Heaven must be there. In
                            every individual, there is an inner recess, a Divine Inmost, in fact a region of infinite
                            depth of spirit which has been explored but a very little ways by even the most spiritually
                            minded, and not at all by a vast majority of man kind. The portals thereof, remain closed to
                            millions of mortals during their entire life on the eai'th. The vestibule thereof is far,
                            far beyond all the rudimentalisms of this mundane existence. Occasionally bright gleams from
                            this throne of bright Glory are recognized by those far advanced in spiritual development.
                            After the agonies and deep proving of Job, (this story of Job is one of the most true and
                            beautiful allegories ever written) among other of his remarkable sayings is the following�
                            "There is a path which no fowl kuoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: The
                            lion's whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it." Job. xxviii., 7, 8.
                            Every spiritual experience though painful and proving, leads us nearer to that halcyon
                            abode. No sin, sorrow or sickness ever penetrated to its hallowed confines. "No lion shall
                            be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon ; it shall not be found there ; but the
                            redeemed shall walk there." Isa. xxxv., 9. 10. "The ransomed of the Lord shall return and
                            come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads ; they shall obtain joy and
                            gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall "flee away." This region of everlasting rest from the
                            sins, shams, and sorrows of this rudimental world is in us al!, and accessible to every
                            sincere seeker thereof. It is the microcosmic habitation of our Ileaveuly Father and Mother
                            to all intents and purposes and on the same plan, that they have for their habitation, the
                            great macrocosm. But the condition of accession is a complete surrender of our rudimental
                            self which we are to sacrifice wholly to the benefit and comfort of others. We cannot do
                            this without being fully organized, and in systematic arrangement. This organization implies
                            an enlistment under a banner recognizing the greatest good to the greatest number. This can
                            be reached in no way only by obedience to that law of the Universe by which "the less is
                            blessed of the better." This is best represented by what Believers term '�The visible order
                            of God." it is, however, only visible by its practical results. (Spirit, ord-T, faith,
                            grace, love, wisdom, &amp;c, are all invisible entities.) This visible order is made
                            manifest on earth by what are called Ministry, Elders, Trustees, Deacons, Members. Obedience

                            Apostle's prohibition of wives from speaking in the church, breaking the commandment by
                            adding to the word of God, when they stretch it so as to include all women ? Evidently, the
                            Apostle alluded not to free women but to wives, when he said "Let them ask their husbands in
                            their own house ;" and when he bade the woman "�be subject to the husband, as also saith the
                            law." That free women spoke and preached in primitive Christian congregations, appears from
                            the records. Thus: "Every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered, dishonoreth
                            her head." 1 Cor. xi. In Acts we are told "Phillip had four daughters, virgins, who
                            prophesied." In his letter to Rome, the Apostle salutes "Priscilla and Aquilla, my fellow
                            workers in Christ Jesus," placing the woman first. The Acts inform us that "Aquilla and
                            Priscilla took Apollos aud explained to him the way of God more perfectly." 1 Cor. xiv., 3,
                            explains prophecy so as to include all that we understand by preaching. Thus ; "He (or she)
                            that prophesieth, speaketh unto men, edification, exhortation and comfort." It appears quite
                            probable that Jezebel, spoken of in Revelation as calling herself a "prophetess," took
                            advantage of a privilege accorded to free Christian women, to shed her false, seductive, and
                            destructive influence. That women were not appointed presbyters, is accounted for on the
                            ground of woman's position in the society addressed. The Apostle appeals not to revelation,
                            but to the common sense of the people, the tone of which is chiefly due to custom, to
                            confirm his judgment in relation to covering the head. Why this appeal if that decision was
                            dictated by revelation ? Referring the matter to their judgment of what was comely, he asks
                            "Doth not even nature itself teach you thus?" Ch. xi., 13. This agrees with his policy of
                            "becoming all things to all men, that if by any means he might gain some," not to shock
                            their prejudices unnecessarily. Judging from reports of travelers and historians, the
                            present mental condition of women in Eastern countries, owing perhaps to seclusion and lack
                            of opportunity, or the absence of spur necessity, approximates rather the state of
                            childhood, than the strength and resources of mature age. And her administrative ability is
                            as much less developed than that of men, as there is less demanded of her. As a consequence,
                            society in that part of the world is stationary from generation to generation, and has
                            little if any sympathy with the restless activity of the pushing, progressive western mind.
                            Supposing women had shown themselves as qualified, and the customs and judgment of the
                            people had been favorable, can any valid reason be assigned why she should not have been
                            allowed an equal share in spiritual labors and burdens ? I can see but one reason aside from
                            custom and habits of the people, why she was not given equal authority with man, and that is
                            this. Woman had not then attained to the complete stature of true womanhood, nor to the same
                            level development with man on the Christ plane, by perfecting her intel-<pb n="54" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>
                            lectual, spiritual, and administrative capacity. The perfect archetypal woman, the queen of
                            the ages and of perfected humanity, had not yet appeared in mortal form to fulfill the
                            prophetic sign of the woman seen in heaven, the empire of religion, clothed with the Sun of
                            Righteousness, flooding the world with divine religious light and inspiration from the holy
                            ones. Crowned with twelve stars, signifying her royal descent, and that she bears rule in
                            heaven and in the new earth ; standing her full length above the moon, which here represents
                            those ordinances of the night of nature, given to rule man in his earthly state, in the
                            absence of the Sun, which here represents the higher and Divine revelation in Christ Jesus,
                            and his "Helper," the holy spirit of Truth in a feminine counterpart. Woman in this
                            character, which is clearly foreshadowed in the signs and types of creation and of
                            revelation, had not made her appearance when Paul wrote. Hence he said "We see in part and
                            prophesy in part, but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part shall be
                            done away." Here he intimates that the arrangements of his time were incomplete and
                            temporary, and therefore to be superseded by the perfect which was still to come. Now if
                            that perfect character has come to a few, or is unfolding in the many, will not too strict
                            adherence to the past and incomplete, shut from view the new and "perfect" when present, and
                            thus repeat the mistake made by Judaizing Christians in Paul's day? Do not the signs of our
                            time indicate that a change is taking place in relation to this matter, both in the custom
                            of our country, and in the judgment of its people? Women are advancing to the front, and
                            showing themselves as gifted with the power of oratory and as competent to instruct on the
                            public platform, and to inspire masses of people with holier resolves, as are their brothers
                            and consorts. Are they not also upright aad virtuous�their motives and aspirations
                            uplifting�and their purpose in theright firm and determined? Is not their reason, judgment,
                            conscience, under the inspiration of pure motives and free from constraint, as safe guides
                            to conduct as are men's? Do we not see many bright examples which prove that the childhood
                            of the sex is being exchanged in some, for the mature and perfect character of responsible
                            womanhood, answerable to the Creator of both male and female, for the use made of her gifts
                            and talents? Are those gifts bestowed to play with, and amuse juvenility, or are they
                            designed to be used in ministering to humanity's great need ? We call the Chinese fashion of
                            children's feet on full grown women, absurd and foolish. Is it uot a greater folly, to limit
                            the action of mind in this enlightened age and generation, to the measure and arbitrary
                            bylaws of two thousand years ago ? The mind of woman has grown and cannot be thrust back
                            into nonentity. For "the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth ; woman hath compassed
                            man." Even in Catholic France, M. Bautain, Professor at the Sorbonne, says "Women naturally
                            speak better than men. They express themselves more easily, more vividly, with more
                            simplicity, because they feel more rapidly, and more delicately. Hence there are so many
                            women who write in an admirable and remarkable manner, though they have studied neither
                            rhetoric nor logic, and<pb n="55" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> even without knowing grammar or orthography." In
                            1875, Evelyn M. Chipman won the prize in an oratorical contest between representatives of
                            eight Iowa Colleges. Her competitors were six men and one woman. Elizabeth C. Stanton is
                            reported as saying "Nothing surprises and delights me so much as to see scores of young
                            women, coming upon the woman's rights platform, and at once stepping to the front as
                            first-class speakers." The report adds "The world holds no finer orators, perhaps never has
                            held more logical and analytical thinker^ and speakers than adorn woman's platform today."
                            Dr. Parker says of Miss Willard, "Woe betide the ill-equipped exegete who crosses the path
                            of this peaceful warrior." With great force she says, "It is men who have taken the simple,
                            loving, tender gospel of the New Testament, so suited to be the proclamation of woman's
                            lips, and translated it in terms of sacerdotalism, dogma and martyrdom. It is men who have
                            given us the dead letter, rather than the living gospel. The Mother heart of God will never
                            be known to the world till translated into terms of speech by motherhearted women." (Public
                            Opinion, June, 1888.) To all of which, I say Amen. Did Jesus forbid the much married woman
                            of Samaria, or any other woman, to testify of him? It is not long since the papers reported
                            a case at Harvard University, wherein a prize was offered the students for the best essay on
                            a given topic. Out of the whole number of essays presented, the prize was awarded to one
                            written by a woman, student in the Annex. When the names of competitors were brought forward
                            and the judges discovered the sex of the writers, they changed the reward without recalling
                            their decision of merit, and it was given to a man, who, according to their previous
                            unbiassed judgment was not entitled to receive it. Because why? Did not th man need
                            encouraging, and was he not the proper sex to wear the honors of Harvard literati? Now this
                            one-sexed truth has not been able to lift the curse but momentarily off humanity, in
                            thousands of years trial. For man always to ride in the saddle, and woman always to trudge
                            afoot carrying the luggage, appears like a relic of barbarism, where all advantages are
                            seized by the strong. We put it to you, O enlightened and magnanimous ones; is it not time
                            to abandon dykes and dams built to confine the Truth to a one-sex channel and allow it to
                            flow unobstructed through both sexes, till all thirsty places receive ample supply ? For was
                            not this matter prepared by Jehovah, when he decreed that "Woman's seed" which "is the word
                            of God," whose "word is Truth," shall bruise or crash "the serpent's head." Most assuredly,
                            that word of Truth and prophecy of future conquest which is now welling up in the wise,
                            nourishing, Mother heart of humanity, is that "other Comforter" which Jesus promised should
                            guide his disciples into all truth, perfect their training, and continue with them forever.

                            philosopher's little daugh-<pb n="56" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> ter before he met the philosopher himself.
                            Knowing that the father was such a deeply learned man, the friend thought that the little
                            girl must have learned something very deep and grave from him. So he said to her, "What is
                            your father teaching you ?" The little maid looked up to him with her clear blue eyes and
                            just said the word " Obedience." This noble man was teaching one of the most important
                            lessons of life, and one which if not learned bv every one in early life will bring trouble
                            as a consequence. Too many parents and guardians neglect their duty in this respect; they
                            have a right to ask and enforce obedience. The command is: "Children obey your parents." A
                            story is told of the imperative government of an Austrian queen, Maria Theresa ; in her
                            household her word was law and none of her children ever thought it possible to disobey her.
                            At one time the companion of one of her sons died of virulent small-pox and was buried in
                            the royal tombs ; later a daughter was about to leave the kingdom for a union in Italy; her
                            imperial mother reminded her of her duty to visit the tombs before departure, as was
                            customary ; she knew then that her doom was sealed, but there was no alternative and she had
                            to submit; she went, said her short prayer as quickly as possible and left; she had caught
                            the disease and s oon died; this we must admit was rather extreme. Children of later times
                            are precocious and independent, and early assume the right and responsibility of their own
                            actions, chafing under restrictions and instead of being controlled, they are allowed
                            latitude in doing as they choose, and often in their tenderest years become impertinent and
                            insulting. If they were carefully and constantly trained from infancy upward, these things
                            would be avoided in a great degree, and parents would receive the honor due them and thus
                            save many sufferings and griefs of a broken heart. This same waywardness manifested in
                            childhood follows through the stages of youth, and maintains itself in haughtiness and
                            uncontrollable recklessness which makes them heedless of the experience of others; they
                            scorn instruction and are carried headlong into the gulf of dissipation and every kind of
                            sin, and consequent troubles which they might otherwise have escaped; many learn this when
                            it is too late. It is related of Minucius a Roman Geueral who acted in the second of the
                            Punic wars, that he disobeyed the orders of Fabius his wise superior, and soon found himself
                            in great difficulty in a war which he incautiously ventured to risk, and through which
                            Fabius kindly aided him ; afterward he addressed his army in the following words: "Fellow
                            soldiers, I have often heard it said, that the wisest men are those who possess wisdom and
                            sagacity themselves, and next to them, those who know how to perceive and are willing to be
                            guided by the wisdom and sagacity of others; while they are fools who do not know how to
                            conduct themselves and will not be guided by those who do." After this they all went to the
                            camp of Fabius and made reconciliations : there is much truth and goodness in this, and the
                            confession showed true nobility. The laws of military discipline are very strict and
                            imperious, and in theory<pb n="57" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> they are never to be disobeyed. Officers and
                            soldiers of all ranks and gradations must obey the orders which they receive from the
                            authority above them without looking at the consequences, or deviating from the line marked
                            out, on any pretext whatever. " It is in fact the very essence of military subordination and
                            efficiency, that a command, once given, suspends all exercise of judgment or discretion on
                            the part of the one to whom it is addressed ;" and it is said that a good general or a good
                            government would prefer generally that harm should be done by a strict obedience to
                            commands, rather than secure a benefit by our unauthorized deviation from them. It is a good
                            principle in social life where many are acting together, for it secures order and system. It
                            becomes us all to learn "from the wise and the unwise," and everything that passes before
                            us, and to yield ourselves to the impressions of good. It would be well if all would obey
                            the still small voice in their souls. All are susceptible to the feeling of guilt and often
                            suffer from it; by this cultivation we should have a moral standard and would be able to
                            follow the course of righteous duty through life unimpeded by evil, being firm in sustaining
                            and adhering to principles of truth, however much they may demand of sacrifice, this manner
                            of action will develop character of worth and high standing. Samuel Smiles said; "Obedience,

                                the document sent, proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution, to prohibit
                                the manufacture of alcohol &amp;c. I have read it carefully, and endorse it fully. I
                                enclose some of my articles, in addition to the one you ask for. As a religious order,
                                we prohibit the use of alcoholic drinks ; have done so with good results for the last
                                thirty years. Your Sunday legislation I do not approve. "This is not a Christian
                                Government," Washington declared ; and I fully agree with him. It is for all peo-<pb n="59" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> the inalienable rights of all. Every day of the week is a Sabbath
                                to some religious order of people. Each religion has its prophets, its Bible, its creed.
                                Do you not see that the province of government is to secure to all, what all have a
                                right to, without interfering with the reserved rights of any one? And above all
                                religious people should be just, and give to those whom some erroneously and
                                slanderously call infidels� like Paine, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln,�the honor
                                and credit of being the founders of our government and authors of our constitution. To
                                use the powers of the government against those who were its authors and founders, would
                                be high treason against Divine Providence and humanity at large. "Shall not the judge of
                                all the earth do right?"� Abraham asked in astonishment, the God of Israel; and I ask,
                                shall not those religious people, who claim to be, of all others, the servants of the
                                living God, be the first to do justice to the Rationalists, who, in the nobility of
                                their souls, framed a constitution that secured even to their most bitter, fanatical
                                enemies� the Christians so-called�the same freedom of faith and liberty of conscience
                                that they themselves desired to possess and exercise without let or hindrance? If we
                                love our religious enemies, and do right by them, will there be any danger of our
                                wronging others? Shakers make as high a religious profession and claim to be as
                                spiritual, as any other denomination. They live celibate lives ; own their land in
                                common ; use no alcohol or tobacco ; will soon (all of them) eat no meat; do not fight;
                                dress plain ; and labor to provide things hones: in the sight of all men. Yet they bless
                                such men as Ingersoll. for the truth he holds, and the good he does, and the evil he
                                refrains from doing: in other words, for the self-denial he practices, and because he
                                loves his fellow men ; they judge him by his deeds not by his belief. Church and State
                                governments generate Inquisitions. The highest form of human hate is when men and women�
                                whilst tormenting their fellows with religious persecutions, and even killing them�think
                                that they are doing God good service. Does the infidel believe in such a God, or love
                                his worshipers? Will murder, in any of its forms, convert him? Is that overcoming evil
                                with good ? I hope you Reforming women will "make haste slowly," and keep clear of Babel
                                priests, and Church and State legislation. Respectfully,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F. W." TEIform="persName"/>F. W.

                            the French astronomer, measuring the courses of the planets, discovered a certain
                            perturbation in their motions which he could not account for. Persisting in his
                            investigations he came to the conclusion that there must be a powerful body in a certain
                            region of the heavens whose attractive force was the cause of the otherwise inexplicable
                            irregularity he had observed. He had not the necessary instruments to verify his
                            conclusions, and therefore wrote to an astronomer at Berlin, asking him to search for an
                            hitherto undiscovered star ; and<pb n="60" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> as a result, within one degree of the
                            spot indicated, Neptune, a planet furthest removed from the sun, was found. Never was true
                            science, based upon deductive philosophy that aims to show the cause of established facts,
                            more triumphantly vindicated. Is there not an equally unerring process of reasoning
                            applicable to the moral and spiritual world whereby the perturbations and irregularities and
                            disturbances of conscious human existence may be explained? When examined into without bias
                            and with a purpose to know the truth regardless of pre-conceived opinions, it will be found
                            that the cause of human misery lies in the tendency to stray outside of the orbit of divine
                            law ordained by God. The modern school of agnosticism is composed of such as are
                            know-nothings by choice and of free-will. They belong to those who prefer darkness rathur
                            than light. Leverrier was convinced of Neptune's existence by no other proof than such as
                            the resources of his mind afforded. What was to him absolute certainty, would have been to
                            others incapable of his comprehensive grasp, but idle speculation. God exists whether I
                            believe in his existence or not. For any one to deny his existence is to assume that he
                            knows more than the vast majority of all ages, who in oue form or another, acknowledged the
                            Supreme Being; or, it is the virtual admission of being of such density of mind that the
                            same evidence which sufficed unnumbered millions is not enough for him. Men may be wicked
                            and depraved from one cause or another, and still believe in God ; but to deliberately deny
                            his being requires an effort of the mind and a hardening of the heart, and it may be
                            questioned if it is sincere after all for it is unnatural. Some great sorrow or bereavement,
                            some great misfortune or affliction, some crisis in life when the long repressed depths of
                            emotion are broken up and the utter helplessness of human nature becomes apparent will cause
                            the soul instinctively to cry to God for that aid without which it is impossible to bear the
                            burden and live. Yes, it is suffering that brings us home to God. Queen Louise of Prussia,
                            fleeing from the capitol before the usurper, accompanied by her children, (one of whom was
                            lately laid to the tomb as the greatest monarch of Europe) stopping at a wretched house by
                            the wayside, wrote with a diamond ring upon a windowpane : Who ne'er his bread with tears
                            did eat, Who ne'er in nights of deepest sorrow Upon his lonely bed sat weeping� He knows you
                            not, ye heavenly powers. It is not the thoughtless children of ease and of self-indulgence,
                            the vain butterflies of pleasure and fashion, nor the learned, the great and powerful of
                            this world who know God best; but they who have passed through deep tribulation and have
                            become purified through suffering can speak with confidence of God in whose sheltering arms
                            they have found peace and rest. West Pittsjield, Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="My Dear Youthful Friends:--On coming across..." TEIform="index"/>

                            that very solid material which we call Iron, I purposed transcribing them for you, thinking
                            that you may derive some benefit from read-<pb n="61" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> ing the same. The heading
                            which of itself is suggestive reads :� "Increase of Value." Here are the facts : "A bar of
                            iron worth $5.00, made into horse-shoes is valued at $10.50 ; made into needles is worth
                            $355 ; made into penknife-blades is worth $3,285 ; made into balance springs for watches is
                            valued at $250, 000 !" You, who are somewhat interested in solving pioblems in Arithmetic,
                            can easily discern by a little close attention, what a marvelous increase of value the owner
                            of the five-dollar bar realized after it had been submitted to the manipulation of so many
                            and varied processes. Just try to imagine, if you please, what drilling, beating, rolling,
                            pounding and polishing one crude bar must undergo, to reach the highest state of excellence
                            named ! and how its intrinsic value was increased by every refining process ! Undoubtedly,
                            they whose duty it was to deal the blows, foresaw, that all the varied manipulations
                            mentioned were indispensable in bringing out the finer qualities sought, to fit this single
                            bar for extended manifold usefulness, so that, finally, not less than 250,000 persons were
                            benefitted, rather than one alone. This foresight must have stimulated the artisans to
                            complete the task. The writer, who penned "�Progress is stamped on everything which the kind
                            Father has made," confirmed a truth which we cannot gainsay. Now, if an object from the
                            mineral kingdom can be wrought into such perfection, who can limit the capabilities of the
                            immortal mind for usefulness, especially when the possessor yields its all "as clay in the

                            you, like myself, will dr w many wholesome lessons from the bare facts quoted. Some of the
                            most important of which suggest to us, patience in trial, humility under reproof, and
                            cheerfulness in self-denial. All of these conditions are necessary for growth in moral and
                            spiritual excellence. Adversity and prosperity are as necessary for mind culture as the
                            sunshine and the rain-cloud prove indispensable agencies, in bringing forward and perfecting
                            the fruits of the earth. Therefore, never yield to discouragement when severely criticised.
                            Remember the lesson of the iron bar and the beautiful passage in Hebrews, xii., 6, "For whom
                            the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every one whom Hereceiveth.' One more selected
                            story as related by Rev. Martin W. Willis, and I close this somewhat lengthy epistle. lie
                            says, "Two artists were once engaged to fresco the interior of a lofty cathedral. The
                            swinging platforms were prepared and they commenced their work. They were both ambitious in
                            their professions and spared no pains to render their labor as perfect as possible. One of
                            them had just completed the central figure, and was gazing upon it with intensest delight
                            aud satisfaction. In order to obtain a better stand-point, he moved backward a few steps.
                            The picture gradually swelled into bold relief, and again he receded, entranced with the
                            vision, until he neared the edge of the platform. Another step and he would fall a distance
                            of fifty feet upon the rocks and timber below. His companion, seeing him in such immineut
                            peril, with the greatest presence of mind, grasped a brush and covered the picture with
                            water. The astonished artist, immediately sprang forward to take revenge upon the<pb n="62" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> spoiler, but found him fainting upon the platform. He at once perceived that
                            the painting had been destroyed only to save the life of its author. So our Heavenly Father,
                            when he sees us enraptured with the scenes of the world, and moving backward to danger and
                            death, suddenly casts blight on the fair picture, not in anger, but only to call us back to
                            the arms of Everlasting Love. Please accept these varied lessons with an expression of love
                            and sisterly regard. Kindly ever,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Stickney, Asenath C." TEIform="persName"/>ASENATH C.

                            pleading with his brethren in the synagogue at Capernaum to accept the way of life. He
                            freely offers the Bread of Life, "Not as their Fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and
                            are dead," but says "He that eateth of this bread shall live forever." At this point we find
                            great unbelief, and contention ; but He does not cease to proclaim that the infinite power
                            of God can accomplish all things and shows what is needed is greater faith and a deeper
                            baptism requisite for the soul's redemption. As these great truths, at this time, were by
                            many, taken in a literal sense, they were indeed, "hard sayings" and knowing their hearts of
                            unbelief, lie said, "No man can come unto me except it were given him by the Father." At
                            this time many were his professed followers, perhaps attracted by the loaves and fishes, as
                            many are in this day. As the spirit quickeneth, consuming the dross, they cannot stand the
                            refiner's furnace, and like the Israelites of old, seek to turn back to the flesh-pots of
                            Egypt. But in all this backsliding He wielded the sword of truth even down to the twelve,
                            for one of them proved false, and in auguish of soul asked, Will ye also go away? AH through
                            the subsequent centuries this great question has stood out in bold relief equally as
                            important as when asked at the first secession of the Primitive Church. The past has spoken
                            for itself. The present and future lies within our power to prove which it shall be. Which?
                                Are<pb n="63" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> we as his followers to-day accepting or rejecting the eternal
                            truths that are so conspicuously breaking upon the spiritual horizon, declaring that
                            progression is the only means and hope of attaining true happiness. Some day sooner or
                            later, all have to decide this weighty question, and may all hearts as quickly respond as
                            Peter's, which the song poet so beautifully expresses� "In quick response my heart replies,
                            Lord, whither shall I turn ; Thou gavest to me eternal life Thy saving power I've known, 0,
                            Thy saving power I've known." Those who have fell and possess this saving Power, did not
                            attain it merely in moments of emotional ecstasy, when the popular voice chimed its
                            approval, and everything seemed attuned to the harmonious chords of the spiritualized
                            feelings. Not so, but rather when iu the wilderness of trial and temptation, and through the
                            thorny pathway of the realities of life ; by persistently bearing a daily eross against all
                            the propensities of an evil nature. Each battle that is won in the conflict of right over
                            wrong fills the soul with increasing joy and peace iu having obeyed superior convictions. In
                            the elements of Nature, some of the most beclouded days are often followed by others in as
                            great contrast ; so it is with Christian pilgrims, storms of sorrow may almost overwhelm the
                            soul, but if it is rightly anchored in the cardinal virtues; Faith, Hope and Love, they
                            shall surely behold the glorious dawn and cheering rays of Heaven's blessing. Sacred history
                            teaches that success consists not in the many, but in the devoted few. Gideon's army gives a
                            striking example of the unselfish and sincere, who had their trust placed in God. Thus the
                            three hundred Gideonites were victorious over the one hundred and thirty-five thousand
                            Midiauites. Does not the continuance of the present church depend upon the faithful efforts
                            of each individual member in cultivating greater self-denial, and in all sincerity of heart
                            striving to propagate the principles taught by our gospel parents, Christ and Mother. Thus
                            giving an affirmative answer in thought, word and deed to our Savior's important question,
                            Will ye also go away? All who are thoroughly iu earnest in advocating the great Cause, will
                            know eveu as Peter did, wherein lies this saving Power ; that it is, "Not by might, not by
                            pcwer, but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts."

                            duty, Matt, xvi., 24, and it is to be exercised in regard to every forbidden indulgence,
                            however pleasant, or presently profitable. He that breaks his own will in everything, and
                            resolutely resists his natural reluctance to prayer and gospel obedience, loves humility and
                            every good work, shows more power than another who can do it with more ease, with this
                            faithfulness we are led to believe that God is well pleased, and will reward us in his own
                            good time by giving us grace to do all these things with a willing heart. But first we must
                            be made truly sensible of the deep corruption of our hearts. See Rom. iii., 23. Then we may
                            use the more violence in prayer and general effort; but if we pray only, and do not resist
                            quickly the propensity of our hearts toward evil, there can never be such a thing as making
                            progress at all. Since the stubbornness of the flesh requires that prayer and conflict go
                            hand in hand, and as one writer truly observes, ''�Efforts to obtain righteousness are to be
                            made in faith." Heb. xi., 6. The same is a "fruit of the spirit, and the gift of God." "It
                            purifies the heart, overcomes the snares and temptations of the wond, is productive of good
                            works," even so, God is faithful to his promises, faithful indeed that calls, warns, and
                            moves our hearts by the promptings of his blessed spirit. O that we were faithful also,
                            punctual and immediate to follow in all things wheresoever he leads.

                                The mission of the divine Teacher introduces a subject...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">The mission of the divine Teacher introduces a subject that never grows old. The
                                righteousness that it demands of man is that which has ever manifested itself in the
                                spiritual resurrection order, or the life of Christ. "Except your righteousness," said
                                he, "shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise
                                enter into the Kingdom of God." This was, no doubt, said to the disciples, to stimulate
                                them to greater care and faithfulness in keeping God's Law and in having a deeper regard
                                for the admonitions of the prophets, that they might more readily accept his work, and
                                bring their lives more in conformity to the life they had accepted. The Scribes and
                                Pharisees, in many things, may have been faithful to the letter of the written law, and
                                honorable in their relations among men, but their general course in life would not
                                commend itself as a worthy pattern for the disciples of Jesus. The Teacher began his
                                work by urging his followers to make their paths strait, by changing their minds, and
                                instead of hating their enemies, to love them and pray for them, and instead of
                                afflicting or murdering their fellowmen, to become peace-makers and children of God. To
                                enter this new order of discipline was to become crucified to the life elements of the
                                world and to rise with Christ into the gospel resurrection. This new life or new
                                creation bore no likeness to that of the old creation. One had its relation in the
                                Kingdom of God, and was pure and peaceable, while the other was born of the flesh and
                                was earthly and sensual. It may seem strange, with all the plain declarations that were
                                made by Jesus, as having reference to the life he lived and to that which should be the
                                life of his followers, that so little of it is found to exist or even to be correctly
                                understood. Self-renunciation as taught in the evangely of Jesus, is not very
                                extensively accepted, not even by those who are the loudest in their proclamations of
                                religious loyalty, and most devout in their rhetorical prayers. Infidels and Christians
                                walk hand in hand when the subject is discussed, and all agree that Jesus, in his zeal
                                for God, over-stepped the bounds of propriety. That some of his doctrines, if accepted,
                                would destroy the whole system of domestic relations. Our Redeemer, the first-begotten
                                son of God, of whom it was said, "This is my beloved Son, hear ye him," may<pb n="67" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> now need a little of our advice, and we will say to him,�Not quite so
                                fast! "The Church cannot accept interpretations which would be injurious instead of
                                beneficial to the welfare of mankind." Of course not! The Church cannot accept the words
                                of Christ if they do not harmonize with the life of the world, which governs the Church.
                                Was it this uncalled-for zeal that broke forth with such a death knell to the relations
                                of the flesh, when Jesus said, "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I
                                tell you, Nay : but rather division. The father shall be divided against the son and the
                                son against the father, and the mother against the daiighter, and the daughter against
                                the mother." This form of doctrine, most certainly, would produce a disturbance among
                                the Christians who advocate the life of the world. The work of generation belonged to
                                the first Adam and his disciples, while regeneration was the work of the Second Adam,
                                and into which his disciples were called to enter. Jesus neither encouraged nor gave any
                                instructions for the improvement or for the continuation of the work of generation, and
                                his visit to Cana had no more to do with the institution of marriage, than the presence
                                of a Christian would have in a saloon with the rum-drinking that was going on around
                                him. Jesus went about doing good and whenever or wherever opportunity offered, he was
                                found preaching his mission of the coming of the Kingdom of God, by making the lame to
                                walk, the blind to see, the deaf to hear, and by casting out demons, from among men and
                                permitting them to enter the swine. So far was he from uniting with the world, that he
                                even said to those who accepted his mission, "Ye are not of the world, even as I am not
                                of the world." But,' 'Ye which have f ollowed me in the regeneration and have forsaken
                                houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for
                                my name's sake, shall receive a hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting life." This
                                presents to us the mission of Jesus, and into this he sought to gather his followers
                                from the world that they might be one with him as he declared that he was one with the
                                Father. But there are not wanting able and learned men, and those who may be called Rev.
                                Christian guides, who stand ready to denounce any attempt to live a life of practical
                                righteousness. These worldly-wise men are free to inform their hearers that, "The
                                transient and disastrous attempt at communism in the first dajTs of the Church of
                                Jerusalem was always partial, was very early abandoned and perhaps had its share in
                                plunging that church into a misery and pauperism deeper than prevailed in any other
                                Christian community." What a compliment to the apostles and to the Pentecostal Church! A
                                disastrous attempt! ! That point, then, is settled,�What next? Jesus has said, "If my
                                kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
                                to the Jews." But the worldlywise men inform us that "under certain circumstances, war
                                is justifiable !"<pb n="68" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> With war comes all the horrors of brutality and
                                lust, as its legitimate results, and over these the Christians pray, and call them
                                justifiable. They have urged men to sow to the flesh, and of the flesh they must, now,
                                reap corruption. St. Paul comes forward as our Christian advocate and very distinctly
                                says, "I testify in the Lord that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the
                                vanity of their mind, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is
                                in them. But ye did not so learn Christ." May our God help the Believers to continue
                                faithful in the work of their gospel mission and in the maintenance of an unflinching
                                testimony against all unrighteousness.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hygienic hints" TEIform="index"/>HYGIENIC HINTS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="English, William A."

                                        elements needed to build up the tissues and organs, and replenish the waste
                                        occasioned by the various activities of the human body, this body will soon
                                        become unfitted to perform its daily functions. The following suggestions may be
                                        useful to those who are interested in this subject, at least, by way of
                                        stimulating further investigation: "Prove all things." The principal requisites
                                        of perfect food, (after being assured that it is outwardly pure and clean) are
                                        as follows :� First: It should be agreeable to the sense of smell. Second: It
                                        should be decidedly palatableThird: It should be (according to our reason and
                                        experience,) nutritious and digestible, and in such condition as to admit of
                                        thorough mastication and insalivation. Fourth : There should be sufficient
                                        variety, at different meals, and change, at different seasons, to meet the
                                        varying demands of the system. Fifth: It should be as fresh as possible; (but
                                        this will be further explained.) Sixth: As a general rule, simples are
                                        preferable : but in case of compounds, no ingredient entering into the
                                        preparation should be such as would be unwholesome if eaten separately. Seventh
                                        : No stage of the processes of securing our food, or preparing it for market, or
                                        for cooking, should be repulsive to our feelings, or to the sensibilities of our
                                        spiritual natures. Let us now consider the above points more in detail. First:
                                        The nose, from its position directly over the mouth, is a useful sentinel,
                                        always on guard to detect the aroma of every substance that comes near ; and we
                                        should heed its warnings implicitly, and allow nothing to enter the mouth that
                                        is repulsive to the sense of smell; yet this sense, like all the others, should
                                        be guided by reason, for it is not always wise to eat every article that "smells
                                        good." If the aroma is not masked by compounding or high seasoning, this
                                        agreeable smell simply testifies that the food elements are in harmony with
                                        elements previously assimilated, and by eating or drinking unwholesome articles,
                                        like tobacco and alcoholic drinks, we may finally acquire a liking for their
                                        aroma. The animals naturally obey the sense of smell, and never partake of
                                        anything repugnant to it. We could learn some lessons from animals, if we were
                                        sufficiently teachable. Second: Food that is not palatable is never perfectly
                                        assimilated, for the digestive fluids and nerve forces do not respond as fully
                                        to an unpalatable morsel. There are idiosyncrasies of taste belonging to certain
                                        persons, these should be duly respected, and generally are of pre-natal origin.
                                        Third � While considering the nutritious value of food, a practice which has
                                        grown out of the ignorance of the masses in regard to the essentials of proper
                                        food must not be<pb n="69" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> overlooked. I allude to the separation and
                                        exclusion of a large portion of the valuable elements of the grain, in the
                                        manufacture of superfine flour, which is so impoverished by this suicidal
                                        process, as to be unfit for the general use of those who eat to live, rather
                                        than to conform to foolish or fashionable customs. It is found that even a dog
                                        will starve when confined exclusively to the food products of superfine flour;
                                        and chemistry solves the problem for us, by proving that the better part of the
                                        elements that build up our tissues, are not to be found in such flour. Grains in
                                        their natural condition, boiled whole, cracked or ground into meal, so as to
                                        retain all these elements, form a highly nutritious class of foods, and,
                                        together with the leguminous seeds, (peas, beans, lentils, etc.) and nuts,
                                        comprise our most nutritious foods. Each individual seed, kernel, or nut
                                        contains a germ of life, capable, under favorable conditions, of developing to
                                        such* an extent as to reproduce its species. It would seem a very natural
                                        inference that food containing so much of the life-principle must be superior,
                                        in dietetic value, to food taken from the carcass or tissues of an animal, from
                                        which not only the life-blood but the life-principle itself�the organizing
                                        force�has departed. The various classes of seeds above mentioned, with fresh
                                        vegetables in their season, and fruits to supply the necessary fluid elements,
                                        combined with aromas and flavors of such wonderful delicacy and variety,
                                        together with milk, butter, cheese, (and possibly eggs,) form a dietary fit for
                                        a king, or for an American citizen; each one of whom should be a true king. But
                                        the question of the digestibility of food cannot be reduced to cast-iron rules,
                                        owing to different conditions arising from previous habits, environments, etc.,
                                        and, though vegetarianism is undoubtedly the ideal dietary, it would be very
                                        unwise to counsel all people to adopt it at once; for, by ages of flesh eating,
                                        the digestive organs become so accustomed to it, that, with most people, its
                                        sudden disuse, would be attended with considerable physical discomfort. It would
                                        be folly to ignore any individual's experience, as to what agrees or disagrees,
                                        in the line of food; so, each one must, in a large measure, be his or her own
                                        judge, yet we should endeavor to perfect our ideals; and our appetites and
                                        desires will gradually conform to them. * * * Fourth: A monotonous diet is not
                                        adapted to the proper development of the race, or the individual. Our physical
                                        and mental activities are so varied; our temperaments so dissimilar ; our
                                        pre-natal proclivities, and our environments and habits so very unlike, that the
                                        necessity for variety at meals, and change from time to time, is sufficiently
                                        apparent. Fifth: All organic material used as food, tends to decay, after
                                        reaching its highest stage of perfection, and should be eaten when most highly
                                        endowed with the life-principle. This applies with especial force to garden
                                        vegetables which, not being matured, rapidly wither, and become stale and
                                        unwholesome. All kinds of flour and meal should be eaten as soon as possible
                                        after being ground, as it is then constantly parting with its finer
                                        liftelements. All food tends to deteriorate rapidly, after cooking; and, if
                                        allowed to remain long uncovered, absorbs atmospheric germs which are
                                        disease-producing. The more moist the food is, the more danger there will be.
                                        Milk, water, and all fluids cooked or uncooked, rapidly absorb injurious gases
                                        and microscopic germs from the atmosphere, if allowed to remain uncovered or
                                        unsealed; more especially in warm weather. Nuts and some kinds of fru\ts, though
                                        they will keep a long time, should never be eaten after their flavor becomes
                                        impaired. Sixth: Food that is compounded of different articles, and highly
                                        seasoned, should be regarded with suspicion, especially if meat is a leading
                                        ingredient; for it is customary with those who prepare these compounds for sale,
                                        to use a very poor article of flesh, and mask the inferiority by plenty of salt,
                                        pepper, and other condiments. Those abominations of modern cookery� pies, cakes,
                                        and puddings�which are made for gustatory pleasure, regardless of consequences,
                                        and often contain some of that delectable substance called lard, might, with
                                        propriety be given to that class of animal scavengers from which the lard is
                                        obtained : GO<pb n="70" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> they are not fit to enter tie human stomach�
                                        (unless belonging to some one closely allied �psychically�to the animal referred
                                        to.) No ingredient that is not first-class, should ever enter into any dietetic
                                        compound, and simple food is usually preferable. Seventh: As the occupation of
                                        gathering and preparing grains, nuts and fruits for the table is pleasurable,
                                        and not in any sense repulsive to our higher sensibilities, and as these kinds
                                        of food contain all the necessary elements of nutrition, why does man continue
                                        the practice of slaughtering innocent animals and devouring their dead bodies?
                                        This practice, unless one has become hardened by it, cannot be engaged in
                                        without experiencing a severe shock to the higher nature.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Esoteric" TEIform="index"/>The Esoteric</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Juvenile" TEIform="index"/>Juvenile.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Brother Daniel Orcutt:--Through the columns of the Manifesto..."

                                to address you; knowing its mission is to publish good news unto all. I can express the
                                thanks of myself and little friends for the many beautiful letters of kind advice, which
                                we have had the pleasure of reading month after month. Perhaps you would like to hear
                                something about us in our southern home. The weather is remarkably mild this winter, not
                                any snow at all. I go to Sunday School every Sunday and like it very much. Last year our
                                lessons were from Exodus to Ruth; this year they are and will be in Mark and Luke. I
                                have not missed a single Sunday. I feel that it is a great benefit to us little folks,
                                and I feel that we should do all we can to show our appreciation to our dear kind
                                teachers, who do so much for our good. Elder Francis Pennebaker is our Superintendent.
                                He is so kind and good, we like him very much. Our Sunday School has seventy-five
                                members. Dear Brother Daniel, "Kind words can never die," so may yours that are so
                                kindly given, be implanted in the hearts of all Zion's children to return again unto
                                you. Please accept the love and thanks of your many little friends of Pleasant Hill.
                                Hoping that we may hear from you again, we will faithfully strive to merit the love of
                                all, by following your precious advice.

                            principal and greatest foes are the evils of our own lives which rise up against us and
                            destroy our peace. Contention in the small affairs of life seems to be quite easy, and
                            altogether too frequent among us; but there is no virtue in it nor any worthy gain; but to
                            contend against, and gain victory over habits and vices that bring pain and trouble to
                            others, as well as ourselves, will secure immortal glory ; this I consider to be a good and
                            a necessary work, and I will strive earnestly, strengthened by power from above, to subdue
                            the errors of my life as fast as they appear to me. We cannot reach perfection in a month
                            nor a year, but if we patiently bear the cross, we shall surely win the crown and realize
                            the reward of our labors. It is said, that "He that conquereth his own spirit, is greater
                            than he that taketh a city." Too many fail to realize this, and seek to obtain fame and
                            honor on the battle field, at the sacrifice of Christian virtue, and at the expense of many
                            human lives; such, worship the god of war, but the laurels gained in this way will perish
                            before the true God. Let me "turn the battle to the gate" as the Scriptures say, and do the
                            true conqueror's work, win the Christian's victory, and bear the palm of righteousness. Mt.

                            too small. When the subject is se-<pb n="71" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> lected for us we often hear, I do
                            not know what to say. I cannot remember anything I have heard about it. I have had an
                            experience in regard to composition, which may be like that of many other young persons. But
                            I remember one little girl who was advised to write, and the troubles she met, and how she
                            mastered them. Her first trial was this� I cannot find a subject. At last this vanished when
                            a friend suggested, "The Snow." She then resolved to do her best, and the result was the
                            following. "Snow is pure white. It comes down from the sky in flakes. It looks something
                            like sugar, but � it is not good to eat. It melts when it is warm out of doors, and in the
                            spring it all goes away This is all I know about snow, but when I am older I shall learn
                            more." It was finished quite abruptly. The advice given by her teacher may be of some profit
                            to other writers. "First choose a subject which you know something about, and before you
                            write your thoughts on paper, have them clearly defined in your mind, and not waste time
                            writing words. Do not fill your article with quotations, and never repeat the same idea
                            several times, to fill out the sheet. Write just what you want to say and when you have done
                            this, say no more " If these few rules were carefully regarded, would we not soon learn to

                                    tree that is said to be the shittim wood of ark fame. Celebrated botanists from all
                                    over the country have examined the trees and agree that they grow nowhere else on
                                    the globe. They have decided that it is the shittim wood of which Noah's ark was
                                    constructed, mention of which is made several times in the Bible. The tree is medium
                                    size, with very dark,smooth bark, and the wood is of a bright gold color. In early
                                    spring the trees are laden with long, white blossoms, closely resembling great

                                than all previous issues. "Better" hardly expresses it�rather, we should say, far
                                superior. It has been changed in every respect; new cuts, new type, enlarged in size
