                            BETWEEN RELIGIOUS RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS TOLERATION.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Allen, Catharine" TEIform="persName"/>Catharine Allen.</byline><p TEIform="p">Webster defines toleration as the allowance of that which is not wholly approved�the
                            endurance of that which is objectionable, or of the expression of offensive opinions. Thus,
                            religious toleration is that which is granted to those differing in opinion from the
                            accepted creeds or tenets of the established church of a nation or state wherein
                            Ecclesiastical and State rule are united, as under all monarchial governments. Under such
                            conditions the property of the established church remains untaxed, and public money is used
                            for the support of chaplains in the army and for other religious services dictated by the
                            State, while none of the clergy of dissenting sects ever receive public appointments, but
                            must be supported entirely by the dissenters whose church property is taxed at the same
                            rates as any private possessions. Under this system we see that the State puts a premium on
                            hypocrisy, by thus making it pecuniarily more advantageous to accept a given code of
                            religious belief, than to declare and live by the individual convictions of reason and
                            conscience. The governments of Russia, Turkey and most eastern nations are unlimited
                            monarchies, where all religious sects, other than those of the established faith of said
                            countries, are subject to the caprice of rulers who may at one time tolerate and even
                            encourage the settlement in their domain of other sects and then without any reasonable
                            provocation, issue edicts for their immediate banishment, as is the case at present with the
                            Jews of Russia. On the other hand religious freedom is that which can obtain only under
                            republican governments wherein Church and State are divorced. It has its securities in the
                            recognition of a "government for the people and by the people," of those inalienable rights
                            by which man is endowed by his Creator, the most important of which is liberty of conscience
                            with the privileges of free press and free speech. By the Constitution of the United States
                            these are ours to enjoy in common with every class of loyal citizens. In the Declaration of
                            rights as first proposed the clause upon this subject read that "All men should enjoy the
                            fullest toleration in the exercise of re-<pb n="82" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 82 THE MANIFESTO. ligion,
                            unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate." To this Madison objected, pointing out this
                            distinction between the recognition of an absolute right and the toleration of its exercise;
                            as the latter would imply the power of jurisdiction. It was therefore so changed as to read
                            : "All men are equally entitled to the full and free exercise of religion according to the
                            dictates of conscience." It is recorded that in 1827, Lord Stanhope voiced the same
                            sentiment from the House of Lord's, in the following words :�' 'The time was when toleration
                            was craved by dissenters as a boon, it is now demanded as a right, but the time will come
                            when it will be spurned as an insult." Thus we see that toleration is opposed to rights, for
                            it is the granting of unmerited favors rather than the acknowledgment of inalienable rights.
                            We have said that under the Constitution of the United States, religious freedom is the
                            right of all loyal citizens ; but at the present time, it would be more correct to say ought
                            to be their right, for, during the twenty-five years a revolution has been going on in our
                            nation, moving with accelerated speed toward a reunion of Cfrarch and State. Not only is
                            this being systematically consummated by the Church of Rome, the mightiest and most perfect
                            organization in the earth, but Protestant bodies, almost as a unit, unwittingly are forging
                            the chains which in no distant day (according to her own bold declarations) Rome will make
                            use of upon all who refuse to acknowledge her authority. Already is persecution in the name
                            of religion going on in several different states of the Union. The Constitution of
                            Tennessee, declaring that:� "No human authority can in any case whatever control or
                            interfere with the rights of conscience," has not prevented decision by the Supreme Court of
                            that state against pious members of the Christian church, who, according to their
                            convictions had observed the Scriptural Sabbath, and on the following day quietly employed
                            themselves on the farm. By the instigation of their Christian brethren of other churches,
                            numbers of the Seveath-day Baptists of Tennessee have for that offence been tried,
                            convicted, and actually imprisoned with common criminals, and in their company worked in the
                            chain gang ! The silence of the religious press concerning these outrages, which have been
                            made public through the secular press, is significant of the general assent of the churches
                            to persecution for conscience' sake, and, by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United
                            States that this is a Christian nation, together with the act of Congress conditioning
                            appropriation for the World's Fair to its Sunday closing, the government has been made party
                            to religious controversy, thus practically making void the first amendment of the Federal
                            constitution. The promoters of these measures have boasted that "these are only the
                            beginnings." Thus we see that our supposed guarantees of religious rights no longer exist.
                            That liberty of conscience in America is a thing of the past, and that the degree of
                            toleration which we<pb n="83" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 83 are now allowed, rests upon the
                            caprice of an arrogant and aggressive minority who are able to sway the actions of our
                            highest magistrates in wresting from the people their most sacred rights. Verily, "Eternal
                            vigilance is the price of liberty." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            attendant on the preparation, printing and circulating of our monthly, which always brings
                            much that is good, interesting and instructive. 1 feel grateful to beloved Elder Henry and
                            to all of our Canterbury Brethren and Sisters who so honorably bear this responsibility. I
                            owe kind thanks to all contributors who have the interest, and spare the time to help fill
                            its pages for the edification of its subscribers. While I commend those who have acted
                            creditably in this respect, I admonish myself for enjoying so much the productions of
                            others, without adding my mite, and only offer as an apology that I am aware there are many
                            more capable. As I have had the privilege of visiting the Societies of Believers, East and
                            "West, with the exception of South Union, I am always pleased with the "Home Notes ;" they
                            renew my limited acquaintance, and carry me to the homes from whence they come, with
                            sympathy, when there is aught that disturbs and troubles, or pleasure and rejoicing when
                            comfort and success abound. The visits I so much enjoyed, the kindness I have with others so
                            bountifully shared, the order, beauty, cleanliness and godliness manifested in the lives and
                            homes of the pure in heart, ever awaken in my soul gratitude to the giver of all "good and
                            perfect gifts," and a realization of my and our indebtedness to gospel Parents, who suffered
                            physically and spiritually, that they might lay a foundation on which to build,�the
                            principles of eternal life. I have recently had the opportunity of visiting nearer home in
                            company with Elder Joseph and Eldress Harriet. We spent New Year's with the Canaan family,
                            and were much pleased with the lively interest manifested in all that serves to make a home
                            for the soul, as well as for the body ; mental culture not being neglected. Not long since
                            we were at the North Family a few days, the former home of Eldress Harriet, where she served
                            faithfully many years previous to moving to Watervliet; but to me it was quite equal to
                            going abroad, as I never spent many hours there before, since the first four weeks that I
                            was in the Society. Elder Daniel, Br. Walter, Eldress Anna and Sister Martha are awake to
                            all that secures to the home pleasant, attractive and protective conditions, and the inmates
                            are constantly striving to develop intellectually and spiritually. Jan. 22nd we spent with
                            them and at 2 p. m. had a heavenly meeting;<pb n="84" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 84 THE MANIFESTO. many of

                            Sisters with uplifted hand. Feeling that we want all the household of faith to share in this
                            blessing, who have known his care and interest in our Zion, we ask to have it inserted in

C." TEIform="persName"/>O. C. Hampton.</byline><p TEIform="p">Infinity is either one or nothing. I believe in the Supreme Being or Infinite Intelligence
                            which runs the visible and invisible universe, and which is the sum of all that is. The old
                            impossible nonsense of two Infinities, which logically, mutually and mathematically and
                            inevitably destroy each other I abandoned long ago, their very expression being an
                            unpardonable solicism. This Infinite Intelligence consists of Love and Wisdom, qualities the
                            same in essence but differing in manifestation. And again by this apparent law of
                            differentiation these qualities are shaded off into many other dual appearances as faith and
                            patience, sincerity and peace, joy and sublimity, male and female, positive and negative,
                            music and flowers, painting and poetry etc. etc., ad infinitum. Among human beings those who
                            are inspired with noticeable aspirations toward higher, holier and sweeter lives may be
                            considered as belonging to the positive class, while those who seem to be making no
                            noticeableupward progress may be conveniently catalogued as the negative class. In reality
                            both classes are inevitably progressing, whether they know it or not. Heredity and
                            environment are sufficient to account for all the characteristics of each class�the goodness
                            and worthiness of the former ;�the apparent badness and unworthiness of the latter. Then who
                            art thou O egotistical and self-righteous man that presumest to judge another? Jesus said,
                            "I judge no man." We are no better qualified to judge than he was. O what boundless room for
                            Divine charity he left in his doctrine for us to exercise toward all, enemies as well as
                            friends, the negative class equally with the positive What boundless love the Supreme Being
                            has toward the just and unjust. And yet Jesus requires this same love to all on our part,
                            for he says, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,"
                            and to show how literally and practically be requires us to carry out this injunction he
                            adds, "who maketh his sun to shine<pb n="85" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. ��85 upon the evil and
                            the good and sendeth his rain upon the just and the unjust." It is a lamentable fact that
                            the majority of us are inclined more to condemn the negative characteristics of our fellow
                            beings than to speak of and encourage their positive virtues, which after all are the only
                            real qualities pertaining to them�the only elements that will not finally pass away. Years
                            ago I heard a Brother (who is now in Heaven) say, "I think Believers would do far better to
                            cease dwelling on the negative side of character and encourage the positive only ; if a man
                            seems full of hatred, gently and patiently set forth the beauty and joy and peace of love"
                            etc. etc., so on throughout the category of the virtues and their negatives. If the love of
                            the Father is Infinite, He must necessarily love Judas as well as he does Jesus, because to
                            talk about degrees in an infinite quantity is nonsense. What a vista of joy and eternal
                            glory this opens up to us, what a stream of everlasting consolation, to be able to love
                            every being in existence and thereby enable all to finally reach the regions of unbounded
                            peace, joy and forgiveness we ourselves enjoy. What greater boon can fall to the lot of
                            finite man, to become infinite in love and savingpower to his fellow man. And this is
                            possible for us all. Union Village, Ohio,</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Those who fail to increase their spiritual light..." TEIform="index"/>

                            worthless, or to shirk the labor necessary to clearly apprehend them? Is that the true
                            method of progressive thinking?<pb n="86" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 86 THE MANIFESTO. To illustrate�In pure
                            mathematics, each word is a sign of one thought, or idea, and of one only. The words one,
                            two, three, applied to numbers, and square, circle, cone, applied to geometric figures, have
                            each but one meaning, and hence never suggests but the one idea for which it is the sign.
                            But the very nature of spiritual and metaphysical ideas, compels their representation,
                            often, by words used as signs for natural objects, and hence arises the use of figurative
                            and symbolic language. Is it candid, and the mark of a truth seeker, to ignore this property
                            of language, or to construe it falsely, in order to invalidate spiritual ideas clothed in
                            such language, because the ideas are distasteful to the natural man, or to stultify the
                            wisdom and character of the teacher; because said teacher does not conform his instruction
                            and practice to the ordinary course of this world ? An inspired Apostle of Jesus, described
                            a two-edged sword that goeth forth out of the mouth. All know that material swords do not go
                            forth from the mouth. But the testimony of truth, proceeding from the mouth of one who lives
                            it, does slay error that gets in the way of it, and hence its likeness to a material sword
                            with which men slay each other. Now as Jesus taught men always to bless, and never to curse
                            each other, but to overcome evil with good, as he compared his followers to children, and to
                            sheep for harmlessness, and sternly rebuked the use of a sword to shed blood, even in
                            self-defense, is it just or fair to interpret him as meaning a carnal sword, when he said,
                            "I came not to send peace, but a sword?" Does not the peace here spoken of, refer to man's
                            internal foes, and the sword, is it not that "testimony of Jesus" which separates good from
                            evil, light from darkness, truth from error, between which, no teacher that preceded Jesus,
                            (if not Buddha,) seemed to know where to draw the dividing line. The carnal sword was
                            already here, in so great excess of reasonable demand, as to render such reference to it,
                            meaningless. Moreover Jesus forever rejected that, when he rejected the proffer of the
                            kingdoms of this world through the Jewish national idea of a great military deliverer. But
                            the testimony, "Resist not evil, but overcome evil with good" continually, the testimony
                            against adultery in the heart, the testimony dissolving all carnal and selfish ties, and
                            abolishing all private ownership of property, including husband and wife-hood, was new and
                            evolutionary, most radical and revolutionary, and pierced a tender spot. This testimony is
                            of that spirit of truth, which Jesus declared "The world cannot receive, because it sees her
                            not neither knows her." As no one knows the things of man but by the spirit of man, so no
                            man knows the things of God, but by the spirit of God, which is one, incorruptible and holy,
                            in all its messengers. If professed light bearers refuse to see the higher spiritual truth
                            when it is proffered them, will they not lose the rank of spiritual teachers, even as the
                            followers of Aristotle ceased to be world teachers, by refusing to see the<pb n="87" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 87 discoveries of Galileo? No blame is attachable to inability, unless it
                            be self-induced, but perverted ability, and falsification of facts, will not aid a good
                            cause, nor bring a desirable reward. It has become a proverb that' 'Books have souls." Of
                            that character is the New Testament record of Jesus and his immediate disciples, covering a
                            space of less than forty years. What other book written by mortals, ever equaled it in the
                            amount and quality of mental pabulum it has furnished to souls hungering for spiritual
                            instruction? What other book of its size, contains so much truth in relation to man's moral
                            duty, spiritual nature and destiny, with so little admixture of error? What vast numbers
                            have been turned from error to righteousness, by conning its precious lessons, multitudes
                            have been thereby induced to lead better lives than they otherwise would. An attempt to make
                            Jesus responsible for all the wickedness practiced by pretenders to his name and authority,
                            is unfair and unreasonable as would be an attempt to make virtue accountable for hypocrisy,
                            or to make honest industry responsible for the avarice, greed, oppression and deviltry
                            practiced to gain an undue share of its products. Those who seek the wisdom which comes from
                            above, which is first pure and then peaceable, full of mercy and good fruits, will judge

My Dear Sister:�It is a lovely day, I am
                            sitting by the west window viewing the scenery that surrounds our beautiful mountain home;
                            my thoughts take wings and fly to you, and "as thoughts are things," did you not feel a
                            familiar presence, my lonely absent Sister? I remember the time when I was brought to Mt.
                            Lebanon; I was young and fond of worldly pleasure, and was greatly opposed to staying, where
                            I supposed everything self-pleasing and attractive would be denied me. You met me with a
                            gentle, loving spirit; and spoke many kind, encouraging words; showing me that our greatest
                            happiness was attained through selfsacrifice and devoting our lives to do good and be good.
                            Be assured dear Sister the impressions I received from those who spoke from actual
                            experience, and in whom I could see Christ's life and teachings exemplified, created in my
                            heart new desires and aspirations ; I was ministered to by a spiritual power that changed my
                            purpose in life. Oh how thankful I am that I have chosen the better part. I feel recompensed
                            for every sacrifice made and find true pleasure and peace of mind in following my inward
                            convictions of right and duty. I feel the necessity of looking to God for strength and
                            assistance, if we trust in his Divine power made manifest through his sacred order, we shall
                            "possess our souls in patience" and be inspired with hope and cheerfulness, these will
                            alleviate all niixict'.* s of mind.<pb n="88" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. "Mirth is like a
                            flash of lightning that breaks through the dark clouds and glitters for a moment, but
                            cheerfulness keeps up continual daylight in the mind, and fills it with a steady and
                            perpetual serenity." It is conspicuous in the characters of philosophers and holy men among
                            all nations, and they who are possessed of this excellent frame of mind, control
                            circumstances and conditions, and live as it were under the benign influence of God�of good.
                            We above all people should be the happiest, surrounded as we are by so much that tends to
                            the elevation of character, to purity of life and the recognition and practice of every
                            Christian virtue; looking not to a far off God who sits enthroned beyond the skies, but
                            seeking his presence in the hearts of those who are created in his and her own likeness and
                            image. What a beautiful thought this is, the acknowledgment, not of the Trinity but of the
                            Duality of Deity. Father, mother, one in spirit, but dual in expression, as we see clearly
                            manifest in all created things. And is it not better to follow our Master and exemplar
                            Jesus, than to place him in the Godhead, and lose the force of those intensely practical
                            human teachings, that made his life not only at one with the Father, but with his brother
                            man, ' 'He came to seek and to save" and "was the first born among many brethren." I often
                            realize what a good work of reformation and regeneration Mother Ann Lee, the founder of our
                            order inaugurated. Truly, her mission was a heaven inspired mission, proclaiming as she did
                            that mankind were under the power and dominion of sin, that the lust of the flesh was the
                            root of all evil, and produced all the misery and unhappiness there was in the world; it
                            also darkened the spiritual understanding so that mankind were unable to perceive the truth.
                            When those who obeyed her testimony formed the communal homes of the Societies of
                            "Believers," they were based on the equality of the sexes. Woman, no more the slave of man's
                            desires, stands as his equal in the pure celibate order; and, since the establishment and
                            practical demonstration of righteousness, and purity in the domain of sex, how woman's cause
                            has grown; surely motherhood is broadening in the sphere of its duties and relations to
                            mankind, and when all sects and people shall acknowledge the Maternal Spirit in Deity, then
                            will extend the glorifying, ennobling influence that shall redeem and uplift the race from
                            all forms of gross evil and injustice to which mankind are now subject. There is so much to
                            interest and absorb our attention, indeed it seems as though all the great reforms of the
                            day were but the stepping-stones to the grand heights to which we all are climbing, and we
                            are anxious to see prosperity attend every effort that shall bring nearer the Millennium.
                            Loved Sister, your letters to dear ones at home, are to our feelings "as deep calling unto

                            MANIFESTO. 89 est to employ our time, we are encouraged with the progress we are making.
                            There have been some interesting articles read, one or more of those concerning societies,
                            organizations, reform movements, etc. One member has written beautifully of the "King's
                            Daughters," and of the society for the "Prevention of Cruelty to Animals," including the
                            Bands of Mercy for children. Another member has written an article concerning the
                            "Temperance Movement," from earliest existence; she interspersed much valuable information
                            with well expressed, original thought of her own. Another member wrote nicely upon the
                            "Peace Cause" and the progress of "Arbitration" in the nations, its many bloodless
                            victories. One of "the younger members informed us concerning the "Brotherhood of the
                            Spirit" and "School of the Christ," an organization in existence at present. The young
                            Sisters have a special singing meeting Friday evenings, for the cultivation and training of
                            their voices. While we are striving for intellectual culture we do not neglect the
                            assembling of ourselves together for worship. We have had some beautiful spiritual meetings.
                            The Christmas tide was very enjoyable. With new songs and interchange of many gifts, morning
                            service, afternoon entertainment which was made up of original conti'ibutions and music, the
                            day was profitably spent. We do not make merry and feast as the worli feast, and while we
                            had a bountiful repast, we were thankful that no harmless creature yielded up its life for
                            our gustatory pleasure. Injustice and heartlessness are even at our doors; there have been
                            two evictions in the town of New Lebanon this winter for non-payment of rent and a
                            foreclosure of mortgage. Not only pride and folly, but selfishness and greed are in the
                            hearts of the children of men, and they fail to deal justly and love mercy. I feel
                            increasingly the necessity of dependence upon those higher spiritual powers that alone
                            sustain and uplift from self and sin. We know from experience that we grow in nobleness of
                            character and breadth of soul just in proportion as we merge our individual life and
                            happiness in the life and happiness of others. The beautiful adornments of the spirit are
                            meekness and purity. We shall be glad to have you return to our home and hope that you will
                            be blessed with renewed health and strength. We remember you in our prayers and hold you in

                            principles of our faith, and pointing out the benefit derived by committing thought to paper
                            in an orderly manner. Some may wish to decline the effort because of other duties, because
                            time will not admit of an elaborate or exhaustive essay, or because we do not wish to have
                            our papers read to the family. These are feelings perhaps natural; but, in the cultivation
                            of our faith, natural feelings of diffidence and indolence should be overcome. In answering
                            the question, Why am I a Christian ? I will first define what I understand Christianity to
                            be. True Christianity embodies the highest expression of divine truth, for the uplifting and
                            salvation of the human race. The Christ angels have inspired prophets as mediums to utter
                            saving truths suitable to the condition of the age in which they lived, and to the then
                            receptivity of the race, since the beginning of creation. Jesus, the greatest exponent of
                            Christian principles, gathered much truth revealed through other mediums : he reiterated it,
                            and was inspired with a further and deeper revelation; chiefest of which was, unity of
                            interest, in temporal and spiritual things, as against a selfish and exclusive interest. He
                            taught the grand principle of human brotherhood, and inculcated the sublime doctrine taught
                            in the parable, "Unto this last also, will I give a penny." The last man had only labored
                            one hour, but his needs were the same as the other laborers; he had stood all the day idle,
                            no one having hired him. Jesus said, "Take no thought for the morrow, what ye shall eat, or
                            wherewithal ye shall be clothed." Mother Ann said, "Put your hands at work, and your hearts
                            to God." This was better; and she had a stronger testimony against the lusts of the flesh,
                            and the generative nature, than Jesus bore. That is now admitted by many thoughtful minds
                            (in the world) to be the root of the evil tree in humanity, of which other evils are only
                            branches. I am a Christian, because I see that a united, consecrated interest in the welfare
                            of my associates and fellowtravelers on life's journey, cultivates my spiritual life, and
                            best helps me to overcome the lower propensities of my nature, and that, by contact with
                            other 'souls in the same work, my character is tried and tested, and my evil nature revealed
                            to me. I have the benefit of the struggles and examples of others to help in overcoming my
                            own weaknesses. I believe that this testing and re-testing of character, by contact with
                            others, is the only way by which we can gain knowledge how to avoid evil, and gain strength
                            to grow together, and to harmonize in good. It is the way laid down by the Christ spirit,
                            for the salvation of the race. In common with others, I desire peace and happiness, and I
                            know that the good and evil in me will not harmonize : I want to be rid of the evil and to
                            cultivate the good. A Christian life is the only way by which this can be done; therefore I
                            am a Christian. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The life is more than meat" TEIform="index"/>The life is more than meat

                            sevenfold as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his
                            people and healeth the stroke of their wound.'1'' Isa. xxx., 26. In this remarkable passage,
                            the prophet Isaiah evidently alluded to that progressive gospel work into which we are
                            called, and which was also foreseen in the vision of John the Revelator, when the seven
                            cycles of spiritual increase were repeatedly alluded to in prophetic language, as the "Seven
                            Thunders which uttered their voices"� testimonies, each with increasing power against the
                            man of sin. Also the ''seven seals" that were to be opened : successive revelations of
                            divine truth that should teach the laws of a more godly life. Seven is considered a mystic
                            number and is much used in the sacred writings of all nations, as well as in both the Old
                            and New Testament of the Christian Bible. The above passage refers to the period of prophecy
                            fulfilled, the Millennial state wherein a new heaven and new earth should exist. In the
                            symbolical language of the Scriptures, the moon represents the earth or civil government,
                            and the sun divine revelation or the Church. "The light of the moon shall be as the light of
                            the sun,"�indicates that the civil government and every thing pertaining to the natural, or
                            earthly life, shall be so perfectly controlled by the laws of truth and justice, so
                            righteous in all its bearings as to belong as fully to the kingdom of God according to its
                            nature and functions, as that portion of the human race called into the higher, resurrection
                            order which fortns the Church. Humanity as a whole to be as a great temple of which
                            Jerusalem was but a type ;�the earthly order, its outer courts, the spiritual order, its
                            inner courts. "The light of the sun shall be seven fold." This was prophetic of a church
                            that shall include all the truths that have been revealed in previous cycles. The seven
                            thunders, seven seals, and seven candlesticks�churches�each having some special truth. We
                            believe that in the gospel we are called practically to bear witness to every truth which
                            has distinguished all the different churches, and to embody all the reforms for which the
                            world are now working. When this is fully accomplished, Believers will be a strong united

                                against the elements of the world, and learning through these important lessons of the
                                cross of Christ what they must do to be saved from the sins of the old inheritance;
                                while they were battling against the elements in which they had been educated from
                                childhood, they, at times, found the bars and bands so strong that it required a heroic
                                effort to force a passage through, and allow them to rejoice as the conquerors of a
                                subtle enemy. Shouting and shaking are tame expressions by which to represent the work
                                of their religious battle, fields. It required the whole man, body, soul and spirit, in
                                the fulness of his powers to contend earnestly and successfully "against the spiritual
                                wickedness in heavenly places." And yet at other times, while under an influence of
                                divine blessing and the assurance of victory they would unite in a "union gift" and sing
                                these simple words. "The gospel is a pretty, little lesson to learn." The very
                                simplicity that was manifested in this peculiar gift, was in itself a valuable sermon
                                and one that inspired the soul with a zeal to do right. This lesson so easy to be
                                learned and so valuable to its possessor was the gift of obedience. Obedience to the
                                light that was manifested in the soul, and obedience to God's word and work. There was
                                nothing mysterious in the lesson, to be learned, nothing complicated and difficult of
                                solution. It was an appeal to the conscience and was found to be the wonderful hope of
                                salvation, and the power of the gospel testimony, through which they were to conquer the
                                whole world. Many of these men were soldiers of the Revolution and as they had fought
                                without reserve for the salvation of their homes and their country, they were now
                                fighting the batTERMS.<pb n="93" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 93 ties of the Lord with
                                equal zeal for a victory over the world. There was no spirit of compromise in this
                                warfare. It was yea and amen. It was the voice of God that was leading them on to
                                victory, and they pressed on with an assurance that they must receive the promised
                                reward ; the salvation of their souls. They zealously learned the lesson and obtained
                                the victory. The same pretty lesson is now presented to us and the same results that
                                were wrought out in their lives will be made sure to us if we are ready to accept the
                                precious gift. Not a word, not a note has been changed. It is the same warfare, the same
                                zealous testimony and the same faithful observance of gospel principles that will secure
                                a victory. Nothing that is obscure or undefined has any place in this manifestation of
                                the gospel of Christ. It is in the light and where the light of God shines there can be
                                no darkness nor mystery. When our good Elder H. L. Eads wrote, from the scriptures,
                                "Other foundations can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ," he had
                                reference to just this very thing; obedience was his watchword. Obedience to the truth ;
                                obedience to that spiritual light which directs the soul to the cross of Christ. Jesus
                                in speaking of his gospel ministry has emphatically given this a prominent place, as he
                                says. "Not my will, but thine be done." It was the willing obedience of an enlightened
                                soul. It was a foundation of righteousness upon which one could stand and feel secure
                                from all harm. It was a little simple lesson which every one could learn and which would
                                assure them as Jesus himself had said, an hundred fold in this time and in the world to
                                come eternal life.</p></div3><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p">An article in memory of our Sister, Asenath Russell, was received too late for

                                it was a constant strife with Brethren and workmen, to keep highways and pathways in a

                                is in an over-ruling Providence, believing that if we rely steadfastly on Him, working

                                presence was like a benediction, and whose countenances beamed with the light of purity.
                                While biding our time here, may we wisely copy their Christian magnanimity and emulate
                                their virtues. We fully concur in the opinion so warmy expressed in the March No. of

                                those united to us by like ideals and life works. True love for our fellowbeings creates

                                bloom with flowers of virtue and to eradicate from society that corruptibleness which
                                destroys noble manhood and womanhood. "Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our

                                Eldress Eliza Stratton, of the North Family, to the renewal of her former duties in the
                                Ministry. Some fourteen years ago she removed from the Ministry and became an
                                indefatigable Trustee, afterwards succeeding to the duties of Eldress at our North

                                again with a hearty and general welcome. As one comes, another goes, for the removal of
                                Eldress Eliza to the Church necessitates a corresponding removal from it, and we bid God
                                speed to our Sister Elmira Hillsgrove who leaves us for the North Family to become
                                associate with Eldress Harriet March. Amid the various changes of life the uppermost
                                thought is constantly with us that the purity of life lived by all souls, compose the
                                Zion of God, and not houses, lands or a multitude of people. This thought leads into
                                another, that of all the papers in the land, our little Manifesto should be the most
                                spiritual in its'aims, from north to south teaching the use of all things as not abusing
                                them, with the constant injunction that all our treasure-stores are being laid up in the
                                heavens where neither moth nor rust can corrupt. This should bear the stamp of the
                                united effort of a united people, to render to God all things with equal gospel
                                non-reservation. With this full spirit of resignation, we become more united and receive
                                from the heavens a deeper baptism into the spirit of Christ, receiving with meekness the
                                power of God into our souls, we need never be afraid of becoming worldly or too deeply
                                engrossed with the various business duties that await our willing energies. Our Sweater
                                business affords us, by a steady receipt of orders, as much work as is desirable for our
                                spiritual growth. Sister Lucy Ann Shepard has temporary charge in the absence of Sister
                                Dorothea Cochran. Br. William Briggs finds scope for all his various resources of
                                mechanical ingenuity to keep the machinery in smooth going order. Our Br. David T.
                                Williams, as engineer, is unremitting in his attention and care, leaving no room for
                                anxiety in that direction May God bless our dear Brethren and Sisters who are working
                                among the intricacies of the machinery. Then there is Br. George St. John, who with that
                                forethought which his able predecessor Br. Arthur Bruce always exercised has already
                                taken time by the forelock in the direction of spring garden operations. He is attending

                                also have had but little water; probably the next will contain accounts of floods; so it

                                What a bond of union the little Manifesto is, on its monthly visits, bringing the best
                                thoughts from dear Brethren and Sisters. It must be the tree that "yieldeth its fruit
                                every month," and is for the healing of the nations. By the time these notes appear the
                                preliminary work on the farm and garden will have begun. What can be a more valuable
                                adjunct to and as a means of healthy living than a well kept garden where not only the
                                necessaries but some of the luxuries can be produced that will thrive in this climate.
                                And while the subject of horticulture is under discussion we would say to all lovers of
                                melons, that they can be had from two to three weeks earlier than common by the use of a
                                cold frame, glass, without bottom heat cut sod about six inches square and four inches
                                thick from rich pasture land, invert and plant under glass early enough so that by the
                                time out-door planting is ready they will have made growth to their fourth or sixth leaf
                                and be ready to set in the open ground. A tastefully arranged and neatly kept flower bed
                                in the lawn or dooryard is a source of innocent pleasure and profit to young and old. We
                                know of no one flower that will give such a magnificent display and is as hardy as
                                Drummond Phlox. Every lover of flowers must make his own selection. The kinds that can
                                be selected from, are legion. The wish from our beloved Brother, Daniel Orcutt that the
                                Manifesto could make weekly instead of monthly visits touches a responsive chord in the
                                souls of many of its readers. We are not given to indulge in flattery but would say with
                                honest feelings, may the Editorial shadow never grow less, and all of the workers on our
                                little missionary feel their hearts encouraged and their hands strengthened. We remember
                                the words of Lawrence, "Don't give up the ship," and though at times out of sight of
                                land we know that we have a pilot who is safe and we shall yet enter our port of

                                suffered to establish freedom of conscience. We can take all the comfort that is
                                vouchsafed to us by the cross of Christ, whereby we are crucified to the world and the
                                world to us. The elements of the world we are leaving behind, and are looking forward to
                                the prize of our high calling which is in Christ; to the power that saves from sin and a

                                last week what we have here in Massachusetts, in the line of snowstorms. For five days
                                we have had two yoke of oxen and a pair of horses trying to make the roads passable
                                again, and yet they are anything but good roads now. But perseverance, no doubt, will
                                bring about good results. It has been quite different with us from what it was with
                                Sambo. When his master was complaining of the rainy weather, he looked up into his
                                master's face with his familiar smile and remarked:�"More rain, more rest, Massa." With
                                us it has been, more snow and wind, more hard work, Massa, But it is a long lane that
                                has no turning. Our little boy after shoveling snow most of the day to make a path to
                                draw his sled, exclaimed,�Well, it will be summer after awhile and then we wont have any
                                snow to bother us. A good thought to look for the sunshine under every cloud, though the
                                thought comes from a child. In our divine service on Sabbath morning, we sung the
                                piece,� Joy and peace are my sunshine, And no day so overcast, But I catch the silver
                                lining Shining through the stormy blast." Could we think of this in the time of trial
                                and look for the rift in the cloud where the sun is shining, I think we would many
                                times, find joy in the trial instead of gloom and despondency. Trials grow by dwelling
                                upon them, like the snow ball, the more you roll it, the larger it grows, and the more
                                we carry trials in memory the less we have of the spirit of Christ. Dear Elder Henry,
                                your last Editorial meets the feelings of our people, and the more we keep that spirit,
                                the more growth we shall have temporally, as well as spiritually. In the world, but not
                                of the world. Having so much of the spirit of our gospel that when duty calls for
                                association, we carry our principles with us, and not come down from the cross. I admire
                                true patriotism in any class, and especially among those who call themselves soldiers of
                                Christ. A coward is one of the meanest things of God's creation. Out-door business is
                                quite at a standstill, as we are trying to finish up with our woodpile. A. D.

                                surely did. The teams were out nearly all of one week breaking roads. It took some
                                little time for the roads to get in condition for travel. The Brethren have well
                                improved the sledding, for one hundred and forty cords of wood have been cut and hauled,
                                ready for sawing, also one hundred thousand feet of lumber. To-day's rain has taken much
                                of the snow, and before long we hope to enjoy the warm sunny days of spring. The
                                Editorial notes in March Manifesto were excellent. May the strength and blessing of
                                heaven sustain the faithful watchmen of Zion, and may their days be prolonged for Zion's

                                        to any person, foreign to self, or to be wrested from oblivion, must be clothed
                                        in words. These terms, or words, then, simply represent thoughts or ideas, which
                                        have been formulated by the activities of the mind. That the expression of the
                                        product of thinking be clear, it is highly essential for the thinker to be able
                                        to employ terms, which convey his true and full meaning. If lie wants his

                                        must be thoroughly understood. This, of course necessitates a complete and
                                        accurate knowledge of the principles of the language, which he adopts as a means
                                        of communication. If the diction of an author is imperfect or ambiguous, his
                                        meaning is liable to be misinterpreted and he becomes a victim of severe
                                        criticism. All intelligent and cultured persons unhesitatingly condemn erroneous
                                        statements and incorrect phrases, when they occur in the field of standard
                                        literature, but there seems to be more latitude and liberty granted in the
                                        sphere of ordinary conversation and daily intercourse. Why such is the case, it
                                        is rather difficult to explain, unless on the unwarranted ground, that a thing
                                        which is commonplace, needs not be conformable to the laws of truth or
                                        restricted to an honest and faithful representation. Familiarity, however,
                                        should not breed contempt. Certainly a blessing or benefit, which is
                                        unremittingly conferred, should not lose any virtue or efficacy through its
                                        frequency. The sun suffers no contamination from its daily shining, nor does
                                        stellar beauty fall into corruption from its frequent glorious nocturnal
                                        decoration of the heavens. Neither should language be . allowed to be corrupted,
                                        on account of its constant use; but its purity and proper simplicity should be
                                        preserved at all times. It is impossible, perhaps, for the uncultured and
                                        illiterate to conform to the accepted laws of the language, as laid down in the
                                        text-books on grammar and rhetoric, when they wish to communicate their thoughts
                                        and desires to their fellow-men. Custom and habit are the only rules observed in
                                        making their assertions, and these serve as guides in their choice of words and
                                        expressions. The plea for purity and correctness in speech or writing, addresses
                                        itself, most particularly, to the learned, and those who are striving to reach
                                        the state of culture. The student, pursuing a higher course of learning, is
                                        confronted by its urgent claims, and he must, in one way or another, meet the
                                        demands, whether it be considerately and intelligently, or remissly and
                                        indifferently. He should be very careful in, the selection of terms in which to
                                        express properly his individual ideas and views. Here comes in a just demand for
                                        the exei'cise of guarding himself well against improper uses of certain phrases
                                        and words, which are found in ordinary conversation. Were less regard paid to
                                        customary and common expressions, and more originality and self-assertion
                                        manifested, there would be fewer erroneous statements. The great abuse and
                                        corruption, which the English language suffers at the hands of scholars and
                                        intelligent people in general, are due, not so much to ignorance or lack of
                                        knowledge as to thoughtlessness and hasty utterances. They are familiar with the
                                        principles governing the appropriate use of words and sentences, but fail in the
                                        application of them to their own peculiar needs. Unauthorized expressions and
                                        obsolete terms, as they fall from the lips of one who presumes to be learned,
                                        are very objectionable and repulsive to the sense of refined taste. Nothing
                                        perhaps detracts more from the efficacy and persuasive power of a public
                                        speaker, than a frequent or persistent abuse of certain rhetorical or
                                        grammatical principles. When he fails to clothe his thoughts in pure and fitting
                                        terms, his arguments fall far short of their desired acceptance and conviction.
                                        The cultivated ear calls for euphony and the harmonious arrangement of words
                                        into sentences, and whenever evident and conspicuous perversions of the language
                                        occur, it meets with an unpardonable offense. From such inaccuracies and errors,
                                        intelligence shrinks back with disgust and stamps the offender as unlettered and
                                        unpolished. It must be admitted that a strict conformity to the laws of the
                                        language can not invariably be observed. No one ever passes beyond the state
                                        where he is liable to make mistakes, even though he exercises the greatest
                                        caution and thoughtfulness. It is not, however, the occasional misuse of words

                                scenes well calculated to develop the better qualities in those who look at them aright.
                                We have had a very perplexing time with our water pipes, and the supply has been cut off
                                from the reservoir. This came about in consequence of the pipe which conveys the water,
                                (a four inch pipe,) being laid in the brook and for a considerable distance upon the
                                surface, depending upon the snow to cover and keep it from freezing. The snow did not
                                come until a long time after the frost, so the pipes were frozen and bursted. Several
                                times we thawed out and repaired them, covering them with straw, but all to no purpose,
                                except to get experience. After patching and wrapping several times with hands in ice
                                water, until they were well nigh past feeling, or holding, we got experience enough. Our
                                knowledge increasing, we added thereto wisdom, so that in future we will know just what
                                to do. We tried most thoroughly thawing by hot water, setting up a large kettle in the
                                brook, and by sprinkling the wood with kerosene oil, we got the water boiling hot, and
                                found by inserting a small iron pipe and pumping the hot water through, it was very
                                effectual for a hundred feet or so; but when we came to pump it three hundred feet, and
                                the water having no opportunity to get away, it became well nigh useless. So we picked
                                up our traps, put the kettle in order, and came home; quit using our water motors and
                                got a steam engine, ceased bathing in the tubs and prepared ten quart pails in which to
                                baptize. Then we went to desiring and wishing and praying that we might have a thaw and
                                some rain. Well, it was a long time coming; but it came and with a rush. We turned the
                                surface water into the reservoir and in a very few days it was nearly full. We have been
                                doing a little missionary work by advertising; the fruits of which will appear in due
                                season. As all are knowing to the demise of Elder Frederick, perhaps a little account of
                                the final winding up of his notable career would be interesting. Thursday, the 9th, was
                                the day appointed to do the last duties. A more characteristic day of his life and
                                ministration could not have been chosen. A born Englishman, in the full sense and
                                meaning of that word, ever on the alert to battle against error, and with his
                                iconoclastic club to overthrow false systems and theologies without mercy, the day could
                                not have been more apropos. The meeting house was prepared by starting a fire three days
                                beforehand, and introducing a large coal stove, and every preparation was made for a
                                large meeting. The roads over the mountain were in a very unsafe condition by reason of
                                the enormous snow drifts, but all the same, notice was given out and we determined to do
                                our best. Wednesday was beautiful; at 12 o'clock at night, the stars shone brightly; but
                                before morning the heavens began to pour out, and they did not cease to weep, except at
                                intervals, until the next day. In the morning we drove up to the grave, saw that
                                everything was in order there; shoveled a path from the house to the place of meeting,
                                preparatory to walking over; but the rain and the thaw came on so abundantly that it was
                                impracticable for the Sisters to walk. We had loaned the large sleigh to our Canaan
                                friends, and the roads from there were considered impassable, so they could not, or did
                                not come up. We had just bought a light sleigh, which was prepared to carry the corpse,
                                but this got broken before meeting, in traveling to and from the meeting-house. We tried
                                to borrow an-<pb n="101" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 101 other, but failed; so we took our
                                lumber sleighs, put the farm-wagon boxes on them, covered the whole with new blankets,
                                and put on the riding wagon seats, lashing the back seat to prevent tipping, and carried
                                the Sisters over amid wind and rain to the place assigned. The Brethren and boys put on
                                their rubber boots and walked. To the great surprise of everybody, whom should we meet
                                but Elder George Wilcox and two Sisters, coming from over the mountain, which was
                                supposed to be utterly impassable, wending their way to pay their last tributes. At last
                                we were assembled, and some few of our neighbors, and ready to commence the services at
                                1 o'clock. The meeting proper lasted three hours and a quarter; then came the the last
                                duties; the interment. As the traveling was so very bad, only those who could be of
                                service were appointed to go to the grave. Then followed a scene never to be forgotten.
                                The water was coming down the road leading to the grave in quantity sufficient to drive
                                a good sized saw-mill. Up a little distance, and over the cemetery, the snow from the
                                hills had slidden down, covering the track entirely to a depth of from two to three
                                feet. Nothing daunted, on we went till one side of the sleigh went down and only by
                                stopping the team at once, and all hands holding on to the sleigh, was it prevented from
                                tipping completely over. Struggling through the snow and water over the tops of rubber
                                boots, we got to the grave and secured some shovels, dug the snow from the upper side of
                                the sleigh to bring it down level, and from under the horses and in front of them, and
                                so came right side up to the grave. This we found full of water and running over. Down
                                to the house, by the short cut, to get pails; then we returned, bailed out the water and
                                performed the last duty. Getting home about 6 o'clock, we sat down in solemn reflection.
                                Elder George and company could not return over the mountain, even if they had so
                                desired. They remained over until Saturday morning, then took the cars for home. Thus
                                ended one extraordinary mundane life and a funeral service that was as interesting as it
                                was arduous. There was thrilling music in the whole of it. The apparent discords only
                                made the harmony more sublime. Music talks to the soul; and we have heard no uncertain
                                sound.

                            heartfelt desire to be led in the paths of purity and truth. The power and strength of habit
                            is often not realized. By cultivation or indulgence all habits are strengthe ed. If you
                            cultivate only pure thoughts, sinful desires can never find a place in your hearts. Bad
                            deeds can be developed only from bad thoughts. Fast and strong bad habits grow, swift they
                            lead to grief and woe. By yielding to sin you may sell your birthright. Spiritual death
                            awaits you in a life of sin. You must pay in suffering for every departure from right. A
                            temptation resisted gives added strength to resist the next one. Be on the watch when the
                            tempter assails. ' 'Praying always with all prayer.'' How can you pray always? By ever
                            cultivating a humble, prayerful spirit. Humility and watchfulness yield peaceful fruits of
                            righteousness. Oh the comfort, the blessedness of prayer. Heartfelt prayer is alone
                            acceptable. Prayer and watching will bring cheerfulness of heart and restf ulness of spirit.
                            "Prayer in all things�great and small things." To act with a pure intention, and with
                            reference to the will of God, is the best of all prayers. Practicing that which i's pure
                            makes you so in daily life. Build on virtue and you Avill be strong, watch and pray and
                            overcome wrong. Die to sin. Make sure of heaven. Strive for the crown unfading. Improve what
                            each hour brings to you of duty and of privilege. Duties not performed cause loss of
                            happiness. The path of duty is plain. Walk therein. Your Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Orcutt, D." TEIform="persName"/>D.

                                what we said. A good Universal History ought to be in every home; this is certainly
                                excellent, if not the very best for general use and reference ever published, covering
                                all nations (except the United States, to be published separately) and from b. c. 5004
                                to a. u. 1892. Certainly it is the cheapest historical work we have ever seen; but that
                                is what readers generally will expect from Mr. Alden, who has done so lu-ich to place
                                the highest class of literature within popular reach. To get such a vast amount of
                                matter within such small compass the type used is necessarily small, but it is
                                beautifully clear, and the paper, printing and binding are of the best. Send 10 cents to
                                Mr. Alden and he will send you a sample volume of UiO pages, containing the history of
                                several nations complete, by which you can judge for yourself whether you want the
                                entire work. His catalogue of choice books, 128 pages, sent post-paid for 2 cents,
                                presents a wonderful feast for book lovers. Address John B. Alden, Publisher, 57 Rose

                                Prof. C. J. Maynard, author of the "Birds of Eastern North America," says; "Contains the
                                best pictures of the species which I have ever seen." Dr. J. S. Newberry, President
                                Academy of Sciences, says: "The work is accurately and tastefully prepared, and I take
                                pleasure in recommending it as the most attractive popular exposition of our ornithology
                                yet given to the public." From Prof. Wm, D. Hornaday, Taxidermist, N. S. National
                                Museum: "I have carefully compared the figures in "The Birds of North America,' with
                                those in Audubon's great work, and am free to say that they are more accurate in outline
                                as well as more faithfully colored to nature." "A careful examination of this beautiful
                                work has given me much pleasure. Indeed, it is a great gift to those who love the study
                                of Ornithology." Editor, Manifesto. Samples of plates and text sent to any address on
