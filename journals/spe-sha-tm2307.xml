A   THOUSAND TUNES.
That's a large number, but the Symphonion plays it. The Symphonion is an unlimited
music box instead of a cylinder playing from
one to six airs. The Symphonion uses steel
plates as shown herewith.
These plates revolve and their teeth strike
the teeth of the steel combs, thus producing
the tones. Plates are changed in a moment.
They may be boughtby the hundreds and each
plate represents a different tune. One may
thus have sacred music, old favorites and latest songs of the day, as he chooses.
The Symphonion is simple in construction
and does not get out of order, as the old fashion music boxes always do. They are rich and
melodious intone and not the least expensive.
We are headquarters for the trade and are
prepared to quote lower prices than ever before with all the latest improvements.

TEIform="index"/>TESTIMONY OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, SEN.</head><p TEIform="p">Having had considerable acquaintance with the religious principles, customs and manners
                            generally known and practiced in this country; and having had experimental knowledge of the
                            operations of the Divine Spirit upon the soul, not only during my connection with the
                            professors of a popular religion, but also after receiving the glorious light of the gospel
                            now revealed by the second coming of Christ; I feel it my indispensable duty to bear
                            testimony in favor of this gospel, as the only means of salvation, the divine efficacy of
                            which I have faithfully proved. And having been personally and intimately acquainted with
                            those blessed witnesses of G-od who first ministered the gospel to us, I feel myself bound
                            to testify to the purity of their lives, and to maintain the truth of their Christian
                            principles. But before I proceed any further, it may not be improper to give the readers of
                            this testimony a sketch of my own life and experience. My native place was Durham, in
                            Connecticut. My parents were members of the Presbyterian church, in good standing, and
                            respectable in the world. I was brought up strictly, anl carefully instructed in the
                            principles of their religion. From a child, I w:.s the subject of religious impressions, and
                            had strong convictions of sin. When I was quite young, I well remember, while walking in the
                            garden one day, my mind was turned to a serious consideration, that death was the common lot
                            of all, and I knew not how soon it would be mine. These thoughts filled my mind with great
                            concern about what would become of me if that should soon take place. I saw at that early
                            period, that my nature was lost from God, and prone to evil. After this, I used to retire
                            alone and pray to God the best way I was able, and sought religion according to the best of
                            my understanding. I spent much time in secret prayer, when I was alone and exposed to danger
                            or temptation; and was careful to kneel and pray to God for protection before I went to
                            sleep. I believed that if I indulged myself in any wickedness, I should never see God in
                            peace, but should be banished from his presence; the thoughts of which I could not endure.
                            Still I could not subdue the carnal propensities of an inbred nature ; and therefore I could
                            not feel a<pb n="154" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 154 THE MANIFESTO. justified conscience, nor find power over
                            sin. On the contrary, I found my evil propensities grew stronger as I grew older; so that
                            after all my labor, I found myself still lost from God, and destitute of the power of
                            salvation. After coining to the age of maturity, my religious experience was considered
                            sufficient to entitle me to membership in the Presbyterian church. And being strongly
                            solicited, I became a member of that church, and made a public profession of that religion,
                            was instructed in their doctrines of election, decrees of God, imputed righteousness, the
                            resurrection of the natural body, and other doctrines maintained by that sect; and, like
                            other professors, I endeavored to conform myself to all their rules of discipline, and,
                            under the influence of those principles, for a time, thought myself a good Christian. In
                            1764, being about twenty-one years of age, I entered Yale College, where I pursued my
                            studies with assiduity, and was zealous to bend the course of my literary attainments to
                            theology, having a view to the ministry, according to the custom of the times. After
                            spending one year in college, I was sent on a school mission, to teach the Indians of the
                            Five Nations. Here I had many opportunities to learn the artless simplicity of
                            unsophisticated nature, in these poor natives of the wilderness ; and to contrast it with
                            the sophistry, superficial pomp and artful dissimulation, so common in countries and among
                            nations claiming the exalted benefits of civilization. This increased my views of the lost
                            state of the world, where the displays of genius and the artful refinements of civilized
                            man, in many cases, only tends to add corruption to a fallen nature. After spending one year
                            among the Indians, I returned to college; where I continued my studies three years longer,
                            and was graduated in 1769, and two years after, received the degree of A. M. During my
                            residence in college, my mind was greatly exercised respecting the Christian world,
                            so-called. It appeared to me that they were all far short of the order and power of the
                            primitive Church. I inquired of the most learned and able divines, particularly of the
                            celebrated Dr. Goodrich, of Durham, whether there was any regular succession of the order
                            and power of the Divine Spirit, from the apostles to the ministry of the present day. I was
                            informed that there was not; but as we had their example and precepts in the letter of the
                            scriptures, we could do no better than to follow them. This put me in a great labor. I could
                            not see how those who had not the Spirit of Christ, could be true ministers of the gospel.
                            Nor could I see how there could be a Church of Christ without a transmission of the same
                            power, in regular succession, down to it; because the churches, so-called, must, in that
                            case, be off from the primitive ground of the Church established by the apostles; and
                            therefore could not be the true churches of Christ. Nor could I see any way for them to find
                            the true ground on which the primitive Church was built, without a second manifestation of
                            the same Spirit<pb n="155" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> Till: MANIFESTO. 155 through some medium or other ;
                            since, according to the confessions of the most learned divines, Christ must be absent from
                            the churches which went by his name. From this time, my mind was directed to look for the
                            second coming of Christ. I inquired of the most eminent divines around, how long it would
                            be, according to their calculations, before Christ would make his second appearance. They
                            informed me that it was near at hand, and according to the best calculations that had been
                            made, it would be about twenty years. I have since observed that this calculation brought
                            the period very near to the time when the Church of the United Society began to gather into
                            order. About this time, in passing through the burying ground at New Haven, I felt my whole
                            soul absorbed in prayer to God, that I might live to see the second appearing of Christ.
                            After I left college I still felt strong religious impressions; but as I could not find any
                            who could show, to my satisfaction, any greater light than that of the church to which I
                            belonged, I concluded to continue my connection with it and seek religion according to that
                            system. And being fervent in spirit, I soon felt as though I had a call to preach the
                            gospel. After passing through a course of preparatory studies, under the instruction of Dr.
                            Goodrich and others, the call was approved, and I was licensed to preach, by an association
                            of ministers at Pittsfield, Mass. For a time, I preached where opportunity offered. At
                            length I received a call, and was ordained pastor of the Presbyterian Church in New Lebanon,
                            November, 1772. This was the first congregation ever formed in this town. I continued in
                            this charge about three years and a half, and endeavored to discharge my duty according to
                            the best of my understanding and abilities. But I could not find that spiritual substance
                            which my soul craved; although I felt a measure of justification in doing the best I could
                            do in my situation. I still felt a great lack of the spirit and power of salvation, and
                            could say, in the language of St. Paul, when speaking in the character of the natural man
                            seeking after spiritual life, "With the mind I served the law of God; but with the flesh the
                            law of sin." As I knew of no way out of the flesh, I conformed to the customs of the world,
                            was married and had a family. At tlie commencement of the revolutionary war, I was. inspired
                            with an ardent zeal in the cause of liberty; and in the station I held, contributed my best
                            efforts to my country's cause. The disorganized state of the society where I was settled,
                            occasioned by the war, induced me to seek a dismission from my congregation; and I obtained
                            an honorable discharge, with a recommendatory certificate from the association. Soon after
                            this, I had another advantageous call; but I did not feel myself at liberty to comply with
                            it, because my mind had begun to be awakened concerning that system of religion which I had
                            hitherto professed and preached. I saw that it was on a false foundation, and that it did
                            not and could not administer the power of salvation. This filled my soul with inexpressible
                                tribulation.<pb n="156" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 156 THE MANIFESTO. I labored and cried earnestly to
                            God that I might find something better and more substantial than I had hitherto found in any
                            scheme of religion, or among any of the professors of religion I had ever met with. I saw
                            that they were all, or nearly all, more or less guilty of biting and devouring one another,
                            and shedding each other's blood. I was led to see, and was fully convinced, that the spirit
                            of war, according to the apostle's doctrine, proceeded from lust; and that people could not
                            be the followers of Christ, and live in wars and fightings; because we were required, by the
                            very spirit of Christianity, to put away all contention and strife, and to ''follow peace
                            with all men." Hence I saw that war and bloodshed could not belong to the kingdom of Christ;
                            and that they who pursued this course of life, could not be led by his Spirit. Some of the
                            most eminent among the Reverend Doctors labored hard to bring me back to the old foundation,
                            and to the traditions of our forefathers ; but all to no purpose. I told them we were all
                            lost and blinded by these things, and that the true nature and spirit of Christianity was
                            not among us. The labor and tribulation of my mind increased, till I was driven to the
                            borders of despair; nor could I find anything to afford consolation to my spirit, or
                            alleviate the anguish of my soul; and I was only saved from distraction by the hope that I
                            should live to see the second coming of Christ; without which I could see no way of
                            restoration from the corruptions of a fallen nature, nor any deliverance from the shackles
                            of a false religion. I fasted and prayed to God, night and day, for a long time. At length
                            it pleased God to give an answer by his mighty power, which descended in divine operations,
                            and struck a death blow upon all my natural powers, and paralyzed every propensity of my
                            nature. It was then clearly manifested to me, by the visions of God and the spirit of
                            prophecy, that the coming of Christ and his kingdom were at hand, even at the door. These
                            gifts of the Divine Spirit, I considered as the fruits of my being baptized into the spirit
                            of that remarkable revival which took place in New Lebanon, and the adjacent towns. After
                            despairing of ever finding the real work of salvation, upon the old ecclesiastical
                            foundation, and hearing of this revival, I went to see whether I could find the work of God
                            among them. I first attended a meeting in Hancock, among the subjects of this revival; I
                            went, praying to God that I might know the truth, and be kept from error. I was soon
                            convinced that the Divine Power attended this meeting, and here I first received it. I then
                            requested the brethren "to come over and help us." They accordingly came to Stockbridge,
                            where I then lived ; and many there caught the spirit of this revival, and received the like
                            spiritual gifts. The substance of all those gifts evidently tended to show that the second
                            appearing of Christ was at hand; that a complete separation from all the creeds and systems
                            of religion known among professors would then take place; and that the way of salvation from
                            sin would then be made manifest to the people.<pb n="157" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 157
                            Although the spirit of that revival soon ceased, I still maintained my confidence in the
                            promises of God then given, and firmly believed I should soon see them fulfilled, and that
                            the second coming of Christ would shortly be ushered in, by a clear and evident
                            manifestation of his Divine Spirit. Nor was I disappointed in my expectations of this great
                            event; though the manner of it was beyond all human calculation. Its commencement was,
                            indeed, "as a light shining in a dark place;" and the messengers who first proclaimed the
                            glad tidings, were people "wondered at." The first direct intelligence I had of them, was
                            from Tallmadge Bishop, about the beginning of June, 1780. He was one of the first who had
                            visited them from these parts. He came to see me at my house, in West Stockbridge, and
                            informed me that he had seen a people who had all the gifts of the apostolic church, and
                            gave me a particular relation concerning them, which need not be here repeated. As I knew
                            the man well, and had knowledge of his former labors in the revival, I fully believed his
                            report, and he was indeed a welcome messenger to me. The next Sabbath I attended a meeting
                            at New Lebanon, where I saw Samuel Fitch, who had also been to see these strangers, and had
                            united with them. He had the power of God upon him, and was exercised in divers operations.
                            I felt an evidence in my soul, by the sensible operations of Divine Power, that this was the
                            fulfillment of my former prophecy, and was fully convinced that it was the beginning of the
                            second appearing of Christ, and the setting up of his kingdom on earth. Some years before
                            this, I had been afflicted with a long course of the fever and ague, which finally settled
                            in my legs, and produced a lameness that prevented me from walking much on foot. But when I
                            received this confirmation of the glad tidings of the gospel, and saAv and felt these
                            wonderful operations of Divine Power, it produced such a miraculous effect upon my bodily
                            powers, that I was enabled to set out immediately on foot, to go and visit these strange
                            people. And though I traveled about thirty miles the next day, I felt no inconvenience from
                            it.

                            and retire for the night. What myriads of hasty words and thoughtless acts, are forever
                            blotted out by its benign influence. Small token indeed ; but it is the little courtesies
                            that make up the sum of a happy home. It is the small courtesies that round off the square
                            corners so beautifully in the homes of laboring men and women. The simple "I thank you" for
                            a favor received, will fill with happiness the heart of the giver. True wealth is not
                            counted by dollars, but by the gratitude and affection of the heart. If a home be happy,
                            whether the owner possess a patch of ground of one or a thousand acres, they are in the end
                            wealthy beyond calculation. Then how much more lovingly are the folds of night gathered
                            around the happy homes ; how much more confidingly do its members repose their weary bodies
                            in the care of Divine goodness, soothing their overtaxed minds to realities of a beautiful

                            of Christ "on earth as it is in heaven?" What lesson of greater importance to the Christian
                            aspirant than to wait upon the will of our God, concerning those things, which perish not in

                            eventful past, bring us to a realization that we must work while the day lasts and walk
                            while we have the light. Hearts and brains are throbbing to the demands of this active world
                            of ours, pens are dipping into the momentous issues of our day, impulse born of necessity is
                            actuating many to renew the importunate knocking at the door of spiritual supply, and
                            prayers, deep and fervent, are ascending to the throne, from which has never proceeded a
                            negative answer. Light is breaking above us, and we are moving toward it, with the throng of
                            eager, anxious souls. The Sower moves also, passing silently through the masses, sowing,
                            sowing, "no respecter of persons." Here a seed, there a seed, "one taken" into notice, "and
                            the other left" for a season ; still the ceaseless tread of one who walked "the wine-press
                            alone," continues. "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground,
                            and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth
                            not how." The operations of God's spiritual work in the .souls of men are deep, hidden,

                            the tree matures silently, surely, without visible movement, so is the growth of the soul;
                            such is the establishment of the kingdom within. The hour which may prove the crisis in
                            mental conflict, the consummation of years of untold sorrow and contest, is known but to God
                            and the struggling soul; mortal eyes may brand it as indifference. The connection between
                            cause and effect is clearly traceable, when the effect is brought to view. "He knoweth the
                            end from the beginning." But it is the object of these simple lines to commend and recommend
                            those stages of spiritual growth, which must intervene between the cause and effect of our
                            salvation, as links in the chain of life span the chasm between the Here and Hereafter. It
                            is wisdom for the young to seek counsel; it is vigor and blessing in the measure to hold it
                            to the hearts of the experienced. The seed of truth is a gift of the divine Sower. Its
                            germination depends upon the condition of the mind which receives it. The necessary
                            temperature of humility, trust, watchfulness and prayer, must be carefully preserved. Should
                            the chilling winds of doubt or self-love sweep over the place, the development is retarded.
                            The food of thought, reflection, selfexamination is demanded daily by the swelling germ. The
                            air which is wafted from more flourishing gardens is a beautiful incentive to growth. The
                            salt, which loses not its savor, is a fine fertilizer. The waters of repentance, the
                            sunshine of love, perform a wonderful part in this wonderful work. No one of these salutary
                            conditions alone, effects the development of the seed of the Spirit's sowing, but the
                            combined operation of all produces that which gladdens the hand that sowed it, the heart
                            that matures it, and the eyes of all who behold it, The growth of the soul, as of the body
                            or a tree, may be termed endogenous. All that effects the external life, the mental
                            faculties, the thoughts, words, and ways that are the expressions of our life, works from
                            within, outward. The noble, self-sacrificing, religious element of our United Societies, the
                            result of all members moving toward spiritual life "as the heart of one," should be the
                            nucleus of a revival of soul work, to move as circling eddies from shore to shore of our
                            socalled Christian land. This is but the effect of a legitimate cause. As the mountain may
                            be reduced to individual grains, and the ocean to drops, so is God's missionary field
                            composed of individual souls. Christian co-workers, let us look well to the interests of
                            this hour, wisely, patiently developing the germ within, which will in due time shelter
                            souls under its wide-spreading branches; drawing them from vice, from the downward road; and
                            inviting to the pure, humble, restful blessings, with which our heaven upon earth and the
                            heaven beyond, are stored. In no other condition or ambition, may we, with our peculiar
                            religious calling and election, merit the approval or benediction of the Sower, who passed

                            Friends, can you, who are highly developed, spiritually, understand that to a person who has
                            lived only for the senses for the greater part of his life, the idea of being "spiritually
                            minded" is to him as Greek is to the unlettered savage. The writer speaks from sad
                            experience. It is no little thing to understand or to actually learn how to be "spiritually
                            minded," or to "think in the spirit." It is true the average intellect can be taught to
                            readily understand that at all times we energize, grow stronger in one or the other of about
                            three grades of thought; either the sensuous, or the intellectual, or the angelic part of
                            our life is being strengthened. But to get command of the mind sufficiently to control our
                            thoughts, with nothing to guide us but our unenlightened minds, must give the seeker for
                            spiritual light a little place in the sympathies of those advanced souls who have progressed
                            and ascended, step by step, up the ladder ahead of us. We are instructed to pray and to
                            meditate. It is true we can say the Lord's Prayer, and have a little set form of prayer; but
                            to pray with composure and to have any conception as to what we pray to, and bow our heads
                            when we have never cultivated reverence, is certainly not praying "In the spirit." And how
                            is a novice to meditate unless he is taught how to meditate aright? To form the habit of
                            correct thinking, is to revolutionize our entire being. "Unregulated thought wars with
                            spiritual growth;" and surely spiritual knowledge and growth should be sought for in a calm,
                            determined, dignified manner: and can no system be suggested? Will some kind Brother or
                            Sister who is now on a higher spiritual plane, please suggest some method to sincere
                            beginners, by which they can possibly gain potency day by day ? and not for years stumble
                            along with no method by w7hich to control the undisciplined mind, taking a step forward
                            to-day, and one backward tomorrow ; working themselves into a state of enthusiasm and then
                            suffering from the reaction which is sure to follow. It is in this reaction where the great
                            danger lies for beginners in spiritual growth; and if there are those above us, who by
                            persistent effort have reached a point of development where they steadily look up higher,
                            kindly suggest how they learned to preserve a medium, as we suppose it is only in that way
                            "safety lies." The writer has paid some attention to this subject of reaction which
                            perpetually seems to go on in our dual nature, something akin to the ebb and flow of the
                            ocean. We seem to rise up like billows to meet our God and enthusiastically hold ourselves,
                            so to speak, poised in almost a sublime atmosphere for a short time ; and then the
                            inevitable reaction sets in, and with a soul-sickening feeling we recede ; and doubts come
                            surging in; and the old, bitter, unbelieving spirit cries out, "Victim of imagination;"
                            "Self-deluded fool;" "You cheat your<pb n="161" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 1G1 reason into
                            slumber." Who has not found himself floundering in these waters, and cried out, "Lord, save,
                            or I perish ? " These reactions come and go in greater or less degrees, and possibly vary
                            with the individual, as to the quality or state of his three natures. We have tried to
                            ascertain if by any possible means, the probable length of time between these reactions can
                            be determined, and believe that although we may have an impulse to recede now and then, we
                            may, by carefully obeying the behests of our higher nature, triumphantly walk on the waves
                            for about three months, at the end of which time, a reaction will come. Again the question
                            presents itself,� Can a system be suggested in this all important subject of soul growth?
                            Could a systematic division of time be arranged which would be conducive to forming the
                            habit of correct thinking? Could a proper diet, or even fasting, assist our higher nature in
                            gaining and retaining the ascendency ? Could we learn to anticipate these reactions, and the
                            weaker ones be taught how to battle with them successfully, and learn to lengthen the time
                            between them until they disappear? We, certainly, take great pains in the training of the
                            physical part of our being. If there is any place on earth where conducive environments and
                            harmonious conditions can be found for spiritual development, it is in a Shaker Community.

                            have passed happily away in the last few years. What a community of saints they now form in
                            their spiritual homes. They are not alone, for souls like Channing, Brooks, Whittier, and
                            others who have made the world-redeeming creeds of Christ their rule of life, have now
                            joined their ranks, and are singing harmoniously together their song of praise. They have

                            seeing, may take heart again." Such souls never die and are still ministering spirits to
                            earth, with an influence more potent than while in their earthly bodies. The light of their
                            ministrations is dropping through the broken clouds of ignorance, selfishness and
                            inhumanity, and is cropping out through the civilized nations, and its beams are darting
                            into the dark corners of the earth. We see it in the spirit of humanity that is now so
                            prominent ; we see it in art and science, and its light shines conspicuously in the best
                            literature of the day. It shines in the bright pages of the Manifesto, for while its essays
                            and editorials teach the necessity of a virtuous, spiritual life, there is blended with it

                                    Scripture Lessons and the voice of the Ministry will press upon you, let me call
                                    your attention particularly to two public perils which threaten immediately, and on
                                    every side, the society in which we live. One of them is sensuality, in the three
                                    principle forms of luxurious living, intemperance in drinking, and impurity. No one
                                    of these three gross sins is confined to one class of people; for although wealth
                                    may be said in some sense to be necessary to luxury, yet among the middle and poorer
                                    ranks, hardly less than among the rich, in country and city alike, we see an eager
                                    passion for excitements and indulgences which are in no true sense moral or
                                    intellectual, but animal. We see the spreading poison of inflamed and pampered
                                    fleshly appetites- We see it at the tables and in the evening parties of
                                    well-dressed persons who are ambitious of a certain sort of gentility, but who eat
                                    and drink as if eating and drinking were the chief relish of life, rather than
                                    conversation, or books, or the arts of beauty, or any useful service to God or the
                                    neighbor. We see it in the vile illustrations of shop windows and the dainty
                                    foulness of a literature soaked in corruption. We see thousands of men and women of
                                    every grade of education whose aims and efforts, if the truth were plainly told,
                                    bear mainly upon pleasures which are of the body, not of the mind or the spirit. It
                                    is a degrading confession. It ought to put every one of us upon sober thinking. With
                                    all our boasts of progress and knowledge, we are yet living at so low a rate. Our
                                    public schools, free suffrage, general information, and enormous outlays in
                                    machinery, have lifted us no higher than this. Is civilization then only in what is
                                    outside of us, in abundant liquors, costly dishes, exquisite cookery, personal
                                    display ? Heathenism had them all, often Avith less drunkenness and less lust. Does
                                    not our Christianity need a new analysis, and another reformation ? The one hideous
                                    vice of intemperance has assumed such frightful dimensions as not only to desolate
                                    homes, and generate threefourths of our crimes, and consume health, and cripple
                                    industry, and impoverish the homes of the working class, but it aspires to control
                                    legislation, enslave the newspaper press, coerce town or municipal government, and
                                    even dictate the policy of parishes and the message of God's prophets in pulpits. So
                                    it has come about that, in all our communities, the men of Christ<pb n="163" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> the manifp:sto. 1G3 are obliged to choose their side, and take their
                                    place, on conspicuous public questions, by the principles of their Master Christ,
                                    and to act and speak and vote accordingly. The virtue of Christian manhood needs
                                    much bracing up. The moral power of Christian women in social fashions needs to be
                                    re-inforced. The moral sense that discriminates between right and wrong, truth and
                                    falsehoods, chastity and uncleanness, requires a keener edge and a bolder courage.
                                    These reformations we all know, demand a steady and lifelong struggle; but in the
                                    hard task shall we not be the better for the offered assistance of another Lent,
                                    with all the cleansing and invigorating force of sanctuaries, the Bible, and the
                                    promised gifts of the Spirit? The other special danger threatens most the safety of
                                    our children. If you ask yourselves the question how and where most of the boys and
                                    girls now growing up among us are expected to get a thorough and consistent training
                                    in the principles and practice of Christian morality, or in the elements of
                                    Christian character, you will, probably, in shaping your answer, come upon the
                                    appalling fact that I refer to. It will be acknowledged that such a training is not
                                    to be found, for a majority of the children, anywhere. It is left by the families to
                                    the common schools, and by the common schools, utterly engrossed with secular
                                    studies, to the Sunday schools, and by unsystematized and ill-governed Sunday
                                    schools (where vast numbers of the children never appear) to chance. We hear the
                                    note of alarm. Juvenile crime increases at a fearful pace. Crowds of the young of
                                    both sexes, without parents or any protection whatever from the worst harm, are seen
                                    on the streets every evening. Their manners in public conveyances and other places
                                    are rude and even immodest. They are already on the verge of ruin. In cities the}'
                                    are drawn into poolrooms, theatres, saloons, innumerable pitfalls. In rural spots
                                    too, they are not secure, because their moral life has not been nurtured and
                                    strengthened along with their physical and mental life. This generation has fallen
                                    thoughtlessly into this danger, losing in many ways much of the home breeding of our
                                    ancestors, and is just waking up to the discovery of it. The Church certainly has
                                    its Divine law, and knows its duty. It is pledged to educate as a Christian, and
                                    rear for immortal life, every child it baptizes. If it is recreant to that trust it
                                    can not escape the curse, in a disobedient, disorderly, profane and dissolute
                                    offspring. It is for the wisdom of our wisest men, clergy and parents, to meet this
                                    grave problem and to devise measures befitting its importance. Meantime, the holy
                                    obligation laid on mothers and fathers in their homes is clear. The line between
                                    good and evil is to be drawn sharply, and early. All possible light is needed, all
                                    possible counsel is to be obtained. The guiding grace of God is to be sought. Where
                                    shall it be sought if not at his mercyseat and altar? What better time to seek it
                                    than in these forty days of religious thought and communion?</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Lenten Pastoral" TEIform="index"/>Lenten Pastoral.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Do men gather grapes..."

                                requisites of the gospel work, as brought to us by the great Teacher. We have no
                                occasion to mystify that in which no mystery should ever exist. "Learn of me," said
                                Jesus, "for I am meek and lowly in heart." Even this simple lesson in the mission of
                                Christ is better than a volume of theology. Our Communities came into existence as the
                                natural outgrowth of this principle of righteousness. Jesus the Christ, our loving
                                example, was the source of inspiration that moved the hearts of those who were led to
                                believe that in God was to be found all life, all love and all truth. To draw near to
                                this spirit gave spiritual life, and this life inspired a love which could not otherwise
                                than result as Jesus has so carefully taught in his lessons to the disciples. "Thou
                                shalt love the' Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself." In this
                                manifestation of the great and good news which the gospel had brought, and which as seed
                                from the hand of the sower, was being sown in the hearts of men. All this was done in
                                the very spirit of "good news and glad tidings," to that extent that "the people heard
                                him gladly." It could not have been otherwise. It is in the very nature of man to be
                                interested in that which may better his condition in this life, and enlarge his hope in
                                the promises of an eternal growth in the world to come. Here enters the life of the
                                Community, the "good will to man." So soon as Jesus had awakened a love for
                                righteousness in his disciples, it immediately foreshadowed the growth of a Community.
                                It came forward as naturally as does the light, on the rising of the sun. "Cease to do
                                evil and learn to do well," was to be the occupation of the mind and the redeeming
                                feature in the life of man. Nothing was said about a theologiTERMS.<pb n="165" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 165 cal formula, or of an antiquated creed that should fetter the mind
                                of the Christian worker. That network of intricacies which sprang up at a later date and
                                held such authority over the souls of men had no place in the primitive church, and it
                                should have no place in our church. When Peter said to Jesus, "I have forsaken all to
                                follow thee," what did he wish to have understood? Why should he forsake the relations
                                in which he had a life interest, and follow in the footsteps of the Teacher unless there
                                was a more advanced work in which to be engaged ? Why did Jesus say to the rich young
                                man who came to him for affectionate care, "The son of man hath not where to lay his
                                head." No house, no home, and not even a couch upon which to rest at night. Why should
                                we be surprised that the young man went away in a sorrowful mood? All these lessons were
                                used for a purpose and led directly to the communal relation, where the selfish
                                interests that form the life of man are laid aside and the spirit of consecrated
                                interest and universal love became the life of the people. Peter was puzzled over this
                                subject and could not see clearly what advantage would be gained in running so great a
                                risk; and as it was with Peter, sjo it is with the Christian church of to-day. The
                                selfish interest comes first and then at a more convenient time comes a thought for the
                                kingdom of God. In all probability some of us who are the communists of to-day, would be
                                as sorrowful as the young man, if we had no place to lie down for rest at night. But as
                                Jesus had no private, selfish home it was difficult for the selfish questioners to
                                understand him ; and he was already giving lessons on this subject to those whom he met,
                                in reference to a communal, consecrated interest. We have no occasion, for a moment, to
                                raise a doubt about the eating and drinking or for the privilege to lie down to rest.
                                His home was with his brethren, consecrated to God, and all that he had to eat or to
                                wear or to rest upon belonged to the church of God. It was the home of a little
                                community, and all they possessed was held in common for the good of the whole family.
                                As the disciples gave up their selfish interests and entered into the work of loving
                                their neighbors as themselves and began to work for the interest of the whole body,
                                instead of working wholly for self, then each one could say as did Jesus, "I have no
                                place for selfish considerations." The home belongs to God and to his children. Our
                                homes, in like manner, must be the homes of God's children if we would have them
                                prosper; and this can only be through our earnest prayers, and our faithful continuance
                                in well doing as taught by the testimony of Jesus the Christ, and by the testimony of

                                our safety and secure us against the influences of the world. The gospel of glad tidings
                                should be preached, and preached far more effectually than it is at the present time, if
                                it is expected to be heard. Mother Ann was our herald of good news, our preacher of
                                righteousness, and our Teacher of the self-sacrificing life of Christ. Her life in God
                                needs to be voiced with more emphasis than ever before, that her children may not lose
                                sight of her gospel work, and wander in forbidden paths. Watching and praying is as
                                essential at the present time, as it ever has been. One of our friends who has known the
                                Shakers to love and respect them, and who has feared that they might be drawn aside from
                                their gospel homes, writes as follows :� "It is all in keeping with the ways of the
                                world for men to rise up as oracles in religion, in science or in literature, and demand
                                that others should follow them. The Shakers are a good, honest people and while the Pope
                                is all right for the Catholics, and Joe Smith for the Mormons, and George Fox for the
                                Quakers, Mother Ann is good enough for the Shakers, and they have no need to run after
                                other religious teachers, as they are all far below her standard."</p></div3><div3 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Of a truth I perceive..." TEIform="index"/>Of a truth I perceive...

                            Discouragement never blocked her way, neither did storms impede her onward course. Her

                                Calvin G. Reed. June, 1893. "Home is where there are friends to lova-us." This simple
                                sentence seems to peep out from between the lines of Home Notes on every page, and as we
                                count over the several Homes of our Communal relation, we rejoice that there are so many
                                strong pillars supporting our household. If in each of these homes every member is
                                striving to the best of his ability to contribute time and talents for the general good,
                                no failure need be feared. A few brave, earnest, unselfish workers, are worth a thousand
                                whose only aim is to sap the good from Society, and contribute nothing to its material,
                                mental or spiritual support. I like the little story which represents a timid woman at
                                heaven's gate, who, when asked of St. Peter what her credentials were, by which she was
                                entitled to enter, could only reply in the negative to all inquiries regarding Church
                                work, foreign missions, almsgiving, etc. St. Peter nearly discouraged, at last said:
                                "Well, my good woman, was there no one to give you a recommend." "O," she sighed, while
                                tears filled her eyes, "I have never needed a recommend, let me return, for I was loved
                                at home." At these words the gates flew open as if by magic, and orders were given to
                                place her among the fairest of the many mansions, for, said Peter, "those who are loved
                                best by those nearest them, need no transformation to complete their angel-hood." At a
                                recent Sabbath evening gathering on the lawn at the North family, Elder Daniel Offord
                                urged upon all the necessity of so caring for our premises, that no corner, however
                                remote, need fear inspection. This clarion call should reach every home, for there are
                                none so young nor so feeble, but what might contribute their mite of labor to beautify
                                Zion. An interest in home asks for no stated hours of labor. Strength should be our
                                measure, and this to be used and not abused, lest like the spendthrift, we find our
                                inheritance gone when we most need it. Amelia J.

"Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, and be ye thankful," says the
                                Apostle. This is an absolute command; therefore we must not despair of peace as if it
                                were unattainable when the command is to let it rule in our hearts. If we follow Christ
                                we shall be partakers of his peace which He gives unto those who walk in his footsteps.
                                Peace reigns with the pure in heart. How many there are who seek in worldly pleasure for
                                that peace which they never find. Denying self brings true peace within. Youth is a fit

                                improve the remainder. Pure air to breathe and pure water to drink, are certainly worth
                                much time and thought, and there is nothing like making an effort to obtain them. Weeds

                                our gardens are looking finely. Peas, onions, tomatoes, and other plants are growing
                                vigorously. Every opportunity for outdoor work has been zealously improved by Sisters as
                                well as Brethren, and it seems as though Nature was putting forth extra exertions to
                                make up loss of time. Our cherry trees, which last year blossomed full and bore nothing,
                                are quite full of green cherries. We hope to secure a good crop this year. The Psalmist
                                said, "I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor
                                his seed begging bread;" and we believe by faithfulness, carefulness, prudence, and
                                economy, we shall have sufficient for all our physical needs. Jesus said, "Take no

                                righteousness, and all these things shall be given you." And this we know by experience
                                to be true. All who turn to Zion for the resurrection life of Christ, are freed from all
                                burden concerning temporalities. A beautiful home wherein every need is supplied is

                                recorded the terms of prosperity which holds good to this day. The late season has
                                necessitated an amount of push and tact to accomplish the farm and garden work on time;
                                but it has been ably and heroically done, and we are now ready for harvesting the hay

                                the opposite direction, to that of the greatest activity. The entire strength of the

                                to the kitchens and on to the dining rooms. Our general crops including hay, potatoes
                                and fruits are full of promise. The main water supply is engaging close attention just
                                now, the machinery all round, being in process of reconstruction and improvement. The
                                water supply being thus cut off, we are now using water from the wells in our door-yard,
                                which is being delivered by the faithful and diligent hands of those who find themselves
                                compelled by stress of circumstances, as temporary water-carriers, to man the pumps and
                                grip the pails. It is quite a lively occupation, to pay the oft recurring visits to
                                kitchens, bakery, dairy, and Infirmary. The obsolete hand churning in our dairy has come
                                back again, with its twin brother, water-carrier. Let us hope not to stay. Albert

                                grand difference between those characters which ennoble all those within the radius of
                                their influence, and that other class of beings which may well be likened to human
                                cobwebs. We end this subject by quoting the Shaker text, "God bless our Sisters." A long
                                felt want is being supplied in our Dwelling house in the arranging of two toilet rooms.

                                prosperity. In communistic life where mingle various temperaments and grades of mind,
                                there naturally flourishes varied graces and abilities; and as recognition of the good,

                                ever zealous to give our aid in the best manner calculated to stimulate one another to
                                continue doing good and utilize the talents which beautify and honor our Zion home.

Beloved Elder Henry :�Last month there was so little of interest to write for
                                Home Notes that I thought I would not occupy the space in our valuable little monthly
                                messenger that would be better occupied by others. When I saw there was not space in the
                                last number for the piece of music I was glad that it was not my scribbling that shut it
                                out. The June Manifesto was very interesting. We were especially pleased with Elder
                                Isaac's article, "Halt and Consider." It is a true blast from the gospel trumpet. May it
                                cause us to consider well how near we are living the Christ life in this day of his
                                second appearing. If we are living to please ourselves rather than for the good of
                                humanity, not so did our Mother or the worthy founders of our Society live. I believe
                                that every true and earnest worker in Zion feels as does Eld. Isaac, that it is time to
                                awaken, and come forth and proclaim the mercy and goodness of God. Father James said
                                that where the testimony was permitted to die out, there the life and power of the
                                gospel would die out also. May this never be the case with us. Br. Benjamin's "Journey
                                to the Land of Canaan," was a very interesting one. May it be many years before he
                                journeys to that other land of Canaan. I presume the experience of all the Eastern
                                Societies is much like our own; a wet, cold May which very much delayed getting the seed
                                into the ground. Yet it was got there and has come up, and the weeds have come up with
                                the good seed, which our workmen are removing with their hoes, for we can not afford to
                                let them grow together till the time of harvest. Our fruit trees bloomed fairly well and
                                the grass never looked better.

                                and amused us. They found in the grass an oriole which from some cause had just departed
                                this life, and tenderly laid it in a box; took it with their hands full of flowers, to
                                the cemetery where they had a little funeral. Sung: "Hushed are the strivings of
                                nature," and "I shall know my own in heaven." Each made a little speech, then the leader
                                said: "Would the Brethren and Sisters like to take a last look at the deceased?" At this
                                ti me they were all weeping, and the bird was buried on Sr. Mary Ella's grave. Finally
                                they strewed the flowers on that and a number of other graves and marched back to the
                                house in a very solemn manner. The Sisters have set out a new strawberry bed of one
                                thousand plants, which are growing finely. The flowers also are coming along nicely and
                                will repay us for our labor both in profit and beauty. Elder William has a kitchen

Oue field of corn is growing nicely. We have eighty acres of wheat to
                                harvest, fifty acres of oats and one hundred acres of hay. Of corn we have one hundred
                                acres put in. We also started a nice orchard of one hundred Lombard plums and the same
                                number of peaches of six or seven different varieties. Fruit with us is about all killed
                                for this season having had several frosts in May, which were very severe. I think we may
                                have a few peaches and some small fruits and shall have in abundance, raspberries,
                                grapes and strawberries. The strawberries are already being harvested. We are having
                                rain, rain, rain every day, so we can not get into the garden to do much work. The
                                cabbages are doing well and the beans are throwing out their fourth leaf. We also have a
                                nice piece of sweet potatoes. Six nice, large, deep red, mulley calves have been
                                purchased and quite an interest is manifested in the polled Durham cattle. For the
                                market, this fall, we have fifty head of young cattle, and would like to realize about
                                five cents per pound for them, which would give us a nice little income. Our farm has
                                been improved by the repairing of fences and the digging of drains. Have just purchased
                                a hay loader, as we have some one hundred acres of hay to make, and it is claimed that
                                vou can put up from four to six tons of hay per hour, that is if you have teams.
                                However, we shall be satisfied to put up fifty tons a day, with three teams and three
                                extra men to assist in putting the hay into the barn. The hay loader does the raking and
                                puts the hay in the wagon and leaves the field very clean. Sisters are fixing up their
                                flower beds in front of the family Dwelling, and they are very pretty. I hope all who
                                have the privilege may be faithful in the gospel cause, and help to build up our Zion

                                this most famous of American novels, by Mrs. Stowe, has recently expired, which frees
                                its publication from the monopoly of the high-priced publishers, and though in
                                anticipation of this fact they have within a few months greatly reduced its price, now
                                that it is really "unchained" the consequences are something surprising. John B. Alden,
                                Publisher, of New York, issues several editions, selling them only direct (not through
                                agents or book sellers;) one in good type, paper covers, for 5 cents, sent post-paid, or
                                the same bound in cloth for 10 cents with postage 7 cents extra; also an excellent large
                                type edition, on fine paper, handsomely bound in cloth for the price of 25 cents,
                                postage 10 cents. Surely a copy of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" will soon be found in every home
                                where it is not already. Mr. Alden sends a 32-page pamphlet describing many of his
                                publications free, or a catalogue of 128 pages of choice books, a veritable "literary

The Opening of the World's Columbian Exposition was the crowning

                                authentic organ of the Exposition was established Feb. 1891. Its object is to make an
                                Official History of the Fair. The June number gives full details of the opening,
                                accompanied by appropriate illustrations. This number is of more than usual interest and
                                rich with choice illustrations, among which are the Duke of Veragua, as frontispiece,
                                the Duchess of Veragua, Marquis of Barboles, Marquis of Villalobar and other members of

                                "The Last Nail," "Spanish Woman's Exhibit," and other articles. Altogether the Journal
                                is an Exposition in itself. It is indispensable to those visiting the Fair�while those

those in Audubon's great work, and am
