                            LEBANON, N. Y.</head><p TEIform="p">The term Church, in our religious order, is used in several senses, but, in its most
                            dignified and proper sense, it implies the whole body of Believers, who profess and maintain
                            the faith of Christ's first and second appearing. These have one general object and interest
                            in a spiritual sense, but may be composed of distinct and separate Societies, in different
                            localities. They may hold a separate interest in temporal things, as the Church of Mt.
                            Lebanon, the Church of Hancock, or the Church of Watervliet. While each Society holds a
                            United Interest within itself in temporal things, it is united with all the other branches
                            of the whole united body which has taken to itself the appellation of United Society. the
                            church of christ. When Jesus Christ commenced his mission on the earth, he called his
                            disciples, and they became a united body, joined to their Lord and Teacher. After his
                            departure from this world, his disciples and followers organized themselves into a church,
                            and maintained a residence in Jerusalem. This church gathered other bodies of Believers
                            which were called branches, and yet they, as a whole, constituted the one church of Christ.
                            This church was trodden under foot by anti-christ, and for several centuries no true church
                            of Christ existed on the earth. This testimony was again revived through the ministration of
                            Ann Lee, and of the Elders who assisted her. During the manifestation of this remarkable
                            work, she received from her devoted followers the title of Mother in Christ, and since that
                            date has been known as Mother Ann. The glad tidings of this gospel of peace were published
                            first in Manchester, England, but after remaining a few years in that country, the little
                            church, through the revelation of God, came to America in the year 1774. A detailed account
                            of this may be found in the "Millennial Church." In the spring ] of 1780 Mother Ann and the
                            Elders began an open testimony before the world. The morning light broke forth, and the
                            sowers went forth to sow the true seed, and many came and confessed, and showed their deeds,
                            as is written of the pentecostal church. The testimony of these first Elders, Mother Ann
                            Lee, Elder William Lee and Elder James Whittaker, spread rap-<pb n="146" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> idly. The
                            doctrine was new and strange and those who were desiring the way of the Cross of Christ,
                            received it with joy. Many were attracted to the home of the Believers, in Watervliet, N.
                            Y., and conviction prevailed among those who went to see and to hear. Returning home, they
                            spread the tidings still farther, and confirmed the truth of what had been reported. While
                            many believed and obeyed the voice which called them from the world, others were found who
                            turned from it and through false reports, did much harm. In the course of three or four
                            years the Believers became quite numerous, and were to be found in the States of New York,
                            Mass., Conn., N. H., and Me. That those who had received faith in the gospel might be more
                            firmly established, and an increase obtained in the work of redemption, it was indispensable
                            that there should be a constant ministration from the Elders then at Watervliet. For this
                            purpose the Believers visited them at their home, and then returned each to their own
                            residence, with increased strength and understanding. In 1781 and 2 Mother Ann and the
                            Elders visited many of tke places where the Believers had gathered into families, and
                            ministered to them a greater degree of the spiritual gift. To these several places the
                            people came, of one accord, and held their meetings, and this, by the Believers, was called,
                            "Visiting the church." After the Elders had established more order and discipline among the
                            Believers, and had appointed leaders and laborers, they returned again to Watervliet, where
                            Mother Ann, and Elder William, soon after closed their short but devoted work on the earth.
                            Elder James continued for a while, to minister to the people and to assist them in attaining
                            to an increase of righteousness, order and harmony. During this period from 1784 to 1787,
                            the time of the ministry of Elder James, the Believers remained scattered, or at their own
                            private residences, conducting their business of buying and selling, as well as all other
                            matters of domestic economy. They lived in their small families of husband, and wife and
                            children, or more or less according to the new faith, as father aud mother, son and
                            daughter. A part of these, as was often the case, were Believers, and the others stood as
                            opposers. In this state they had a thorough trial of their faith, iu taking up the cross
                            against former habits, and iu separating themselves from the world, and unbelievers, which
                            gave light to the word of Jesus. "A man's foes shall be those of his own household." Father
                            James, as he was now called, was greatly blessed with the power and gifts of God, visited
                            the several towns where the gospel had been planted. Wherever he sojourned, he was kindly
                            greeted by many of the Believers, and particularly by those who had been appointed as
                            Elders. Among them were Joseph Meacham, Calvin Harlow, and David Meacham. Father James spent
                            his life in arduous labors for the protection of the Believers. He encouraged and
                            strengthened them, and instructed them as preparatory to an advanced order, of a more united
                            condition, in both temporal and spiritual things, and this was in a good degree effected
                            during his life. In a vision, Mother Ann saw the state of Believers. They were advancing but
                            as a scattered people. Sudden-<pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> ly, they came against a wall, and could
                            proceed no further. At this place they collected and began to form into a united body. Soon
                            there was an opening in the wall through which they passed, and then they were able to
                            advance with success. Mother Ann interpreted what she had seen, as the scattered state of
                            the Believers, being situated so distant from each other and without the necessary means of
                            guidance and protection. She then predicted that the Church would be gathered, "but," said
                            she, "that will not be my work. Joseph Meacham and others will perform it." From this time,
                            1784, the Believers were anticipating a great increase, and were laboring as far as
                            circumstances would permit, to become more united. Different familes united their domestic
                            interests, and gradually approached more to a uniformity. Where one or more was gathered
                            from a family, they entered these that were already organized, as did those who were poor,
                            so that all might share equally in the blessings of this life. Father James Whittaker and
                            his assistant Elders, were at this time, zealously laboring to promote peace and order among
                            the Believers, that all might be able to accept the increasing work. As a preliminary step
                            to the gathering of the Church, Father James directed the Brethren, in the year 1785 to
                            build a house for public worship, at New Lebanon, N. Y. In response to this call the
                            Believers, began, at once, to contribute of their means so far as they were able, while
                            others not so well blessed in the goods of this world, gave as freely, their time and
                            ability. The deep interest manifested in the work, by those of all ages, together with the
                            gospel union which animated every heart, gave such an impetus to the consecrated labors,
                            that the whole was speedily accomplished, and on the 29th of January 1786, the Believers
                            were privileged to assemble, in this new house, for the worship of God. It was a beautiful,
                            a sacred and a joyful occasion to every faithful soul. Father James delivered a very
                            soulstirring discourse, in which he said, "If you will obey the voice of the Lord your God,
                            you will be protected, and his blessing will rest upon this place. People will come from
                            every Dation under heaven and hear the word of God." From this date, 1787, New Lebanon began
                            to be considered as the central home where the first Church would be established. Many
                            persons visited the place, who were anxious to share in the privilege of the new, religious
                            order. Hurried preparations were made; all their business relations were adjusted, and
                            everything being settled with their social relations, they were now ready to enter a
                            Community of united interest. It was a time of trial of the faith of Believers. The parable
                            of the net that was cast into the sea, was having a practical application. Hundreds had been
                            accepted as probationary members, and among these were to be found, men and women of the
                            best character, and of deep religious conviction, while many were of the class quite
                            unprepared for so great a sacrifice of personal selfishness, and a separation between the
                            classes must necessarily follow. The testimony grew more and more intense. It was the whole
                            cross of Christ, and this includes a decided farewell to the world, and all its relations.
                            "That which is born of the flesh, is<pb n="148" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> flesh," and flesh relations must
                            be sacrificed to give place to an order which is new and spiritual, and which belongs to the
                            kingdom of Christ. As might be expected, in all religious revivals, some will be found who
                            have more zeal than wisdom, who are eccentric or who are ready to cry Lord, Lord, w hile the
                            purifying work of the cross, can find but little that comes from, or belongs to, a
                            consecrated life of God. Through excessive labors for the care and protection of the
                            Believers, Father James was prostrated by sickness, and many feared that he would not be
                            able to recover. Those who were affectionately attached to him, as a gospel Father, began to
                            realize that their cup of sorrow was already quite full. Some were brought under severe
                            trials of their faith, while others were disheartened and finally fell back into the
                            elements of the world. Corresponding instances have taken place many times in religious
                            history, and evidently will take place, after the same manner, in the work of the future. As
                            Father James continued to decline in health, his last sleep is recorded as having taken
                            place on the 20th of July 1787, he being thirty-eight years of age. The gospel work,
                            however, moved on. The people were prepared to enter the communistic life, and the time was
                            fast approaching when the formation of a Society would be commenced. Many were anxiously
                            waiting as at the gate of a walled city, desiring to enter that they might partake of a
                            greater blessing. As Elders in this great work of spiritual progress, Father James had
                            chosen Joseph Meacham, Calvin Harlow, and David Meacham. These acted in concert, in
                            counseling, directing and protecting the people, and they were unanimously received and
                            acknowledged to be the rightful leaders of all who had accepted the testimony of the cross

                            so doing. But what would have been the condition of the religious world, by this time, if as
                            heaven directed, the so-called Reformation had not been brought in by Luther. The state of
                            the religious world needed just such a character to be inspired to commence a successful
                            war. This was just as necessary as that Jesus should first turn water into wiue, which
                            finally aided men in carrying out a drunken frolic. In each case it was right, they could
                            appreciate nothing higher. Each did the work necessary to be done and this was as it should
                            be. When the Episcopal church took the lead, it was sixteen twentieths world and four
                            religion, and was soon imposed upon. When Whitefield and the Wesleys dissented from the
                            church amidst the fires of persecution who would have thought that they could have turned
                            such multitudes in the old and new world out of the churches, into higher degrees of the
                            spirit, though still short of the true light. From the Reformation down to the French
                            Prophets, all continued to prophesy of a coming judgment, the gradual increase of the Holy
                            Spirit, and greater light, as these bodies rose, sealed the<pb n="149" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> truth of
                            their testimony. These fiery witnesses testified that formal professors had stopped the
                            waters of life, and they predicted their breaking through to sweep away the wicked, and
                            suddenly inundate all nations. They spoke and anticipated like men, but the fulfillment came
                            gradually, like the doings of a merciful God. When the increasing light and spirit which was
                            leading the way to the New Heavens, had come up to a certain period, a Columbus was inspired
                            to dream out the region where God had ordained to erect a new order on the earth. An
                            agitating inspiration was upon him, which gave him, and those who heard him, no rest, till
                            the Catholic power cleared the way, by which he opened a passage to the New World. This gave
                            an asylum to the pilgrims, whose posterity laid the foundation for the church of the latter
                            day. Eight souls directed by a woman, settled near the city of Albany, N. Y., acd were
                            tried, tempted, disheartened and fell into doubts respecting the opening of the testimony.
                            But that gathering came not as they calculated but in God's own time and way. Mother Ann
                            promised in a gift of God, that the next opening should be at the far West. The Lebanon
                            fathers and mothers looked for the fulfillment of that promise, till their faith was sorely
                            tried, but in its season that came also. However frail and imperfect human agency may be,
                            when true inspiration moves the honest leader, he fearlessly delivers God's word respecting
                            comiDg events. Luther and others, though men of great faults, were honest. They were
                            organized to see the crumbling away of old religious structures, and were inspired to
                            testify it, reckless of consequences. Columbus saw the green fields, mountains, forests,
                            rivers, living forms and golden sands of this western world rise up before him like an
                            enchanting vision. Like the Hebrew Seer radiant with hope, he spread it before scepters and
                            thrones, because he felt and knew what he saw was true. The pilgrims were inspired to look
                            for a brighter church in the wild regions of America, and their intuitions were true. Mother
                            Ann was inspired to promise the planting of the Church, and predict the second opening of
                            the gospel testimony and by the same word of God, the mediums in Ziot) have proclaimed that
                            heaven designs a third enlargement, and as former predictions have come out, as reasonable
                            beings, why should we despair of the last? Nearly forty years ago, the spirit of prophecy on
                            the earth plane, began to rise in the political horizon, like the little cloud, scarcely
                            perceptible, predicting that God would break the fetters of every bond-man in America.
                            Garrison, living on his crust and cup of cold water, was moved to print a little sheet,
                            unpopular to the last degree, which at first, few would read, but finally agitated the
                            nation. This sheet breathed the spirit of the universal rights of tribes of all colors. This
                            inspiration agitated his soul like the pent up fires of a volcano. His startling narratives
                            of the slave's wrongs, his hopeless bondage and the driver's lash, fell like burning brands
                            among the citizens. His office was assailed, his type cast into the street, and he was
                            mobbed in the city of the pilgrim fathers, and liad to seek refuge from violence.<pb n="150" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> Who would then have thought that God intended by the efforts of that
                            unpretending man, that in 1865 the slaves of America would be set free, and like
                            Wilberforce, Fox and Burke, who fought the battle, which paved the way for West India
                            emancipation, who thought he would live to see it commenced as they saw the slave trade
                            overthrown ? With a pen dipped in liquid fire he still uttered truths which fell like
                            convictions from on high upon tender con sciences. We well remember these exciting scenes,
                            the legislature of Mass., sympathizing with the South denounced the man and his measures,
                            and he was solemnly arraigned before that body to answer to charges which they magnified to
                            the crime of treason. They had seized papers, pictorial and written, as positive evidence,
                            and in full assembly they as unbelievers, and he as a firm believer in the truths he uttered
                            commenced the contest. After accusing him of hard things, which he met like a reformer and a
                            hero, he was permitted like Paul to stand forth and speak for himself. Armed with the power
                            of truth (not as it is in Jesu&gt;-) as it should be in the suffrage of the nation, he spoke
                            long and powerful enough to convert two thirds of that august body to his own conclusions,
                            and thus scattered his views all over the state. This spread these fires in other states. It
                            became the battle cry of the Presidential canvas, elected Lincoln, unsheathed the sword and
                            finally uprooted slavery forever. These bold reformers and discoverers are not the men that
                            have moved the world. They nor other men ever had the power to do it. It was the tru'.hs
                            they felt and proved and uttered which overturned old systems, and created new ones. Truth
                            deeply planted in human understandings will roll down through unborn generations and never
                            die. The consciousness of this prompted Jesus to say, "I come to bring fire upon earth and
                            what if it be already kindled?" Jesus saw that this fire would kindle up a host of Christian
                            reformers, who would shine iike blazing torches, quite through the dark night of antichrist.
                            The intuitions of Columbus were founded on the clearest deductions drawn from science.
                            Through these, spirits kindled a burning inspiration, founded in truth which finally brought
                            in the reality. William Lloyd Garrison is a conscientious believer in God. He learned by
                            fugitives and others, that multitudes of wretched bondmen, were crying to God for
                            deliverance. The cry wrung his soul with agony. Through this distress he was inspired to
                            help raise the Macedonian cry for help. Past history taught him that the prayers of the
                            oppressed had always been heard and at some time answered. In the strong power of this
                            truth, he cried, prayed and wrote day and night as one bound with them. They told their
                            wrongs to that God who is never out of hearing, and he proclaimed them to the nation. This
                            was spreading the truth by faith. This truth moved others, in the same power these moved the
                            nation, which shook it to its foundation, poured out rivers of blood and finally broke down
                            the power of the oppressor. An array of these historic facts, is not resting altogether on
                            faith in promises. It shows that anciently when God brought in succeeding dispensa-<pb n="151" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> tions, they were founded iu truth, which he intended should run down a
                            line till a certain period, and where this t"uth was planted by the finger of God, men on
                            earth could never overthrow it. Now, was there ever a clearer set of truths founded on law
                            and order, given to redeem the race than may be found in this body? Are they not truths for
                            which men and women of all ages have sacrificed their lives by thousands, to bring in for
                            the final benefit of themselves and others? If the less important truths have cut their way
                            through and finished their destined mission among men, will the most important fail and
                            break down ? There is no estimating the tears, the prayers and anguish that millions have
                            bowed under, to bring out these mighty truths. If many that we have named, have never failed
                            to run their course like the sun in the heavens, who cannot see that it is impossible for
                            these to fail of doing so ? Through self-denial we are building new realizations on the
                            simple word of God which must go through ; for the prophet says, ''As the rain cometh down,
                            and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it
                            bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater ; so shall my
                            word be that goeth out of my mouth ; it shall not return unto me void, but shall accomplish
                            that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." Isa. lv., 10. To

                            willing mind and in reproof to the transgressor of God's law. I was convicted that she spoke
                            by inspiration and the power of her spirit made me tremble. With her divine gift I was well
                            assured that she could read my mind. I ventured even after this to attend a meeting at the
                            Square House, in Harvard. Here I saw Brother Aaron Wood under the influence of the spirit
                            and in the manifestation of sorrow. I then thought I shall be like that if I do not honestly
                            confess and forsake my sins. At that time Father William Lee approached me, aud said, "Young
                            man, you had better obey your faith." Soon after this I made up my mind to forsake the
                            world, and to confess my sins to God. This I did, faithfully, agreeably to the advice of
                            Father William. After I had accepted the life of a Believer, Mother Ann said to me, Amos,
                            you are a large man, and a man of faith, but the cross will effectually try your faith, and
                            will prove you. As Mother Ann had said to me, that if I was honest iu my confession, I
                            should prosper, my confidence in God's work remained unshaken, although I was made to fear
                            and tremble when I felt that her reproof belonged to me. I remained at Watervliet several
                            weeks and assisted the Brethren, as best I could, iu felling trees or chopping wood. At the
                            close of the week, and as the Sabbath was approaching, I thought I must prepare to be more
                            serious, as that was the general manner of keeping a New England Sabbath. Mother Ann on
                            meeting me, said, "You have been bright and lively all the week, and now because it is
                            Saturday afternoon, you have taken on a long antichristian face. When there is any testimony
                            against the old heavens, you are not touched, as you never made any profession of religion,
                            but you should know that your churchal religion sticks to you as does the bark to a tree,
                            and what if I should prove it to you ?" Mother Ann thought I had better not come to the

                            and during the meeting not less than two person? were sent to me with messages of reproof. I
                            thought this was more than a man should bear. In fact I was real-<pb n="153" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> ly
                            provoked, and if any horse had been there, I think I should have gone to some other place
                            for the night, bat seemingly I could not get away. After meeting I went into the house and
                            Mother Ann spoke very kindly to me. Amos said that soon after this he returned to Harvard.
                            He loved the Elders and maintained his gospel faith. At the time of his next visit he
                            reached Watervliet during a severe rain storm. The people were in meeting and as soon as he
                            entered the house, Mother Ann spoke to him and he was made welcome to their home. Mother Ann
                            said, "Joy on, Amos." Without stopping for a change of garments he went directly into the
                            worship and remained during the service. While on a visit to the Elders, Mother Ann asked
                            him if he loved the Elders as well as he would, if they were not English. (Amos had been a
                            soldier in the war of the Revolution and was much prejudiced against the English, or the red
                            coats, as he called them, but he replied,) "I do." The Elders in reply said, "That is hardly
                            correct Amos." This was a severe trial to him as he thought so much of his character and
                            about speaking the truth, but his faith in the gospel caused him to look into his heart, and
                            he felt convinced that they had told him the truth, and he accordingly acknowledged it.
                            Mother Ann then said, "How is it James, did not Christ say, Blessed are they who have
                            believed and have not seen ? " "Yea," said Elder James, and Amos received the blessing and
                            was comforted. Amos was at Watervliet when Eleazer Rand (afterwards known as Father Eleazer)
                            was about to leave the place for his home in Mass., Father William came into the room and
                            said, "Eleazer I have not felt the liberty from God to speak to you since you came to visit
                            us, (Eleazer had then been at Watervliet about two weebs,) and I huve prayed to God to know
                            the cause, and he has made it known to me." "You are ashamed of the power of God and the
                            testimony of truth before the world." Eleazer accepted the admonition and fell upon his
                            knees, and in tears of repentance, sought the forgiveness of God. He then received the
                            blessing of the Elders, and returned in peace to his home. Amos said a young man told him
                            the following incident. "I went to see Mother Ann once in company with an elderly man who
                            was called a good Christian. I did not wish to go alone as I was a very wild young man. I
                            did not expect to be noticed at all myself, but hoped that by being in good company, I
                            should obtain a chance to see Mother Ann as I had a great desire to see her. On my way I
                            told my companion that perhaps I had better put a piece of money in my mouth, so that she
                            should not be-witch me. On being introduced to Mother Ann, she did not seem to notice,
                            particularly, my companion, but said to me very pleasantly. "Young man, take that piece of
                            money out of your mouth, as we are not witches, and will not hurt you." She talked with me
                            so kindly and feelingly that I became convicted, and accepted the faith of the Believers.

Life
                            to answer its object must be a constant application to duty, watchfulness and care. Neit ler
                            wealth nor luxury affords happiness. Those who keep nature's laws and live in compliance to
                            their light are an honor to humanity, but a life conformable to the fashions of the world is
                            full of selfishness. We are singular inasmuch as we follow him who was not selfish or
                            worldly. To be a true Christian it requires a brave heart. Jesus has told us so. To overcome
                            evil habits and be renewed to a perfect life is not attained by selfish indulgence. The
                            allurements of a worldly life are treacherous. Passional excesses are constantly shortening
                            the life of human beings. It is these excesses which Christianity has to contend against.
                            Christianity follows to resurrect the spiritual part, to mature and consummate man and
                            woman's glory and happiness. It is the harvest of the ripe fruits of humanity. Surely none
                            will cast the arrows of malignant spite against those who are enlightened to live above the
                            follies which are sinking the race below the animal. Watervliet, N.

S. Tanner:- -Yourbook, addressed "To whom it may concern" is addressed to me,
                            seeing I am deeply interested in your successful, fruitful, and self-denying experiment. The
                            results of which, coupled with your former experiences, are suggestive that the long train
                            of maladies incident to humanity may be disposed of. I see the importance, and highly
                            estimate your labors in the above line. Again, your retirement ia the Shalam community New
                            Mexico, is not without its importance. Its non-success involves lessons of great value. I
                            recognize in that Community an effort to rid its subjects of the prevailing social maladies
                            of our times. Underlying all social formations there are laws, as invariable, and as
                            omnipotent, as are the laws productive of mateiial phenomena. I find in the leaders of that
                            community, the same forces that inhere in all men and women. And that these forces when
                            active produce definite results. The universality in the prevailingform of social life on
                            our planet, points to a corresponding force, or cause, which uniformly brings forth the
                            usual family relationships. The auimal affectional affinities existing between men and
                            women, is the force which creates the private family. It is worthy of note, that all animals
                            are the subjects of that force ; therefore, it may be called "The animal emotional force,"
                            it being represented by the propensities. Now, I find in your leaders, and also in those who
                            sympathize with them another force, a force to form a universal brother and sisterhood
                            having one common interest; and to eliminate from themselves bodily, as well as moral
                            maladies; and also, to substitute peace for war. This force, may be called the divine,
                            emotional force ; it being represented by manifestations of "Good-will to men," justice,
                            "benevolence, mercy, and by aspirations after, and a growth into these divine attributes. To
                            live under the vitality of this force exclusively, is to have heaven in and among us. As the
                            said leaders manifested in forming such community the divine emotional�the higher life, why
                            did they not succeed? History deals in facts, not in personalities. Well, what are the facts
                            in reference to said leaders, or rather the leader? At first he taught abstinence from
                            propagative emotions, and afterwards married a woman. He formed a community having goods in
                            common, and then introduced the force, having goods in severality ! Is it not also a matter
                            of history, that the women in the Shalam community remained under the influence of their
                            animal emotional affinities? And that there was neither power in said community to destroy
                            the organizing affinities of Adamic relationships, nor ability to unfold within these women,
                            angelic life. On these points, hinge the success, or failure of communal homes. Woman is the
                            organizing force in social formations. If you will have divine homes, first, find the divine
                            woman�the woman clothed with divine energy. The moon�animal desires under her feet. Her
                            children will bruise the serpent's head, and render communal homes an everlasting success.
                            The teachings of the Faithists to go direct to Jehovah, without the necessary preparation of

                            spread broadcast by the press and lecturers ; they are shaking the old heavens and earth all
                            to pieces ;� 1. That God is a duality, not a trinity, and is a heavenly Father and Mother.
                            2. The Jewish God of Israel was not Deity, but a tutelary divinity. 3. The Jewish Bible,
                            some portion of it, is a record of the word of God. In it we are told what the living ivord
                            of God really is�thus, "The word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged
                            sword, piercing, even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
                            marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Heb. iv., 12. 4. Jesus,
                            when bora of Mary, was not yet the Christ, but had to be born again by being anointed by the
                            Christ Spirit, and thus became the Christ. 5. Probation extends into eternity. Whenever a
                            soul is convicted of sin, and seeks the mercy of God, by confession and repentance, it will
                            be met in mercy. "The mercy of the Lord endureth forever." But effects must be endured. 6.
                            There is no resurrection of the body : the Resurrection is, rising out of Generation. "I am
                            the resurrection and the life," Jesus said. He had risen by the Christ spirit, out of and
                            above the generative order. 7. Atonement must be made by the sinner, not by Jesus. The soul
                            that sinneth, it shall die ; and the sinner that repents, is raised from that death. 8. Man
                            has worked out his own condemnation ; and he must work out his own salvation and redemption.
                            9. The law is included in the Gospel. It is "the song of Moses the servant of God and the
                            song of the Lamb." The song of the Lamb is the Gospel Testimony of Christ's first and Second
                            Appearing. Luther and Calvin separated them, and repudiated "good works, as filthy rags."
                            They substituted the righteousness of Christ or Jesus, in place of their own
                            righteousness�of doing right themselves, individually. 10. Swedenborg was the angel of
                            spiritualism, and Ann Lee of religion. 11. The seven thunders are seven cycles of travail by
                            the Millennial, or resurrection Church itself. The other sevens of the Revelator�seals,
                            vials, plagues and trumpets, are the seven cycles of travail of the great Antichristiaa
                            world�"Seven Churches of Asia"� Gentile Christianity, from the first to the second Appearing
                            of Christ. The history of the Church and State generative, fighting, poverty-creating
                            governments, who have the poor always with them to make soldiers out of; and with the
                            soldiers they fill the earth with violence. "In her�Babylon�was found the blood of all
                            saints and martyrs, and of all the blood that was shed upon the earth." 12. The marriage of
                            the Lamb and Bride, is the union of the first and second Pentecostal Churches�Jew and
                            Gentile. The first church has been in the spirit world 1260 years ; and the second, in a
                            wilderness state on earth, amongst the Two Witnesses, for 1260 .years. 13. The kiugdom o�
                            heaven is now being created upon earth, and is fulfill-<pb n="157" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> ing all the
                            promises, both physical and spiritual, belonging thereunto. It furnishes the "hundred fold"
                            of houses and lands, to those who have forsaken their selfish private property�houses and
                            lands; and it provides, uniformly the "daily bread"�good, substantial, hygienic food�to all
                            its members. 14. There is no effect without a cause. There would have been no late Civil
                            War�destroying millions of life and property- �if no chattel slavery; and no chattel
                            slavery, if no wages-slavery. There would have been no wagesslavery, if no
                            land-monopoly�single persons holding, and claiming to own, more land than they used. If no
                            landmonopoly, no poor, landless, homeless people. If no poor, homeless people, then no
                            soldiers, and nothing to fight about. For more than a century, these radical ideas and
                            millennial truths have been going forth from Zion. They are creating material for the two
                            OrdersNew Heavens and a New Earth, of Righteousness and Holiness. Appendix. Many notable
                            persons have been ii&gt; terested in the Shaker theological ideas. Theodore Parker adopted "The
                            Second Appearing of Christ" as his textbook, to preach from He was one of the first to own
                            God as a Father and Mother, and to publicly pray to a dual God. Hepworth Dixou has much to
                            say about Shaker ideas, affirming that "they have modified the religious thought of
                            America." He says :�"One man with ideas may be worth a Parliament�nay, a whole nation,
                            without them. The Shakers may not be scholars and men of genius. In appearance they are
                            often very simple ; but they are men with ideas, men capable of sacrifice. No one can look
                            into the heart of American society without seeing that these Shaker unions have a power upon
                            men beyond that of mere numbers. If a poll-tax were decre. d, they might pay into the
                            exchequer less than many of the sects.; but their influence on American thought is out of
                            all comparison with that of such sects. The Shakers have a genius, a faith, an organization,
                            which are not only strange but seductive, which have been tried in the fire of persecution,
                            and are hostile to society as it stands. A Shaker vi'lage is not only a new church, but a
                            new nation. This church is based upon these grand ideas :�The kingdom of heaven has come ;
                            Christ has actually appeared again on earth : the personal rule of God is restored. In the
                            wake of these ideas and dependent upon them, follow many more. Mount Lebanon is the center
                            of a system which has a distinct genius, a strong organization, a perfect life of its own,
                            through which it would appear to be helping to shape and guide, in no slight measure, the
                            spiritual career of the United States of America. Spiritualism. Dixon sees a connection
                            between Shakerism and spiritualism. He says :"When Mother Ann had been lodged in jail in
                            this river town (Poughkeepsie,) she had gathered a little court of curious people around
                            her, to whom she commuuicated her strange experience of the unseen world. Andrew Jackson
                            Davis, a poor cobbler, is the spiritual<pb n="158" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> descendent of Ann Lee, the
                            poor factory girl. Davis sees sights, and dreams dreams ; but his revelations have scarcely
                            gone beyond the hints afforded by Mother Ann. When we essay to judge spiritualisma system so
                            repugnant to our feelings, so hostile to our institutions as this school of spiritualism�it
                            is needful, if we would be fair in our censure, to remember that, strange as it may seem to
                            on-lookers, it has been embraced by hundreds of learned men and pious women. Such a fact
                            will appear to many the most singular part of the movement; but no one can assert that a
                            thing is simply foolish, beneath the notice of investigators, which has been accepted by men
                            like Judge Edmonds, Dr. Hare, Elder Frederick, and Professor Bush." Bishop Hughes is
                            reported as saying, "The Catholics have nothing to fear from the Protestants : we know them,
                            their organizations, numbers, and power. But the Spiritualists are a nameless number, an
                            unknown quantity; we know neither their numbers nor their future." And. that is true.
                            Spiritualism will be the agent to undermine the great Catholic Church ; and Shakerism will
                            crumble it to pieces. It is the fall of Babylon. Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N.

                            along to the end of life's journey. Those of our class and age have mostly passed the
                            wondrous river, while we stand waiting upon the banks for the boat to take us on board. A
                            signal is not unfrequently given notifying me that the ferry-man is approaching the near
                            shore for passengers. To embark, I am in no haste ; yet from the course of nature, I know
                            the ;ime of my departure draweth nigh. You and I have had our day. Our battles in life are
                            nearly at their close, our good fight nearly fought and our victories we can count upon with
                            a degree of rejoicing. Our relations we have learned to value, and to us are very dear, and
                            our treasures of immortality no one can take from us. However much we may realize we are not
                            millionaires, yet our possessions are not trifling, the thought of which is very comforting.
                            We are not ignorant of our burden and strife, and we know that our labors have rewarded us
                            with life and being, bringing peace, love, and joy, with a home and a relation whose value
                            is incomputable. Dear brother, for a long time my mind has been especi ,lly drawn to
                            Canterbury, to old friends and to you in particular as one whom I have long loved, who has
                            nobly faced the enemy, fearlessly braved the storms and terrors of the battle and com i out
                            a victor. In your conquests, I congratulate you. As we sing the songs of triumph now and
                            here, I am thinking how more exultingly we can swell the songs of the Lamb in that
                            undiscovered land. And still we are marching on, with the expectation of a continuous
                            journey which ends not with time, but extendeth on and on, until like Jesus we can say,�"The
                            prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me." St. John, 14, 30. Then it must be that
                            our coffers are full of blessing and love, and<pb n="159" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> our ministrations will
                            be devoid of any savor of earth, of self, or the powers of darkness. G-ood brother, please

Then Infidelity
                            must be the opposite. The question, who are inn'dels? The reformers of the world who in all
                            ages have been branded with the epithet of Infidel or the reactionists who have assumed to
                            themselves the ho lor of Fidelity. Was Jesus an infidel? Let us examine into his record ;
                            while a child he was faithful to his parents and grew to manhood imbued with the principle
                            of fidelity to truth, and loyalty of soul to that grand central truth of the final
                            consummation of the brotherhood of man ; while his bigoted persecutors were the infidels and
                            he was forced to exclaim, ''Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, ye devour
                            widows' houses and for a pretence make long prayers." Those who have stood on the danger
                            line in the advance guard of human progress have always been hounded with the cry, "Infidel,
                            Crucify him." Moving down the ages we meet the grand army of progre.-sive thinkers that have
                            sealed their devotion to the truth with their lives. Which were the infidels, Polycarp,
                            Huss, Bruno, Servetus or those who so fiendishly sacrificed them to satiate that lust for
                            dominion over the souls of men and could not tolerate Fidelity to the truth ? When through
                            the spiritual evolution of tve race it became possible for that highly spiritualized and
                            inspired woman Ann Lee to announce her mission as one of the advauced reformers of the world
                            ; when her announcement was flashed upon the world that woman must be free to work out her
                            own redemption, a mingled howl of rage and terror arose from the advocates of the Pauline
                            doctrin3, that woman must be subject to man, fearing that their idol would be destroyed, the
                            cry of infidel, fanatic, arose "'Crucify her" she did not merely stand on the danger line
                            but was advancing with dangers besetting her on every side, she sealed her Fidelity to the
                            truth with her life, while her persecutors the Christian clergy ( ?) could profess to be
                            shocked at the sight of a woman preaching. When that grand man, one of nature's noblemen,
                            William Loyd Garrison thundered his protest against chattel slavery and in demanding
                            immediate abolition made his ineffectual appeal to the clergy what was the result? While
                            standing in their pulpits and quoting the Bible to uphold the infamcus system could hiss
                            Infidel, while they were the infidels to those principles of truth that were working for the

                                fires and floods that so frightfully devastate the earth. As appalling as the recital of
                                these conditions may be, we are led to think of the thousands upon thousands of men,
                                women and children, who in one moment became as helpless as infants and were overwhelmed
                                in a watery grave or gave up their lives in the devouring flames. The breaking away of
                                the reservoir at Johnstown, Pa., has produced a scene that no language may be able to
                                describe, nor pen fully to illustrate. That fearful exhibition of a wall of water more
                                than thirty feet in height, whose voice was like that of rolling thunder, which went
                                dashing along in demoniac fury, crushing every building in its path, with the swiftness
                                and ease that one would crush the shell of an egg, can never fade from sight. Within the
                                space of one hour that great body of water, four miles long, one mile wide and held by
                                an embankment of one hundred feet in height, had spent its fury and thousands of souls
                                were hurled into eternity before any voice of warning could reach them. How forcibly
                                this should impress upon the mind, "The uncertainty of life, and the certainty of
                                death," and of the feebleness of man to even contend against the natural elements. That
                                busy throng of men, women and children, absorbed in the duties and industries of this
                                life, and in one moment blotted out of existence forever. Has this sad catastrophe any
                                lesson for us ? Shall we look upon it as accidental, and from uncontrollable causes?
                                There are Christians, no doubt, who will believe it was fore-ordained to take place on
                                that day and in that very hour, and also for that great army of souls to be hurled into
                                eternity without thought! Was it. not the result of the breaking of some law, over which
                                the sufferers had no direct control? Jesus very wisely and instructively brings forward
                                an incident that occurred in the eastern country, in the falling of a tower, which
                                unfortunately killed some eighteen persons; and draws from it a very marked lesson.
                                "Suppose you that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they
                                suffered these things ? I rr^sn-TMLSi.<pb n="161" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> tell you, nay : but except
                                ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." This same remark may have a direct application
                                to those who were dwelling in that ill-fated valley on the thirty-first of May. Do we
                                wonder why they did not take warning, when more than once, it was clearly spoken to them
                                ? The only answer that can be given to this, must be the one made by the prophet. "The
                                people were destroyed for lack of knowledge." Had they only listened with care, and fled
                                from the place, with the haste that Lot fled from Sodom, like Mm they might have escaped
                                a frightful calamity. Already it is being said, "it was wrong and almost criminal to
                                keep such an immense body of water, three hundred feet above a populous valley, for no
                                other purpose than to afford occasional sport and recreation for *&gt;, few rich and
                                favored individuals." In this case, the law, God's unchangeable law was open before the
                                rich and the poor. They knew their danger but trifled with the warning, and permitted
                                for the pleasure of a few rich Christians, more than eight thousand souls to be most
                                signally and overwhelmingly blotted out of existence. The laws which God has designed
                                shall rule the universe are, without doubt, as safe and reliable as is the Creator of
                                those laws, and the rain cannot avoid falling to the earth, nor the dew from rising
                                among the clouds, any more than the sun can avoid shining. While we stand appalled at
                                the horrors which are measured out so fearfully upon an unsuspecting people, because
                                some one or ones, in their avarice or ignorance neglected to regard an imperative law,
                                should we not study with deepest interest the laws of God which so vitally effect us as
                                a people, or as individuals ? Our certainty of his law can claim no excuse. For every
                                transgression a corresponding penalty is sure to follow. Neither prayers, nor
                                alms-giving, nor sacrifices can prevent the effects of wrong doing. Religion is not
                                ignorance, nor asceticism nor the life of a devotee to a churchal creed. God's laws are
                                open before us every hour of our existence, and take cognizance of our every act.
                                Christians without a knowledge of these higher laws which should rule them in the lesser
                                things of life as well as in the greater,�in eating, in drinking, as well as in all that
                                pertains to the health of the body or to the life of the soul, are so far from or
                                without God. If the wholesome advice which St. Paul so thoughtfully gave could be
                                conscientiously acted upon, it would herald a wonderful reformation in the world, and
                                the millennial age would be at the threshold of our door. "Whatsoever, therefore, ye eat
                                or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do it to the glory of God." How much is being done every
                                day that is far from being a glory to man, and indeed, much less a glory to God. Under
                                this influence the earth would become a paradise, while every one would be interested in
                                the happiness and prosperity of his neighbor, equally with that of his own.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">Articles published in the Mani-<pb n="162" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> festo must be referred to the authors

                                        Tobacco contains an acrid, dark-brown oil, an alkaloid, nicotine, and another
                                        substance called nicotianine, in which exist its odorous and volatile
                                        principles. When tobacco is burned, a new set of substances is produced, some of
                                        which are less harmful than the nicotine, and are more agreeable in effect, and
                                        much of the acrid oil�a substance quite as irritating and poisonous as nicotine�
                                        is carried off. These fire-produced substances are called, from their origin,
                                        the "pyridine series." By great heat the aromatic and less harmful members of
                                        the series are produced, but the more poisonous compounds are generated by the
                                        slow combustion of damp tobacco. This oil which is liberated by combustion is
                                        bad both in flavor and in effect, and it is better, even for the immediate
                                        pleasure of the smoker, that it should be excluded altogether from his mouth and
                                        air passages. Smoking in a stub of a pipe is particularly injurious, for the
                                        reason that in it the oil is stored in a condensed form, and the smoke therefore
                                        highly charged with tin; oil. Sucking or chewing the stub of a cigar that one is
                                        smoking is a serious mistake, because the nicotine in the unburned tobacco
                                        dissolves freely in the saliva, and is absorbed. "Chewing" is on this account
                                        the most injurious form of the tobacco habit, and the use of the cigar holder is
                                        an improvement on the custom of holding the cigar between the teeth. Cigarettes
                                        are responsible for a great amount of mischief, not because the smoke from the
                                        paper has any particularly evil effect, but because smokers�and they are often
                                        boys or very young men�are apt to use them continuously or at frequent
                                        intervals, believing that their power for evil is insignificant. Thus the nerves
                                        are under the constant influence of the drug, and much injury to the system
                                        results. Moreover, the cigarette smoker uses a very considerable amount of
                                        tobacco during the course of a day. "Dipping" and "snuffing" are
                                        semi-barbarities which need not be discussed. Not much effect is obtained from
                                        the use of the drug in these varieties of the habit. Nicotine is one of the most
                                        powerful of the.''nerve poisons" known. Its virulence is compared to that of
                                        prussic acid. If birds be made to inhale its vapor in amounts too small to be
                                        measured, they are almost instantly killed. It seems to destroy life, not by
                                        attacking a few, but of all the functions essential to it, beginning at the
                                        centre, the heart. A significant indication of this is that there is no
                                        substance known which can counteract its effects ; the system either succombs or
                                        suivives. Its depressing action on the heart is by far the most noticeable and
                                        noteworthy symptom of nicotine poisoning. The frequent existence of what is
                                        known as "smoker's heart" in men whose health is in no other respect disturbed
                                        is due to this fact. Those who can use tobacco without immediate injury will
                                        have all the pleasant effects reversed, and will suffer from the symptoms of
                                        poisoning if they exceed the limits of tolerance. These symptoms are: 1. The
                                        heart's action becomes more rapid when tobacco is used; 2. Palpitation, pain, or
                                            unus-<pb n="163" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> ual sensations in the heart; 3. There is no
                                        appetite in the morning, the tongue is coated, delicate flavors are not
                                        appreciated, and acid dyspepsia occurs after eating; 4. Soreness of the mouth
                                        and throat, or nasal catarrh appears, and becomes very troublesome; 5. The
                                        eyesight becomes poor, but improves when the habit is abandoned; 6. A desire,
                                        often a craving for liquor or some other stimulant, is experienced. In an
                                        experimental observation of thirtyeight boys of all classes of society, and of
                                        average health, who had been using tobacco for periods ranging from two months
                                        to two years, twenty-seven showed severe injury to the constitution and
                                        insufficient growth; thirty-two showed the existence cf irregularity of the
                                        heart's action, disordered stomachs, cough, and a craving for alcohol: thirteen
                                        had intermittency of the pulse; and one had consumption. After they had
                                        abandoned the use of tobacco, within six months, one-half were free from all
                                        their former symptoms, and the remainder had recovered by the end of the year. A
                                        great majority of men go far beyond what may be called the temperate use of
                                        tobacco, and evidences of injury are easily found. It is only necessary to have
                                        some record of what the general health was previous to the taking up of the
                                        habit, and to have observation cover a long enough rime. The history of tobacco
                                        in the island of New Zealand furnishes quite a suggestive illustration for our
                                        purpose, and one on a large scale. When Europeans first visited New Zealand they
                                        found in the native Maoris the most finely developed and powerful men of any of
                                        i the trines inhabiting the islands of the Pacific. Since the introduction of
                                        tobaceo, for which the Maoris developed a passionate liking, they have from this
                                        cause alone, it is said, become decimated in numbers, and at the same time
                                        reduced in stature and in physical well-being so as to be an altogether inferior

                            men. They personified all that adorned and dignified their national character. They were the
                            nobility of God's spiritual kingdom. Theirs was a higher calling and grander sphere than any
                            titled mortal can boast. But they sought not this responsible di&gt;linction. Moses and
                            Jeremiah earnestly, yet vainly, prayed exemption from this solemn charge. The soul of
                            Ezekiel rebelled against the divine mandate; but the hand of the Lord was upon him, to curb
                            the hate and bitterness of his spirit, and to model him for his sacred calling. Consecrated
                            by the eternal spirit they magnified their office, and sustained it with dignity and
                            majesty. They were borne along through scenes, prosperous and adverse, by God's impulsive
                            energy ; they took the words of blessing, of cursing from his mouth, and enforced them by
                            the most impressive sanction that could sway the souls of men. As the spiritual guides and
                            censors of the people, they waited on God continually for ^ivine illumination in the
                            discharge of their solemn function. They were admonished to make no distinction between the
                            proud and the lowly, the monarch and his subjects. Their commission announced them as the
                            vicegerents of heaven. "See" fsaith the Lord to Jeremiah) "I have this day set thee over the
                            nations and the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down and to destroy, to build and to
                            plant." There is a moral sublimity in the prophetic office adapted to excite profound
                            emotions and inspire lofty conceptions. Mark the experience of "the man of God" with whom
                            the Lord spake face to face, of Isaiah, who saw the Lord of hosts enthroned, of Daniel who
                            beheld the cessation of time and the dawn of eternity, of John who saw the great white
                            throne and who sat thereon. The thoughts, the language of heaver was theirs, and from their
                            lips fell words upon which God had stamped his irreversible seal. Pondering over their
                            heaven-horn themes graced by divine sanctions, we seem to be fingering the harp of prophecy
                            and chanting<pb n="164" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> its joyful or solemn or awe thrilling tones as Saul of
                            old ere the lamps of God went out in the temple of the Lord. We are struck with the
                            magnificence of Moses, Ezekiel and Nahum; with the harmony and splendor of David, with the
                            majesty and sublimity of Isaiah, with the pathetic and solemn energy of Jeremiah, and with
                            the power and grandeur of Daniel. No monumental pillars record their names but their oracles
                            are their monuments more precious than gold, more majestic than the triumphal arch, and more
                            enduring than the time crowned pyramids. Though mortal there were those among them whose
                            immortality began in time. Enoch, seraph winged, out sped the conqueror death, and
                            indomitable Elijah in his chariot of fire, triumphantly passed to the realms of the blest.
                            The history of the prophets exhibits the lights and shades of Jewish life. It is a story of
                            such marvelous interest, that it seems a spiritual romance. Though pilgrims of earth the
                            star of inspiration shed a halo of glory around them and illuminated their pathway to the
                            Eternal. It cast a gleam of light over the dark future upon which they looked and told what
                            God proposed to do in far reaching ages. Tuftonborough, N.

                                    humble monk. One day at Bologna, a stranger arrived, and asked the prior for some
                                    one to get provisions, and carry his basket. "Tell the first brother you meet," said
                                    the prior. St. Thomas was walking in meditation in the cloister, and not knowing
                                    him, the stranger said, "Your prior bids you to follow me." Without a word the great
                                    teacher�the angel of the schools as he was called by the affection of his admirers�
                                    bowed his head, took the basket and followed. But he was suffering from lameness,
                                    and since he was unable to keep up the stranger rated him soundly as a lazy,
                                    good-for-nothing fellow, who ought to show more zeal in religious obedience. The
                                    saint meekly bore the unjust reproaches, and answered never a word. "Do you know
                                    whom you are speaking to, and treating in this rude way ?" said the indignant
                                    citizens who witnessed the scene. -'That is Bro. Thomas, of Aquino." "Bro. Thomas of
                                    Aquino!" said the stranger in amazement; and immediately throwing himself upon his
                                    knees, he begged to be for-<pb n="165" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> given. "Nay," said St. Thomas, '
                                    it is I who should ask forgiveness, since I have not been so active as I should have
                                    been." And this humility, so rare in little men, was the chief characteristic in
                                    this truly great man. Once again when he was addressing a vast congregation in one
                                    of the cliief churches of Paris, an insolent intruder beckoned to him to stop, and
                                    aimed at him an abusive harangue. The saint waited till he had ended, and then,
                                    without one word of anger or resentment, calmly continued his discourse. Erom that
                                    disciplined and noble heart all pride had been expelled. "Give me 0 Lord" �such was
                                    his daily prayer�"Give me 0 Lord, a noble heart which no earthly affection can drag

J. Kaime.] A friend of ours, living at the time near Eed
                                    river, Arkansa , relates that one day an Indian, with whom he was friendly, came to
                                    him in a great rage against a certain planter, who had set his dogs on him. He
                                    declared he would kill him, or set fire to his buildings. "Oh, no," said my friend,
                                    "that would not be right." " What!" said the Indian, "not right to kill him when he
                                    set his dogs on me?" "No," was the reply: "besides, what good would it do you to
                                    kill him?" "I would have my revenge," said the Indian. "That," said my friend,
                                    "would be nothing, and you would be guilty of murder, and be in constant danger and
                                    dread of punishment." The Indian looked very thoughtful a short time, then said,
                                    "Well, what shall I do?" "Why," said my friend, "do that man some good the very
                                    first opportunity, and you will find that sweeter than revenge, and it will bring
                                    you into no danger, but may bring you many blessings." The Indian looked at him
                                    earnestly, and said, "You never told me a lie; I will try it, and find out if you
                                    lie to me now." Several months passed on. My friend had forgotten the circumstance,
                                    when one day the Indian came to him with new blankets, overjoyed to see him. "Ah!"
                                    said he, "you told me true; it is no lie." "Well, what is it?" said my friend. "Why,
                                    you remember I was going to kill such a planter, and you told me not to, but to do
                                    him good. Well, some days ago that man was lost. He had wandered about in the woods,
                                    until he was almost starved. I found him. 'Now,' said I, 'I can easily kill him for
                                    setting his dogs on me,' but I remembered what you told me, and so I took him to my
                                    camp and fed him, and kept him over night, and the next day took him to his
                                    plantation. When just by it, I said to him, 'There is your house ; you see it: go.'
                                    He was so glad he shook me by the hand, and called me good Indian. 'Yes,' said I;
                                    'but you did not think me very good when you set your dogs on me.' 'I set my dogs on
                                    you?' said the planter, turning pale at the thought of the hazard he knew he had
                                    been in, from his knowledge of the Indian character. 'Yes, you set your dogs on me
                                    at such a time, and I had to run for my life ' 'I am sorry,' said the planter, 'and
                                    you have rendered me good for evil; come in.' "So," continued the Indian, "he took
                                    me to his house, and told all his negroes to treat me well if I came there when he
                                    was not at home. And he gave me these fine blankets, and made me feel very happy.
                                    You told me no lie." Here was sown a little good seed, which bore its good fruit,
                                    and all because the Indian thought my friend "did not lie." "He that goeth forth and
                                    weepeth, bearing this precious seed, shall doubtless come with rejoicing, bringing
                                    his sheaves with him."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Living way" TEIform="index"/>Living Way.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">[In the Boston Journal of May 11th we find this remarkable confession of a person who has

                            trashy stories for the cheap weeklies than any single writer. For twentyseven years he has
                            done nothing else. He is<pb n="166" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> now comfortably off from the returns which
                            his work has brought him. I asked him how he looked back upon his career and work, and his
                            answer was interesting : "I count my life almost a failure," said he. "This trash which I
                            have been writing has brought me returns upon which I can live comfortably, but look on the
                            other side ! I have no peace of mind when I think of the havoc I have undoubtedly wrought
                            upon young and innocent minds. I can point to nothing with any pride of authorship. I am
                            ashamed of it all. Even my children would hang their heads in shame did they know their
                            father was the author of this trashy stuff." Do they know it? "Bless your soul, no ! and God
                            forbid they ever discover it�at least during my lifetime. You saw my eldest daughter at the
                            table. Would I wish her, so beautiful and pure a girl, or her sisters, to know! Oh, no ! no,
                            sir ! My daily prayer is that I may never live to see the flush that will kindle on their
                            beautiful cheeks if ever they learn the truth. Why, there are only five persons, I think,
                            that know of my authorship of the stuff I have put out. No one would certainly suspect it
                            from my nom de plume, and I never write anything else for print, so there can be no
                            comparison of style. Those who know it are, as you are, pledged to secrecy by their
                            friendship for me. I am never suspected of having more than an ordinary passing interest in
                            literature of any sort, and am careful never to start books, authors or periodicals as a
                            topic of conversation. "But, it doesn't pay !" Why did I start in it? Because it paid me
                            better to write a murderous story than a clean one, and once begun I have kept right on. My
                            first proved so appetizing to its readers that the editor offered me almost double the price
                            he paid me for the first if I would write a second one. Encouraged, I kept right on, until
                            now I hate to think of the number I have written. I have published my stories under fifteen
                            or twenty different names, male and female, and if I have written one I suppose I have
                            written 200 of these beastly serial novels. They're all in the same vein, and there isn't
                            one which hasn't a lot of robberies or murders in it. How people can read them I cannot
                            tell. If they despised their reading as I do their writing, I would be a poor man now I
                            suppose. But with me it is now a thing of the past. I have written my last story. I have
                            laid aside enough to keep my family in comfort and there is no longer any necessity for me
                            to keep up my fiendish work. My girls will soon marry and my two sons are already in
                            business. Does my wife know of it? Yes, the only woman in the world who does, and God bless
                            her! she has never chided me for it, although tears of joy stood in her eyes when I dropped
                            the pen for the last time." I am not exaggerating facts when I say that this gentleman's
                            total income from his 27 years' work has been fully $250,000. Yet what a lesson is contained

                                    cannot properly be u?ed as a noun and be governed by a preposition. 2. Audience, as
                                    in the sentence, "A large audience was present." This use is indeed recognized by
                                    Worcester, but all lexicographers recognize as current many forms of speech the use
                                    of which would not be approved either by themselves or by good writers. Audience in
                                    the sense of assembly is not precise. 3 Commence is used a good deal, both in
                                    writing and conversation, where begin is preferable. The latter is the easier and
                                    simpler word. It is from the Anglo-Saxon, while commence is from the French. There
                                    arc instances in which commence is to be preferred, but in most cases begin is the
                                    better word. Young persons have within a few years seemed to forget that the English
                                    language has such a word as begin. 4. Gospel, as in the phrases, "Gospel Meetings,"
                                    "Gospel Songs," "Gospel Hymns.' Here a noun is inelegantly used as an adjective; and
                                    that Worcester recognizes it as an adjective is no proof of propriety in so using
                                    it. The notice that Eev. Mr. A. B. will hold a "Gospel Meeting" is objectionable for
                                    another reason. If Mr. A. B. is an evangelical minister, how can he be presumed to
                                    hold it for any other purpose than to advance the interests of the gospel? that is
                                    of Christianity. 5. Holy Ghost; sometimes most barbarously used as an adjective,
                                    thus : "What we need is Holy Ghost meetings, Holy Ghost sermons, and Holy Ghost
                                    prayers." It is to be hoped that such a shocking use is not the result of
                                    irreverence. 6. Calvin; also wrongly used and as an adjective. Calvinistic is the
                                    adjective. Calvin Baptist is both ungrammptical and misnaming. There are Baptists,
                                    and Free Will or Free Baptists, and Seventh Day Baptists, but there is no such
                                    people in the United States as Calvin or even Calvinistic Baptists. The Baptists
                                    reject some of the most characteristic doctrines and rites of Calvinism; that is, of
                                    the religious system taught by John Calvin. 7. Congregationalist, a noun, is often
                                    used improperly as an adjective. The adjective is Congregational. The correct use of
                                    the two words is well illustrated in the Golden Rule of June 7th, as follows : "The
                                    Congregationalist of Last week has a sharp and abusive editorial touching the
                                    addresses of the Andover professors at the Congregational Club." 8. Transpire is
                                    wrongly used for occur. "Such an event transpired," say many. 9. Reliable, though,
                                    like transpire, with the meaning of occur, used by some good writers, is not a
                                    well-formed English word. On these two words the reader may consult Worcester.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Oh!

                                    begins to fade? Why stand ye idle, waiting For reapers more to come? The golden morn
                                    is passing, Why sit ye idle, dumb? Thrust in your sharpened sickle, And gather in

                            </head><p TEIform="p">The Coming Creed op the World by Frederic Gerhard is a work that has been in
                                contemplation by the writer for more than forty years. The accumulation of facts bearing
                                upon the subject of churchal Christianity, and illustrating its effects upon the mind,
                                is truly wonderful. The book contains a large amount of information having reference to
                                the Bible, dogmas, sects, miracles, fanaticism and evil spirits that could not be
                                obtained by the ordinary reader from any other source. The work is written in a very
                                kind spirit and cannot fail to awaken a greater desire for a more thorough knowledge of
                                the truth. That the author has formulated a system that is more "sublime and blissful"
                                than the picture he has drawn of the unspiritual, persecuting Christianity of a past and
                                of the present age, is at once admitted. The testimony of Jesus Christ is the coming of
                                the kingdom of God upon the earth. The creation of a new heaven and a new earth wherein
                                should dwell righteousness and peace. The work must interest every intelligent person,
                                although it should meet him with the potent admonition of the prophet.�Thou art the man!
                                The author of this remarkable message may with all propriety send out his work, as �liA
