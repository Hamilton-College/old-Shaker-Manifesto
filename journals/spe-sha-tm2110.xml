                            Schismatics. The principal thing that distinguished the Schismatic worship from that of the
                            New-Lights, was their taking the privilege of exhibiting by a bold faith, what others were
                            moved to by a blind impulse. This they considered a great improvement, growth and
                            advancement in the spirit of the revival. Upon this principle, the voluntary exercise of
                            dancing was introduced as the worship of God, by Br. Thompson and some others who were
                            forward in promoting the grand schism. Although this singular worship was practiced
                            voluntarily with a degree of formality, yet it was not introduced in a formal way, but by
                            following up and improving those operations which at first irresistibly forced them into
                            that exercise. At the spring sacrament at TurtleCreek in 1804, Br. Thompson had been
                            constrained just at the close of the meeting to go to dancing, and for an hour or more to
                            dance in a regular manner round the stand, all the while repeating in a low tone of voice; '
                            'This is the Holy Spirit, Glory!" But it was not till the ensuing fall, that the Schismatics
                            began to encourage ona another to praise God in the dance and unite in that exercise ; just
                            believing that it was their privilege to rejoice before the Lord, and go forth in the dances
                            of them that make merry. However, the Schismatics aimed at that worship which should be
                            expressive of uniform and continual joy, yet they were far from attaining it, and at least
                            the one half of their exercises were of a contrary nature ; some of a voluntary and others
                            of an involuntary kind. Among their voluntary acts of worship, was the general confession
                            that they were sinners, rebuking, reproving and laboring to reclaim their fellows who were
                            more notoriously wicked than the rest; some praying to God to sanctify their corrupt
                            natures, and others praying against their prayers. This kind of praying-match was a very
                            common Schismatic exercise. They<pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> considered it contrary to their
                            federal constitution for one to attack another openly by any supposed authority, and
                            therefore they had recourse to the spirit, and by the brightest, boldest and loudest gift of
                            prayer, the cause was commonly decided. In this way they generally settled their
                            controversies of every kind. One would begin to preach or exhort, and if his doctrine was
                            judged unsound or uninteresting, he would be presently matched with a prayer, and whichever
                            collected the greatest warmth and manifested the most lively sensation of soul, gained the
                            victory, and interested the general shout on that side. There were moreover in the
                            Schismatic worship, a species of exercises of an involuntary kind, which seemed to have been
                            substituted by the Great Spirit, in the room of the falling, which had been among the
                            New-Lights. The principal of these, were the rolling exercise, the jerks and the barks. The
                            rolling exercise which consisted in being cast down in a violent manner, doubled with the
                            head and feet together, and rolled over and over like a wheel, or stretched in a prostrate
                            manner, turned swiftly over and over like a log. This was considered very debasing and
                            mortifying, especially if the person was taken in this manner through the mud, and sullied
                            therewith from head to foot. Still more demeaning and mortifying, were the jerks. Nothing in
                            nature could better represent this strange and unaccountable operation, than for one to goad
                            another, alternately on every side with a piece of hot iron. The exercise commonly began in
                            the head which would fly backward and forward and from side to side with a quick jolt, which
                            the person would naturally labor to suppress, but in vain. The more any one labored to stay
                            himself and be sober, the more he staggered, and the more rapidly his twitches increased. He
                            must necessarily go as he was stimulated, whether with a violent dash on the ground and
                            bounce from place to place like a football, or hop round with head, limbs and trunk,
                            twitching and jolting in every direction, as if they must inevitably fly asunder. How such
                            could escape without injury, was no small wonder to spectators. By this strange operation
                            the human frame was commonly so transformed and disfigured, as to lose every trace of its
                            natural appearance. Sometimes the head would be twitched right and left to a half round,
                            with such velocity that not a feature could be discovered but the face appear as much behind
                            as before. In the quick, progressive jerk, it would seem as if the person was transmuted
                            into some other species of creature. Head-dresses were of little account. Even kerchiefs
                            bound tight round the head, would be flirted off almost with the first twitch, and the hair
                            put into the utmost confusion. This was a very great incon venience, to redress which, the
                            generality were shorn, though directly contrary to their confession of faith. Such as were
                            seized with the jerks, were wrested at once, not only from under their own government, but
                            that of every one else, so that it was dangerous to attempt confining them, or touching them
                            in any manner, to whatever danger they were exposed. Few<pb n="219" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> were hurt,
                            except it were such as rebelled against the operation through willful and deliberate enmity,
                            and refused to comply with the injunctions which it came to enforce. The last possible grade
                            of mortification seemed to be couched in the barks, which frequently accompanied the jerks
                            nor were they contemptible characters who were the common victims of this disgracing
                            operation, but persons who considered themselves in the foremost rank, possessed of the
                            highest improvements of human nature. In spite of all the efforts of nature, both men and
                            women would be forced to personate that animal, whose name, appropriated to a human
                            creature, is counted the most vulgar stigma. Forced I say, for no argument but force, could
                            induce any one of polite breeding, in a public company, to take the position of a canine
                            beast, move about on all fours, growl, snap the teeth, and bark in so personating a manner,
                            as to set the eyes and ears of the spectator at variance. It was commonly acknowledged by
                            the subjects of these exercises, that they were laid upon them as a chastisement for
                            disobedience, or a stimulus to incite them to some duty or exercise to which they felt
                            opposed. Hence, it was very perceivable that the quickest method to find releasement from
                            the jerks and barks, was to engage in the voluntary dance. Such as refused, being inwardly
                            moved thereto as their duty and privilege, had to bear these afflicting operations from
                            month to month, and from year to year, until they wholly lost their original design, and
                            were converted into a badge of honor, in the same manner as the first outward mark of human
                            guilt. Although these strange convulsions served to overawe the heaven-daring spirits of the
                            wicked, and stimulate the halting Schismatics to the performance of many duties disagreeable
                            to the carnal mind, yet in all this, their design was not fully comprehended. Something
                            doubtful and awful, was thought to be figured oat thereby, which would suddenly fall with
                            pain upon the heads of the wicked; and nothing was more calculated to excite such fearful
                            apprehensions, than the expressions that were sometimes mixed with the bow wow wow, such as
                            every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess. At least these exercises served to show that
                            the foundation was not yet laid for unremitting joy, and that such as attached themselves to
                            this people, must unite with them as a body destined to suffer with Christ, before they
                            could reign with him. However great the sufferings of the Schismatics, from a sense of their
                            own remaining depravity, the burden and weight of distress they bore for a lost world, the
                            hatred, contempt, and persecuting rage of all around them together with the spasmodic
                            writhings of body with which they were so generally exercised ; yet they were not a little
                            alleviated by the many extraordinary signs and gifts of the spirit, through which they were
                            encouraged to look for brighter days. Among these innumerable signs and gifts, may be
                            ranked, the spirit of prophecy; being caught up or carried away in this spirit, and
                            remaining for hours insensible of anything in nature, dream-<pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> ing of
                            dreams, seeing visions, hearing unspeakable words, the fragrant smell, and delightful
                            singing. This spirit of prophecy is particularly worthy of notice, which had its foundation
                            in a peculiar kind of faith, and grew up under the special influence of visions and dreams.
                            The first thing was to believe what God had promised, with an appropriating faith; cast
                            anchor upon the thing promised though unseen, and hold the soul to the pursuit of it in
                            defiance of all the tossing billows of unbelief. This faith, so contrary to the carnal
                            heart, they concluded must be of God. It must be the spirit of Christ, or God working in the
                            creature, both to will and to do. What is the promise but the purpose of God? What is the
                            purpose of my soul, says the Schismatic, but to have the thing promised. Has God promised ?
                            He cannot lie : Has He purposed? He cannot alter. What his spirit leads me to, I shall
                            possess, as certain as God is stronger than evil. Upon this principle all were encouraged to
                            believe the promise and immediately set out in co-operation with the promiser; and in
                            proportion to the strength of their faith, to predict the certain accomplishment of that
                            purpose of God, which they felt within them. Notwithstanding this faith furnished a very
                            bold foundation for predicting what should come to pass, yet it was far from comprehending
                            the whole of that evidence, upon which the Schismatic looked for the purpose and promise of
                            God to be fulfilled. It was very common for them to be caught up or carried away by the same
                            spirit of faith, and be shown in bright and heavenly visions, the indisputable reality of
                            what they before contemplated in a simple belief. In those ecstacies some would seem to
                            desert the body, and leave it for hours in a state almost or quite inanimate. Others in
                            their transports, would seem to use their clay tenement as a kind of instrument, to sign out
                            and represent to the spectators, what the active spirit saw in open vision. Of these
                            extraordinary visions, nothing can be communicated here beyond an imperfect hint, and
                            whether they ever be correctly stated on paper is a matter of doubt. Their general import
                            respected things that were darkly hinted at in the Scriptures, and hard to be understood ;
                            such things as were especially to take place in the latter days. Hence, notwithstanding they
                            had adopted the Scriptures under the notion of a confession of faith, yet it was not
                            immediately to the Scriptures they applied for light, but to that transporting spirit which
                            opened clearly to the mind, those mysterious things recorded in Scripture, which the wisest
                            men upon earth, without the spirit, could not understand. We view Christ as the only center
                            of union, and love the only bond. Let us labor after this spirit, and when we obtain it,
                            then we shall all be united in one body. Some are groaning for the wounds of the
                            Presbyterian cause ; some for the Methodist and some for the Baptist each believing that it
                            is the cause of Christ for which they are groaning. Some are as heartily groaning for the

                            If we should unite our groans and cries to the Father of our mercies, for the general
                            release and the coming of the Lord's kingdom with power, God would hear and answer us. 0 let
                            us unite in the common cause. Then will Zion shake herself from the dust, shine forth as the
                            sun in his brightness and be terrible as an army with banners. Then shall she be a cup of
                            trembling to all the people round about her, and shake terribly the nations. Then shall that
                            man of sin be destroyed, and righteousness shall flow down as a mighty stream. These things,
                            dear brethren,' are not vain imaginations for God is now about to take the earth. Thy
                            kingdom come. Even so come Lord Jesus. Brethren, yours in the Lord. R. Marshall. J. Dunlavy.

On Sunday, Aug. 23rd., at the usual Society meeting of the Shakers,
                            held at the church in Mount Lebanon, N. Y., a number of visitors were present. Daniel Boler,
                            first Elder of the Ministry, opened the meeting. After singing and other exercises, Elder
                            Frederic W. Evans delivered a short sermon, taking for his text, Heb. ix., 28: "Unto them
                            that look for Christ, shall he appear a second time without sin, unto salvation." He first
                            sketched the history of the primitive church, with its cardinal doctrines. Jesus had
                            preached and carried out with his disciples, community of goods. Another doctrine was that
                            of a celibate virgin life; and his disciples were to take up the cross and follow him. And
                            not the least of these great principles was non-resistance ; they were to be peaceable, and
                            to take no part in war. Elder Frederic alluded to the persecutions of the early Christians
                            and the "two witnesses" down to the Quaker order, who were, he said, the most prominent of
                            all the witnesses for truth. Then, in 1770, the Christ spirit appeared a second time on
                            earth, to a woman named Ann Lee, revealed the Fatherhood and Motherhood of God, and taught
                            that human beings must confess and repent of their sins, and work out their own salvation.
                            That was the testimony of Mother Ann, who gathered round her a chosen band of faithful
                            witnesses. That church has stood for over a hundred years. After alluding to the remarkable
                            (and thus far accurate) prophecy uttered in 1803, by Joseph Hoag, a Quaker, he went on to
                            show that the foundation of the redemption of humanity is laid on this earth, and that it
                            will never be overthrown. That is where we stand today. There are many noble-hearted men and
                            women in the Shaker Societies true as steel to the testimony, who have consecrated
                            themselves to help to actualize true Christianity upon this earth. The Believers had with
                            them that day a messenger of God, a man who had dedicated himself to the cause<pb n="222" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> of, humanity, to abolish war from the nations ; he was the representative of
                            earnest men and women corresponding with him from various parts of the world, so that a
                            nucleus of power was now arising in Philadelphia, which was "judging the nations." He
                            thanked God for such an organization, and for their faithful representative. * After some
                            remarks from Elder Calvin Reed, Sisters,/Martha J. Anderson, Catharine Allen and a few other
                            Brethren and Sisters, Br. Daniel Offord introduced to the meeting, as an "apostle of peace/'
                            the above-named messenger, Alfred H. Love, who delivered an address in substance as follows
                            :�"What were they that their eyes those glories saw, and their ears heard the sound?" Which
                            was the pew and which the pulpit, which was the spiritual and which the material? It was
                            "Communion day" with them ; not the communion day that they had in his neighborhood at
                            Philadelphia, at one of their largest churches, where it was an outward communion, but a
                            communion of soul-feeling and of spirit : and in the same manner he might liken it to their
                            baptismal day, their dedication day and their consecration day ; because he felt that good
                            people had all these good things at all times, without the calendar and without fixing a
                            date. Reared as a Friend or Quaker, he was there not as a member of any religious sect
                            outwardly, but as a member of all religious denominations in spirit, for his sympathies were
                            with the good of every denomination. He had filled the pulpits of Universalists,
                            Presbyterians and others; and why? Because there was a membership outside of the formality
                            of a creed ; and in that spirit he was among them that day. Last evening, picking up a Bible
                            before retiring, as was his wont, he opened it at that beautiful chapter of John containing
                            the words, "Wilt thou be made whole ?" The sick man thus addressed, after complying with the
                            conditions, was healed, and he rose and walked; and it was the Sabbath day. So he retired
                            with that upon his mind, and he thought, "How fitting to be in the Shaker Community, and to
                            reflect with the sick man of old, "Can I be made whole?" No wonder that he had a good
                            night's rest, and that he came with a cup overflowing with love and sympathetic regard for
                            them. No wonder, too, that we should feel encouragement in traveling about in the world and
                            seeing so much good that can be found there, if it can only be brought out of its recesses
                            and utilized. In thirty-five years of traveling through the prisons, he met with a. great
                            many who had lost their way, and wrhen he got to the secret recesses of their hearts, he
                            found that they did not really wish to be bad ; they had missed their way; there was
                            weakness and they needed strength. After conversing with them thus, he frequently induced
                            them to make promises of reformation. By reasoning with them, one after another had been
                            reformed ; and peace was produced in that direction. So it was in other matters. He had
                            always been a peace man; it wras as natural to him as to take the air into his lungs. He
                            could not but see that a peaceful condition was best for us<pb n="223" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> all; the
                            amiable and affectionate feelings of the heart, and all the facilities for being at peace
                            would not have been given to us, were it not intended that we should be at peace. Therefore,
                            when he met with a general or other military officer, he declined to call him by his title ;
                            this was the case when he met General Gregory ; he saluted him thus: "Friend Gregory, how
                            dost thou?" The lieutenant prompted him aside, to "call him general;" but he said," I do not
                            want to call any one by a name which signifies a man-killer, or one skilled in destroying
                            human beings." "Then take my hand," said the chief; ' 'I wish there was no war and no
                            generals." ' 'Well then, begin now ; throw off thy epaulets, and cast away thy title." At a
                            future time, "the sword shall be beaten into a ploughshare and the spear into a pruninghook
                            :" but the "beating" has to be done; begin now, and there will be a prospect of their being
                            transformed. At the Philadelphia Centennial, they held a meeting in old Carpenter's Hall to
                            promulgate their testimony for peace. Mary Thorne, a Friend, had been delegated to have an
                            emblem of peace suspended over his, (the speaker's) head as president, a dove with outspread
                            wings ; but her humane feelings dissuaded her from having a bird killed and stuffed for the
                            purpose; "Thee can get along without any emblem over thy head." But the speaker related how
                            a friend from California arrived with a live, white dove in a basket, which he opened. The
                            beautiful creature flew thrice round their hall, then out of the window, circled thrice
                            round old Independence Hall; returned into their place of assembly, and perched upon the
                            statue of Jefferson during the meeting. Three swords were brought to them, from Ireland,
                            from Pennsylvania and from another state ; then Clayton Rogers said, "I am a manufacturer,
                            and will turn them into a plough and pruning-hooks." These agricultural implements with so
                            significant an origin, were sent to the Paris Exposition; from thence they were presented to
                            Switzerland, and now, bearing an inscription, they are located in the Hall at Geneva where
                            the arbitration took place between Great Britain and the United States. These little
                            incidents he related to indicate how the work is going forward. They would be interested to
                            know that not only did the British Government have to concede what the Quakers asked; but
                            our own American Government had to concede the principle of non-resistance as applied to
                            war. During the War of the Rebellion, a number of Friends were drafted and carried into the
                            ranks ; but the general had to report, ' 'We cannot do anything with these men." The
                            governor expected them "to change such foolish notions." He (the speaker) positively refused
                            to serve. His father and another man each offered to pay his three hundred dollars for him.
                            A colored man said, "You are a good anti-slavery man; I will go and serve for you as a
                            substitute." "I cannot take you, my brother." "Then I will go out and get a white man
                            instead.'' "I cannot take a human being to be my agent; the agent is as bad as the
                            principal." A doctor said, "Shall I put in "Physical disability?" "No, I<pb n="224" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> am stout, strong, able to do military service." "You have spectacles; are you only
                            carrying those to avoid the draft?" Another doctor examined his eyes, and said, "We give you
                            three days grace : come back, and we will see what we can do for you." But of course he gave
                            no promise to return, and the next thing that transpired was, he was brought back and told,
                            "It will kill your mother to hear that you will be punished as a deserter." "No, my mother
                            is made of a better material than that, if her son is standing by a principle." "Well, what
                            must be done with this man ?" "He must be shot." "I am ready in five minutes' time." But,
                            ultimately, they gave him his exemption papers. Abraham Lincoln had said, "Do not hurt those
                            people ; they are my best citizens." Stanton said, "My grandfather was a Quaker, and I know
                            they will not budge an inch from their point." An act was passed through Congress, releasing
                            the Quakers and Shakers from military service; also providing that the duty should devolve
                            upon them of taking care of sick and wounded soldiers. So we got that enactment into the
                            constitution of the United States. This resistance to compulsory military service was in the
                            old spirit of William Penn, and upon that they stood. "No human authority can interfere with
                            the rules of conscience :" that is on the statute books of Pennsylvania ; and no human
                            authority could take that away ; for it was in their bill of rights. Upon the Behring Sea
                            difficulty, the Peace Union addressed both Salisbury and Blaine to this effect: "Friends, do
                            not interfere with the peace between the mother country and this country ; but arbitrate
                            your difficulty, and see if you cannot settle it in that way." Blaine wrote to Salisbury in
                            the spirit that they wished ; and now the matter is in course of settlement. When Venezuela
                            was threatened by the British with a war, the Universal Peace Union sent their
                            representative Stollmeyer to negotiate with both countries : and at length a letter came
                            from Salisbury, that if it was thought that the English were taking an inch of the
                            territory, it should be left to the United States to decide; and that imbroglio, too, was in
                            course of adjustment. We had done wondrously in science and art: but there remained other
                            worlds to conquer ; the spirituality of our being was to be developed, and we had to diffuse
                            the universal love of God and man. This was not an impossible task ; for the Creator did not
                            leave us without the means to realize our conceptions. The ideal in this Community could be
                            attained. There would not be a God of all goodness and of omnipotence, if he could give us a
                            conception of a higher condition, and then tie our hands and leave us powerless to do the
                            work. "Righteousness and peace have kissed each other," exclaimed the psalmist. The great
                            poet had said, "Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace." If you go forth with a weapon,
                            it causes a weapon tobe used in return; while, on the contrary, the open and friendly hand
                            attracts ; it signifies welcome ; the open hand is peace. They would continue working
                            zealously for the cause of peace, looking upwards to the God of<pb n="225" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> peace
                            for aid in their endeavors, and they would reverently say to him, "O Lord! Forgive us, if
                            too close we lean Our human hearts on Thee!"</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Have faith" TEIform="index"/> HAVE FAITH.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Erickson, Lars" TEIform="persName"/> Lars Erickson.</byline><p TEIform="p">Watch for false prophets. They are all deceitful. It is only one faith that bringeth forth
                            good fruit unto righteousness, and that is the blessed faith of Jesus Christ. No man can
                            take that faith except it be given from the Father. True faith is founded on Christ only. He
                            is the gift of God given to mankind. In him is hidden all treasure that is needed for man's
                            redemption. The first thing that faith bringeth forth is life; next is light; next is
                            righteousness and then full redemption. This faith never was known to fail in love from man
                            to his fellowman. Many profess to have faith but fail to love God, and therefore they are
                            false and the truth is not in them. They refuse Christ and have no love to their neighbor,
                            therefore Jesus gave us this sign, "By their fruits ye shall know them." Pleasant Hill,

                            of the South Union Community of Shakers, from the text: "I am the Way and the Truth and the
                            Life ; No Man cometh to the Father but by Me." John xiv., 16. "There is nothing more true
                            than the text I have chosen to-day, and I J hope truth may guide me in all I may | say. Oh,
                            truth ! Sacred truth, thou ' art God ! Then let us have it, though it should transpose ideas
                            and beliefs we may long have cherished. I am informed that new truths are causing | other
                            churches to revise their creed,<pb n="226" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> and may not the Shakers have to do the
                            same since some leaders do not agree on some essential points of doctrine? To this I would
                            say firstly, that the Shakers have no creed. Our faith is Apostolic and unchangeable� one
                            faith, one Lord and one baptism. The faith that saved the Apostles will save the world.
                            Speculative theories may lead some in another direction, but all who are saved must come
                            back to the 'faith that was once delivered to the Saints.' Admitting the charges, I shall
                            endeavor in as few words as possible to correct them. One is the denial that Jesus is the
                            Christ which he claimed to be, and to which his Apostles bore witness. "These things are
                            written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God."�Jno. 20-31. "For
                            there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."�Tim. 2-5.
                            These are truths, incontrovertible. There was no mediator above and between Him and God as
                            supposed by some. It is as correct to say Jesus the Christ as it is to say Daniel the
                            Minister. Another is that the true Christ came from the seventh heaven, entered in and took
                            possession of Jesus at his baptism, and a third is that a Christ of the Universe came,
                            directed and guided Jesus. Both of these postulates are in violation of the first canon of
                            logic, and no man can know his reasoning is sound without having studied this science and
                            complying with its canons. The seven heavens spoken of have no reference to distances in
                            space, as contended for, but they are the seven conditions of our race, one above the other,
                            from animal man up to Christ, who introduced the seventh and highest condition possible to
                            the race, and which his true followers enjoy. Points in space do not make a heaven for any
                            soul. Heaven is spiritual. God's kingdom is within you, and wherever you are, if the soul is
                            in harmony with God, it is in heaven�if not, it is in hell, even though it should be in the
                            company of saints and angels. Heaven and, hell are both here�you ascend to heaven as you
                            ascend in goodness, and descend to hell as you increase or descend in badness. Thus every
                            one will get the reward of the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or evil, for God
                            is no respecter of persons. You do not have to go above the clouds and into the starry
                            regions to find the one, nor descend into the bowels of the earth to find the other.
                            Astronomy shows the falsity of both postulates; it teaches that Alpha in the constellation
                            of the Centauri is the nearest star to the earth, and that it is 206,000 times further off
                            than(the sun which is 95,000,000 miles distant, and that it takes the light of this nearest
                            star three years and four months to reach our earth. Now it is not supposed that any
                            distinct entity, either spiritual or material, could travel faster than light, which flashes
                            around our globe almost as quick as thought, and were the first material heaven spoken of on
                            a plane with this nearest star, Christ would have said to the repentant thief, 'this day
                            three years and four months wilt thou be with Me in paradise ( !)' But, as 1 have said,
                            heaven is here : we do not have to go among the stars to find it. The Lick telescope<pb n="227" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> reveals enough to show that it would take the Christ of the universe
                            millions of years to visit all its parts, thus confirming the truth that such a Christ is a
                            creature of the imagination and has no existence ; and the same of the seventh heaven
                            missionary. To suppose the seven heavens were seven rings at great distances around the
                            earth would be to make this little ball of ours the center of God's universe ( !) when God
                            is as much here as anywhere in space, seeing every act, and knowing every thought of our
                            lives, for all of which He will hold us accountable. So let us all come back from the stars,
                            accept and obey Him who is the way, the truth and the life, as we never can come to the
                            Father but by Him, Jesus Christ, who never made a mistake or blunder. It is thought by some
                            that He was mistaken on the food question, but He was not: yet all should be Apostolic
                            enough to abstain from any kind of food rather than offend weak brethren who do not know the
                            components or properties of the food 'that goeth into the mouth,' and thus support union and
                            harmony. The second coming of Christ is questioned by many, who wish to know something about
                            the marriage of the Lamb and Bride and when and where it took place, and how Ann Lee came to
                            have that honor. According to her testimony, it was about the middle of August, 1770, over
                            one hundred and twenty years ago. She says she saw the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and she
                            (I believe her, for I have had the great honor of seeing Him myself) conversed with Him face
                            to face, as one person with another, and that, in the presence of hosts of shining Angels
                            and Christ Himself there told her that she was the one of God's own choice to carry on his
                            work, not of generation, but of regeneration, when Ann accepted and owned Him as her Lord
                            and Guide, and ever after that her followers gave her the title of Mother. Thus they became
                            one, and the marriage of the Lamb and Bride was completed by God Himself in the presence of
                            angelic hosts without any priestly ceremony, and she humbly accepted Christ, the Way, the
                            Truth, and the Life, which she lived and manifested to the world the second time as
                            predicted, 'without, sin unto salvation,' and thus ended the mystery of the second coming of
                            Christ, and all who are still looking for Him to come bodily through the clouds are doomed
                            to disappointment, for he came as a thief in the night, as predicted more than one hundred
                            years ago, and he now calls to all the world, saying : 'Come unto Me, for I am the Way and
                            the Truth and the Life. No man cometh to the Father but by Me.'

                                pass from mind to mind, through the household of faith to kindle anew a zeal for love to
                                God and for peace and good-will toward all men. Yea, good brother we want the
                                inspiration that has touched your soul to become as wells '' of living water springing
                                up unto everlasting life," that every one may drink freely of these waters and thirst no
                                more. The water from Jacob's well may be very good for many purposes, for the children
                                of this world and be to them God's natural blessing, so much to be desired, and so
                                essential for health and comfort in this world. While we unite with them in giving
                                thanks for the unbounded supply of good gifts which come to us so freely from the hand
                                of our God, we will not forget how much we are indebted to Him for all the gifts and
                                graces that adorn the mind and which enable us, as children of his care, to work the
                                works of righteousness. This gives evidence of a growing interest toward goodness ; of a
                                life above that of a mere animal existence : and a light from God that is to redeem the
                                world. Our responsibility in this matter is one of magnitude. Neither principalities nor
                                powers should be able to exert an influence detrimental to the prominent interest that
                                has called us from the world. As there are no mysteries to obstruct the highway of
                                holiness or that can ever prevent the pure in heart or the peacemakers from seeing the
                                glory of God, so we have nothing to fear in accepting the cross of the Christ, and in
                                presenting this before the world. It is simple, easy to be understood and affords a
                                light so bright and clear that there need be terms<pb n="229" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> no fear of
                                losing the right path if we enter in at the strait gate. The elements of human nature
                                are, no doubt, quite as they were "in the beginning," and the advancement in human
                                progress must be the cultivation of man's moral and spiritual faculties. The fearful
                                outbursts of passion and the revolting crimes that are so suddenly aroused in the
                                ignorant brutal mind is a fearful reminder of what our life may be if we neglect to walk
                                uprightly. Jesus in accepting hip mission gave testimony that he was the light of the
                                world; that his doctrine was from God; that it was absolutely necessary for man to make
                                strait paths in which to walk, and to repent or change his mind from that of an earthly,
                                sensual man, to that of a spiritual man, or a child of God. This same light was and is
                                given to all the disciples, and to them, and no less to us, Jesus has said, You are a
                                light in the world; you are as a city upon a hill, which cannot be hid. Having received
                                this spiritual light, you must let it shine before all men, that they may see your good
                                works, and through these learn to glorify your Father in heaven. All who have this light
                                in one degree or more, should let it shine. A very little of God's light in the soul is
                                a most precious blessing. If it affords strength sufficient to conquer one bad habit it
                                is well worth cherishing and eminently worth our Giving; thanks. Returning to the word
                                of our brother, who has made alive the sleeping thought of many anxious souls, we would
                                repeat,�"If Believers would only make a little more effort !'* If they will only�and we
                                believe they will, we are assured that a blessing will attend and increasing good be
                                established. Let light be diffused more freely in the world. If the truth as found in
                                the testimony of the Christ, has made us free, the same truth will make others equally
                                free, and inasmuch as it has enlarged our thankfulness for these heavenly blessings, it
                                will effect a corresponding work in the hearts of others.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p"> Through the kindness of friends we are able to distribute several copies of the Manifesto

                                another month is numbered with the past! Have we anything to show for the march of
                                events? Yea, surely. Our barns are well filled with the produce of the earth and
                                potatoes are being stored for winter, which are of very fine quality. Pears are so
                                abundant it is difficult to market them, especially since peaches glut the market of our
                                inland city of Pittsfield. Both these fruits are very fine this year. Plums are also
                                very plentiful, and prices range accordingly. Our tomato crop looks likely to be a
                                failure, yet we hope to secure enough of this indispensable article to make us
                                comfortable, insomuch as creature comforts are concerned. I am pleased with the musings

                                to each and all who feel an interest in making our paper a vehicle for Shaker thought
                                and the intercommuning of the various Churches, located in the several states of the
                                Union. Surely, we as a people should feel as much solicitude in sustaining our little
                                Periodical for spreading the truths of Shakerism as other religious bodies are, in
                                propagating their views of God and Christ and what constitutes Christianity. On Aug. 26,
                                a party of eight Sisters and seven Brethren from our home went to G-reylock summit, the
                                highest point of land in the state of Massachusetts, being about 3,500 ft. above sea
                                level. We had quite an enjoyable time, for an outing. Some of us had to sleep on the
                                floor, which did not quite come up in point of comfort to our nice hair and husk
                                mattresses, still we roughed it through and liked the ciiange. T. D. E. !N o rtlx Fam
                                ily-. Sept. 10, 1891. Chilly nights and cool mornings remind us of approaching winter
                                and of the necessity of having our fire arrangements all in safe working order. At this
                                season of the year we only need a little flash of fire, and the light fuel we use is
                                just right to set chimneys and stove pipes on fire if they are not cleared of soot.
                                Defective flues and carelessly put up stove pipes cause a large percentage of the fires
                                in our country. I had a little experience in our boiler cellar, the other morning. We
                                were burning some trashy stuff and a few sparks fell on the floor; I took the broom and
                                swept them up and hung up the broom. In a few moments a scent of smoke attracted my
                                attention, and I went to see what was the cause, and found the broom on fire; water
                                being handy and I being right there no damage occurred. I have concluded hereafter to
                                wet the broom before hanging it up. We are now engaged cutting corn for ensilage. We
                                have the boiler outside the barn and we draw the wood as we want it; a cart load was
                                dumped near by, and in the middle of the forenoon smoke was observed coming from that
                                load of wood. A spark had fallen from the smoke-stack upon the wood and fire was the
                                result. We make it an invariable rule after we start a fire in the boiler, never to
                                leave it; we remain there until every spark is extinguished by an abundance of water,
                                and the same with our kilns for drying apples &amp;c. They should never be left till
                                the fire is in a perfectly safe condition, and never leave on any account when drying in
                                the night. A hose should be attached to the hydrant and ready for instant use; but<pb n="231" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> where there is no hydrant a barrel or two of water and pails
                                should always be in readiness. We finished haying on Sept. 4. Fruit harvest has
                                commenced and is very abundant. Our Ministry leave for Watervliet on the 16th. inst. In

                                Manifesto to do better. The summer is past, but the harvest is not ended. While hay and
                                grain are secured, fruit and vegetables are not. Hay, fair crop. Oats very good. Eye
                                fair. Beans rusted badly, consequently few cans filled. We are busy canning pears, plums
                                and tomatoes, also drying corn. Fruit is plenty except peaches in our locality, of the
                                latter we have enough to make us comfortable. Have had considerable wet weather, which
                                has hindered work, but we keep moving as there is always plenty to do. We have had good,
                                refreshing meetings, and if the spiritual atmosphere has not been cleared it is not for
                                the lack of gospel testimony,�delivered not in a cooing, lullaby style, but in trumpet
                                tones, that wakens into life the true-hearted Believer, if it does not effectually
                                arouse the slumbering, or more properly the dead soul into newness of life. Our motto
                                is, Fear not�"Cry aloud spare not," neither the wrongs in ourselves nor others. We have
                                also had beautiful ministering spirits in our midst the past season. Not only the loved
                                ones who have gone before, but the loved ones still living with us in earth-life.

                                words will long be remembered. All the good Sisters from Enfield N. H. each one of whom
                                we remember, and shall always feel drawn nearer to them for their beautiful testimony

                                also Br. Watson Andrews who seemed to possess the life and power of the gospel in his
                                soul. We have heard rumors of an accident that befell him, but trust it is not as

Dear Editor;�With a soul full of appreciation and thankfulness for the
                                luminous little monthly magazine that comes to us laden with riches, and sheds its
                                radiant beams of light on the pilgrim's pathway, we take our pen for the purpose of
                                adding our mite to the department of the Home Notes. Thoughtful remembrances and kindest
                                wishes are tendered to the faithful band who so patiently toil to interest and instruct
                                the many readers, while breathings of prayer ascend to the Father above, that he may
                                continue to bless and prosper so laudable an enterprise. We recently had the
                                satisfaction of entertaining for a few hours a company of devoted, worthy Sisters from
                                the North Family of Mount Lebanon. Harvesting, cutting and drying of apples, canning of
                                fruit and attending to other needful duties is the present occupation. Apples and pears
                                are more plentiful than we had anticipated. Plums few or none. Oats a good crop. ^
                                Potatoes yielded well, but show signs of decay. Our little blackberry patch that looked
                                so finely in the spring, gave us the nice product of sixteen bushels of rare sweet
                                berries. "Dr. Kaime finding a flower under the Humboldt glacier was more affected by it
                                because it grew under the lip and in the cold bosom of the ice, than he would have been
                                by the most gorgeous garden bloom." In like manner we are surprised, ami record with
                                great pleasure the fact that we gathered this season, from a tree grown in our Office
                                garden, a bushel of good peaches. Such an incident has not occurred in this, section of

                                alone, two Sisters will accompany and remain with him. God grant that he be restored to

The
                                full meaning of this phrase comes to me now as never before. Here is the shadow of a
                                great rock where we find sweet home peace and rest beneath the shadow of his protecting,
                                guiding love, while the lif e-battle grows more and more earnest. If we could always
                                remember that He does indeed do all things well what a comfort and blessing it would he!
                                How light our burdens would grow, how easily we could walk and faint not. It does not
                                seem right that we should bear burdens that need not be felt if we had more faith and
                                trust in his eternal goodness and power. We are journeying on day by day, coming with
                                each step nearer the rest and joy awaiting the faithful. Why may we not have more of
                                that rest, more of that joy as we walk? Why may we not even here breathe the pure air of
                                heaven and be strengthened by the sweet songs of peace the angels sing? Let us struggle
                                on, hope on, hope ever. Let us be strong, be true, be manly, believing that "He doeth
                                all things well." "Guided by the Lord's anointfed" we "walk through green pastures and
                                by still waters," and though sometimes the way seems rugged and sorrows arise, we have
                                strength and courage to go on undoubtingly, and find peace and happiness in unexpected
                                places. 4698 spaces of cream were sold in Aug. Our new ever-bearing strawberry plants
                                are remarkably vigorous, and give promise of an early and late crop next season. Now is
                                the time to decide on the number of fowls to be wintered. Hens that have moulted should
                                be separated from those that have not, and placed in winter quarters, free from draughts
                                at night. The moulting hens should not be slighted. Hot milk is a valuable drink for
                                them. They need a variety of health-giving diets. When the moulting season is over they
                                should have a good supply of egg-making material. Buck-wheat and corn exclusively is not
                                a good diet for hens. It is best to act wisely when starting in the poultry business.
                                Large flocks of hens do not often pay as large a percentage of profit as smaller ones.

                                among us which serves to awaken our home circle to purity of life and goodness of heart,
                                is that where a few truth-loving souls are assembled to serve God in sincerity, there
                                will the spirit of Christ be, to bless them. "We gain spiritual substance, something
                                living eternally, by our own exertion, just as we may gain temporal sustenance by
                                industry. To expect redemption from the life of perverted nature by the merits of any
                                other human being, however good, will inevitably lead to sad disappointment. We have the
                                most favorable opportunity now to commence to build a mansion in God's holy temple, in
                                which we may abide. To defer this Avork until we leave the mortal form, is unwise.
                                Divine instruction leads us to believe that all souls will have an opportunity for
                                eternal improvement. We can most favorably commence the work of self-improvement today.
                                To accomplish this great work, we must bear the cross of Christ, which will enable every
                                one to say, "I have overcome the world." When we have overcome our individual world of
                                selfishness and unhallowed desires and have grown to the fulness of manhood and
                                womanhood in the ministration of Divine love, (Christ) we have truly "set down with Him
                                in his throne." Our Parents made their outward lives subservient to a spiritual travail.
                                The temporal duties of life claim attention, but they should be subjected to the
                                spiritual growth. We are pleased to see Br. D. Offord's remarks about the Reaper
                                &amp; Binder; we have one of the same kind, and think it<pb n="233" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> works
                                admirably. Two horses can draw it as easily as a mower, in heavy grass. It will do more
                                work, and better, than any four horse binder. Its name deserves mention, Adbiance. We
                                have been trying a Pruyn potato-digger and are convinced of its n\erits; may have more
                                to say about it hereafter. Two horses of moderate weight can draw it quite easily, when
                                properly adjusted. The weather has been hot for nearly two weeks, but a great change has
                                come and we now fear that frost will overtake the corn. It is surprising how suddenly
                                extremes follow each other in our New England climate. We wish to mention a brief visit
                                to our home from Elder Andrew Barrett. We felt him a messenger of spiritual riches,
                                gained by a life of consecration.

Deae Editor:�I see by the last Manifesto that I am brought upon the stand,
                                Criticism by Br. D. OfCord. Well, I think I deserve it, though it was my intention on
                                leaving home to have only a few days of rest. I have gathered much spiritual treasure,
                                and while enjoying these rich seasons of good at the several Societies, I did regret not
                                having the company of our good Sisters, to share with me, and to drink in the heavenly
                                inspirations. We are exhorted in our little paper to give breath to the spiritual as
                                well as to the temporal. During my visit to my former home they gave me the privilege of
                                a two days' visit to the little family in Canaan which met my feelings most agreeably.
                                In my interviews with the Brethren and Sisters, many expressed a strong faith in the
                                work of crucifixion, by the cross. The hour of worship really did my soul good, as I
                                listened to the testimonies of truth that found utterance in that little united band, I
                                could say with one of old, �"It is good to be here." Not only were we with those in the
                                body, but the presence of the immortals was sensibly felt during this beautiful season.
                                All through my old home I could realize the blessings of a heavenly influence resting
                                upon those who were still holding most sacred, those principles of purity which they
                                have valued more than life. If by the outward we read the index of the mind, or that
                                which is spiritual, we must say that Mount Lebanon holds her place as the fountain head,
                                from whence our other homes may still draw new life. How pleasant it was to see
                                consecrated souls ornamenting aud making their home attractive, in the beautifying of
                                the Lord's heritage. After a wearisome season of toil and care we are beginning to
                                realize the benefits of good and thorough farming. From less than a quarter of an acre
                                we took seventy-five bushels of extra nice potatoes, and the remaining four acres have
                                the appearance of producing as good results. Our corn and ensilage crop never was
                                better. The Sisters are busy in preserving the fruit, and in caring for the herbs. The
                                dry weather has very much reduced our water supply, and at present, we are obliged to
                                resort to the pumps for much that we use. A. D.

                                N. A. Briggs. Sept. 1891, We are now quite certain that the summer is past, and the
                                harvesting of many things has ended for this season, but the part that has special
                                reference to beingsaved will be reserved till next time. During the past few weeks we
                                have had sad forebodings of a failure in the potato crop, as in several instances there
                                has been evidence of premature decay. As the early crop was touched with the disease, we
                                thought that our foreknowledge would<pb n="234" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> readily determine the state
                                of the later crop. We now have a more favorable report, and shall wait through hope. We
                                have had an evolution or a revolu'tion in the coming of ovens. In 1837 our fathers built
                                a large oven of free-stone, and for many years it was thought to be one � of the best,
                                and was in daily use baking the best of bread and pies', etc. etc., till 1865 when it
                                began to depreciate in value and soon gave place to one of the galvanized iron ovens.
                                After the pleasure of the change was over, this oven proved objectionable from the
                                volume of heat that escaped as' the large doors were opened. The next change gave us a
                                large square free-stone oven, surrounded by another of brick and heated by a stove
                                placed in the rear and under the floor of the oven. Within this oven were four revolving
                                cast iron disks which were reached by four doors at the front. As the wheels or disks
                                were laid horizontally, the several doors in front were quite narrow and but little heat
                                escaped when any one of them should be opened. The chimney was directly over the oven
                                and as the draft proved to be defective from the first, this was charged as the cause of
                                its failure. In a few years this oven was remodeled but without any marked improvement.
                                A stove was placed inside of the oven, in order to obtain a quicker heat, but with the
                                heat came more or less smoke and to this the bakers objected. The top of the oven was
                                taken off and the flue enlarged. All this work did little good and it was decided to
                                remove the whole of the chimney and the oven and begin anew. This time the chimney was
                                built, having its foundation laid on stone work and the oven placed as near the chimney
                                as consistent. In appearance this oven bears a close resemblance to the last one. The
                                heating apparatus has been improved and the structure is now a nice, triple oven. The
                                outer one is of brick; within this is an oven of blocks of free-stone and the inner or
                                third oven is made of galvanized This last change has been at a cost of nearly three
                                hundred dollars, but the oven has been in daily use for several weeks and up to date is
                                pronounced a success. Elder George at Enfield Ct. has had a corresponding experience
                                with the oven built at that place and of whom we received our first patterns. He thinks
                                it is not best to say very much at present, about his improvements, which gentle hint
                                need not be lost in our case, as we shall probably hear from him at no distant day. A
                                company of five Sisters have recently made a visit to the Society at Enfield, N. H. and
                                have returned with glowing accounts of a beautiful place, where many near and dear

                                over. Now all New Eng. landers must prepare for winter. Harvesting is going on in this
                                section. Our grain has been gathered and threshed, yielding over 200 bu. Winter apples
                                are not very plentiful. Of early apples we have an abundance. Have already dried 72 bu.
                                Hope to dry as many more before we get through. On the 4th. inst. a company of ten
                                Sisters went from this place on an excursion to the city of Portland. They took the

                                Garden on Peak's Island and watched for the White Squadron which was to come in that day
                                but did not appear until after they had returned home. Another company went to the State

                                returned late in the evening. Health of Society generally good, but we are still in need

                                Notes from the North Family. I am twenty-one years old and have lived here twenty-one
                                months. I have been taught the faith of Believers and find it good. I intend to make an
                                effort to live and die by it. By faith in God, confession of sin and obedience to gospel
                                orders, good is gained and progress made in spiritual life. It shall be my aim to set a
                                good example and to aid my younger companions, of whom there are eight in this family
                                under age. Eldress Nancy is very zealous for our welfare both spiritually and
                                temporally. We have had good crops of wheat and corn this year, and a fair crop of Irish
                                potatoes. Plenty of vegetables, and fruit in great abundance. Of milk and butter, a
                                large supply. We have preserved and dried for family use an unusual amount of peaches
                                and other fruit. We have plenty of honey. Our Brethren and Sisters are promising and

                                received last evening, thanks for both of them; we were pleased to hear from you again,
                                just as we are each time you mail us- your kind thoughts of Groveland. We are quite sure
                                you are coming and tell the family so; we shall not cease looking for you till you come
                                which certainly you will. So hurry before snow-flying days appear for time flies so fast
                                you know they will soon be here then it will not be so pleasant to look about our town
                                when snow-drifts form along the path with sharp winds sweeping down. The many cold
                                nights, with not quite a frost have been unfavorable for sweet corn, it has not
                                developed as perfectly as it would with more warm weather, but with its imperfections
                                much of it is very good, and may yield a bountiful harvest; it is much easier to predict
                                a failure where no signs of failure exist than to search for signs of prosperity. We are
                                blessed above our highest anticipations in our fruit market. Apples and pears that we
                                were sure would not be seen or heard of, have grown into delicious healthful food, while
                                some trees are heavily laden, quite to the breaking of limbs. Pears have been so
                                abundant that some have been sold. Well, we cannot tell what a few months will produce
                                in the fruit culture. Wheat sowing was commenced the 3rd. inst., and farmers are
                                actively improving the fine days with their much-sowing, while the house managers are
                                trying to brighten the interior of house and home by sweeping and dusting and cleaning
                                in some of the many forms. A few buildings have had the roofs repaired and repainted and
                                many more are waiting for the same renovating element to brush them up to the shining of
                                more honor and beauty, but when they will, remains far ahead in the future, they may and
                                they may not. G. D.

                                the world. Some were reported to be worth their millions, who had come to these watering
                                places in pursuit of health and happiness. Judging by what we could see many had
                                mistaken excitement for happiness. A change for a day sometimes tends to bodily health
                                and present happiness. So thought President Westcott of the P. &amp; R. R. R. when
                                he so kindly sent a free pass to Eld. John for as many of our family as could leave home
                                to come down to Portland and go out to one of the islands in Casco Bay. On the 20th. of
                                Aug., thirty-one persons including children availed themselves of friend Westcott's kind
                                offer. If I should write a history of that day, it would take up too much of your
                                valuable space, suffice it to say on arrival at Portland we took steamer for Cushing's
                                Island where we spent a few hours watching the waves and inhaling the fresh breezes from
                                the broad Atlantic. Then returned to the city to give the children and some older ones
                                an opportunity to spend a few pennies for what most pleased them. At 5-30 P. M. took
                                train for home where we arrived very tired but not sorry for the journey. Brethren
                                harvested 150 tons of hay in very good order. The second crop is cut and eight acres of
                                sweet corn harvested which averaged fifty dollars to the acre. The cream sold for the
                                first seven months of this year amounted to $732.48.. The most received for one month
                                was $143.52. Twenty-five bu. of cranberries have been picked by the young Sisters the
                                past week. One young Sister hand picked two and one half bu. in one day. Health of

Dear Elder Henry :�As harvest is about to close, 1 will give some details of
                                the crops. "Wheat averaged about 20 bu. to the acre and we have raised about 10,600 bu.
                                on our farm. We have cut 625 tons of hay. Oats amount to about 6000 bu. averaging 30 and
                                35 bu. to the acre. Corn never looked better for this time of year, and we have some 675
                                acres planted, quite a considerable part of which is on virgin soil, and if no untimely
                                frosts come we shall have a large crop of corn Potatoes and other vegetables and fruits
                                are quite plentiful. For all these blessings we are under obligations to the benevolent
                                giver of all good things�obligations of deep gratitude and also great responsibility as
                                to what use we shall make of such unmerited munificence on the part of the great Father
                                and Mother who inhabiteth Eternity, even the eternal God who is our refuge and the
                                Everlasting Arms which are underneath all. Let us seek the Christ of the universe, "who
                                maketh the stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning; that
                                calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out on the face of the earth, the
                                Lord is his name." We are razing to the ground some useless and unsightly buildings and
                                trying to get things in better shape but it is slow work. Yet what will not patience and
                                perseverance accomplish in time? We consider a spelling school for our young folks to be
                                in order at this time, and are looking with considerable solicitude toward a Bible Class
                                in the near future. We must keep spiritually alive and try to rise more and more into
                                purity, love, self-abnegation &amp;c. or our highest temporal blessings may become
                                more a curse than a blessing. Our health is quite good, and if we could only persuade
                                those from outside to come in and help us enjoy the peace and purity, the contentment
                                and elevating influences of this blessed gospel our joy would be full. Elder Joseph

H.</head><p TEIform="p"> Sept. 13, 1891. Dear Editor:�I had about decided not to send a voice from our (corner?)
                                of the circle, when it occurred to me in our morning service, that if I was only able to
                                place upon paper the genuine spirit and inspiration of both exhortations and pieces
                                sung, it would be worth writing and also reading. Why does not some one in each Society
                                who is a regular attendant in service learn stenography: it certainly would be a surer
                                investment of both time and means than learning the art of remembering, the scientific
                                name of which I fail to recall, if I ever knew. I often regret that so many wise sayings
                                uttered by those rich in experience, are lost upon the air, while if it were possible
                                for them to be read at some future time by an awakened soul prepared for the good seed,
                                might bear golden fruit in the resurrection order; I will just touch upon the different
                                points as. space would not admit of other than brief mention. Our Beloved Elder Giles'
                                last words in our assembly were revived as very opportune; "We should be producers as
                                well as consumers." In the spiritual rendering, producers of love, peace, good-will, not
                                consumers alone, preying upon the vitals of society by magnifying the defects to our own
                                detriment. Our Community home was affirmed to be the best home for the development of
                                the Christ spirit; supplying the proper conditions whereby his life and teachings may be
                                lived, which home should be sacred to the memory of all consecrated souls, and never,
                                either intentionally or thoughtlessly, made to serve selfish purposes. The love which
                                should characterize the true disciple, far removed from the inferior quality of this
                                divine element, which is the unregenerate inheritance of humanity as a whole, pure,
                                peaceable, merciful, forgiving and withal truthful. In the freedom of our worship lies
                                both its benefit and beauty, so let us avail ourselves of all our privileges, that they
                                may be blessings in full. "Running ater is sweet, it is the tight tanks that become
                                slimy and unwholesome." E. B.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="By invitation of the Spiritualists of Albany..." TEIform="index"/>

SCRIPTURE TEXT. No. 1.</head><p TEIform="p"> "There came a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in ivhom I am well
                            pleased." Matt. Hi., 17. At the transfiguration a voice was heard, saying,�"This is my
                            beloved Son, hear ye him." In Exodus xxxiii., it is written, that the Lord spake unto Moses
                            face to face as a man speaketh to his friend, and in Gen. iii., 9 the Lord and Adam
                            conversed about the affair that occurred in the garden of Eden, but John in v., 37 in
                            quoting the words of Jesus that have reference to God, he says,�"Ye have neither heard his
                            voice at any time, nor seen his shape," while in John iv.,<pb n="238" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> 12. it
                            reads,�"No man hath seen God at any time." It might be quite a difficult matter to reconcile
                            all that may have been said or done as recorded in the first books of the Bible with the
                            statements found in the New Testament. The voice of God in the garden of Eden was quite
                            different from the voice of God on the banks of Jordan. Dreamers, visionists and seers,
                            whether acting in the capacity of Prophets, or Apostles, tillers of the ground or as keepers
                            of sheep, have from the earliest ages reported themselves as walking and talking with God.
                            To the dreamer while in the embrace of sleep, or to the visionist while entranced, this
                            seems to be as real as any of the transactions of our physical life. John says he saw the
                            heavens opened and heard the voice of God, and in all probability he was the only person at
                            the baptism that saw the heavens open, or the dove descend. It requires spiritual eyes to
                            see spiritual things and spiritual ears to hear the angels sing or even to hear the voice of
                            God. A dreamer may see as distinctly, hear as accurately and conduct an interview as
                            pleasantly and consistently as a person in full consciousness, and during this time be
                            locked securely in a room without company, and his mind wandering in dreamland. John was
                            quite safe in telling those unbelieving Jews that they had neither heard nor seen God,
                            according to the Christ dispensation. The disciples were quite human in manifesting a much
                            deeper interest for the dreamers and seers of their own order, than for those of other
                            people. They could heal the sick, but would see others consumed with fire from heaven,
                            rather than to have them healed in any other name than the one in which they were
                            interested. They could hear the voice of God, but were free to say that those not of their
                            order had never heard God's voice. As the voice of God is the voice of the spirit of
                            goodness, a person must be spiritually impressed to hear it.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Exegetical and critical" TEIform="index"/> EXEGETICAL AND CRITICAL.</head><p TEIform="p"> In Home Notes of Union Village, for Aug. Manifesto, Elder Oliver quotes a text from Ezek.
                            xxxi., 8, and asks "Who will hunt it up and explain it?" Sister H. Agnew thinks no one lias
                            paid attention to that request, and she wishes to have it noticed. She has hunted it up, and
                            I rise to explain. The Prophet is uttering a parable to describe the greatness, glory,
                            beauty, strength and prosperity of the kingdom of Assyria, which had been destroyed about 30
                            years previously, or in the year 605 before Christ. The world is represented as "the garden
                            of God," and its different kingdoms are likened to trees therein. As Assyria, which for a
                            time exceeded them all in greatness and beauty was brought down to Sheol and destroyed, so
                            would Egypt meet a like fate on account of the pride and arrogance of her people. No pomp,
                            nor splendor, nor greatness could save her from the punishment due for her sins. A. G.

SUNSET m THE ALPS.
It had been a day of excitement and
fatigue, and it was a luxury to rest upon
the bench in iront of the house where we
were stopping", and listen to the sweet-faced
old woman, our hostess, who was knitting
by the door and trying to talk to us, writes
Mary J. Holmes, the novelist, in the September Ladies' Home Journal, The streets
were full of people, thousands of them
who had come to see the play and were
now going home. The high and the low,
the rich and the poor Germans and French,
Americans and English, jostling against
each other, and anxious to get away: the
titled lady in silk and satin, whose destination was Munich or Innspruck, and the
owly peasant woman in her cotton gown
iml wooden s3ioes, who thought nothing of
l walk of sixteen miles which must be
accomplished before she reached her
lome far up among the Tyrolese hills.
On Mt. Kofel, where the huge cross was
standing, the sun was still shining with a
brightness which the old woman pointed
mt with the words, "See the glory show-'
ing.1'
And truly, it was a glory which that sunset threw over all the fir-clad sides of the
mountains; and when the red disk disappeared behind a tall gray peak, and the
purple shadows began to creep across the
river and the valley and up to the heights
where a few white, misty clouds were
floating, it was easy to understand why
to the superstitious fancy of the woman
there was in every cloud an angel's face
come to view the scene of the great tragedy, and to keep watch over the tomb which
to her, was more really in Obei-ammergau
than in Jerusalem. How the colors deepened and changed as the daylight faded,
until, at last, there were only a few bars
of crimson and gold marking the spot
where the sun went down. Then suddenly, on the opposite side of the valley
the jagged peaks were piled high above
each other, there came a luminous light
like that which heralds a fire, except that
it was soft and silvery, and the rocks and
trees and hills grew white and ghostly as
the moon rose higher and higher in the
heavens and brought into greater distinctness the little town with its humble, lowroofed houses, nearly each one of which
held an actor, who was either sleeping
quietly after the day's excitement or praying for grace and strength for the morrow,
when the work must begin again.
"'Tis like where He has gone," the old
women cried, dropping her knitting, and
folding her hands reverently as the moonlight fell upon her upturned face, while I
wondered if the city which needs no sun
by day nor moon by night, could be
fairer then this scene on which I wTas gazing.
