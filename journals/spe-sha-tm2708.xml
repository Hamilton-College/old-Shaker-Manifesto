TEIform="persName"/> By Elder Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> SO long as there are children and youth, there evidently will be no lack
                            of work for willing hands and Christian hearts. If love is to be the
                            redeeming advocate that shall save souls from the many low estates, it
                            must work where it can become effectually recognized. The testimony of
                            Jesus, the Christ, as we understand it, is the embodiment of all the
                            gifts and graces which should adorn the mind. The injunction which was
                            given to the disciples to "go forth into all the earth and preach the
                            gospel to every creature" has a significance as full and as broad as the
                            command itself. Everything must come within the boundaries of the mind;
                            and be readily comprehended or it fails to produce the desired results.
                            The words must be easily understood, or a mysticism will soon ruin their
                            force. As all undevelopt faculties are characteristic of childhood, a
                            man's age is determined by this fact, rather than by the number of years
                            he has past upon the earth. If he is to be led on to a higher life, it
                            must be through the culture of all the faculties in their respective
                            orders. Good manners must come first as a necessary preparation for the
                            more advanced moral education which at its best serves only as a teacher
                            to bring the life to Christ. The sensualist must repent,�change his mind
                            and walk circumspectly before he can be able to walk with God. The
                            self-conceited must learn to love his neighbor as himself or he would be
                            inclined to pray,�My Father who art in heaven, instead of�Our Father, as
                            was taught by Jesus. The beauties of neatness AUGUST, 1897 <pb n="114" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> must b e preacht to those who are predisposed to slovenly
                            habits as a part of the foundation on which to build the more exalted
                            work of Jesus the Christ. To be chaste and to be pure seem like a
                            pleasant association, opening to us a harmony that can not be obtained
                            by a neglect of either. If the highway to the Kingdom of Heaven begins
                            at the lowest strata of human minds, and every one who turns his face
                            and directs his steps toward the Holy City becomes a fellow-pilgrim,
                            then we can see why some are drawn to benevolence, others to order or
                            prudence and those more advanced in the regenerating life of the Christ
                            to a baptism of the Holy Spirit and of fire. Jesus in one of his remarks
                            has said;�"It is not given to all men to receive these sayings," Perhaps
                            he thought they had better be educated first in good manners, in
                            civility or in the elementary work of the Mosaic Law. We well remember a
                            visit we once made to a Theological Institute by invitation of a young
                            friend who was preparing for the Ministry. After he had given us an
                            introduction to the Bishop and to several of his fellow-students, we
                            past on from room to room till we reacht his own private apartments.
                            Here we rested for conversation. It was his home and the place where he
                            retired for communion with the spirit of his God. Here he was silently
                            being molded by the influences and conditions that were with and around
                            him. At some future day, after his Greek and Latin and Hebrew were
                            committed to memory, he would go out into the world to repeat them to
                            other minds, and with them he would give all the chaotic and
                            undisciplined forms of life in which he had lived. We wondered !
                            Everything was in confusion. A regard for order or even for rules of
                            propriety were entirely ignored. His apology for a bed occupied one
                            corner of the room, while his wardrobe, more privileged than his bed,
                            was only limited by the four walls of the apartment. The legitimate use
                            of the broom or brush, if they were there at all, had been sadly
                            neglected. We could but feel sorry for the young man as well as for
                            those to whom he was to be an apostle. He was now spending his months
                            and years learning to repeat a form of prayers and to become skilled in
                            certain ceremonies of the church and also in developing himself into a
                            stumbling-block as a Christian, by the cultivation of these slovenly
                            habits. Side by side these conditions are to pass with this student
                            through all the walks of life. Attaching themselves with the same
                            tenacity to the mind, they are reflected alike upon every company,
                            whether at his home or in the church among those who have come for
                            divine worship, which should be in the beauty of holiness. The
                            spirituality that could rest satisfied in the ministration of such an
                            element must, indeed be very crude. When we speak of the gospel of
                            Jesus, the love of God to lost souls,�that to be made partakers of its
                            divine beauty, we must bear his cross; then there are but few who
                            realize the depth of its spiritual meaning. We say that sin must be
                            washt away; but what is sin ? There may be a list of trespasses <pb n="115" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> which the disciple is expected to guard against,
                            for Paul has said that a transgression of the Law is sin, and as the
                            disciple of Jesus we sin and come short of the glory of God if we fail
                            to repent,�to change our lives, to become new creatures by which every
                            habit and practice may be brought under gospel inspection. We must live
                            soberly, righteously and godly. The gossiping busy body and
                            mischief-maker must give place to the loving peacemaker, indolence to
                            industry, and slatternly conditions of the mind to neatness. These are
                            the elementary lessons of the seeker after righteousness, as preparatory
                            to the entering upon that more exalted state of spirituality ;�purity of
                            heart. Like all the developments of life, righteousness is seen in every
                            phase, from the first germ to that of the Angel sphere. It is sometimes
                            difficult to reconcile our minds to the many incongruities that present
                            themselves under the guise of redeeming influences while the mind is
                            callous to the refining process which it is said shall work like the
                            refiner's fire and like fuller's soap. East Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Funeral of eldress Lois Wentworth" TEIform="index"/> THE FUNERAL OF

                            departure from this life of beloved Eldress Lois we met a loss,�we feel
                            a sorrow that should be shared by the Household of Faith for she loved
                            all Zion. Firm, true and hopeful was her spirit, broad was her mind and
                            warm her affectionate parental heart. We loved her as a mother in
                            Israel. We saw her enduring and faithful in the duties of her cherisht
                            home and there we honored her, not only as a mother but as a Queen,
                            crowned by angels and commissioned to administer the virgin laws of
                            their holy life. By her wise tenderness she gathered and held twelve
                            young girls,�they were her treasure. She labored to implant in them the
                            principles she had tested and the virtues that were her own. If the good
                            Brethren and Sisters in all our consecrated homes could have seen that
                            stricken band they would pray for those young people that they may still
                            prove loyal to her and make her glad by their confiding obedience to her
                            beloved successors, the sincere and worthy souls who are now appointed
                            to be the visible guides. It was a solemn assembly on the day of the
                            burial. The ever helpful Ministry were present, going about as
                            comforting angels to the bereaved little family. The memorial services
                            were feelingly opened by Elder Louis Basting and the Ministry's words of
                            appreciation for Eldress Lois covered her life from childhood to the
                            close of her seventy-five years that kept her still bright and active.
                                <pb n="116" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> Her unreserved devotion to the welfare of
                            others and her living spirit that went forth to humanity, making her an
                            Elder indeed, were most lovingly spoken of and the tributes that
                            followed their testimonies l'esembled the jewels in the Breast-plate of
                            old, beautiful and of great value. The tides of sympathy that swelled
                            even from the hearts of the silent were like the waters of life.
                            Although the day was dark, and cold gusts of wind brought rain, into
                            that house of sorrow came a spiritual light and warmth that shed
                            consolation. Trusting the dear ones to immortal guardians we left

                                dear Eldress pleased me more than I can tell you. Indeed, I had been
                                intending to write you these three days past to tell you how much
                                good I received from my interviews with you while you were here.
                                Your interest in me is one of my most precious thoughts. I trust I
                                may prove worthy of it. As I feel at present I can only keep
                                thanking the good Father over and over again for all his goodness to
                                me. What a happiness to feel one self among living souls that belong
                                to that one true church which Jesus founded when he preached his
                                ever memorable sermon on the Mount! I wish, dear Elder Henry, I
                                could in some way make you understand my happiness. As the days
                                pass, and the world and its frivolities recede to a dim remoteness,
                                I feel that God is drawing nearer and nearer to my own heart.
                                Believe me when I tell you I would rather fill the humblest place in
                                the Society of Believers than to occupy the most influential pulpit
                                in the land. Pity fills my soul when I think of those whom I have
                                left, and who can not see as I see. I wish they could all come into
                                my happiness. Poor blind souls! drifted about on the restless
                                current of a world's applause, their pursuit after worldly pleasure
                                is like a hunt after weeds and carrion. How often in their own lives
                                they catch glimpses of their folly, but the flesh preventing them
                                from deeper search, they struggle on without once experiencing the
                                unspeakable happiness of seeing God. Ministers of the gospel may
                                preach until the end of time the possibility of seeing God but not a
                                single soul that listens to that preaching will ever enjoy the
                                beatitude until sensuality is completely overcome. When ministers
                                preach this doctrine, how little they themselves know of what is
                                truly meant by seeing God ! How unwilling to pay the price of seeing
                                Him! 01 course we all know that when we speak of seeing God we are
                                using a figure of speech. <pb n="117" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> But there are
                                various ways of looking at the figure. I believe that in the mind of
                                Jesus, "seeing God" meant nothing more than the complete victory
                                over the lower nature, a constant and daily growth of the spirit
                                into a fuller sense of the divine, which will enable us to rise out
                                of the body, and soar away above the lusts of the world finding no
                                object worthy our capacities until we rest in God's own heart. Then
                                comes the peace that can not be defined, which we would not change
                                for all the wealth of the kingdoms of the earth combined. In
                                accepting this view of the figure it is plain that our vision of God
                                depends entirely upon ourselves. As we are, so is the God we see.
                                Each time we violate the divine command, or willfully close our eyes
                                to the light, we shift our point of vision oi" God. We know how
                                differently sensible objects appear according to the manner in which
                                they are viewed. The sun appears to be one thing when we view it
                                with the naked eye, but a very different thing when we view it
                                through the lens of a powerful telescope. So it seems to me it is
                                with God. He is one sort of being to the soul that views Him from
                                the sunny height of a pure heart, but a far different sort of being
                                to the soul that views Him from the low, dark vale of sensual
                                appetite and gratification. Is it not strange that intelligent,
                                professing Christians, do not see this grand truth which is as plain
                                as the noon-day sun ? If they did see it, instead of regarding our
                                precious faith as the height of folly, and we ourselves as fanatics,
                                they would see in our faith the ripest wisdom, and in ourselves true
                                followers of the meek and lowly Nazarene. I think that the Master
                                saw into the future when He said, "Fear not little flock. In the
                                world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer I have
                                overcome the world." Ke well knew his true followers would be a
                                small minority. He knew how hard it would be for the natural man to
                                discern the things of the Spirit. But tho we are a little body,
                                misunderstood, often despised and calumniated, who of us would
                                change that happiness we feel within, that divine guest our hearts
                                entertain, for all the wealth and power our despisers may possess.
                                We have a feeling towards them of pity,�a feeling voiced on the
                                Cross of Calvary, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they
                                do." Pardon me if I seem too profuse, but dear Elder Henry my heart
                                is so full of joy that I feel I could ascend the house-tops and
                                preach the glad tidings to all the world. 1 would that all men might
                                see that there is something, yea, the greatest happiness obtainable
                                in the "despised little Nazareth." Oh how I wish I had entered this
                                blessed Society before any sin of the world ever stained my soul!
                                During the years I spent in the ministry my position was that of
                                poor blind Bartimeus by the wayside, crying, "Lord open my eyes that
                                I may see! " I am firm in the belief that my petition has been
                                heard. My being here is sufficient proof of that. We had a very
                                helpful service last Sabbath morning. I must confess a <pb n="118" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> feeling of regret stole over me each time I lookt at
                                your vacant place. But we must not be selfish. You are doing the
                                Master's work where you are. We know you will come back to us. What
                                a glorious meeting that was we had when the good Sisters from
                                Enfield were here! It took my thoughts back to the first gathering
                                in the upper chamber at Jerusalem, and the Pentecostal descent of
                                the Holy Spirit. May we enjoy such meetings in the future. I long to
                                make myself useful. I want to learn everything. It will \\ quire
                                time and patience; but it will all come. Hoping, dear Elder Henry,
                                that you will be able to return to us soon, I remain, with much
                                love, Yours in the Faith,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Dwyer, Thomas A." TEIform="persName"/> Thomas A.

                            clear sunshine, the cloudless sky, of this beautiful June day, in
                            contrast to the leaden clouds which have settled over our hearts and our
                            home. A life, a love, an ornament is taken from our midst which nothing
                            can replace. Other friends are kind are good and true, but it is not
                            justice to the loving nor to the loved, to feel that their place can be
                            supplied, that the ranks pan be closed up, and we miss them not. Each
                            dear and loving friend, true as the needle to the Pole, rears in our
                            hearts a shrine to which we bring the best offerings of our lives ;
                            offerings which to each is meet; and which is sacred to each. Then when
                            a dear one passes "within the veil," can we s?t that shrine aside, and
                            place another in its stead ? Would it be justice to the living to feel
                            that "to be absent is to be forgotten?" Is it conducive to the growth of
                            a tireless pure affection, to know that it is transcient and euds with
                            time? Ah nay ! A thousand times Nay ! But how can we speak of the loved
                            one whose sacred memory we are vainly endeavoring to honor. Vocal sounds
                            seem but a mockery, when feeling is too deep to even be mirrored on the
                            surface. From our earliest childhood dear Sister Anna, has been so woven
                            into the web and woof of our lives, that it seems there almost needs
                            come a flaw in the pattern, when such needed such strong material is
                            taken out. Only in loving memory to the good she has done, we must like
                            the tapestry weavers of the far famed East, keep our eyes on the
                            pattern, above us, and following that, toil on e'en tho the web is
                            reverst, knowing that when the material is completed, the true pattern
                            will be represented. <pb n="119" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> We who were under her kindly
                            instructions when a teacher, who were blest with her spiritual guidance
                            in youth, know how much we owe the solid principle for which we have
                            workt, to both her precept and example; and the deference, love and
                            honor we have ever accorded her, proves the truth of the poet; "Our
                            hearts ne'er bow but to superior worth And never fail of their
                            allegiance there," When in our riper years her burdens fell on those she
                            had instructed, she did not leave her places of trust as vacancies to be
                            filled, but as a sturdy oak, she maintained her superior talent, on
                            which we as vines could cling; and all through the long years of change,
                            it has ever been thus ; so that those who are now bearing the burdens in
                            the heat of the day, have found that in every emergency, in every want
                            and need of life, we could turn to her for strength, for advice, for
                            sympathy and were ever sure of parental love and care. "Those there are
                            Whose hearts have a whole look southward And are open to the whole noon
                            of Nature." Such we found our loved sister. To the young her sunshine
                            was a magnet ; to mature life a strength, and to the aged a healing
                            warmth. To the erring she was charity and courage, which virtue alone
                            would ever hold her memory dear; for only those whose hearts can
                            sympathize with the weaknesses of frail humanity are worthy to bear the
                            name of our worthy Exemplar whose words were "Neither do I condemn thee,
                            go and sin no more." One markt characteristic of her noble nature was
                            her inability to take offence. She allowed no imaginary trials nor
                            burdens to mar her peace, nor to take the sunshine from the lives of
                            those about her. But it is needless to say more. She has written her
                            character, builded her monument, in our home and in our hearts; and dear
                            Sister Anna will live ever with us, her virtues growing more
                            resplendent, as time bears us on, and tho we may feel that such love as
                            we bear to her is "like seeds taken from the Tropics, and planted where
                            the winter comes too soon," we will think of her as "Not lost, but gone
                            before." Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituary eulogy for sister Anna Dodson" TEIform="index"/> Obituary

                            again to us returning, after exit, nevermore. Nevermore shall we behold
                            them while we tread this dusty ball; We must wait for this reunion till
                            we meet Death's solemn call. Thus the ties that now confine us to this
                            busy, earthly sphere, Weaker and more weak are growing as we fill each
                            passing year. When we feel the cords, so tender, by a sweet communion
                            spun Must be severed for the present, and the new one just begun Can
                            continue but a season, and unfinisht, we must part, Solemn are the
                            contemplations clustering round the thoughtful heart. What is life, and
                            all our knowledge, bat the drama of a day! Soon their measured, joys and
                            sorrows, forming but a curt relay. Here we ride the swelling billows, of
                            their ruthless foam, the sport, Aiming still to guide our vessels,
                            safely to their destined port. Winds, and storms, and tempests, ended;
                            conflicts over; labors done; All our yearnings; anguish; turnings; bring
                            us to life's rising sun, Where we view in unveiled lustre, the eternal
                            realms of Light And upon its shores we enter to regale our newborn
                            sight. Mortals paint in magic beauty, glories of the world to come, All
                            so purely beatific, and entrancing is that home, That it fills weak
                            minds with longings to repair there ere their time; Making this a veil
                            of sorrows, shorn of every grace sublime That would yield the fruits of
                            courage and the weary heart solace, Prompting unto noble action which
                            ensures abiding peace. But when earthly years are garnered with
                            perfected righteous toil, And the lamp of wisdom burneth brightly well
                            supplied with precious oil; When the days are fully numbered in the
                            calendar of life; When assured we've won the victory in the noble
                            glorious strife And have kept the Faith unsullied and with honor closed
                            the race; And surveying our sojournings, find no traces of disgrace,
                            Then it is we part the curtain; enter into open day, And receive the
                            righteous sentence to our souls most joyfully. So we view our noble
                            Sister, as she breathes her kind farewell To her Brethren, Sisters,
                            kindred, in the Summer Land to dwell. She has been a faithful toiler,
                            guarding well her Savior's fold; Caring tenderly, parentally, for her
                            people young and old. Patient, merciful, forgiving, in charity
                            abounding, kind; Self-denying, peaceful, solace giving to the burdened
                            mind. Precepts lead! Examples draw! This sterling maxim gray with age,
                            Embodies in its excellence, the wisdom of the sage. Our Sister's bright
                            example is an evidence of this A Christian exposition, made by works of
                            righteousness. Her mandate was not, Go I and without me, perform the
                            task, But, I will take the burden. Come, follow! This only will I ask.
                            And thus she filled life's measure, and rounded her three score and ten,
                            And that she has been faithful, unitedly we say, Amen.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Angels just over the way" TEIform="index"/> THE ANGELS JUST OVER THE

                            pure, Were only the pulsings of those who secure A birthright with
                            Angels to stay. As I pensively mused, in a querying mood, Whence came
                            this effusion, so cheering and good, Spreading o'er and around me like
                            aerial flood, All pure and entrancing to me? The whisper replied, as tho
                            from the sphere, Where nothing but goodness could ever appear, 'Tis the
                            bond of true friendship, untarnisht, sincere, Of Angels just over the
                            way. Can it be? I again askt the ministering Guest, Tha,t earth ever
                            garnered a treasure so blest, So lofty, so noble, so fully possest Of
                            sacred felicity, boundless and pure? Once more the sweet spirit replied:
                            It is true. This good is the solace that Time brings to view And this
                            tow'ring upward, will ever be new, Eternally, heavenly, socially sure.
                            The joys and the pleasures which true hearts possess, The sweet
                            consolation which naught can repress, Will brighten in lustre as Godward
                            they press, With Angels just over the way. And there the strong bond of
                            true friendship will be Unfailing and cheering thro Eternity, And
                            unsullied union and felicity Will make all such Angels forever to stay.
                            Thus our Sister has woven her garments divine, By virtuous actions with
                            beauty they shine, Her life work of goodness has made her sublime, An
                            Angel of eternal day. Her robe and her crown are spotless and white, Her
                            spirit refined with Christianity's light Has made her credentials a
                            compromised right, With Angels of glory to stay. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="William H. Gladstone is credited with the following remarks..." TEIform="index"/>

                                at present, appears to have a very keen edge, and its wielder is
                                engaged in making thinner our already depleted ranks with a ruthless
                                hand. One by one the ripened sheaves are garnered in the Lord's
                                illimitable store-house. We now have to add to the long list of
                                garnered the name of our worthy sainted Sister, Anna Dodson. She
                                doffed the mortal and donned the immortal, and spread her angelic
                                wings and soared to the Celestial Sphere to join the ranks of those
                                who dwell in the City of the Living God, which has no need of the
                                sun to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it. The
                                funeral was held on the 27th ult. Descending from the celestial to
                                the terrestrial, I will simply state: We are celebrating the
                                Independence of the United States of America on this Fourth of July,
                                by opening Public Meeting in our Church edifice. We shall hold
                                Public Service so long as the weather will permit. The opening
                                meeting was a success. The hay harvest now occupies our time and
                                strength. It has been cool and wet enough to render the grass crop
                                heavy and splendid. We are thankful for this blessing. Crops,
                                generally, are luxuriant especially the potato beetle and apple tree
                                worm; but a dose of paris green and hellebore puts them to rest. in
                                the spring of 1896 we set a sixth of an acre to strawberry vines;
                                this year on June 19th we began picking; between that date and July
                                3rd we have gathered 26 bushels. We gathered at one picking seven
                                and one half bushels. A large number of the berries measured five
                                and one half inches in circumference. It has- been too cold for
                                asparagus to do its best; but bad as it has been we have taken 89
                                bushels from the bed. Our milk is so flush, and the apparatus for
                                preserving it is becoming so dilapidated we are under the necessity
                                of setting up a separator to take the cream from the milk. The
                                Ministry at present are with us; but as they, of necessity, are
                                migratory Officials, their tarry with us is very precarious. It is a
                                time of general health in the Community. Eldress Ann Taylor is not
                                long for this world unless all signs fail. She is so as to be about,

                                June have past away all quite too soon. On a sunny Sunday afternoon
                                of May last, we paused in our occupation to listen to the music in
                                the air, it was like the voice of many waters, as the voice of
                                harpers harping with their harps, and we lookt and lo ! a company
                                from the North and from the Church and from the neighboring family,
                                were singing, and they sang an old song which we all well knew as
                                they approacht our home on the hill, meeting in pleasing communion
                                with we southerners, the family hall resounded with vocal and
                                instrumental music intersperst with compliments and greetings of all
                                concerned. Thus happily an hoar past whan the starn er duties or
                                life called us back to our respective posts. Among the transfers of
                                the good and just to spirit life we record the departure of our
                                dearest friend and mother Sister Lydia Dole whose beautiful life
                                well filled with grand and noble deeds will ever remain as a guiding
                                light inspiring us on to more loyalty in the service of God's
                                kingdom. Her going from our vision is not death but renewed life, it
                                is but "an event in a,continuous existence." June was made decidedly
                                agreeable by the coming of two of our Sonyea Sisters, Elizabeth
                                Sidell and Eleanor DeGraw who spent a brief time visiting friends in
                                this Community. We hope when they come again they will forget to
                                remember their return trip and extend their tarry beyond the limits
                                of a few days. July with its toi-rent of burning sun has come to
                                stay till it goes. We are having a quiet celebration of Independence
                                day by trying to keep cool. Genevieve DeGraw. North Family. July,
                                1897. Heat is intense. An abundant cherry harvest gives more than
                                abundant employment to Brethren and Sisters; other fruit will soon
                                demand attention. All kinds look promising. Two young men and one of
                                riper years have been added to our ranks since early spring. All
                                seem interested in giving freely of their best efforts. Two women
                                who have been corresponding with a view to membership are expected
                                to visit us soon. Public meetings were opened July 4th; an excellent
                                beginuing has been made. The removal of the Canaan family leaves a
                                lamentable space in our large meeting house. We miss them in the
                                singing and in spiritual ministration. We are receiving invitxtions
                                from several leaders in the social movement for a company of
                                Brethren and Sisters to attend meetings in Chicago to give
                                suggestions and otherwise aid in the organization of a new
                                co-operative society. It is but natural that those who have so long
                                held together on the basis of radical communism should now be
                                solicited for help in solving the difficult problems of our time. We
                                know that we have some yet to solve for ourselves. Experience has
                                taught us that the religious impulse alone, based on strong
                                conviction will prompt to that selfdenial which will insure success
                                in any organization beyond a mere business compact. The present
                                systems of industrial and social life have evidently reacht their
                                day of doom. God speed all workers toward those conditions of
                                justice which must ever be the foundation of "peace on earth
                                good-will to men."

Y.</head><p TEIform="p"> July, 1897. On a neat little memento presented us by a friend to be
                                used for removing the dust from the eye glasses was printed the
                                motto, "If you would see the world aright, Be sure and keep your
                                glasses bright." It led us to reflect that in all the phases of life
                                objects apparently partake of the condition of the medium through
                                which they are seen. The mind inclined to be misanthropic, looking
                                through the vision <pb n="124" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> of the pessimist sees life
                                as it were moving backward toward universal collapse. But to a mind
                                which has a clear sight, viewing aught existing conditions knowing
                                that out of the conflicts of opinion and clashing of interests that
                                seem at present to absorb and turn to a sinister use human life;
                                above it all there is the good angel of concord, more powerful and
                                farreaching in the results than all the rest. We do not accept the
                                doctrine of a chance world, nor that of fatalism. The one leaving
                                everything to go hap-hazard; the other accepting what ever is as
                                final with no power to change for the better. We would suggest the
                                fact that the good Deacon in his controversy with the slave-holder
                                believed that the Lord would be on the side of the one who was ready
                                to help himself; at least the slave-holder thought so judging by his
                                conduct when they had their last meeting. The prospects at present
                                indicate a heavy hay crop. Spring crops are late, the last corn
                                planting on the 25th of June. When we compare conditions with the
                                flooded districts of the west and the sufferings from the violent
                                wind-storms that have devastated sections of our country we have
                                reason to be thankful for our exemption from those destructive
                                elements.

                                thraldom of the demon of licentiousness, stricken with
                                soul-blighting diseases, tinctured with the curse of intemperance,
                                fettered in the chains of tyranny, homes wherein the angel of purity
                                never enters and the song of gladness never sounds, how our hearts
                                ought to throb with sympathy for the unfortunate, and with gratitude
                                for our own blessing. Is not home life made harmonious and
                                prosperous by the congregated efforts of her inmates to establish
                                justice, morality and integrity of the highest order? and should not
                                home be of such worth to us that we exert our abilities to get rid
                                of all that is disagreeable and debasing? thus adorning home with
                                virtues and joys of more value than the costliest gem we could
                                possess, or the finest works of art we could hang upon the walls.
                                True,. Home's not mere roof and room, It needs something to endear
                                it; Home is where the heart can bloom, Where there's some kind lip
                                to cheer it. George H. Baxter.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shaker Station, Connecticut" TEIform="index"/> Shaker Station,

                                Brethren are having great success on the farm. Not because of the
                                great numbers toiling thereon, but because God is in the midst of
                                those who serve Him faithfully, and whose interests and loves <pb n="125" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> are universal; no one claiming aught as mine
                                or thine. Jesus said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of
                                these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." Showing we can not love
                                and serve God unless we love and serve one another. We have taken
                                advantage of the pleasant Sabbaths, and held our morning religious
                                services at the Church. In the afternoon they meet with us for
                                Singing. We enjoy this interchange very much. Our dear Father,
                                Gilbert Avery is enthused with the vegetarian principle and says he
                                is going to be a vegetarian the rest of his life. If he at the
                                advanced age of eighty-nine years can change his diet, should those
                                who are younger think it such a task? The Brethren are drawing coal
                                for winter use. The haying is already commenced. The cherries are
                                almost all gathered. Through the liberality of our friends at the
                                Church we have enjoyed quite a feast of strawberries; another year
                                we hope to have some from our own garden. The peaches are fast
                                ripening. The Sisters are painting and improving all that needs this
                                attention round about home. We hope Elder Andrew Barrett will
                                continue to keep us informed through the Home Notes as to the
                                progress they are making in Florida, as we are much interested that

                                at the type case and as I think of you and your dear companions,
                                there rushes to my mind so many thoughts of days of happy
                                interchange, now past, yet to be renewed in days to come, that I can
                                set them in type as readily as I could write with the pen. I shall

                                let us ask angels to bless our past efforts to do the right and so
                                chasten us, in the wisdom of the Divine Spirit, that we may become

                                        therefore, to food itself we must primarily look for the
                                        origin of these earthly deposits. Besides providing the
                                        requisite elements of nutrition, food contains calcareous
                                        salts, which, upon being deposited in the arteries, veins
                                        and capillaries become the approximate cause of ossification
                                        and old age." "The action of distilled water as a beverage
                                        is briefly as follows: First, its absorption into the blood
                                        is rapid; second, it keeps soluble those salts already
                                        existing in the blood, thereby precluding their undue
                                        deposit; third, it facilitates in a markt degree their
                                        elimination by means of excretion. After middle life a daily
                                        use of distilled water is highly beneficial to those
                                        desirous of retarding old age, and it is also a useful
                                        adjunct for averting stone in the bladder and kidneys."
                                        Distilled water, diluted phosphoric acid, glycerine and some
                                        of the aromatics constitute a most delicious drink�a very

                                fruits, nuts, fish, venison and wild game contain only a very trifle
                                of these calcereous salts and earthly particles, and are, therefore,
                                very healthy for the aged. Fruits and distilled water are specifics
                                for ossific depositions. A French physician observes That man begins
                                in a gelatinous and ends in ah osseous condition.....In the human
                                body water forms TO per cent, of its aggregate weight; in fact there
                                is not a single tissue which does not contain water as a necessary
                                ingredient. Now water holds certain salts in solution, which become
                                more or less deposited, notwithstanding the large proportion
                                eliminated through the secretions. Nevertheless it is only a matter
                                of time before these minute particles deposited by the blood have a
                                markt effect in causing the stiffness and aridity of advancing life.
                                The reason why in early life the deposits of earthly salts are so
                                infinitesimal is simply because they have not had time to
                                accumulate. "It is the old kitchen boiler which is found full of
                                incrustations, not the new one, time not having been sufficient for
                                their deposit. M. LeCann proved by analysis that human blood
                                contains compounds of lime, magnesia and iron, averaging 2. lin
                                every 1.000 parts. This clearly demonstrates that in the blood
                                itself are contained the earth salts, which gradually become
                                deposited in the system."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sabbath piece" TEIform="index"/> A SABBATH PIECE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Vinneo, Cora C."
