We have
                            received three numbers of the St. Louis Republican, containing a detailed account of a
                            seance held by W. C. Clark, as medium, but exclusively under the supervision of Henry
                            Timpkins. He had offered the medium $50 for the privilege of shooting the spirit when it
                            became visible. He did shoot it, with a rifle, as soon as it appeared. The cabinet and all
                            its appurtenances were improvised and arranged by Timpkins and the city reporters, the
                            medium's clothes all changed and himself secured as best they could devise. When the seance
                            ended, he was found just as they left him. The money was paid upon the spot, and no one
                            breathes any suspicion of trick or fraud, except the Scientific American, hundreds of miles
                            away in another city and State. It is accepted as one of the most wonderful and
                            unaccountable occurrences of the day — totally inexplicable — except upon the theory of
                            genuine spirit materialization. Here follows a letter from the medium to the editor of S.
                            &amp; S. and his answer thereto.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="St. Louis, August 16, 1875" TEIform="index"/>St. Louis, August 16, 1875</head><p TEIform="p">Elder. Evans — Dear Sir : Inclosed, please find accounts of materialization, through my
                            mediumship. That night, on retiring, I beheld a great light in the center of the room. Out
                            of the light, proceeded a voice, saying, " We have chosen you, as a medium, through and by
                            whom we may be permitted to do great and wonderful works ; we wish yoxi to go to Mount
                            Lebanon, for thirty days, and sit with my people, for their development." Thrice, this
                            happened, that night. Next day, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, while sitting in my room,
                            pondering upon the events of the night, I made up my mind, that if, upon its next
                            appearance, I could overcome the awe with which it inspired me, I would speak and question
                            it. Immediately it was present, but it was long before I dared speak. At last I mustered
                            courage to address it, saying, ¦" Are you a Spirit?" Answer — "Yea." "Whose?" "Mother Ann
                            Lee, I am called by the faithful." " What, the Shakers ? " " Yea." " Last night you wished
                            me to go to Mount Lebanon; I, being of the world, they would not be willing to have me sit
                            with them." " Write my desire, and they will be more than anxious to have you in their
                            midst." " You know I am engaged to be married shortly ? " " Yea." " Should I go, I would
                            want to take my wife with me." "That is our intention; you would not be perfect, in this our
                            intended development, without her." " Would it be wise, in me, to question what this
                            wondrous work is to be, and how I am to proceed in the matter ?" " When there, I will
                            impress you whom to choose to form a Circle, sitting one hour each day." " Am I to Sit for
                            manifestations, or materializations, while there ? " " Nay, we wish to draw a subtile force
                            from you, to equalize the Circle, through and by whom we will be enabled, with others, to
                            manifest ourselves to the world, and teach them the way of life." " By others, do you mean
                            of the Shaker persuasion?" "Yea," " Will this take place during my sitting with them ?" "
                            Nay." " How soon after ? " " You are not permitted to know ; it will be after the death of
                            one or more members of the Circle." " Do I understand that you will be enabled to take on
                            the form, and appear to the world, in such manner, that all, who behold you, will, of a
                            surety, know you are a Spirit ? " " Yea." " Shall I let my friends know of your appearance
                            to me, and your desires ? " " Nay ; none but the lady you are about to marry." " Whom, of
                            the Shakers—a's I know none of them — shall I apply to?" "Elder Evans." " Shall I write him
                            and let him know of your communication with me ?" " That is our desire." I have delayed
                            writing, until compelled by some unseen force. I now feel relieved. Please answer this
                            communication, immediately. Address me at this city ; also Dubuque, Iowa, as I may be in
                            that city in a few days. Respectfully yours,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Clark, W. C." TEIform="persName"/>W. C.

                            The Papers also received. Of course, the first question that arises is, Who is W. C. Clark ?
                            as I am as unknowing of you as you are of me. To sit, at intervals for thirty days is a long
                            time. A young married couple would be objectionable, if living in "youthful lusts that war
                            against the soul." We are of the Resurrection Order. Any Spirit, in or out of the body, who
                            sustains not this Order, if presuming or assuming to teach us, we will, without hesitation,
                            reject. We do not believe every spirit. They must be tried. See 1st John, 4-1. I do believe
                            in the Law of Materialization, and that it will be developed among the Shakers. I also
                            believe, that in the world, it will be used as a medium through which many, who marry, will
                            be brought to a practical knowledge of the True Order of Nature— Sexual commerce for
                            offspring only. And to a knowledge of true Celibate Order for those who are called into the
                            Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth — the Shaker System. I see nothing practically objectionable,
                            except the marriage of the mediums, which may be a trap, or snare, to preach marriage to the
                            Shakers, by authority of Spirits. If that be the covert design, we want nothing to do with
                            it. We do not live as we do, because Ann Lee did so live, nor would we change, should she be
                            materialized and come among us to subvert the doctrine of the Holy Celibate Life and Order
                            that she established. You are very welcome to visit us, and when you come, we will do as we
                            feel guided by the Spirit of Truth.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F. W." TEIform="persName"/>F. W.

                            they are alone together in the wigwam, after the following manner : " My son, the time has
                            come when you must lay aside your childish toys, together with the thoughts and manners of
                            your childhood and become a man — a man in thought, and a man in feelings and in actions.
                            You must mingle with the elders in council and listen to the words of wisdom spoken by the
                            Ahkewainze (wise men) of the tribe. " Bring all your childish playthings — your bows and
                            arrows with which you amused yourself—and cast them into the fire of the wigwam as an
                            offering to the Great Spirit. Then follow me to the forest. I will build you a wahkiegun
                            (house of fasting) in which you must fast many days before the Great Spirit, with your face
                            bowed to the earth. Your face will be painted black, as a token of your childish darkness
                            and ignorance. A cup of water will be placed before you, which will be your only refreshment
                            during your many days of fast. If you persevere, my son, the Great Spirit will surely look
                            down upon you from the windows of his house in the sky, and you must listen to his voice. Do
                            not reject the words of the Great Spirit! Open your ears to them! As the little birds in
                            their nests lift up their heads and open their mouths to receive food from the parent bird,
                            so do you, my son, open your ears to receive the words of the Great Spirit. He will teach
                            you to be wise in speech, when you take your seat in the assembly of the elders. He will
                            give you wisdom, so that even the ancient men of the tribe will bow their heads before you.
                            He will also give you wisdom in hunting the wild beasts of the forest. He will show you the
                            beast of prey that is to be your totame (family name, or badge), of which you will be a
                            mighty hunter before Kejea Manito — the Great Spirit." The son does as his father commands
                            him. He follows him to the forest. His father constructs a wigwam for fasting. He places in
                            it a cup of water, paints the face of his son black, lays him on his face on the floor of
                            the wigwam, and leaves him to the direction of the Great Spirit. The son remains in this
                            attitude fasting for many days, praying to the Great Spirit for wisdom and strength to
                            endure to the end of his fast. Many days pass over — some have said they have fasted eight
                            or nine days before the Great Spirit spoke to. them from his window toward the south. He
                            tells him wherein he shall excel, gives him words of wisdom to speak by the council fire of
                            the chiefs and elders, reveals to him his totame, and speaks to him words of strength and
                            courage. The young man arises, returns to his father's wigwam, washes the black paint from
                            his face, and paints it white — an emblem of purity and truth. His mother sets meat before
                            him. He eats and refreshes himself from the effects of his fast. He then arises, goes into
                            the forrest and cuts for himself a bow and arrows from a tree to which he has been directed,
                            during his fast, by the Great Spirit. He returns to the wigwam, arms himself with his bow
                            and quiver of arrows, and with his father's blessing, starts off in pursuit of the animal
                            which has been shown him by the Great Spirit. He travels until he has found it. He may have
                            trackless miles of wilderness to pass over, and cross broad rivers and streams, and climb
                            steep precipices, and dig through tangled thickets — still he must not flinch. He must
                            pursue his way until he has found and captured the animal that has been shown him in his
                            dreams. He discovers it — his arrow does not miss — it is the gift of the <pb n="82" id="p2" TEIform="pb"/> SHA.KER Great Spirit; lie takes it on his back and bears it — a part or whole — to his
                            father's wigwam. A feast is prepared, the old men of the tribe are called in, the victor's
                            song is sung, and they worship in the dance before the Great Spirit. Prom that day he is no
                            longer a boy, with childish thoughts and actions, but calm and sedate, with firm and
                            steadfast step, he walks erect, with his face upward, for he has spoken and conversed with
                            the Great Spirit. He forsakes all his former vain and frivolous companions, and mingles with
                            the wise men of the tribe. He listens to their words of wisdom, treasures them in his heart
                            and shapes his course by them, and so becomes a useful man in his tribe, and after death
                            crosses the spirit prairie and the great river in safety, and finds repose in the Land of

                            known — common sense. I am the happier for the realization of living in an age when so many
                            may be truly complimented as having in possession this additional faculty, and for finding
                            its influence so weighty, in deciding the correctness or folly of their theology. Ours is an
                            age when people are too intelligent to be satisfied with a theological deduction, because
                            somebody says it is so; and unless it be agreeable to science, to which theology is
                            handmaiden, and unless it will bear the criticism of the gospel of common sense, it is soon
                            rejected. The gospel of common sense looks upon Jesus as a lineal descendant of perfected
                            Judaism— his mission, the time being ripe, being a progressive evolution into higher life.
                            These admitted, the gospel of common sense questions the propriety of professional
                            Christians adhering to certain practices of the Jews, neglecting almost entirely the
                            superior principles of him whose name they assume. The Jews practiced marriage for
                            reproduction only, this being regulated by law. They were permitted by the same good law to
                            hold private property, except upon their occacasional sabbaths, for forty-nine years, when
                            they most begin over again, their landed possessions reverting to the original owners. War,
                            and retaliation, equal to an injury done, were among their other privileges. The prominent
                            advances of Christianity were made upon these principles, which were righteous, in Judaism.
                            Instead of marriage and its consequences, Jesus lived and taught celibacy; and the gospel of
                            common sense asks, how many Christian followers has he in this ? Instead of the righteous
                            reproductions of Judaism, Jesus invites to " sow to the spirit," and, with him, join the
                            children of resurrection, who have risen out of the generative sphere into practices quite
                            superior. Jesus taught and practiced community of goods—common property— and the gospel of
                            common sense is surprised that Christians in name are not more generally practical in this
                            respect; but that they rather imitate the Jews, and poorly at that, by miserable families
                            and private property, having no sabbaths upon which to feed the poor, free their slaves,
                            rest their land, forgive their debtors ; but abolishing all these, claim as a right, the
                            possession of the land and debtors as mine forever ! At all of this retrogression, the
                            gospel of common sense is greatly astonished! Jesus taught non-resistance—peace, love and
                            good will to all, friends and enemies. He was particularly impressive in the prayer he
                            taught, and the sermon on Mount Beatitudes, that his followers should exceed the Jews, by
                            forgiveness of their enemies. Now, the gospel of common sense is astounded, that professedly
                            Christian soldiers torture and kill, not only their enemies, but friends, who have never
                            wronged them, nor given offense ! It objects to Christian soldiers carrying guns, bayonets
                            and swords, with which to forgive their enemies. It objects to the impropriety of so-called
                            Christian governments placing the Lord's Prayer and sermon on the mount in the knapsacks,
                            while they refuse their enemies forgiveness until after they have killed them! There are
                            many other things the gospel of common sense would say to professedly Christian people,
                            could they bear them. But I hope these allusions will cause a halt for reflection upon and
                            comparison between the Christian professions of today, the Christian practices of
                            Pentecostal times, and the adherents of all faithful followers of Jesus, practicing the
                            gospel of common SENSE.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Berlin, New Jersey, August 18, 1875" TEIform="index"/>Berlin, N. J., August 18, 1875</head><p TEIform="p">Dear Friend Evans : A great deal is being said and done in preparation for the Centennial
                            Exhibition to be held, next year, in Philadelphia. Probably a great deal of improvement, in
                            the Arts and Sciences, in the last century, will be shown. But how much advancement, in
                            honesty, justice and practical righteousness, is another question. As the war of the
                            Revolution, which resulted in our separation from the mother country, was a protest against
                            taxation without representation, how can we celebrate the event without blushing, while half
                            our population are as much slaves to the other half, as were the Colonies to the mother
                            country ? I do not believe in voting. If humanity ever attain to a higher state of society,
                            we will have a different—a better government, in which there will be neither vote, sword,
                            nor gun. So long as our Government is founded on the vote, it seems a mockery to celebrate
                            what we call Independence, while the Feminine Half of our population are classed with idiots
                            and imbeciles. How can we hold a celebration, without shame, while our Government is robbing
                            the Red Men of their lands, and hunting them like wild beasts ? The leaders of the
                            Centennial movement want to have the Indians represented there. Will they not blush when
                            foreigners ask, what has become of the millions of Indians who once owned and inhabited this
                            fair land, and inquire how the scattered remnants of that race are now situated, and how
                            treated by our Government ? On the subject of peace: A whole century of boasted improvement,
                            and our nation in debt more than two- thousand millions, for a war among ourselves; with an
                            army and navy, costing from sixty to a hundred millions per annum, in time of peace — except
                            a chronic war with the remnants of ruined red men! If the leaders of the Centennial movement
                            want honor, let them assemble, as did the Revolutionary Fathers, in Independence Hall, and
                            issue a new Proclamation. Let them proclaim that Women of the United States are entitled to
                            all the Rights and Privileges of Citizens; let them declare that henceforth the Indian Race
                            shall be treated as Brothers and Sisters—not as wild beasts ; and let them Proclaim, as with
                            the Trump of Gabriel, to all the World and the rest of mankind, that This Nation shall never
                            engage in War — that swords shall be beaten into plowshares, and spears into pruning
                            hooks—and that the people shall learn war no more. If they will send forth a Proclamation
                            like this, in the true and living spirit of him who, eighteen hundred years ago, on a
                            certain mount, preached Truth, Justice and Peace, then may they hold a Centennial, in which
                            all good Men and Angels can rejoice. A Centennial, any thing short of such Proclamation,
                            should end in shame and disgrace. A Friend to all,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hacker, J." TEIform="persName"/>J.

                            reorganization of the Civil Government that shall do justice to all the members of the body
                            politic—a plan that will carry out, more perfectly, the intentions and principles of
                            Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, and their coadjutors. The Revolutionary Fathers were inspired
                            and raised up to lay the foundation of a Civil Government that should eventually effect a
                            complete separation of Church and State. God put it into their hearts to hate, without
                            exception, all existing theologies. In our own time, Lincoln and his followers ; Horace H.
                            Day, the famous India Rubber man ; Gerrit Smith ; G. H. Evass, the originator of the Land
                            Reform movement, who wrote " Vote Yourself a Farm," and published papers and books to the
                            end of his life, advocating the Inalienable Rights of Man and Woman, the Owens and their
                            compeers, were also, by the same Spirit, inspired and raised up, to progress and perfect the
                            Civil Government — this being the New Earth, even as the Spiritual— Shaker Order — is the
                            New Heavens, whose founders were inspired and raised up simultaneously with the founders of
                            the American Government. They were cotemporaries, and the two Orders have hitherto run
                            parallel toward the final goal — a true Natural Order and a true Spiritual Order. The
                            highest kind of inspiration is that which takes hold of the affections and understanding of
                            the mediums, leading them to consecrate their lives, fortunes and sacred honors, to the
                            cause of Humanity, as the purest worship of God. The monopolizing, fighting, marrying
                            Christians, call these inspired souls—these Saints— in the Natural Order, Infidels; and in
                            the Spiritual Order, Fanatics. An Infidel is a person false to profession. Not so were the
                            skeptical Revolutionary Fathers, nor the equally skeptical Lincoln, who emancipated the
                            slaves of this Free Republic. That whole class, the first of whom founded, and the last of
                            whom are progressing the American Government, have made the term Infidel an honorable
                            appellation, as the Shakers have redeemed the word Fanatic, by Successful Communism. Fanatic
                            means excessive enthusiasm upon religious subjects, extravagant notions, strange motions and
                            extraordinary vehemence in religious worship. Among Shakers, these have ultimated in
                            practically shaking off many of the lusts of the flesh and mind that still infest
                            Christendom. Our writers put anti before such Christians, and prove, from their history,
                            that it is well put. Shall we Shakers condemn the Skeptics to an/i-Christianity for
                            following our example ? From the standpoint of English Law, much progress has been made by
                            the American Government. 1st. The Public Lands have been proclaimed the common inheritance
                            of Humanity. The People have "Voted themselves a Farm." Any person, of any race or nation,
                            may become an American, and have a home. 2d. Under the Homestead Law, any Citizen can
                            protect a homestead against creditors. 3d. Imprisonment, for debt, is abolished in most of
                            the States. 4th. Woman's Rights in property are secured in part. Her right, as citizen, is
                            not fully secured. Man does the voting, makes and executes the laws — holding woman in
                            barbaric thraldom. In the marriage relation, she has not control of her own person. And "
                            Land Limitation" is yet in the future. 5th. Chattel Slavery is abolished ; but War, the root
                            of slavery, is not yet abrogated. 6th. Church and State are partially separated, and liberty
                            of conscience exists, nominally. Theology is still recognized by law— Chaplains in
                            Legislature, Army and Navy, and Bibles in Public Schools — Debts are not yet illegal—Paper
                            Money exists; even a paper house might do good service, until you really need a house. 7th.
                            Privateering on the High Seas, in time of war, is extinct. Spiritualism,as a force, by which
                            alone the above-named " plagues of Babylon"—Christendom— can be removed, is not yet
                            officially recognized. In the Cincinnati Convention of original thinkers, individuals, with
                            a mission, can fulfill their mission in a quiet, unostentatious manner. They attend, not as
                            delegates ; they represent themselves only — a private assembly. What meeting could a
                            Believer attend, with a probability of doing more good, in so short a time? The originators
                            of the movement, finding more of their principles in practical operation in the Shaker
                            Order, than elsewhere, ^lND 82 <pb n="83" id="p3" TEIform="pb"/> SHAKERE8S, 83 asked me to attend, and to
                            nominate some fifteen or twenty others, in different States. How shall the Law go forth,
                            from Zion, to the Natural Order, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem? Daniel legislated
                            for the great Babylonian Empire. Why cannot God raise up Daniels—Prophets—in our day ? Are
                            not all the Children of Zion Prophets ? The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of
                        Prophecy.</p></div2><div2 type="national-news" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Aristocracy of the hod" TEIform="index"/>ARIST CRACY OF THE HOD</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">This is the best country in the world for men who earn their living by manual

                                    advertisement, from men of 20 to 30 years of age, all of whom wrote fair hands, some
                                    excellent; all were acquainted with the routine business of a law office; some were
                                    attorneys already admitted to practice, graduates of colleges and universities, and
                                    in several instances the applicants were also accomplished stenographers. These men
                                    asked salaries of from eight to fifteen dollars a week, less than the strikers in

                                    throughout the country, wherever there are young men hesitating whether they will
                                    trust to their hands or their brains for a living, that at this hour, in New York,

                                    labor will therefore bring only what employers find it profitable to give. It is an

                            them. The Statutes and Ordinances of Moses were given, because of the hardness of men's
                            hearts, being a compromise, between the primary Eternal Law of Eight, and the existing
                            habits of the People called Jews — descendants of Abraham. If it be asked, How could God
                            thus condescend to humanity ? — the answer is. Their God was a Tutelar Deity — was God, to
                            them, as Moses was God to Pharaoh. He, it was, who gave the people their request, which sent

                            they should not forever live. " Behold the day cometh that I will make a new covenant with
                            the house of Israel, saith the Lord. Not according to the covenant I made with them when I
                            brought them out of the land of Egypt." There was a discrepancy between the primary law, and
                            the law in use. It was the penal law that Jesus was the end of — not the original,
                            everlasting Law of God, which is forever operative in the elements of which all human beings
                            are composed. Of this Law, Jesus said, " Think not that I am come to destroy the Law, but to
                            fulfill it — for I say unto you, that Heaven and Earth shall pass away, before one jot or

                            about thirty seances. William went into a new cabinet, placed on the other side of the
                            platform, and on the opposite side of the chimney from the old one. His manifestations were
                            just as good. Saw ten different spirits come out the first night from the new cabinet, one
                            about three feet high and one six feet four inches ; all had different costumes on. This
                            settles the question as to confederates. One night he gave me permission to examine his
                            person before he left the platform, which I did thoroughly, even to boots, socks, shirt,
                            wallet and tobacco pouch. That settles the question of his personating these parties by
                            means of masks and wardrobes. Mrs. Huntoon, a sister of the Eddys, is the best test medium I
                            ever saw. I attended ten of her seances. She shows two and three different spirit forms
                            while she is sitting where the spectators can see her. Your own personal friends, whom you
                            recognize, come to you through her. I shook hands with four spirits in one night. I saw six
                            spirits of my friends in one evening. My own brother showed himself to me, I think fifty
                            times, while I was there, and several times in full form. One night he came out and turned
                            himself around twice for me to view him. The spirits will tune a violin and play tunes at
                            your request, sing songs in chorus of three or four voices, and will talk in audible voices,
                            while the medium is in plain sight of the audience. If she had a cabinet arranged, she could
                            show forty or fifty or more at once, she thinks. We saw as many as four at a time. It is
                            simply momentary, what is seen at this medium's seances. I believe we shall soon get such
                            control of these spirits, that they will do any thing we want them to do. This medium is the
                            one who performed most of the remarkable tests described in Olcott's book as occurring
                            through the brothers ; yet Olcott did not mention her name in the book. Her brothers, they
                            say, are jealous of her, and prevent people from going to her seances. If that is so, they
                            will find they are making a grand mistake, for the public will soon leave them and go to
                            her. There is a good time coming. It won't be long. For spirit voices are sounding here ;
                            Prepare to greet them, the millenium is near.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Miller, E. P." TEIform="persName"/>E. P. Miller, Bath Hotel, 39 and 41 W. 26th st., New

                            acceptance and receiving tickets of admission. Not all came, but it was really a treat to
                            meet with those who did assemble from such divergent points and immense distances. To not a
                            few of them it was a heavy tax upon their resources. Nearly all the States were represented.
                            Upon assembling at the Hall, it was soon apparent that persons inimical to the objects of
                            the Convention — human rights — were in our midst. They were agents of Political Parties who
                            had signed no acceptance nor received tickets of admission. They had crept in unawares, bent
                            upon mischief. In the evening a meeting was called at another place from which interlopers
                            were excluded. There were both male and female members in the Conference. We had a
                            satisfactory time. The primary ideas that I think will be embodied in a reorganized Civil
                            Government, were stated, discussed and accepted as planks in the New Platform. Who are
                            Citizens ? was the first point settled. Are they all men—all women — or are they all Human
                            beings ? Having ascertained who are Citizens, the next question was, What inherent rights do
                            they possess that should be inalienable? Air, Water, Land — All things needful to human
                            existence, and to render that existence a blessing, was the conclusion arrived at. These are
                            not property, and should not be bought and sold forever. What is property in the New Earth?
                            came next in order. Property is the result of labor upon the natu ral elements. It is
                            transferable from citizen to citizen forever. Agreement was reached that no Laws for the
                            collection of debts should be enacted. All debts should be debts of honor, these being
                            uniformly most collectible. Public debts will be voted public wrongs, to be duly repudiated,
                            inasmuch as no existing generation has a right to enslave its successors by mortgaging their
                            patrimony and resources. Let Private and Public pay as they go and owe no man any thing but
                            Love and good will. This will be a means of rendering War impracticable, averting its waste,
                            expense and demoralization. Thus would Slavery and Poverty soon become things of the past.
                            Hygienic and physiologic reforms would correct the errors of generation, in the New Earth,
                            and banish from the New Heavens sickness and disease, therein there should be no more pain.
                            The second day of the external Convention was spent by those who took part in it, contending
                            with the politicians who had come to capture them. Again, in the evening, we held another
                            meeting of the Conference proper. It was a full meeting; highly interesting; addressed by
                            different speakers — the writer occupying over an hour. There was a noble band of earnest
                            souls in harmony and agreement with the views, ideas and principles presented. The
                            conference lasted until near midnight, and the members parted with mutual gratulations. Seed
                            was sown that will be fruitful in the future.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Man can have a proprietary right..." TEIform="index"/>Man can have a proprietary right...

                            doctoring. Learned philanthropists are now consenting that health reform is the basis of all
                            other reforms. We must insist that physicians should begin to preserve health rather than
                            drug to restore it. It is strange that so many have an idea that they can do the latter, but
                            not the former. They can make one well, but cannot keep one so, reversing the common sense
                            maxim that " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Strange, that the skill which
                            puts the body in order might not prevent the disorder. Is it not easier to keep the road,
                            than to find it after losing it? Is it wise to let our children contract vices, that we may
                            use our skill to return them to their lost virtues ? Is it not easier to keep ten men sober
                            than to reform one drunkard ? So must it be as to health. Far easier and far safer for
                            doctors to study, to practice, to teach hygiene— to have all their patrons live in
                            accordance with the laws of health — than to dose them into health when sick ? Why not do as
                            one of the kings of China — give the physician a certain sum for every day the family were
                            kept in good health, but nothing for the days this inestimable blessing was lost ? Under
                            such an engagement the physician should have control of the diet and other sanitary
                            regulations, which would be far easier, happier and less expensive than his too often vain
                            effort to kill disease with poisonous drugs. Besides, let it be well understood and never
                            forgotten, that disease is the remedial effort of nature to right a wrong; the noble defense
                            against a vile attack; the courageous, loyal rally to dislodge a dangerous foe. For
                            instance, put snuff in the nose, which will be the foe, and the sneeze which follows to
                            expel it is the disease ; put the same weed in the mouth, and the saliva flows to wash it
                            out, and, if held in the mouth for the first time, nausea and vomiting are reinforcements to
                            expel the enemy. Swallow indigestible food upon a weak stomach, and the disease of throwing
                            it back comes as a relief. These instances, be assured, soundly illustrate the friendly
                            action of our system against our injuries. The cause of the disease is a foe to be removed —
                            the disease itself, a friend, never to be fought, but always favored. Happily, however, with
                            ordinary caution, a man becomes his own physician. He has but to keep a careful watch over
                            his desires, and restrain the promptings of passions always struggling to be free from the
                            fetters imposed by common sense; to keep the system in a healthy condition, and conform to
                            the hygienic laws which mark the boundaries of health and disease, and he has a certain
                            immunity from pain and suffering.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sea of glass" TEIform="index"/>SEA OF GLASS</head><p TEIform="p">To stand upon a sea of glass, is to become a new creature, dwelling in light. The natural man
                            and woman are one thing in another, having an outside and an inside. The heart, of such, is
                            deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Why? Because their inmost thought,
                            imagination and feeling — their own selfhood — are distinct from their outward, whether by
                            looks, dress, walk, or speech. " The poison of asps is under their tongues. With their lips
                            they use deceit." They are not what they seem to be — claim to be.— Life, with them, is a
                            falsehood. It begins with the boy and girl. The sphere of childhood has its under current of
                            craft and finesse — its secrets. Anon, as young men and women, they have a little world of
                            their own ; from which the old folks — parents, guardians, seniors, —are carefully excluded.
                            Knowledge — useful information — which might have been imparted, at the proper season, was
                            withheld. That dependance, of the younger, upon the elder, and the confidence created, by a
                            gradual impartation of practical truth, are not sustained. The love, of the boy, for mother,
                            of the girl, for the father, is, in nature, transferred to wife and husband. It should be
                            normal. Then, when called to forsake all natural relations, for " Christ's sake and the
                            Gospel," the transfer of affections would be possible, the yoke easy and the burden

                            things, to " thin-whiten " the walls of one of his chambers. This thin whitening is almost
                            colorless until dried. The gentleman was much surprised, on the morning after the chamber
                            was finished, to find on the drawer of his bureau, standing in the room, White finger-marks.
                            Opening the drawer, he found the same on the articles in it, and also on a pocket-book. An
                            examination revealed the same marks on the contents of a bag. This proved clearly that the
                            mason, with his wet hands, had opened the drawer, and searched the bag, which contained no
                            money, and had then closed the drawer without once thinking that ever anyone would know it.
                            The "thin-whitening" which happened to be on his hands did not show at first, and he
                            probably had no idea that twelve hours' drying would reveal his wickedness. Children, beware
                            of evil thoughts and deeds. They leave their finger-marks, which will one day be revealed.
                            If you disobey your parents, or tell a falsehood, or take what is not your own, you make sad
                            stains on your character. And so it is with all sin. It defiles the soul. It betrays those
                            who engage in it, by the marks it makes on them. These marks may be almost, if not quite,
                            invisible at first. But, even if they should not be seen during any of our days on earth
                            (which is not at all likely), yet there is a day coming in which every sin will be made

                                    stomach, gastric juice is secreted to digest it, and that no more gastric juice is
                                    secreted than is required for the digestion of the proper quantity of food. If a
                                    person eats twice or thrice a day, at regular periods, the gastric juice is secreted
                                    by the stomach to digest the food it has received. If, while the food is being
                                    digested, more food is introduced into the stomach, digestion, in relation to the
                                    food already in the stomach, is arrested. For instance : a person takes, in the
                                    morning, a piece of bread and several potatoes ; now, it will take about three hours
                                    for the stomach to dispose of that food. Suppose the person, about an hour after
                                    eating this food, takes a piece of bread and an apple or two ; what would happen ?
                                    The digestion that was going on in the stomach would immediately stop, and not be
                                    resumed until the food that was received last was brought into the condition of the
                                    first. Suppose he took food every hour, what would be the consequence ? The stomach
                                    would become prematurely worn out, and could do nothing perfectly — working all the
                                    time without rest. But if the person possessed a good constitution and a large
                                    amount of vital power, he would not feel, at first, this drain upon his system, but
                                    sooner or later he would have to pay the penalty of outraged nature. Some persons
                                    have an enormous amount of vitality—good constitutions. It is said of these persons
                                    nothing hurts them ; they can eat and drink any thing with impunity. This is a fatal
                                    mistake.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Science of health" TEIform="index"/>Science of Health</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="national-news" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The grasshopper plague in the West has directed attention to..."

                        </head><p TEIform="p">The grasshopper plague in the West has directed attention to the terrible waste and
                            destruction of game that used to be so abundant in the country now afflicted with insects.
                            Formerly, when grouse, quail and other insectivorous game birds were abundant on the
                            prairies, people never heard of grasshopper plagues. They have only been known since the
                            people of the West have indulged in wanton destruction of the birds, so that they might make
                            money by selling their carcases to the eastern markets. To such a degree has this business
                            been carried on that-of late years dealers have been offered high prices for squab-grouse,
                            as a dainty, and the young birds have thus been slain before they had done their part in
                            replenishing the earth. Once the prairies used to be covered with luxuriant vegetation, in
                            which were myriads of grouse ; and nobody ever heard then of grasshoppers eating up the
                            prairie grass. The birds had the advantage over them, and ate them up before they got time
                            to lay waste an acre. The birds have now been destroyed or driven away to remote and
                            unoccupied territory, where, of course, they will again be pursued by the gunners, unless
                            the western legislators pass laws by which the destruction of the birds may be prevented and
                            their increase be promoted. The grasshopper is just as dainty to the grouse and the quail as
                            is the measuring worm to the English sparrow, and the way to abolish the annual plague of
                            the grasshopper is to prevent the destruction of all such birds by legally punishing their
                            destroyers.</p></div2><div2 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Time devoted to meals" TEIform="index"/>TIME DEVOTED TO MEALS</head><p TEIform="p">Dr. Derby states that the average time occupied in the process of taking food by the people
                            of Massachusetts dees not exceed from twelve to fifteen minutes for each meal. Such haste is
                            injurious to health for many reasons. The process of digestion begins in the mouth with the
                            action of the teeth, and through excitement of the salivary glands by the presence of food.
                            Unless saliva is abundantly mingled with the latter, the first act of digestion is
                            obstructed and nature's plan is changed. The fluid not only lubricates, but acts chemically
                            in the mouth, if a reasonable time is given it, upon all the starchy elements which make up
                            the great bulk of what we eat. Eating in haste a great deal of air is swallowed. Air is to a
                            a certain extent always entangled in the saliva and assists digestion, but when "wads" of
                            food succeed each other very rapidly, they act like pistons in the tube leading from the
                            back of the throat, and drive before and between them into the stomach such amounts of air
                            as to distend that organ and impede its functions. Another evil of eating in this way is
                            that the masses of food, imperfectly mixed with saliva, become impacted in the Eesophagus,
                            checking its muscular action, which is obviously intended to propel one piece at a time. The
                            embarrassment is overcome by taking at one gulp as much fluid as the mouth can hold, thus
                            distending the elastic tube and washing the obstructed food into the stomach. All this is
                            unnatural, and can hardly fail to work mischief.</p></div2><div2 type="shaker-press" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shakers" TEIform="index"/>SHAKERS</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">The Shakers' church was overcrowded Sunday, when Elder Lomas delivered one of his

                                weak, And that you all may not distinctly hear ; However, I will try to make them clear.
                                I once in vision sought this hallowed land, And here I found a happy sister band ; They
                                held communion, serious, glad and free, But every sentence was in poetry. I really think
                                they felt just like the Spring, When she has hid beneath her dewy wing A wondrous gift
                                of perfume, buds and flowers, Which she assumes to scatter wide in showers. Their names
                                are — Martha:—but I wont recall, If we find her I know we'll find them all; They gather
                                round her like a flock of doves ; And she in turn each one with fervor loves. They are
                                the daughters of a noble race ; Perhaps their record you would like to trace; But here
                                they are, the mystic number seven : — Come, sisters, come and speak of earth and heaven.
                                Martha : The subject in its vastness truly awes, And yet its contemplation gives
                                delight, We see the workings of Progression's laws, And hear the voice that said " Let
                                there be light." The fine and subtile laws of Alchemy A secret power of transmutation
                                hold, Touch with refining sensibility, And bring to light each hidden grain of gold.
                                Thus, from earth's basis to ethereal spheres, In pure atomic substance wisely planned,
                                More sublimated each degree appears, That forms successive kingdoms, high and grand.
                                Life's occult forces work with magic skill, To build anew, 'till earth and heaven shall
                                blend, Eternal laws of progress to fulfill, In chain of being that shall never end. Mark
                                the material forms that round us rise ! They reach their zenith, yield to blight and
                                death; But spirit hath a growth that never dies! 'Tis life of all that lives, and
                                ceaseless breath ; 'Tis spiritual force that guides the suns And worlds that fill
                                immensity of space ! Electric fluid through each atom runs, That evolution gives a form
                                and place. Man — crowning point of the created whole — The impress of his Maker's image
                                wears ; This microcoism — body, spirit, soul — Resemblance to creation fully bears, Each
                                special phase of being, here combined. The soul and sentiment of every thing, Is
                                germinal — within the immortal mind — That yet shall blossom in eternal spring. By
                                wisdom placed within this rudirnental sphere, To give his noble powers unfoldment free,
                                His childhood state brings teachers, year by year, Who spread for him the chart of
                                destiny; He reads and thinks, he learns and understands, Aspires still further with a
                                yearning hope, And lo ! his God-like soul expands, And ever fruitful fields before him
                                ope. 'Tis life progressive, ever on and on, A glorious resurrection day by day ; 'Tis
                                step by step, and starry summits won, That mark our ever upward, onward way. Melissa:
                                Ann has a thought — I read it in her eyes, For when I smile she looks so grave and wise
                                — So, I insist, that she shall spread it out, And let us know just what it is about.
                                Ann: My thoughts have turned with sympathy To Mother and her band ; I see them in their
                                humble home In old Oppression's land. They had to keep a light within, Though all around
                                was dark, To war with each Egyptian sin, To build and bear the Ark. They had their own
                                strong human hearts To conquer and subdue, They had to find the way of life And prove
                                the Gospel true. Although their numbers were but few, Their faith in God was strong,
                                That He could carry on his work And lead their souls along. Though in a land where
                                church and state Had ever been combined. Nor freedom to the liberalists As yet had been
                                assigned, Still, on the God of truth they felt Their hearts could trusting lean ; This
                                gave them courage to endure Each dark and adverse scene. Melissa : Yea, they were
                                faithful to the power That will redemption work, They had no dread of clouds that lower,
                                Or foes that hidden lurk. 'Tis thus, dispelling doubts and fears Progression finds her
                                way, And pauses not mid wreck of years To count her glorious sway. But on, still on, new
                                pathways ope Through meads and trackless wilds, Her magic touch inspires new hope, The
                                earth with blessing smiles. She waves her sceptre — Science yields To the electric flow
                                ; Knowledge o'erspreads the nations' fields, And they its glory know. Old superstitions
                                fade away, Like wreaths of mist at eve, No more need dark'ning sophistry The human mind
                                deceive. Like clouds of death before the sun, Fell ignorance takes her flight. For
                                education's beams have won Their way through error's night. In vain has persecution
                                sought To chain, with iron hand, The power that has so dearly bought The claims of
                                freedom's land. It presses through the tide of thought, And stems the current wrong;
                                Untold achievements it has wrought Where tyranny was strong. Elvah: In speaking of
                                progression up through the ages past, Can we not some reflection upon home record cast?
                                The trees, the rocks, the houses and all have passed through change, And in their latest
                                beauty most happily we range. Margaret : Broad the field of thought and action, We must
                                labor there to find Buried stores of useful knowledge, That would elevate the mind. O, I
                                feel my soul is lifted By the work that is for me, From the trivial and the selfish [
                                would set my spirit free. If life's labors seem defeated — No success their efforts
                                crown — Was it not the same with ancients ? Bear they not this story down ? Rising,
                                falling — falling, rising — Marks the journey here below; But the end will be
                                triumphant, And the vict'ry we will know. Charlotte : Stern repetition's stamped on
                                history's page, Truth hidden but to brighter, brighter glow; Each generation finds anew
                                the thorny age, And learns that life, in its mysterious flow, Gives strength unto the
                                lowly and the sage. The scorn of world that hath but little charity, The desolations of
                                the soul's retreat, The voice that cries, From sin I am not free, And hearts that
                                tyranny of home must meet — Foreshadow dimly of eternal liberty. But, still expanding,
                                there is joy and hope, And knowledge often doth unfold lur leaves, While science and
                                religion ever to us ope The higher lesson that each one receives, E'er left in error's
                                wilds to lonely grope. Thus, on and on, as poets oft have told, Progression has a place
                                in every age; Her glories in the past and present hold Their rightful claims upon time's
                                busy Stage, With strength unwavering that cannot grow old. And, from experience past,
                                our spirits learn That self-denial is the only guide, And they, who fraily from this
                                safeguard turn, Are like the wanderers with no place to hide, No welcome port where
                                friendly beacons burn; For faith, that 'mid the tide and storm is strong, Is like the
                                life-boat on the ocean cast That buoys and bears the traveller along, Unto a home that
                                evermore will last, Where swells the chorus of the victor's song. Catharine : Over
                                history's leaves we have backward glanced, And learned of primitive time, Hommaterial
                                things through growth advanced, Till touched by the soul divine. How the pulse of

                                elements, A home and a sphere for man We see how truth hath onward marched Through the
                                elemental wars, 'Neath the dark sky of oppression arched, And through dungeons' heavy
                                bars; How the prophets' hearts have been inspired To teach the higher law, And how their
                                raptured souls were fired With the glory they foresaw. We see the witnesses of God All
                                linked in a golden chain, We know the victor's path they trod Was paved through immortal
                                gain. We know that the unseen arm of might Still bringeth the victory, And bears the
                                promise, "There shall be light," Till the earth is glad and free. Margaret : 'Tis
                                cheering to watch the waves of truth As they onward, onward roll, And feel that ever
                                their strength will bring A victory unto the soul. We know that the ocean is broad and
                                deep, And many are sailing thereon, Yet who of the many their course will keep, Till the
                                journey of life is done? The changes and changes we undergo Have hidden, within their
                                life, A glory and beauty not always known, A power that caimeth the strife. Through
                                trial and blessing, through sorrow and pain, We learn of progression here, The greater
                                the conquest, the nobler the gain, And brighter our efforts appear. Yet still doth the
                                cry from the suffering arise; O, when will the struggle be o'er? For earth will be
                                wrecked in the vapors of death, Till her people shall sin no more. Lo, voices come
                                floating from regions away, Not always is sorrow with time, For forces are massing the
                                earth to redeem By the light of the spiritual clime. Martha: This glorious light has
                                dimly shone Through depths of human wrong, And souls have toiled through faith alone To
                                bear the right along. Through hope and fear, like struggling breath, Good seeds have
                                pressed their way, And life has triumphed over death. When forms have passed away. And
                                souls progressed in every clime War for truth have waged, While prophecy of future time
                                Gave light from age to age, Which showed that human hearts would rise Above base
                                passion's sway, And lust of power fall sacrifice To the advancing day. A day when new
                                and living thoughts From mind to mind would flow, While noble deeds, through them
                                outwrought, Would aid life's toils below. And on the annals of the past We see this
                                truth impressed. That nothing can defeat the law By which the race is blest. Meltssa :
                                While to the natural world of mind Progression's truths unfold, The ideal with the real
                                combined Her regal forces hold. How is it with the human heart, Makes she an impress
                                there? Does she those hopes and joys impart Which come through faith and prayer ? For
                                fiery streams of lust have swept The earth with dead'ning blast, While germs of good are
                                latent kept By dregs of sin o'ercast, And life a mockery is made To shade discord and
                                woe, To hide the heavy curse that's laid Upon the earth below. And must this be ? Is
                                there no gift To reach the soul of man? Will nothing from him ever lift This dark
                                corroding ban ? Yea, free the world of lust and hate, Those ruling demon twins, And, in
                                each home and heart, create The love that virtue wins. We need reform in social life .
                                To stay the plague of sin, A deep, a thorough, holy strife From living faith within;
                                Till, in the place of crime and vice, The love of God shall reign; Then earth will bloom
                                a paradise, Redeemed from blight and pain. Cecelia : Melissa, you would have Reform, Not
                                tumults by that name, Not errors broken by the storm, Reversed, but still the same.
                                Margaret: O, who can solve the problem Of life so grand and strange, Or who can see the
                                power That guides the law of change? Our life flows out and then returns Unto the
                                fountain's source, And still the question is, O, where Lies hid its motor force,? Ann:
                                That is the question of the Past, His shriveled lips repeat it o'er, 'Tis heard upon the
                                flying blast, And in the waves that beat the shore ; The Present asks it in her pride,
                                And cannot brook the least delay, Yet its solution doth abide Within the Future's
                                perfect day; For as we gain the power of good, The power of God our minds can trace; And
                                mystery no more shall brood, When sin is conquered by the race. Cecelia: Now,
                                Elvah,'does that meet your mind? In metaphysics does there lie A better system than you
                                find In that concise reply? <pb n="86" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 86 SHAKEE Elvah: Nay, there does not.
                                But when We think the spirit-land a mystery, And ponder o'er the problem unexplained,
                                So, might we view the nightly stellar sky, Or deem the humblest soil on which we tread,
                                For all is strange! We oft repeat the hope, We all shall comprehend these hidden things,
                                When, like the rising perfume of the flowers, Our souls ascend to blend with spirits
                                there, In that grand world, the theme for which we live; And, grander thought, the goal
                                of progress here. To think is but the imagery of life; To Know, the living motor of the
                                heart; But gather e'en the knowledge of the great, And we are humbler than the smallest
                                thing. Catharine: God is Spirit; E'en the granite rocks declare that He is life. On each
                                feature of His glorious Universe Indelibly is stamped the great eternal law. Which works
                                redemptive change to every atom. 'Tis action, The unseen force that harmoniously
                                controls The grand revealments of existence, That, with nature's funeral anthems of
                                decay, Blends gladsome songs of new-born forms of life; And, in one vast extended chain,
                                Links evolving strata of this mundane sphere With sublimated particles; And these, with
                                finer, more interior realities, Converge toward the soul of all created power, The
                                center of intelligence. Martha: God's Universe teems with harmonious action, In grandeur
                                and beauty effectively swayed, Through order and law without mar or infraction, Have
                                forces creative their wonders displayed. My being is thrilled with a cadence of motion
                                As life in its majesty marches along, The music of heaven, of earth, and of ocean.
                                Inspires my heart with a fullness of song. Cecelia : Then sing to us, sing to us that
                                inspiration, Give us the melody, full, rich and clear ! Bound are our hearts to the work
                                of salvation, To us its music is precious and dear.</p></div3><div3 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="All hail! to the spirit of beauty..." TEIform="index"/>All hail! to the spirit of beauty...

                                command, Or made by the scorn of the stolid to stand Bereft of its noble possession ?
                                The creeds and the dogmas that death contain Would still in their canting bondage
                                remain, While the altars of old, where the faithful were slain, Would sink 'neath their
                                weight of oppression. The pathway of virtue by martyrs once trod — The hearts in the
                                conquest of self unto God — The truths that for victory our feet have well shod, Would
                                still be unknown and unsought. The visions of hope from futurity's clime — The song and
                                the anthem pure and sublime — The fiowings of mind In a musical chime Could not with our

                                religion the same bitter part, While the toil of the student could never impart The
                                weight of his realized aims. The glory of man, through the culture of thought, Would
                                back to the past and its errors be brought, While the growth of to-day, with sorrow
                                outwrought, Would yield to the priesthood its claims. Let the sons of the finances open
                                their eyes, And the daughters of pride from their vanity rise, E'er the nation to error
                                and ignorance hies, And earth of her freedom's bereft. For over the nation is brooding a
                                power — Of priestly convention — a black plotting power That would rob from Columbia her
                                God-given dower. Thus from Him the nation be cleft. Ann: Oppression's rule in church and
                                state Must bow to nobler claims, Stern Bigotry and cruel Hate Be as forgotten names. In
                                civil and in social life Shall justice yet be done, For man will aid the lawful strife
                                That woman has begun. Her power for good shall find a place Where legislatures meet, And
                                strength, with purity and grace, With wisdom be replete. Then monstrous frauds and
                                crushing wrong From courts of law shall flee, And earth and heaven will sing the song Of
                                priceless liberty. But it is ours here to begin This mighty toil at home, That to the
                                standard against sin True noble hearts may come. For us are good foundations laid, For
                                us the streams are cleared, By efforts which our Parents made The work of God is reared.
                                Elvah: Those dear old saints could tell us, who've reached the shining shore, How, early
                                consecrated, they plied the pilot's oar. Their hairs were white with honor, their aged
                                forms were blest By rising generations e'er they had turned to rest. I heard our blessed
                                father, good Elder Richard, tell Of days when cross and hardship most thickly round him
                                fell. I think 'twould swell a volume could some historian pen The pages of his
                                earth-life with pictures now and then. And some, here present with us, have oft
                                conversed with those Who suffered with our Mother, who has long enjoyed repose. They
                                hold full many incidents of penury and pain, Related by these first-born, whose impress
                                will re main Long after we have passed away and their acquaintance made, Long after
                                death has borne us where the wicked ne'er invade. And now it but remains for us to toil
                                with just such zeal, To add unto their honest wealth and live for others' weal. We can
                                but bless their labors here, for we can never know The many inconveniences they had to
                                undergo. Margaret: Our home is graced with beauty, rare, • With trees, and plants, and

                                daily action, Whence wealth of blessings flow. It is not sordid greed or gain That makes

Advanced minds — pioneers
                            in the work of progression,— have been sent forth in all the ages past, whose thoughts were
                            lifted above the narrow limits of self-pleasing; whose perceptions were quickened, and
                            intensified by inspiration; and they have electrified and aroused the dormant energies of
                            the slumberer, given vivacity to the timid, and new strength and courage to the progressive
                            and aspiring. All persons exert an influence of some kind in society, varying in character
                            and degree. What that is or shall be, depends upon the moral status and spiritual
                            development of individuals. The legitimate use of the elements of nature, either of mind or
                            matter, tends to harmonious action, and results in good; but if perverted, great blessings
                            become great evils, in proportion to their misuse. For example, steam ptnoer, great as is
                            its utility in civilized life when properly directed, if uncontrolled by intelligence and a
                            knowledge of its nature, is a destructive power. So with human intelligence, if not governed
                            by moral principles, it is a fearful power in society. We are all affected, more or less, by
                            external surroundings, and equally so are we acted upon by the mind and spirit of those with
                            whom we associate. One person, with discordant feelings and an antagonistic spirit, might
                            engender strife and contention without uttering a word, while a calm, well-balanced,
                            harmonious mind, though silent, would cast a tranquil influence, and the still, soft whisper
                            could be heard — "Peace, be.still." What sensitive mind has not imbibed the unspoken
                            thoughts of others, and been impressed by those with whom their spirits were in unison, even
                            when they were hundreds of miles distant ? It is difficult to estimate how great in extent
                            may be the effect of a word spoken or a thought unexpressed, for thought precedes action,
                            and the whole character is formed of individual action. Therefore, we are not only
                            responsible for words which we utter, and deeds that we perform, but also for the cherished
                            secret thoughts — the in most breathings of our souls — from which are exhalations either
                            pure or impure. It is said that the air is malarious where the upas grows. Webster says it
                            is a fabulous report, that the atmosphere surrounding the upas is deleterious. However that
                            may be, we would prefer the aroma of the rose and lily, emblems of love and purity, whose
                            secretions are not poisonous like the upas. If we seek the companionship of the wise and
                            pure, and strive to the best of our ability to help create healthful conditions, by watching
                            and prayer, and repel every evil influence, and place ourselves as humble recipients of all
                            that is good and true — live to our highest conviction of right, without fear or favor —
                            then we shall be as trees of righteousness in the garden of the Lord. The following is a
                            good illustration, given by one of our spirit guides: " As blades of grass before a strong
                            wind all bend in one direction, the weak in spirit bow before the force of public opinion,
                            while they who are properly developed, and by use have strengthened the innate powers of
                            their souls, are the marble pillars which stand erect, firm and unmoved when the wind and
                            storm beat upon them; having a solid basis to rest upon, they tower toward heaven. Whether
                            large or small, plain or ornamented, they are the same in quality — possess the same
                            properties — and in the sunlight of truth show forth the same glittering beauty. " In every
                            department of life the strong should bear the infirmities of the weak, and not ' break the
                            bruised reed.' Those who possess a high degree of vitality, and are capable of imparting
                            strength to those who are weaker than themselves, they should give freely, and look to the
                            angel world to have their strength renewed, till all their aspirations tending Godward may
                            culminate in a perfect life." I would not ask that the diversity of human character be
                            abolished, but that all that is worthy should be improved, adjusted, reduced to order, and
                            be brought into proper action and harmonious relation. Our earthly home should be like a
                            primary school, to prepare our minds for higher spheres — a heavenly home. Our prayer is,
                            Let thy will, 0 God, be done in thy kingdom which has come! If we labor to this end He will
                            bless our efforts, and answer our prayers.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Broadway, Emeline" TEIform="persName"/>Emeline Broadway, IT.

                            belief in Bible history, may cavil and cry " fraud and delusion," when modern spiritual
                            manifestations are presented to them for belief or even scientific investigation. But when
                            we meet persons who say they believe the Bible records of great signs and wonders, wrought
                            through Moses, as medium, and the so-called miracles of Jesus and the Apostles,
                            unquestioned, because the Bible says thus and so ; and when the same or similar phenomena
                            occur in our own time, to find them among the first to denounce and to demand a full
                            explanation why there should be a suspension of natural law to bring about such results, we
                            think that " consistency," when found, " is a jewel " of priceless worth. We rejoice to know
                            that some scientists have set themselves to work fearlessly to investigate the subject of
                            materialization; and regardless of sectarian prejudice or contumely that may be poured upon
                            them, to give to the world a candid report of the conclusions reached by searching inquiry.
                            We are a mystery unto ourselves. The atmosphere in which we live and move, while its weight
                            and mechanical forces can be accurately estimated, is entirely imperceptible to our visual
                            organs. We are forced to acknowledge the fact, that the mineral, vegetable and animal
                            kingdoms increase and expand; because we do not see them grow, does not warrant the
                            assertion that occult forces are not at work to accelerate growth, and perfect each
                            according to its kind. That the world of matter is only an outward expression of the world
                            of mind, we have no just cause to doubt. We call it the invisible world, because it is
                            imperceptible to the external senses ; but when perceived by the interior, spiritual senses,
                            the spirit world is the real world; the material part is the shell — the incrustation —
                            while the spiritual part is the soul and substance of all things. The long-cherished idea
                            that the spirit world was located far beyond the starry regions, and that they who traveled
                            thence could never more return to earth, is now superseded by demonstrated facts, coming to
                            us by tens of thousands of living witnesses. The spirit world is all around us. We are
                            surrounded by an ocean of intelligences. This is evidenced in various ways — by rapping,
                            moving ponderable matter, and by materialized forms appearing to many persons at the same
                            moment; speaking audibly, and at times speaking with prophetic power concerning the great
                            work to be accomplished through spirit agency in the not distant future— convincing many
                            skeptical and infidel minds of the immortality of human souls — causing mysterious orthodox
                            ideas of heaven and hell, together with the physical resurrection, to give place to reason
                            and the sense of justice and mercy conjoined ; for God, who is infinitely good and wise,
                            will never arbitrarily punish any soul because he possesses the power to do it. But He has
                            fixed laws for all, irrespective of nationality, caste or color, and they who violate those
                            laws mar their own being and make an impress which themselves must remove by compliance with
                            and yielding fealty to those God-given laws. Spirits from interior worlds are doing a great
                            work ! Have not those who have been baptized with power from the resurrection heavens a
                            great duty resting upon them, to cooperate and work with those spirits, in helping to pull
                            down the walls of Babylon, built up of churchal creeds and dogmas, and cemented together by
                            priestcraft, until not one stone is left standing upon another — until people of all nations
                            and languages are convinced that the power that is striving to bear rule is ordained of God
                            ? There are many Spirits of various grades at the present time, good, bad and undeveloped,
                            who run with tidings without authority, and who, by so doing, create confusion, and are in
                            reality lying prophets But they who try the spirits and place themselves under the care and
                            tuition of good angel guides, are nursed with their love and feel their sweet influences
                            distilling upon them as the soft dews of the morning. Such are inspired to believe it is
                            quite as possible to create heavenly spheres and circles here and to draw the bright and
                            beautiful to us, while in mortal form, as for spirits in other spheres — the same in kind if

                            applied to persons and things, than Love. Abstractly, and scripturally speaking, " God is
                            Love " ; and whatever emanates from, and leads to God, is Love. As there is a natural, and a
                            spiritual world, so there are natural affections and loves pertaining to the material and
                            natural, and also superior loves and affections, which belong to and are placed upon, the
                            spiritual and heavenly. Leaving the perverted, impulsive and passional, that often pass
                            under the false guise of love, we allow there are two distinct definitions of the word Love
                            — Natural and Spiritual. The natural, which is first, if not distorted by wrong uses, is
                            good in its place— a product of the great First Cause. The Spiritual, refined from earth's
                            alloy — the highest and purest — is the only love that is imperishable; it is an eternal
                            principle that can never fail. A human soul, devoid of love, is the most miserable, and the
                            most unenviable of all known objects. We were created to love, and the heart is cold and
                            sterile without it; we cannot be happy without the disposition and opportunity to impart and
                            receive love — it is a priceless boon. It has been said, that " Religion is the cement of
                            society ;" and we say " There can be no true religion without love." A community cannot long
                            exist, unless based upon the principle of love to God, and to humanity. All <pb n="88" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 88 8HAKEE SHA.KEREBS. the emanations of God's Spirit are unalloyed Love. No
                            mortal being hath ever yet fathomed the depth of unselfish love, or tested its power; but,
                            so far as our capacity extends, we have been made happy by contributing, and being the
                            recipients of love. If a companion onthe journey of life becomes careworn and weary, and
                            falls by the wayside, or strays from the path of duty, what is so potent to win him or her
                            back to rectitude, and inspire with courage, confidence and hope, as a ministration of true
                            Christian love ? Should the chastening rod fall upon the wayward, and their sinful actions
                            meet with reproof, charity and mercy will mark the whole. Would it not be well for all who
                            profess the Christian name, to consider how much we are actuated and controlled by the
                            spirit of love in our intercourse with others ? Are we willing to lift up the lowly, and
                            hold in our embrace the weak and erring, and help them to become strong in the true and good
                            ? Are we untiring in our efforts, to reach and warm the hearts of inexperienced youth by the
                            power of love, and thus give them an assurance of enduring friendship ? It is Christ-like to
                            bind up the brokenhearted—comfort the mourner—to give bread to the hungry, and drink to the
                            thirsty. That is practical love. And Jesus said, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least
                            of these, ye have done it unto me."</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Cummings, Mary Ann" TEIform="persName"/>Mary Ann Cummings, Enfield, N.

                            important; but might not be interesting, or of much moment, to others. I would not wish to
                            obtrude my individual experience upon the public; but have often felt, that could my friends
                            in the outside Order, who knew some of my struggles in life to satisfy the demands of my
                            conscience, and obtain peace of mind, also know that I have found a haven of rest, where the
                            turbid waters caused by a sinful life, have in a large measure ceased to roll, it would give
                            me great satisfaction. One of the Apostles of Jesus stated that " the fashion of this world
                            passeth away." The fashions of the world at the present time may be classed under different
                            heads; but they spring from one root. Pride of wealth, and caste, which finds expression in
                            fashionable dress, is one form. Marriage is the ruling fashion among all-classes, high and
                            low—a fashion that does not readily pass away, except by estrangement, or divorce, which
                            oftentimes occurs for the sake of taking on conditions still more obnoxious. Now, in the
                            nineteenth century, church-going and religious profession have become popular and
                            fashionable ; but, practically, a nominal professor of religion has no more influence, as
                            salt in the earth, to preserve souls and save from the lusts of the flesh and mind, than a
                            Jew or Mahometan. I followed those fashions, and sought pleasure therein; but found
                            disappointment and remorse. In early life, I, like many others, had an affectionate mother,
                            who felt great anxiety for my spiritual welfare; and her intercessions in my behalf were
                            strong and fervent. At times, I caught glimpses of the higher Christian life and character,
                            and felt that Wisdom's ways must be peaceful and pleasant. Again, I felt that a worldly life
                            would be more congenial to my feelings. I turned to fashion, and sought happiness in the
                            marriage relation; but found I had sold myself into bondage, and my conscience accused me
                            before God, day and night. I united with the Congregational Church— was very strict to
                            attend meetings — and reached forth in vain to the professed ministers of the Gospel, for
                            the bread of life; I felt that my soul was famishing for the want of it. I heard of Miller,
                            who preached the Second Advent doctrine. I eagerly caught the idea and believed it possible.
                            New hope sprang up in my heart. I felt that the Spirit was calling me to a more spiritual
                            life, and, by the Second Advent of the Messiah, I hoped to attain it; and I strove sincerely
                            to prepare myself for the event. It is needless to say that I, with many others who sought
                            relief, was disappointed in my expectations. Some went to their farms, others to their
                            merchandise — divided in opinion — troubled in mind. I was deeply impressed that it was my
                            duty to come out from the world, and be separated from its sinful practices. Many beside
                            myself, truth-lovers and truth-seekers, at that time, became weary of wrestling against
                            spiritual principalities in the churches, and the power of evil in their own hearts, which
                            continuously strove for the mastery, and to bring them into servitude to sinful passions. As
                            there was no living testimony in the popular churches against the doleful works of darkness,
                            I resolved, with about sixty other persons, who were like-minded, to leave the church,
                            believing we could find more protecting power, and enjoy greater liberty of conscience, to
                            be disconnected from it. My spiritual vision was opened, and I saw that, like Jesus and his
                            Apostles, I must "forsake all for the kingdom of heaven's sake — take up the cross and
                            despise the shame." I felt remorse of conscience, and my spirit was wounded; but the giving
                            up of all for the Gospel — forsaking natural ties and relations, for the spiritual, seemed a
                            hard requirement, and I knew not how to find strength to do it. I looked upon my husband and
                            children, whom I loved tenderly, and felt a struggle. About that time I heard of the Shakers
                            ; I visited them, and found them a self-denying, spiritual minded people — able to minister
                            strength and comfort to my weary spirit; and I resolved to become like them. I had a large
                            circle of friends, who were unwilling to part with me; trial and persecution awaited me. I
                            realized my duty to my family, and desired to fulfill it. All I asked was permission to live
                            according to the dictates of my conscience, for I had resolved to live a pure, virgin life.
                            My husband made fair promises, but did not keep them. Finding that I could not enjoy freedom
                            in that capacity, I resolved to break every earthly band that bound me, and no longer be a
                            slave, morally speaking. I begged for my children to take with me to my new home and
                            friends, unto whom I had resolved to flee for protection from the usages of society at
                            large, which deprive a woman, in the marriage relation of the right to her own person. I
                            have never ceased to be grateful for my liberation from the bondage of that relation, and
                            that I have found a home, where the bread of life may be obtained, and spiritual waters flow
                            freely to all who seek. And I heartily join in the invitation of the Spirit, through the
                            Prophet Isa, " Ho, every one that thirsteth; come, buy wine and milk, without money or
                            price."</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Dains, Eliza" TEIform="persName"/>Eliza Dains, Hancock, Mass.</byline></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Duality" TEIform="index"/>DUALITY</head><p TEIform="p">Highly Esteemed Editress : I feel impressed to write my faith in the duality of Deity. As the
                            positive and negative principles run through all the works of the universe, representing
                            male and female elements, I am forced to the conclusion that God, the first Great Cause of
                            mind and matter, must be dual — Father and Mother — the creative and bearing principles, the
                            soul of all things, from whom proceeds life in all worlds. That we are created in their
                            image and likeness, I have no doubt; and that all good things, temporal as well as
                            spiritual, were produced, directly or i/idirectly, by them, as blessings and gifts to be
                            used for the well-being and happiness of mankind, I firmly believe. The orderly arrangement
                            in the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms, never were conceived and brought forth,
                            except by the harmonious action of the Allwise Father and loving Mother, whose dwelling is
                            in the high heavens, but whose watchful care and kindness extend to all the works of their
                            hands. To them all honor is due whence genius, talent, art and science are derived. Through
                            the mediatorial agency of Jesus the anointed and first born Son in the Christian era, and
                            Ann Lee, who was also anointed to be the first born of many daughters, we have received a
                            revelation of the duality of Deity— our Eternal Parents. By being baptized with the Holy
                            Spirit, as they were, and walking in their footsteps, we also may become rightful heirs in
                            the kingdom of peace and (in our degree) saviours to other souls. Only by obedience to truth
                            can we possess this heritage with the chosen heirs of light in the completed order of male
                            and female., whether we are led through the deep waters of affliction, or through fires of
                            persecution, if our faith is in God, and our confidence in our spiritual guides, we shall be
                            enabled to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles which may appear in the way ; and
                            should we be left to cry in bitterness of spirit as was Jesus," My God, why hast thou
                            forsaken me ? " we shall be sustained as he was, and finally find peace and rest to our
                            souls. There is no rest like that which comes from G-od — our Eternal Parents.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Davis, Saloma" TEIform="persName"/>Saloma Davis, South Union, Ky.</byline></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Full salvation" TEIform="index"/>FULL SALVATION</head><p TEIform="p">That the soul is immortal need not be questioned. Soul has been defined, the spiritual,
                            rational and immortal part of man and woman; Life, the vital principle. Then, according to
                            reason, the rational part of our being cannot rest in a dormant state; it must be aspiring
                            to elevation, or be degenerating. We possess dual powers, and capabilities — natural and
                            spiritual. The tendency of the natural, unaided by the spiritual, is downward, toward the
                            animal and sensual; and would lead back to Egyptian bondage, heathen mythology, and even
                            lower than the brute creation. But God, in love and mercy, hath given us light, to discern
                            the " way of holiness, cast up for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in ;" and hath raised up
                            Christ Jesus, to be our great Leader, in the male Order, and Mother Ann, our example and
                            Leader in the female Order. Now, indeed, hath light come into the world ; and they, who no
                            longer '' walk after the flesh," to fulfill its desires, and reap its corruptions, are not
                            bound in darkness ; but they live in the spirit, and dwell in the light of life. Those who
                            have commenced to travel the highway of holiness, find, as they progress, that light shines
                            clearer; and the power to lift fallen and erring humanity above the low plane of nature,
                            increases. Thus we are able to put on Christ, by being baptized with the same spirit, and
                            are no longer subject to the will of the carnal mind; we may be clothed with pure robes of
                            righteousness, as were our Gospel parents, and like them, rise from day to day in newness of
                            life, and feel that our souls are elevated above the sensuous, by being cleansed from all
                            impurity. How can the heart be refined, except by culture — by destroying noxious, poisonous
                            weeds, and nourishing the good and choice plants in the garden of the soul ? Impure thoughts
                            are like " little foxes that spoil the tender vines." We should learn to take those little
                            foxes — impure thoughts — before they take form in actual deeds. If we judge our own hearts,
                            truly, we shall not be judged — condemned. By obedience to true principles, we shall be made
                            free from earthly bonds and fetters, and be fitted to enter mansions of purity, prepared for
                            the Saints of God, when called to lay aside the mortal part. Then will the immortal spirit
                            rise triumphant over death and the grave, and progress onward and upward, in our eternal
                            home. Watervliet, N.
