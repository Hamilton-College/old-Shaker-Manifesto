                            evening of the 21st, in our Lyceum, the above hymn suggested itself to me, which I now send
                            with haste to you, that you may also enjoy the sensation before it gets to be old. I send it
                            in its simplicity, without any intention or desire to have it published; but, simply as a

                            views and progressed thoughts are continually appearing on the surface. These, with their
                            various combinations, and translation into practical life, constitute human progression.
                            Neither educational bias, habits, passions, nor emotions (made agreeable by long use),
                            should array themselves in opposition to the spirit of progress, nor to the evolution of
                            high and higher truths, nor to holy and holier obedience thereunto. Truth can never be in
                            opposition to itself ; but it is one of the commonest of episodes for some humanity, to
                            become alarmed for the safety of a notion or doctrine, long entertained, but perhaps never
                            investigated for five consecutive minutes —to feel very much annoyed, if some one, by word
                            or other challenge, deems it unworthy of veneration. Still, the ever recurring question is :
                            What is truest and best ? And can we ignore this appeal to our intelligence and conscience,
                            and yet be true to ourselves ? it is, I think, the dictate of wisdom to leave all questions
                            open to the fullest investigations. A refusal to investigate a subject, fearing, lest it may
                            overturn some pet theory, is an open avowal of insincerity ; and how can we be true to
                            ourselves, or in tranquil at-one-ment with God, if we are insincere ? Besides, a refusal to
                            examine any new evolution for fear of discovering some phases which may collide with our own
                            preconceived and settled ideas of right, is cowardly, to say the least, and shows a
                            willingness to shrink from the painful sacrifice of cherished notions, rather than possess
                            tlie pearls of pure truth. Is such not an unhealthy state of mind ? Is it not a case of
                            mental dyspepsia ? Some of our writers have declared that we are in a state of transition —
                            on the periphery of an old cycle, — and j ust about to cross the borders thereof into a new
                            sphere. Is this not a good time to investigate and discuss many points in our practice and
                            discipline, which have no inherent fixedness in themselves, but do now and must forever move
                            upon a sliding scale of circumstances, undergoing more or less modification, in order to
                            musically vibrate in rythmic harmony with the sublime law of evolution and progress ? To
                            transmute all that is good, true, beautiful, into higher forms of loveliness, and lay hold
                            on still higher and holier truths; and incorporating them into practical life as soon as
                            discovered, seem to me to be the religious duties of every one who believes in the doctrine
                            of Christianity. If there is any unnecessary friction in our community machinery, it can
                            never be removed by ignoring its existence, through fear of any consequences. Pouring on
                            oil, though good in many cases, will not answer in all ; certainly, if positive
                            reconstruction is in any place necessary. Celibacy, community of goods, confession of sins,
                            and Peace, are the primal principles and obligations of all Believers ; and no Society of
                            our people can live without them. Questions, in nowise compromising these, might be
                            continually discussed, investigated and improved by us. Take a general question : Are all
                            the talents, intellect, spiritual faculties and usefulness of every member fully called out
                            and appropriated to the best possible advantage of the whole ? Again, are there not means,
                            not yet brought into active requisition, whereby a greater amount of talent, now lying
                            latent, might be brought into fuller use? I suppose, the object of our paper is to circulate
                            useful knowledge in every direction the world over, and to our own Societies in particular.
                            With this aim only in view, have I made the above suggestions; and shall my motions be
                            seconded ?</p></div2><div2 type="food" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Proper food, or what substitute?"

Evans, in a recent letter to this office, appears moved to testify thus earnestly
                            : " Fine flour is a skeleton in every Society of Believers to-day. All the elements that go
                            to make up a human body and mind, must be supplied by the food usually appropriated, or
                            there will be a want - a constitutional want— and this will call for some substitute in
                            place of the normal element. " Condiments, alcohol, tobacco, etc., are substitutes—even meat
                            is a substitute. Wheat contains all that a human body needs as solid food. Eaten as the
                            apostles ate it, fresh from the field, is good. Whatever else is done to it after threshing
                            and winnowing, let us be jealous of—grinding, bolting, packing, raising, baking, etc.,— let
                            us look out for ! Is your wheat all there, unseparated, unkilled, unpoisoned 1 There is a
                            rest —a satisfied rest — remaining to the victor, who supplies the system with normal food
                            in proper quantities. There is no more hunger for the abnormal. The first Believers, as a
                            class, warred with neither small nor great evils excepting the lusts of the flesh — the
                            abuses of the reproductive functions. The second class will direct their batteries against
                            the abuses of the digestive powers as well. In both capes, the enemies to be conquered are
                            within the individual or among the body of Believers. I can hear, coming up from the
                            uttermost parts of the earth : " Glory to the righteous in physiology !"</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Little sins" TEIform="index"/>LITTLE SINS</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Orcutt, Daniel" TEIform="persName"/>DANIEL ORCUTT</byline><p TEIform="p">"A little sin is no harm!" These words have caused more destrflction to human souls, than
                            perhaps all the rest of Satan's artillery! A little of the forbidden fruit, urged the arch
                            tempter, to the Mother of mankind, will do no harm ; it will, on the contrary, open your
                            eyes to behold hidden mysteries ! The unsuspecting pair believed too readily, and we know
                            the consequences. It is by little and little, that sin increases in strength upon its
                            victims by repetition ; until it overpowers their fortitude and bids defiance to their
                            noblest resolutions. It is astonishing how some imperceptibly yield to vice, and how firmly
                            they adhere to it. They begin with very slight departures from strict honesty; which hardly
                            seem to carry " the appearance of evil," and go on, from bad to worse, till they finish
                            their criminal career by a bold plunge into certain destruction! Nothing is more obvious
                            than the connection between the beginning and the termination of sinful practices; yet how
                            difficult to convince the young of its reality. When entering upon the " broad road," they
                            do not seem to have the least fear of the fatal issue; but think they can easily effect an
                            escape when danger appear; but soon " their bands are made strong," and ere they are aware,
                            they are bound by the iron grasp of that monster, vice, and ruined ! We often feel the
                            greatest security when in the greatest danger ! " Who is afraid ? not I," has been the
                            destruction of thousands! " Let those who think they stand, take heed lest they fall! " No
                            one suddenly becomes depraved and abandoned; the beginnings are small, like the leak in the
                            ship, or the hole in the levee ; but the stain to the soul will appear. Some think that
                            little sins are not bad, provided great ones are not committed; others believe they are a
                            little bad, but in so small degree that no record is kept. No mistake is more fatal than
                            this ; it is the way that vice maintains its dominion on this earth; the standing cause of
                            ruin to the souls of millions! Vice, after thousands of years in destroying souls, has
                            become a powerful agent; and to be safe from its enticements, the voice of conscience must
                            be regarded, in little things. Let all beware of the first wrong step / Here is the chief
                            danger. It lies in venturing upon little indulgences, slight violations of conscience. The
                            only safeguard is, " avoid the appearance of evil; " " watch and pray that ye enter not into
                            temptation." Watch ! the enemy is in close pursuit, perhaps unseen, along your path! Keep
                            your armor on ; he will strike unawares ! " A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth
                            himself ; the simple (rejecting the counsel of the wise) pass on and are punished."</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Moral courage" TEIform="index"/>MORAL COURAGE</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Prescott, James S."

                            Convention. Before entering the hall, he said, " Brethren, let us lay aside all
                            personalities, and go in and speak to the people as the Spirit may give us utterance." In
                            common parlance it is said that Noah built the ark ; Solomon built the temple ; U. S. Grant
                            conquered the rebel armies ; but such were not the facts; for while others did the work,
                            these received the praise. They were entitled to their share of credit in common with the
                            rest who did the work; and no more. All praise belongs to no human being, but to God, the
                            source of all good. The meed of praise awarded me in April issue, for canvassing, does not
                            belong to me as an individual, but to the community of which I am only a component part,
                            therefore I respectfully decline wearing the medal. With moral courage, let us canvass for
                            "The Shaker." Let us lay aside all personalities, and put into the field the talents, best
                            adapted to the work, without respect of persons, in every community of Believers, until
                            every State is thoroughly canvassed. It is enough for us to know that " The Shaker "
                            continues to be ably edited ; that its radical truths are working like leaven among the
                            masses ; truths, too, which have been (and continue) revolutionizing the world of thought
                            for the last one hundred years. Why, even the very heathens (so-called) are beginning to
                            rise up in judgment against the false Christianity of our day, founded upon Paul instead of
                            Jesus ! But they do not conflict with " The Shaker," neither past, nor the present. In all
                            ages of the world, truth harmonizes with itself. Principles never 34 <pb n="35" id="p3" TEIform="pb"/>
                            THE S H A. K E 35 change. It is when truth grapples with error that conflict arises. There
                            is no conflict between the theology of The Shaker, the pentecostal church, nor any high
                            standard of morals; and we may say, original Christianity, which existed among the Chinese,
                            Japanese, Burmese, and Hindoos, thousands of years before the nations of Europe were known,
                            excepting as barbarians ; while our Christian era, and, even our bible, are modern when
                            compared with their ancient records. Viewed in the light of truthful, scientific antiquity,
                            they cast us, as Americans, quite into the shades. No wonder our dear J. M. Peebles felt
                            humiliated, while visiting the oriental nations, when he saw that they not only had records
                            dating anterior to any thing he could find in the western world, but that they had
                            inspirational gifts, too, from the God of the Universe equal to our own. It is enough for us
                            to know that all our good deeds are recorded in the book of life; that we are in harmony
                            with the good, the true, and the pure of all nations.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Subdue passion" TEIform="index"/>SUBDUE PASSION</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Whitcher, Mary" TEIform="persName"/>MARY WHITCHER</byline><p TEIform="p">Passions restrained, but not subdued, May yet o'errule the whole — Our common sense, our

WITHAM</byline><p TEIform="p">As the sun of the natural world warms the flower into life and beauty, so the spirit of man
                            receives from the great fountain of divine love, the warmth which animates it into action.
                            This quickening spirit of love is the essence of our beings ; it flows from God into our
                            souls, and forms a part of our lives. If love, then, is the essential principle of our
                            beings( it is very important that we understand its nature and quality. Mankind partake of
                            animal love, but with it we also partake of an inner, spiritual love, which is angelic in
                            its perfection. As all sin comes from love of self, we should seek above all things, that
                            power which lifts us above the realm of self, and its evils, into that heavenly sphere,
                            where love is characterized by purity of word and deed. By the power of this spirit, victory
                            over evil is gained, and the power of the enemy laid low. Love in purity brings from within
                            itself all that our heavenly parents can bestow. Unto God give all thy thoughts, and in thy
                            actions he shall be glorified, and in his love thou shalt be rewarded. Light and love— the
                            intelligent eye, and kind heart of God — twin sisters in holiness, decorate the brow of
                            their sterner brother truth, with heaven's choicest garlands. Love and wisdom smooth the
                            rugged road, and make the sandy desert to bloom as a heavenly resting place for the
                            heaven-bound pilgrim. Without God's love there is no harmony.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Social beauties of shaker communism" TEIform="index"/>SOCIAL BEAUTIES OF SHAKER COMMUNISM</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Neal, Sarah A." TEIform="persName"/>SARAH A. NEAL</byline><p TEIform="p">Dear Editor of the Shaker : Being an earnest reader of The Shaker, and feeling a deep
                            interest in its permanent success, I take the liberty to write a few lines, in which I
                            purpose to offer some remarks upon that which would improve, and make it more effective,
                            generally and particularly, while you certainly are at liberty to act your pleasure with the
                            same. That The Shaker is a candid exponent of gospel truth I truly admit ; and think every
                            reasonable reader will readily say the same; but while I have read its truths with a very
                            large amount of pleasure, and have enjoyed a real soul-gain by so doing, I regret to observe
                            that the beauties of social life, derived by the practice of these truthful principles, do
                            not find fuller expression in its columns. I sometimes think, that for an exponent of
                            cheerful Christianity, The Shaker wears too sad a countenance to comport with its true
                            mission. Now, would it not brighten its general appearance, and make it more favorably
                            effective to all, to blend more of our social benefits, with our religious tenets ? That the
                            social life of Christian communism is superior in its precepts to all worldly life, we know
                            very well; indeed, principles so beautiful as those on which our institution is founded, are
                            calculated to produce a heaven right here upon the earth ; and if we fail to realize the
                            superior harmonies of the angel-]ife, it is because our practical lives fail compliance with
                            these basic principles. Living in the spirit of our gospel testimony, we necessarily
                            renounce many practices which bring pleasure to the worldly mind; and embrace those elements
                            which produce the joys of heaven in our present social lives. And would not individuals,
                            making no profession of our principles, more willingly sacrifice their transient pleasures,
                            for the acceptance of the pure and enduring joys of Christian communism, could they know
                            that such were the living realities of our present life, and not alone anticipated hopes to
                            be realized in the far away future ? Now it is commonly believed by those least acquainted
                            with Shaker communism, that the Shakers are a recluse and unhappy people ; but so far from
                            this necessarily being the case, we know that our happiness might be transcendent in excess
                            of that realized within the limits of worldly circles. And, knowing this to be a fact, I
                            think we fail to do justice to our gospel cause, by permitting any to think thus wrongly of
                            our social lives, by our remaining silent on this subject. It seems to me that our paper
                            ought to be the very christ of our day — the true medium, through which the divine spirit
                            can reach mankind ; and to make it thoroughly loyal to its mission, we need to clothe it
                            throughout with the genial spirit of Christ, that, while it prepares the soil, and sows the
                            seeds of truth in nature's bleak country, it may, at the same time, reflect the warmth of
                            spirit, and the sunshine of power, requisite to bring forth those germs into life and
                            fruitful activity. The fact is simply this : we need to denote more of the bright, genuine
                            influence expressed by " I am happy, I am free." And when we shall have convinced the world
                            that this is our home condition, thus enhancing the beauties of our gospel, more will be
                            attracted to our delightful precincts, to share in the truths and joys of the heavenly
                            kingdom, not anticipated, nor imagined, but real, tangible, present possessions. Then again,
                            if I understand Shaker communism rightly, it not only claims the faculties in their
                            religious exercises, but it embraces every active, practical phase of a pure life ; and
                            likewise the all domestic phases, which we nearly or wholly neglect to notice. These form an
                            essential part in the programme of practical Christianity. And to neglect one phase of our
                            Christian life is to reflect a shadow on all the others. And more, I think that all
                            societies, families, and individuals could be largely benefited by a liberal expression of
                            every Christian, domestic practice. Let us give expression to all that is good, whether
                            coming from the basement or attic of domestic relations ; and Christian duty calls us into
                            both places oftentimes. For instance, some society or family may have easier methods for
                            doing certain kinds of business ; others, a more healthy kind of food and a nicer manner of
                            preparing it. Still another may have acquired superior facilities for intellectual
                            improvements ; and by giving expression to our various attainments in different departments
                            of domestic life, all could be benefited by adopting the most advanced opinions. Of course
                            these are only suggestions not intended as any intrusion upon that which could occupy their
                            place with more propriety. But to conclude, I think if we clothe our truths with sunshine,
                            and present them with cheerfulness, we shall increase their force, and make their effects
                            eternal, And while I hope the truth may have a perfect growth with us all, and that the
                            smiles of a loving providence may ever brighten the editorial sanctum of The Shaker, I
                            remain very truly the friend of beautiful Christianity, and your sister.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Think no evil" TEIform="index"/>THINK NO EVIL</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wheeler, Maria" TEIform="persName"/>MARIA WHEELER</byline><p TEIform="p">The importance of speaking no evil cannot be too deeply considered. Yet to avoid evil
                            speaking it appears necessary that we think no evil. We are so liable to be led by impulse,
                            that we can hardly entertain evil and unkind thoughts toward any one, and constantly speak
                            good and kind words of them. Some individuals may be very weak and erring, but to such we
                            should extend that " charity which covereth a multitude of sins ; " and few if any are so
                            perfect as to be faultless. Again, we may fail to understand, and consequently misinterpret
                            the actions of others. If we practice judging the actions of others, by our preconceived
                            ideas of their motives, we will unjustly, and often injuriously, " bear false witness " of
                            them. Although six thousand years have rolled their slow lengths along since the command, "
                            Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy brother " was first proclaimed, its justice
                            and immutability have lost none of their force. And it declares its divine origin by its
                            just and equita- <pb n="36" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 36 THE 8HAKEK. ble character. Nor is it more a
                            commandment than the words of the wise and good man Jesus, written in the sands, " neither
                            do I condemn thee, go and sin no more." Our obedience to these two commandments, the former
                            to protect the innocent, and the latter to shelter even the guilty, would give us food for
                            pleasant reflections, when we do as the poet beautifully says: " It is good to talk with our
                            past hours, And ask them what report they bore to heaven, And how they might have borne more
                            welcome news." This practice would make us lenient to the faults of others ; and often
                            discover to us that much which we are inclined to call wicked in others is only unwisdom.
                            Now, if we wish to speak no evil of any one, we must think no evil, lest unkind thoughts
                            betray themselves through speech. If the heart is right, there is no need of a sentinel at
                            the lips.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Five questions—please answer" TEIform="index"/>FIVE QUESTIONS—PLEASE ANSWER</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Webster, Ruth" TEIform="persName"/>RUTH WEBSTER</byline><p TEIform="p">Can we truly say that we desire the blessing of God, when we do not strive to merit it ?

BASSINI'S THEORY.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Russell, J. G." TEIform="persName"/>J. G. RUSSELL </byline><p TEIform="p">Physically speaking, " tone is breath, made vocal " therefore, the respiratory process is the
                            great, moving cause of the origin of tone. The thorax, alluded to in the preceding number,
                            is an organ, capable of immense compression, and expansion, which renders it a befitting
                            receptacle for the lungs, and likewise subserves the purpose of giving, by its resonance,
                            both depth and volume to tone. Rising now higher, in the scale of tone-rendering, we trace
                            the movements of expired air, as it leaves the lungs, and enters two great branches, or
                            tubes, anatomically termed the bronchi, at the junction of which is a single tube, called
                            the trachea, which is composed of numerous cartilaginous rings, into which the air passes.
                            Situated on the top of the trachea, is a cartilaginous box, called the larynx, which, in the
                            language of Bassini, " is composed of four pieces, which have the power of playing into each
                            other, or of moving together. Through the center of the larynx is a hollow passage, or
                            continuation of the air-tube. This tube terminates in a wide opening, which is formed by the
                            vocal cords, being of triangular shape, and is called the glottis. Above this opening is a
                            valve, called the epiglottis. The epiglottis covers the air tube, and protects it in the act
                            of swallowing ; the food passing down behind at the back of the throat. Above the epiglottis
                            is a continuation of the opening [leading both into the mouth and the nose] called the
                            'pharynx. The walls of the pharynx have the power of contracting, or acting upon, the column
                            of air, thus modifying the tone." The larynx, then, is the principal instrument in the
                            production of vocal sound ; and through its mechanical structure we come to consider the
                            nature of the voice. Though writers upon this subject are somewhat at variance in their
                            ideas as regards its likeness to certain kinds of musical instruments, they coincide in the
                            idea that its imitation is good in certain ways. The distinguished Bassini — before alluded
                            to — after recognizing three kinds of musical instrument, viz. : the reed, the stringed, and
                            the flute (all three of which he explains), thus writes, " But I cannot resist the
                            conviction, that the voice is an admirable compound of all three, mechanisms ; and for this
                            reason : It is not a reed alone, because a voice can slide from one tone to another (like
                            sliding a finger up a violin or guitar string), in a manner impossible to a reed instrument.
                            Besides, in a reed instrument, the reed, or tongue, is fastened at one end only; whereas,
                            the vocal cords, in their perpendicular extension through the larynx, are fastened at both."
                            Again, " The voice is not a stringed instrument alone, because in the production of falsetto
                            tones (so called), the strings cease to vibrate." Still again, " It is not a flute
                            instrument alone, because only a portion of the tones are produced by the vibration of a
                            column of air in a fixed tube. The voice, therefore, I cannot but think, wonderfully
                            combines the advantages of the reed, the string, and the flute mechanism, most closely
                            resembling, however, the reed."</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Day of Christ" TEIform="index"/>THE DAY OF CHRIST</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bussell, William H." TEIform="persName"/>WM. H. BUSSELL</byline><p TEIform="p">This expression is world-wide as well as particular in its signification. Jesus said, " When
                            I shall be elevated from the earth, I will draw all unto myself." " When the son of man
                            shall come in his glory, then will he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall
                            be gathered all nations." There is evidently here an allusion to that sublime scene in the
                            vision of the prophet Daniel, when " one like the son of man came to the ancient of days,
                            and there was given him dominion and glory, that all peoples should serve him, whose
                            dominion is an everlasting dominion." The son of man in the vision is to be regarded only as
                            a representative character, for in the interpretation given to the prophet, it was declared,
                            " The dominion under the whole heaven shall be given to the people — the holy ones of the
                            Most High." That Jesus understood it in this light is evident from his words in the
                            application and exposition of the vision. " Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least
                            of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." The day of Christ is the day of judgment of
                            all nations and of each individual person. Jesus said, " For judgment I have come into this
                            world," and yet he declared emphatically, " I come not to judge the world, but to save the
                            world." He reconciles these words by the statement, " The word that I ham spoken, the same
                            shall j udge you in the last day." In this light are to be understood the words of the
                            prophet, " Judgment was given to the saints ;" and also of the apostle, " Know ye not that
                            the saints Shall j udge the world ? " It is truth, or God himself inspiring his people, that
                            is to be the j udge of mankind as nations and as individuals. God is unbounded love, perfect
                            holiness, infinite wisdom / the God of all peace and of all justice. These attributes must
                            have irresistible sway. Judged by these, in the progress of this eternal day, the apostolic
                            age of ages, the nations shall yet be impelled to convert their instruments of destruction
                            into implements of peace ; not only to abandon all efforts to acquire fame by conquest and
                            slaughter, but also to change all the customs of servitude, whether of man to man, or woman
                            to man; all the distinctions of wealth, all the marks of honor that arise not from the
                            indwelling of the spirit of love and exact justice in the soul; and to employ the abundant
                            resources which the earth contains for the highest welfare of all its children. This is the
                            universal prophecy that has come hymning its joyous melody all along the ages, uplifting
                            many a heart that seemed overwhelmed by the accumulated evils of its own times. This truth
                            must also judge the individual. When divine love makes its permanent residence in the soul,
                            it will sit in judgment upon every thing found there contrary to itself. It must decide
                            against that pride which exalts itself not only against God, but against the least of his
                            creatures. It must condemn to the perpetual fire of the day of j udgment that selfconceit of
                            the individual man which influences him to regard himself as occupying the place of Supreme
                            Authority, ready to exercise vengeance against whoever ventures to call in question his
                            infallibility. It inculcates humility ; not a bowing and cringing before power, whether
                            legitimate or assumed, but that evenness of soul which puts itself on a level with all God's
                            creatures because they are such. Divine love must decide against whatever disturbs the
                            equanimity of the soul, producing a condition such that it cannot weigh in even scales
                            whatever is presented to its rational powers. It impresses upon the understanding and the
                            conscience the truth, that fickle lust is not love, and that mere indulgence in any or all
                            of the senses and passions does not tend to the highest welfare. The power of judgment is a
                            discriminating power ; it examines all motives, and scrutinizes all feelings, approving
                            whatever will permanently edify, and discarding that which is valueless. As a necessary
                            sequence of the preceding, the day of Christ must be regarded, as it is in reality, a day of
                            resurrection from evil of every kind, and an entrance upon a new life, vastly superior to
                            that which is merely sensuous, even in its highest condition. The sensuous man may be highly
                            developed, socially, intellectually, and morally. When he has risen from the sensuous to the
                            spiritual plane of life, he is no less social, intellectual, or moral; the obligations to
                            universal culture and growth are binding as ever. The difference between the two conditions
                            consists in degree as well as in tendency. There is in the latter a newness in the
                            sensations experienced, and an aspiration toward that Divine Life, which comprehends every
                            creature of God in its loving embrace. In his former condition, the person is limited in his
                            social, intellectual and moral vision, and hence is often sceptical with respect to
                            immortality, even though he may have made extraordinary scientific attainments. The -newness
                            of life experienced enlarges his views and imbues his spirit with a consciousness of
                            immortality that mere intellectualism cannot supply. This inspires him with courage in the
                            work of restraint which he finds necessary in order to rise entirely above the sensuous, and
                            to live and move in the spiritual life. This experience, with the added fact that it is
                            ultimately to be the experience of every human being, and that it is never to end, but to
                            increase as the ages ceaselessly roll on, is what really makes the glory of the day of
                            Christ.</p></div2><pb n="37" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Communication from Horace Greeley" TEIform="index"/>COMMUNICATION FROM HORACE GREELEY</head><p TEIform="p">THROUGH ALMIRA ALLARD. [It is generally known that the Shakers are the original subjects of
                            modern spiritualism. We have received innumerable communications from the Spirit World, many
                            being accompanied by irrefragable evidences of genuineness. Although these seasons, in their
                            most fluent proportions, have ceased with us, passing oat to the larger human societies of
                            families, yet we have never been entirely neglected by our spirit friends. We present the
                            following communications from the simple, loved, good, and great Greeley. It is but just to
                            the medium that we say, the same was sent to us, before the Belknap and other exposures were
                            made. G. A. Lomas.] To G. A. Lomas, Ed. of The Shaker : * * * I still live, and work for the
                            good of humanity. I find in the spirit world, that while the sexes stand on an equality in
                            all things, the masculine principle precedes in the direction of the general good. Laws are
                            made here, through the united agencies of male and female mind. They are not arbitrarily
                            imposed on any. The influence of love they bear with them, invites their acceptance, and
                            convinces the erring and fallen, that their good only is desired. The golden rule is more
                            apparent here than on earth ; and hence, we find here none trodden down, nor ruled by the
                            iron rod of tyranny. * * * I perceive in the government of Washington, corrupt and evil men;
                            those upon whom the president should look with unfavorable eyes. The elements that waken the
                            spirit of war, are warming up again, and for the most selfish ends, there are those in
                            governmental positions who favor war. Let these be chastened. * * * When on earth, I labored
                            honestly for human elevation. I believed in a just God. and in retributive consequences. In
                            my way, and according to my ability, I did uplift the people. I was not considered a
                            Washington, Jackson, nor as others, noted for peculiarly noble deeds ; I was, and am, simply
                            Horace Greeley. Here, I can see the folly of worldly splendor: Noblemen and kings; ladies
                            and their queens, anxiously accepting offers of mercy from the humble, in ways that are
                            lowly, yet wise ; all guided by the Christ-spirit. I am now confirmed, that I was correct in
                            my private opinions of the extent of intercommunications between this spirit world and
                            earth. * * * Be thou encouraged ! The Shaker is earnestly sought by thousands in these
                            spheres; and it has already been the best means of enlightening innumerable minds in spirit
                            life. It is destined to have a wider circulation. I find my inclinations lead me as strongly

                            accusations, and that these may be proven facts, abundant opportunity is being consumed,
                            before courts, councils, committees, and the general world of thinking men and women. They
                            may prove to be mere scandal ; they may prove truths, which "the mills of the gods," so
                            slowly, yet inevitably jn'csent. But in all the trials thus far, there has been an element
                            wanting, which, being prevalent in Jesus, made him the best of lawyers ¦— preeminently the
                            most desirable one upon such trying occasions. The majority of the people has adjudged
                            Beecher guilty. There are the best of evidences for believing that this verdict reflects the
                            construction of too many guilty hearts. We have not come forward at this late hour, to be
                            the champion of our illustrious friend, we will not even assert his innocence, though we
                            must be permitted to hope so, but we have risen to interpose the argument of Jesus in his
                            behalf, even supposing his case to wear the worst possible construction. Our impressions
                            are, that these trials have been conceived, opened, prosecuted and attended, by a class
                            resembling one of old, which introduced an equally aggravating case to the attention of
                            Jesus, and at the conclusion of which he figured conspicuously. A scene: A party of two —
                            man and woman — are detected in a very wrong act, for the punishment of which the law of
                            Moses had prescribed stoning to death. The icoman only is brought before Jesus, to test the
                            competency of his judgment concerning the law. His answer is well known; and there were no
                            stones cast. Still they questioned Jesus, what they should do with her; while he, stooped to
                            the ground, and as if he heard them not, wrote with his finger thereon, and the revelation
                            of the spirit, says that he wrote: uTe have all done likewise." A Jesus was needed in these
                            terrible trials of our friend, to have given a quietus at the first, of causes which have
                            cast such baneful influences all over the world. Our opinion is: If Jesus had conducted
                            Beecher's defense, he would not have shielded him if guilty; but he would have spoken and
                            written as once before, for the benefit of Beecher's accusers, '' and they being convicted
                            of their own consciences, went out" leaving Jesus and Beecher alone; and, assured by
                            Beecher's honest confession, of his true condition, the ever memorable index to true
                            repentance might have been useful: "Go, and sin no more," while Brooklyn, and all else,
                            could profitably lament: " Alas, for the rarity of Christian charity, Under the sun." We all
                            may conclude, that in being weighed in the balance of eternal justice, none will weigh the
                            more in righteousness, for traducing Beecher's or any other's character. Let Jesus be
                            admitted to practice in our own courts. ^</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Original and modern Christianity" TEIform="index"/>ORIGINAL AND MODERN CHRISTIANITY</head><p TEIform="p">The N.

                            illustrating the scintillations of the grand truth of universal brotherhood: "^ ? * * "The
                            demands of a growing civilization have greatly modified Christianity since it was first
                            preached in Galilee, and the eye of the needle has in the course of twenty centuries been
                            gradually enlarged so as to admit the biggest camel of the herd. It is plain that if we make
                            it a dubious matter whether rich men get into heaven, we discourage trade and setup a bar
                            against the cultivation of the useful desire for riches. * * * " But is it not a little
                            strange that the (Drew's) theological plant has grown in such a soil? Does it not furnish
                            food for reflection ? Give all thou hast to the poor and follow me, was the injunction of
                            the Nazarene. He taught that gold was not a salve for a sore conscience or a pavement for
                            the narrow way to heaven. Such healing must be won by the abandonment of the sordid
                            practices by which the gold was gained, not merely by the relinquishment of the whole or a
                            part of the plunder, and that road must be trod by wayfarers who not only gave up what they
                            had wrested through cupidity, but who also eschewed cupidity itself and followed the lead of
                            a higher and more spiritual guide. If we people of New York should practically take the
                            words of Christ as our guide and follow the example of the chosen companions of his earthly
                            career whom he commended, or even that of the early Christian community who had all things
                            in common, we should have a very different civilization from that we now boast of. " It is
                            idle to deny that the seed planted in Judea has grown into a tree whose outspreading
                            branches shade and shelter a much more complex system, and one more adjustable to the
                            desires and passions of men than the simple Christianity of the New Testament. This it is

                            us from our sins, and from the desire to sin — principles that have changed our hearts, from

                            heard the invitation to step in and be healed, we are moved to communicate upon the grand
                            desiderata of the times. We are witnesses of a valuable truth — that whoso loves men's souls
                            may, by earnest, persistent efforts, induce the impression that results in a revival of the
                            Good Spirit among men. There is none, however, in the past nor present, who, having awakened
                            souls to the realization of their loss, and the necessity of their conversion, but is
                            confronted with the truth that human effort alone is very, very limited for human salvation
                            — only an agent in the hands of higher powers. We have heard the egotist boast of what he
                            has done and what he can do, but these have been made intensely disagreeable by the prayer
                            of the humble,'' Lord, if Thou wilt, and unless Thou dost help, mine is a useless effort!"
                            We have read of and witnessed the arduous efforts of sincere soul-workers, we have noted
                            their personal endeavors in mentally convicting individuals of their souls' real needs, and
                            we have seen sinners aroused, as by thunderclaps, through the efforts of the successful
                            revivalist. We have been mournful witnesses also, of the serious truth that conviction,
                            though it necessarily precedes, is not conversion. We have been among the number who have
                            earnestly labored in diffusing the light that exposes human errors, and we have been as
                            sorrowfully disappointed at the ease with which those who, having experienced true
                            conviction, failed to yield to a genuine conversion, and that there followed in the wake of
                            great awakenings of the good spirit, an army of backsliders into the mire and vomit of
                            worldly pride and flesh. To the thousands who may feel the spirit working for them, The
                            Shaker speaks cheeringly, adding an assurance, however, that if a "change of heart" means
                            any thing, it means turning from sinful practice into the righteousness of a new, unselfish,
                            pure Christian life. A revival that begins in the spirit and ends in the flesh is
                            soul-hardening — there better have been no revival. And yet, how frequently, almost
                            invariably, revivals take this unchristian turn. Why is it that carnal affiliations of a
                            general character subsequently displace the pure affections of the good spirit that, in
                            times of genuine revival, lifts souls upon the cross that crucified Jesus every day of his
                            life — that makes the bare mention of worldly pride and carnal lusts the .most objectionable
                            themes? Seek conviction, but be assured of a true conversion, without which all effort is
                            useless and all religion a fraud.

                            illustration of the droll humors of that period, and of the characters of the leading actors
                            in the scene which found its denouement in the establishment of Protestantism. Apropos of a
                            picture representing Calvin at the burning of Servetus, Mr. Parton offers a goodnatured
                            apology for the part taken by the illustrious Genevan divine in that unhappy transaction :
                            The former was not indeed present at the burning, but he caused the arrest of the victim,
                            drew up the charges, furnished part of the testimony that convicted him, consented to and
                            approved his execution. Servetus was a Spanish physician, of blameless life and warm
                            convictions, who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Catholic and Protestant equally
                            abhorred him, and Protestant Geneva seized the opportunity to show the world its attachment
                            to the true faith by burning a man whom Rome was also burning to burn It was a hideous
                            scene—a virtuous and devoted Unitarian expiring in the flames after enduring the extremest
                            anguish for thirty minutes, and crying, from the depths of his torment, "Jesus, thou Son of
                            the eternal God, have mercy on me ! " But it was not Calvin who burned him. It was the
                            century. It was imperfectly developed human nature. Man had not reached the civilization
                            which admits, allows, welcomes, and honors disinterested conviction. It were as unjust to
                            blame Calvin for burning Servetus as it is to hold the Roman Catholic Church of the present
                            day responsible for the Inquisition of three centuries ago. It was Man that was guilty of
                            all those stupid and abominable cruelties. Luther, the man of his period, honestly declared
                            that if he were the Lord God, and saw kings, princes, bishops, and judges so little mindful
                            of his Son, he would "knock the world to pieces." If Calvin had not burned Servetus,
                            Servetus might have burned Calvin, and the Pope would have been happy to burn both.</p></div2><div2 type="recipe" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Cracked wheat pudding" TEIform="index"/>Cracked wheat pudding

NANNIE MINOR. Some one has asked for directions as to the
                                    various modes of cooking cracked wheat; but among the numerous replies I have not
                                    seen one for making a dish which our family consider particularly dainty and
                                    wholesome. I take a large coffeecupful of boiled cracked wheat; four eggs ; four
                                    heaping tablespoonsful of coffee-sugar; one pint of new milk ; one piece of butter
                                    of the size of a walnut, and one fresh lemon (if I can get it). Mash the wheat with
                                    the potato masher (to avoid lumps); add the yelks of the eggs and sugar well beaten
                                    together; the butter after it is melted, then the milk, and lastly, three or four
                                    slices of the lemon, being careful not to allow the seeds in, as they will make it
                                    bitter. Rake one-half hour or until the custard is set, stirring once or twice after
                                    it becomes heated, to prevent the wheat from settling to the bottom. Beat the whites
                                    of the eggs to a stiff froth ; add a little pulverized sugar, and flavor with the
                                    juice of the lemon that is left. When the pudding is baked spread this on the top,
                                    return to the oven and brown lightly; serve hot, with cream, or it is equally good
                                    when cold. Cracked wheat simply boiled is a daily dish on our breakfast table, and
                                    as it is almost impossible to cook just enough, we often have a small saucerful
                                    left. In two or three days enough will have accumulated to make this pudding—and to
                                    use these precious bits I have improvised this, which has now come to be one of our
                                    standard puddings, and which I now offer to your readers In return for the many

Have any of our readers witnessed similar

                            three years I have lived in a town, and during that time my sittingroom has been free from
                            flies, three or four only walking about my breakfast-table, while all my neighbors' rooms
                            were crowded. I often congratulated myself on my escape, but never knew the reason of it
                            until two days ago. I then had occasion to move my goods to another house, while I remained
                            on for two days longer. Among other things removed were two boxes of Geraniums and
                            Calceolarias, which stood in my window, the windows being always open to the full extent,

                            those around me. This, to me, is a new discovery, and perhaps it may serve to encourage
                            others in that which is always a source of pleasure, and which now proves also to be a

                                    themselves on a plan based upon principles much further reaching than the so often
                                    tried and unsuccessful co-operative plan, but based somewhat on the socialistic
                                    principle, though so modified as to secure its success, by keeping out lazy and
                                    selfish individuals. They have established an institution which they call the
                                    Industrial Works, and this establishment furnishes all the members with constant
                                    employment at fair wages, and a pleasant home at a small cost, which is meeting with
                                    a success so marked as to attract the attention of all thinking people. The members
                                    of this association are all young people, who are willing to rid themselves of all
                                    bad habits, work steadily, dress economically, and save a portion of their wages; no
                                    others are taken. All the men who join are required to furnish a small amount of
                                    capital, and to save one-fourth of their wages, which must be invested in the
                                    capital stock of the association. Women are not required to furnish any capital at
                                    the outset, but must save one-sixth of their wages and invest it in the business.
                                    Those who do not comply with the requirements of the association are expelled, and
                                    those who wish to leave can do so at any time, and can withdraw their capital by
                                    giving six months' notice. The wages paid to each member are fixed by a Board of
                                    Directors, and are proportioned to their skill and ability. They have a large
                                    dwelling, or home, where the members live and enjoy many privileges and comforts not
                                    usually found in families or boarding-houses. All pay a moderate price for their
                                    board from their wages. They have two new factory buildings, a good water privilege
                                    and considerable machinery, and are engaged in the manufacture of toy and
                                    house-furnishing goods, for which they find a ready sale. They commenced business a
                                    year ago with five hands, and are now working forty-five ; their sales for last
                                    month were over |3,000, their pay-roll for the month was over $1,200, and the saving
                                    of wages which was added to the capital of the company was over $300. The average
                                    amount saved from the wages of each man in a year is $150, and of each woman $50.
                                    Many of the members have saved much more than this during the year, but this is all
                                    that is required of them. The aggregate amount saved by the present company in a

                            exceedingly trying course of discipline, by completely changing its hours — exposing it to a
                            bright light at night, so as to prevent sleep, and putting it in a dark room during the day.
                            The plant appeared to be much puzzled and disturbed at first. It opened and closed its
                            leaves irregularly, sometimes nodding, in spite of the artificial sun that shed its beams at
                            midnight, and sometimes waking up, from the force of habit, to find the chamber dark in
                            spite of the time of day. Such are the trammels of use and wont. But, after an obvious
                            struggle, the plant submitted to the change, and turned day into night, without any apparent
                            ill effects.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="According to Beecher" TEIform="index"/>ACCORDING TO BEECHER</head><p TEIform="p">Another man finds himself a lawyer.

                                been chosen with the most exceeding care. As a secular magazine, we have not seen any
                                thing higher toned, nor more desirable; and we now wonder less that America leads the

                                clemency of the weather. It will be of brick; 32 feet wide, 38 feet long, with an L for
                                outbuildings. Two stories high,— retiring rooms above. It is the present inteni ion to
                                light and heat it by same reservoirs that warm and illuminate the new house. Its
                                location is fifteen feet farther north; six feet farther west than the previous one —
                                this change for the better prospect, and to escape the shade made by the house. The
                                Church Family, Mt. Lebanon, purpose exhibiting some of their manufactures at the
                                Centennial. Also, the South Family have secured space to display their Shaker Chairs —
                                editorial, and others, we suppose ! We have thought it a good idea, that they should
                                take with them Mother Ann Lee's chair, now in possession — what there is left of it—of
                                Shakers at Watervliet, N. Y. It has been so constantly used, that the legs are worn up
                                to the lower rounds, all round. We were pleased to notice that Bro. R. M. Wagan has
                                issued a musical and historical circular of Shakerisrn for Centennial circulation; and
                                has so ingeniously blended chairs, music and history together therein, that the people
                                cannot see the pictures of chairs, without being forced to learn our history and our
                                songs ! Will not all other Trustees be as anxious to dispense the gospel ? We doubt not,
                                that while he thus magnanimously circulates such valuable information, he will also sell
                                many of his chairs ! Elder F. W. Evans has been laboring in New York and Brooklyn
                                considerably of late. Accompanied by ten of his family, songs and sermons were
                                plentifully distributed. We • hope they were successful. There is no criterion equal to
                                success.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Vital truths" TEIform="index"/>VITAL TRUTHS</head><p TEIform="p">Truth is like a torch; the more it is shaken, the more it shines. No indulgence of passion
                            destroys the spiritual nature so much as respectable selfishness. If we get knowledge into
                            our minds edgewise, it will soon find room to turn. He who would reprove the world must be
                            one whom the world cannot reprove. He who reigns within himself, and rules his passions,
                            desires, and fears, is more than a king. Good humor is the blue sky of the soul, in which
                            every star of talent will shine more clearly. Traits of character which you seek to conceal,
                            you had much better seek to reform. The poorest education that teaches one selfcontrol, is
                            better than the best that neglects it. It is not enough that we swallow truth ; we must feed
                            upon it as the insects do upon the leaf, till the whole heart is colored by its qualities,
                            and shows its food in every fibre. If you put a hot coal in your pocket it will burn its way
                            out. Aye, and so will a bad deed that is hidden make itself known. A fault concealed is a
                            fault doubled ; and so you will find all through life. Never hide your faults, but confess
                            them, and seek through God's help to overcome them. Herbert Spencer says, " Whoever
                            hesitates to utter that which he thinks the highest truth, lest it should be too much in
                            advance of the time, may reassure himself by looking at his acts from an impersonal point of
                            view. Let him duly realize the fact that opinion is the agency through which character
                            adapts external arrangements to itself— that his opinion rightly forms part of this agency—
                            is a unit of force, part of the general power which works out social changes; and he will
                            perceive that he may properly give full utterance to his innermost conviction, leaving it to
                            produce what effect it may. He must remember that, while he is a descendant of the past, he
                            is a parent of the future ; and that his thoughts are children which he may not carelessly
                            let die. The highest truth he sees he will fearlessly utter, knowing that whatever may come
                            of it, he is thus playing his right part in the world."</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>TO EVERGREEN'S SHORES</head><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hawkins, Betsy" TEIform="index"/>Betsy Hawkins
