Published in Albany, N. Y., in 1808. No. 12. Account of the Progress
                            of Shakerism among the Revivalists. The flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit
                            against the flesh; these are contrary the one to the other, so that every person according
                            to the principle by which he is governed, whether flesh or spirit, will conceive, judge of,
                            and denominate things around him. Hence, Avhat is food and medicine to one man, may be
                            poison to another; what one calls truth, another calls error; what is the work of God to
                            one, appears the work of the devil to another, and even the happiness of one may be the
                            misery of another. The same thing is often distinguished by names directly opposite,
                            according to the sense of different persons. He who was called the Son of God by some, was
                            denominated by others, the prince of the devils. What one calls Shakerism another calls the
                            testimony of Jesus Christ, and a Shaker in the language of some, is by others called a true
                            Believer, a child of God, a follower of the Lamb. What is still a greater contradiction,
                            that which is called a work of redemption by some, others distinguish as a work of the
                            deepest delusion. From this diversity in the sense and language of mankind, it will be
                            necessary to treat of this religion in a twofold order. 1. According to the real sense and
                            understanding of those who have embraced it. 2. As it is addressed to the external senses of
                            mankind in general. In each part of the history, impartiality requires that I use the names
                            of distinction and modes of expression peculiar to each. Accordingly I shall proceed in the
                            first place to give a brief account of the entrance and progress of the testimony of Jesus
                            the Christ, among the subjects of the revival in Kentucky and Ohio. Great expectations had
                            been formed by the subjects of the revival of something very great to take place in the
                            summer of 1805, in which God would especially answer their ten thousand prayers, in
                            delivering them from sin<pb n="266" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> and opening the way into the holiest of all,
                            pursuant to which, the same spirit that had convinced them of sin, inspired them to pray and
                            confidently look for deliverance from it, and stirred up such warm expectations of its near
                            approach. That spirit, on the first day of the first month, in the same year, dispatched
                            three men,�John Meacham, Benjamin S. Youngs, and Issachar Bates from the Church at New
                            Lebanon, in the state of New York, with the testimony of Jesus the Christ, and as living
                            witnesses of God, to open and confirm to the people, that way, and only way out of sin; that
                            complete salvation which they themselves had found, and that everlasting life and glory of
                            which the Church in that place was in possession. They arrrived in Kentucky about the first
                            of March, tarried a few days at Paint-lick where they were kindly entertained; from thence
                            they journeyed to Cane ridge and spent a few days among the subjects of the revival in that
                            place, by whom they were treated with unfeigned respect. From thence they passed over into
                            Ohio, and paid their first visit to Springfield, but without exercising particular labors in
                            any of those places ; they prosecuted their journey until they arrived at Turtle-Creek, near
                            Lebanon, on the 22nd. of the same month. They came first to Malcham Worley's and tarried
                            with him over night, and the next morning they came to my house, which was the first means
                            by which I knew that a church or people by such a name existed upon earth. We spent the
                            remainder of the day principally in conversation on the most interesting points in religion,
                            and from the evidence I could collect, I judged them to be men of honest principles,
                            singular piety, and deep understanding in the things of God, and as such I determined to
                            treat them so long as their deportment was correspondent. Some of their conversation I could
                            not so well understand; a number of things appeared new, but considering the copious field
                            of truth, too extensive for my comprehension, I was rather disposed to hear and learn more
                            of God, than to shut out everything that was not included in my little sphere of knowledge.
                            The next day was the Sabbath, and as they desired to know whether the rules of our meeting
                            would admit them to speak in public, provided they had a feeling so to do, I answered that I
                            knew of nothing to hinder. I was sensible the spirit of the revival, as well as that of our
                            wholesome government, imposed no restriction on any man from testifying his faith, nor bound
                            the conscience of any from hearing whoever they chose, and upon this principle, the door was
                            fully opened for them to make any labors at Turtle-Creek, either in public or private to
                            which they conceived they were com missioned. Accordingly, Issachar Bates and Benjamin
                            Youngs attended the meeting and opened the testimony of Jesus Christ, which might all be
                            summed up in this one saying. "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take
                            up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life- shall lose it; and whoso ever
                            will to his life for my sake shall find it."<pb n="267" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> From their own feelings,
                            as well as in behalf of the Church from whence they came, they expressed great union with
                            the work of God that had been for years past among the people, convicting them of their sins
                            and pointing out by words, signs and many other ways, the door of hope for salvation ; but
                            they further testified that the time was now come for them to enter into actual possession
                            of that salvation, of which they had received the promise that the way to attain it, was by
                            selfdenial, taking up a full cross against the world, the flesh and all evil in our
                            knowledge, and following Christ; walking as he walked, and being in all things conformed to
                            him, as our pattern and head. Particularly according to St.' Paul, becoming dead with Christ
                            to the rudiments of the world, dying unto sin once, rising with him to a new, spiritual and
                            holy life, and ascending step by step in a spiritual travel, and separating "farther and
                            father from the course of a corrupt and fallen nature, until we arrive at the perfect
                            stature and measure of the sons of God. That the first step in this saving work, was to
                            confess all our sins, and when we confessed them, forsake them forever. And wherein we had
                            injured and defrauded any one, to made restitution ; in so doing we should find mercy ; and
                            being faithful, should receive that measure of the holy spirit, which would be an overcoming
                            power, not only sufficient to keep us out of all actual sin and defilement, but to cleanse
                            and purify both soul and body from the very nature of evil. These things they delivered, not
                            as mere speculations, but as things that had for many years been reduced to practice, and
                            established by the livingexperience of hundreds in the church of Christ, to be the way and
                            only way of God ; the one door of hope for a lost soul, and the sure entrance into the
                            righteous, peaceful and holy kingdom of God's dear Son. They did not pretend to direct
                            others in a wray which they themselves had not travelled but testified that with these plain
                            terms of the gospel, they had complied; and the substance of the promise they had received,
                            and could say without boasting or dissembling, that they had received that overcoming power,
                            w'hich kept them faultless before the throne of God, even in the presence of his glory, was
                            a matter that greatly concerned us. That as Christ had now made his second appearance, for a
                            final settlement with every soul of man, and as God had wrought so great a wrork among us,
                            in waking up, enlightening and preparing us to make a final choice; and by a special gift of
                            his spirit, had sent us his everlasting testimony of truth, we ought to be very cautious how
                            we treated it. Such as were illuminated in the great and marvelous light of the revival, to
                            see the evil nature of sin, and stirred up to seek the way out of It, and had the only way
                            of God opened to them, if they should reject it, their case must be deplorable. Although the
                            light and power of the spirit might have been again and again restored to such as fell into
                            sin, while they had not the proper means of keeping out of it, yet when those means were
                                of-<pb n="268" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> fered, should they be rejected, there remained no more
                            protection for such a soul, but they must lose the salutary effects of their former light,
                            and fall under the power of the wicked one. Upon this principle, the subjects of the revival
                            must either embrace the present call of God, and in obedience thereto take up the cross and
                            follow Christ, or gradually lose the extraordinary effusions of the spirit they had been
                            under, and leaven back into a more corrupt and deplorable state than ever. If a historian
                            cannot be disinterested and unbiased it is necessary that he be honest; therefore I
                            acknowledge that nothing ever presented itself to me that so powerfully interested my
                            feelings as the above testimony. Although I was not wholly unbiased, I can say with
                            propriety, I was far from being biased in its favor. A thousand objects presented themselves
                            to bias me against it. But its intrinsic weight, the importance of the work that was past,
                            the salvation of thousands that hung upon the point of its termination, and that of my own
                            soul with the rest, balanced the weighty demands of the three insatiable idols of time, and
                            held me at least upon an equilibrium for several weeks, so that without prepossession or
                            predetermination, I could candidly investigate the subject, ready to go with the weight of
                            evidence, whereever it should preponderate. During this interval, my searches and researches
                            into the Scriptures, their history, precepts, promises and prophecies, the signs of the
                            times, my own past experience in religion for fifteen years, the nature of the past
                            extraordinary work, and the present state of the subjects of it, with all the rest of the
                            professors of Christianity with the many questions and answers that passed in conversation,
                            were they all written, would swell into a large volume. In this kind of exercise I was not
                            alone. The general agitation may be in some measure conceived of, from the following letter,
                            dated Caneridge, April 2, 1805. (to be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Interest for Zion" TEIform="index"/> INTEREST FOR ZION.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Perkins, Abraham" TEIform="persName"/> Abraham Perkins.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Many, many times am I mentally drawn to the subject of Zion, its needs, the call of souls to
                            the support of its interests, and with their knowledge of Christian life, their great
                            responsibility, together with the cares, burdens and duties evolving. In my heart I
                            exclaim,�that with all there exists of human weakness, man is able to satisfy the Almighty
                            and become his glory, however mighty the work or great the sacrifice. Our God is not an
                            unreasonable being ; a being who would require of his creatures beyond their capacity of
                            performance, although the demand to be, perfect even as He is perfect may seem preposterous.
                            As his children, we are to be perfectly obedient to the revelation of his will given us ;
                            and as we grow in knowledge to the risingstate of manhood, with that addition of knowledge,
                            the character of our lives should correspond, producing evolution, progress and greater
                            perfection, God-like, and as is manifested<pb n="269" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> in the works of the Creator.
                            If we would find, we must seek; if we would be opened unto, we must knock. Thus do we grow
                            in understanding to know good from evil, to become in capability and power, not Gods, but
                            men and women of God, such creations as the All-wise designed we should be. He hath
                            said,�"Shall I bring forth and not cause to bring forth ? Shall the earth bring forth in one
                            day? Shall a nation be born at once ?" Neither is manhood perfected in a day. It requires a
                            term of years and soul travail to accomplish it. It should not be inferred from these facts
                            that ease or indolence is justifiable. We must work while the day lasts, while mercy
                            continue th and while the cistern remains unbroken. Our God, though long-suffering, is not
                            to be mocked. In his character He is justice as well as mercy; a good requiter for every
                            service rendered Him and positive exacter to the utmost farthing for every deed of
                            unrighteousness. Enfield, N.

                            God's loving care is shown. Through all life's varied mazes When devious paths we tread; His
                            strong arm ne'er forsakes us In safety we are led. Thus far the Lord hath guided Well may
                            his children sing; And to his throne of mercy A grateful tribute bring. Still keep us
                            Heavenly Father O draw us nearer Thee With thy seal of love, impress With true humility.
                            Illume life's inner temple With rays of light divine; May fleeting years bear record That we
                            are truly Thine; And when our earth-life closes We ask as robe and crown, The blessing of
                            the faithful, The joy of duty done. Canterbury, N.

Watson" TEIform="persName"/> W. Watson Andrews.</byline><p TEIform="p"> The idea of communistic life seems to have been entertained by men in very early times.
                            Instances are not wanting even before the advent of our Savior, of communities established
                            upon this principle. People in all times seem to have been aware that there is not only a
                            disposition but a necessity in man's nature, leading him to fraternize, to congregate into
                            communities and live in as close a relation as the nature of his circumstances would permit.
                            In obedience to this law men have endeavored in various<pb n="270" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> ways and at
                            various times during their history to establish communities wherein all the members should
                            fare and share alike ; having common interests, tables and privileges generally, varied only
                            by the tastes, conditions and capabilities of the individual. And although there has been no
                            lack of talent, of means, nor of good intentions engaged in these enterprises, they have for
                            the most, signally failed. And the cause of these failures is always the same old
                            story�disagreement, antagonisms among the mem-, bers, a preference for self and family
                            connections. Nature first of all must needs provide for the reproduction, care and culture
                            of the race, by endowing man and woman with the reproductive and parental instincts, and
                            unlimited care and partiality for their offspring. Without this the human race had not been
                            known; and with it there was necessitated private families, private property and private
                            residences. Hence all attempts to maintain community of interests and of residence while
                            retaining the family relation must ever fail; for it is no less than attempting to do away
                            with an effect while continuing the cause. The human race depends for its existence upon the
                            family relation; and the family relation, as we have seen, depends upon isolation of
                            interest and of residence for its existence. Likewise, the human race depends for its
                            happiness upon congregation,�the community relation ; and this equally depends for its
                            completeness and permanent existence upon identity of interests and residence ; and both
                            phases of human life are alike called for by the nature of things. The family relation,
                            therefore, is a great primal necessity; though perverted, it is nevertheless a fundamental
                            necessity, the seed field of the human race. It antedates the race; it produced and it
                            sustains the race, and the last echoes of its knell will be heard only by the last of the
                            race. The communistic relation is also a great necessity, a kindred necessity of equal
                            importance; and although not primal it is final, and completes what the other begins, being
                            the harvest-field of ;,the human race. The necessary self-love of the one, with its
                            consequent antagonisms, and the equally necessary social love of the other with its
                            consequent harmony, are alike but parts of the divine economy in the affairs of men, for
                            growing and harvesting a crop of human souls divine. And "the husbandman that sowed the seed
                            is the son of man; the field is the world and the reapers are the angels." In the first,
                            self-preservation is the standard of excellence; in the last, self-abnegation. In the first,
                            except a man provide for his own household he is said to be worse than an infidel; and in
                            the last, if he do not forsake and hate the selfish relationships of the household for
                            Christ's sake and the gospel, he is an infidel. Beside these, there is no true way for men
                            and women to live upon this planet; all others are incipiency or decay, presaging or
                            recalling normal human society. The family requires that a man be governed by the selfish
                            sentiments,� exclusive care for himself and family. Directly or indirectly, whatever he
                            plans or executes has- for its object<pb n="271" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> the support and comfort of his
                            own household. He contributes, it may be, to the support of the state, to liberal
                            institutions and various public enterprises; but it all means only this, that his nature
                            prompts him (and very properly) to provide for his own in preference to another. He gives in
                            charity when he can without depriving his own, not otherwise; self must have the preference
                            or the race would speedily become extinct. And this is by no means the result of calculation
                            only; but it has its source in man's original nature, in the necessities of the case. The
                            true communistic relation, on the contrary, requires that a man be governed by the liberal
                            sentiments, an equal care for his fellow-man. AV hatever he engages in has for its object
                            the well-being and happiness alike of his fellows as himself. And the only wTay to do this
                            permanently is to make a full sacrifice of all selfish considerations, all natural, partial,
                            private relations ar 1 possessions,�father, mother, brother, sister, wife, children, houses
                            and lands, yea and his own (rudimental) life also. Retaining a preference for any of these
                            proves a rock to the voyager in communism, and a rock upon which sooner or later he is sure
                            to split. For whatever partakes of the nature of possession, possesses the nature of
                            antagonism; i.e. any exclusive possession from the enjoyment of which the brother must be
                            excluded, involves the possibility of contention, and contention and harmony are
                            incompatible ; and harmony is the cement of society, without which it speedily falls in
                            pieces. No matter what the society, whether savage, civilized or Christian, there must needs
                            be a common bond of union, a universally pervading element in which all interests center,
                            and toward which all aspirations point as the needle to the pole, in order to have that
                            degree of harmony which creates and which alone sustains society. In natural generative
                            society this harmoiiial bond is the reproductive instincts (erroneously called love,)
                            culminating in the family relation with its "trouble in the flesh," its cares, its
                            anxieties, its fears and its sorrows; antagonistic in its nature and limited in duration,
                            its pleasures are necessarily limited and unsatisfactory. In spiritual regenerative society
                            this harmoiiial bond is love�love to God, supreme, and neighbor as self in the communistic
                            relation, with its freedom from "trouble in the flesh," the cares, the anxieties, the fears
                            and the sorrows of the family relation. Harmonial in its nature and continuous in duration,
                            its pleasures are necessarily unlimited and abundantly satisfying. For having reference
                            mainly to the spiritual life of man which is eternal in its nature, the true religious
                            communistic relation is equally eternal, a life�habits of thought and of social intercourse
                            which time cannot affect and which death does but sever from whatever annoyance things of
                            time occasion. Instead of stripping the soul of its treasures, death does but place it in
                            the full enjoyment of all that constituted its happiness while on earth. And this is eternal
                            life, the voluntary relinquishment of all that death can take from the soul and<pb n="272" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> the formation of tastes and habits while in time which will eternally endure,
                            and in the exercise of which souls are forever increasing in wisdom, in purity and in
                            happiness. And as fast as men progress to the condition of understanding these great truths�
                            of comprehending the grand system of nature�of God with regard to man, that it necessarily
                            embraces a harvest as well as a seed-time, a regenerative as well as a generative
                            dispensation; that these two states are necessarily of an exactly opposite character,
                            inasmuch as the one is a purely natural state indispensable in producing natural beings, and
                            the other a purely spiritual state, equally indispensable in the development of spiritual
                            beings. The ripening of the spiritual depends upon the decay of the natural as really as the
                            ripening of the grain depends upon the decay of the stalk. Therefore what is pleasurable in
                            the one is painful in the other, what is life to the one is death to the other and vice
                            versa�so fast will they comprehend that all pertaining to the natural generative order,
                            either in this mode of existence or any other, must be stripped from the immortal soul of
                            man as the chaff from the grain, before he can become capable of those complete
                            soul-blendings with the divine source and his fellow-man, which alone produce the harmony
                            and insure the happiness of heaven. Union Village, Ohio.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Strike the enemy within..." TEIform="index"/>Strike the enemy within...

                                Congress, London, 1890, that your little Community is based upon the principles of
                                vegetarianism, adopted by you for its conformity with your religious and scientific
                                persuasion. Now, it is the intention of myself and some friends of mine, all adherents
                                to the doctrines of Jesus Christ and the natural diet of fruit and vegetables, to reform
                                both our spiritual and bodily lives, as much as we can. We are young men about
                                twenty-five years old, and occupied, hitherto, in commercial and official affairs: but,
                                bred in the country and acquainted with country life and rural occupation, we have
                                studied besides, theoretically, the best methods of growing fruit and vegetables at a
                                profit. So, we mean to retire from town, where it is so very difficult to make any
                                progress in the sanctification of the soul, and the improvement of our health, and to
                                take our residences in the country, growing all we want by cultivating the soil and
                                establishing our lives on the basis of brotherhood, after the model given by the first
                                Christians and being described in the second and fourth chapters of the Acts of the
                                Apostles. We know that there are many doubts as to our aptitude for such an enterprise;
                                we are even fully aware that our character is by no means developed enough to equal the
                                    glorious<pb n="273" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> example of the first Christians. But our aims are
                                pure and we will earnestly endeavor to proceed in sanctification and education, as well
                                of ourselves as of our families ; and Jesus Christ being ever before our eyes, his holy
                                example inciting us, day by day, to shape our lives after his own, could it be too bold
                                to hope that our endeavors would succeed, at least more than in our present
                                circumstances? So we wish soon to be able to let you know of the starting of our
                                settlement ; and as your principles seem to be the same as ours, we should be very happy
                                indeed if there could be established more intimate connections between you and us, in
                                order to help each other in all aspirations tending to improve mankind, and to secure a
                                flourishing and blessed state of our communities. We are not likely to begin our reform
                                before the lapse of some years : nevertheless, I should be very thankful to already
                                enter into relations with you and the families of your village, and to profit as much as
                                possible by your experience and knowledge. You will oblige me very much by letting me
                                know the statutes, principles and administrative views upon which you arrange your
                                external affairs. As to our respective religious persuasions, I do not know whether they
                                are the same or not; but I can scarcely imagine that the difference, if there be any at
                                all, is very great. Perhaps you will let me know the title of some book wherein I may
                                find all the details in this respect. Hoping to be favored with a kind reply, I remain,

                                due time. We are very glad to hear of, and from you; and to learn that you are
                                dissatisfied with what is, and are looking for something better. We know how to
                                sympathize with you, having been in the same hoping condition : but now� having found
                                that good thing, which has been so long a subject of prophecy�we enjoy a sabbath of
                                rest. The testimony of Jesus, manifested in the first appearing of the Christ spirit to
                                humanity, in the male part, was a "spirit of prophecy," of hope in the future. The early
                                Christians "knew in part, prophesied in part, and saw, as through a glass, darkly." They
                                knew God as a heavenly Father ; they were a kind of first-fruits of the tree of
                                redemption ; they looked for a second appearing of the Christ spirit, to effect a more
                                perfect work of God upon earth; they prayed continually for the kingdom of heaven to
                                come. To us, it has come. Christ�not Jesus�has made his second appearance, "without sin
                                unto salvation." In the first appearing, the heavenly Father was revealed; in the second
                                appearing, the heavenly Mother is revealed ; it is "the day of the Lord." Hitherto, all
                                governments, civil and ecclesiastical, have had male rulers; church and state were
                                united, like Pilate and Herod; and woman was kept in abject subjection. Even under the
                                infidel, secular government of these United States, where all men are declared to be
                                created equal, and en-<pb n="274" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> clowecl with certain inalienable rights ;
                                woman is deprived of those rights, and has not any part in legislative assemblies,
                                "whose just powers are derived solely from the consent of the governed:" woman's consent
                                is not asked, and has not been given ; she is a slave. You are young men�the princes of
                                the provinces�and intend "to reform your lives, bodily and spiritually." Vegetarianism
                                is to be a plank in your platform of principles. That is good; it is better than
                                orthodoxy, founded in the blood of butchers' shops, phys.ically, and in the blood of
                                Jesus spiritually. In orthodox Christendom� Babylon�is found ' 'the blood of saints and
                                martyrs, and of all the blood shed upon earth." Buddha says, "Thou shalt not kill:" is
                                not that better than Babylon Christianity, wherein all creatures are killed and eaten,
                                and wherein church and state agree to train all the able-bodied and healthy young men,
                                for several years, in the art of killing each other? Nine millions of men in Europe are
                                now separated from social life, from agriculture, from marriage, who ought to be the
                                very ones to propagate human beings, instead of killing them : and what of the
                                corresponding nine millions of women, who have a natural, inalienable right to husbands,
                                who should be the noblest of the race ? Now they have to marry the debris of manhood,
                                that the doctors have rejected as physically unfit for soldiers, to kill and be killed.
                                Dear friends, look closer, deeper, if you would succeed in "establishing your lives on
                                the basis of brotherhood, after the model given by the first Christians;" as shown in
                                Acts ii., and iv. We will refer you to seventeen companies of men and women who have
                                lived in brotherhoods and sisterhoods for one hundred years ; as Peter referred those
                                who had arrested them, to the impotent man who had been healed. In all of these
                                Societies, no one lacks food, care, clothing, house nor land. Are not these what you
                                seek to secure, in process of years? Why seek ye the living present among the dead past?
                                Wherefore are you like the Jews, looking for the Messiah, when the Messiah lay in a
                                manger, or talked to their wise men in their temple; or, like the antichvistian
                                world�Greek, Catholic and Protestant�who keep praying for Christ to come and establish
                                the kingdom of heaven upon earth, do ye go about, to seek that which is found, and to
                                creuce that which exists, already, in glory and overcoming power? Rather, come and see
                                what God hath wrought, as the queen of Sheba came to see Solomon's temple; and you shall
                                find that "a woman has compassed a man," and has established a system of redemption,
                                more perfect than the Pentecostal model church�a spiritual temple, which Solomon, in all
                                his wisdom, attained not unto, any more than, in all his glory, he could clothe himself
                                as the lily of the valley was clothed. Christ has come into Christendom's dark ages as a
                                thief, in the night, works his will, while the occupants of the house are in deep
                                slumber. "Watchman, what of the night? The morning cometh, the day is dawning, the sun
                                of righteousness has arisen, with healing in his wings," not for<pb n="275" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>
                                one poor, impotent man, but for the saints under the altar, who were crying, "How long,
                                O Lord, shall we have to wait for the fruit of our labor and suffering, for our reward
                                ?" And answer was given, "Be patient, until other saints and martyrs, like you, shall be
                                killed by those who think their infernal, inquisition torturing and killing them, is
                                doing God good service, under church and state governments." These are now supplanted by
                                an infidel, secular government, which was founded by Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and fifty
                                like them, who signed the Declaration of Independence. Under a republic, there is peace
                                and safety, liberty of conscience, and none to make free men and women afraid. Glory to
                                our Father and Mother God, in the highest! Could not some one or more of your company
                                come over, as the spies to the land of Canaan? We have room and work for all of you, if
                                you are ripe for so spiritual a work as we have devoted our lives unto. � Perhaps, some
                                of you would prefer to marry and be given in marriage : let such remain, and form a
                                co-operative society, but not attempt a community. A community is where the Lord began
                                to show his city, at the day of Pentecost; on that basis, "no man's building will be
                                able to stand." Try it, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Co-operation belongs to the
                                new earth: community to the new heavens�the Shaker order. I will send you some of our
                                writings ; and if, upon further acquaintance, you are still interested and attracted
                                toward the Shakers, "upon whom the ends of the world have come," we shall be pleased to
                                continue the communion of saints thus commenced. Much love to you from your Shaker

TEIform="persName"/></byline><p TEIform="p"> I was born in- - - - -Warren Co., Ky., Sept. 1, 1807. In the spring of 1811 my parents moved
                            to South Union, and entered the Community of the Believers. The children were placed under
                            the charge of the Elders and appointed caretakers. At this early date our accommodations
                            were very limited, as the Society had not been able to furnish suitable dwellings for all
                            who accepted the gospel faith. A log cabin was selected as the residence for the little
                            girls and their caretakers, where we lived till the fall of 1812. We now moved to the<pb n="276" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> Grove or to the former residence of John Rankin. Our home was now
                            known as the "Children's Family," and with the adult members who had charge of the place, we
                            at times numbered not less than one hundred and fifty. � I remained in this place till I was
                            ten years of age. During the summer months the girls were sent down to the Black Lick family
                            and returned in the fall very much improved in health. As the Grove proved to be a very
                            unhealthy location our family was moved in 1817 to the place formerly owned by Jesse
                            McCombs. In 1822 a part of the children were moved to "Black Lick," and the place was known
                            as the "Children's Family." The older boys and girls were accommodated with homes in the
                            Framed and Brick House families. Black Lick was also to be my home and I was to assist in
                            taking charge of the smaller children, and O wThat a time we had that winter in those open
                            log cabins. For three years, three months and nine days this was my Community home, but on
                            the fourth of Dec. 1825, I moved to the "Center Family," and entered a class of my own age,
                            the companions of my infancy and childhood, and retained this privilege for eight years,
                            when I reached the age of twenty-five. On the 7th of May 1833 I was appointed to the order
                            of Elders, an assistant to Eldress Susan Robinson. Our home was to be in the "Novitiate
                            Order" which was under the direction of Elder Samuel Eads. In June, 1839, I moved to the
                            North Family, as assistant to Eldress Maggy Nay lor, and on her removal to the Center Family
                            in Sept., of this same year, when Eldress Prudence Houston was chosen to be the senior
                            Eldress. In this home I remained eleven years. Eldress Prudence returned to her former home
                            in Dec. 1843, and the writer was appointed as the senior Elder of the family and sister
                            Clarissa Rankin was chosen to be my assistant. I accepted the cross and labored according to
                            the best of my ability to do my duty acceptably. In Oct. 1850 I was appointed to the Order
                            of Ministry as an associate with Eldress Betsy Smith. I had now reached the age of
                            forty-three years, one month and twenty-nine days, and yet this change was the greatest
                            cross of my life, and before I could make up my mind to accept the gift, I prayed fervently
                            to know if it was really the gift of God. Not that I doubted the wisdom of my superiors, but
                            I felt myself so unfitted for the place. My faith was in my obedience to the gift which I
                            accepted and to which I gave my whole life. This change was demanded on account of the death
                            of our beloved Eldress Sarah Rice. I labored to be helpful in this new calling, although it
                            was not congenial to my mind. The office of the Ministry was a very retired position and
                            deprived me largely of the sociability and company of the family as a whole, but as years
                            passed on I became more reconciled to the place and rather enjoyed the freedom from the many
                            cares and burdens of a large family. In Oct. 1864 I moved from the Order of Ministry, and
                            was appointed to the Order of Elders. My home was to be in the "Center Family." I had<pb n="277" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> left one good company of gospel friends, to enter another and to
                            accept a new line of duties. I had lived with the Ministry nearly fourteen years, and I now
                            found I was accepting a great cross to part with my dear friends, to accept the burden of
                            family cares, at my advanced age, and especially in a time like the present, when the spirit
                            of rebellion seemed to rule both church and state. The war of the Rebellion had forced upon
                            us as well as upon those surrounding us, a great many very unpleasant conditions. Our little
                            Community was by no means exempt from its baneful influences. Passing through this state of
                            unrest we have by the blessing of God been protected so far as to be able to keep our home,
                            and to share with our gospel relation, in the beautiful gifts and graces of the spirit. (to

                            sorrows together we've known O, where have its golden tipped moments flown Sot long ago we
                            heard spring's gentle tread, And before our eyes her rich robe she spread; The sequestered
                            nooks and lone silent places, She adorned with her rich and beautiful graces. On the barren
                            mountain's towering height, The forest arose in its kingly might; E'en there she cast her
                            bright robe of green, While flowers arose and blushed unseen. Thus around us they stood in
                            their beauty anew Watered and nurtured by summer's rich dew, They smiled to the sun- and its
                            glittering ray. As it kissed from each leaf the dewdrops awa. From the tall stately trees to
                            the tiniest leaf, Springtide adorned with her flowery wreath, The hand of our maker in each
                            form was seen As they stood richly dressed in their fresh robes of green; Thus decked in the
                            glories of fair springtide, Creation stood forth in its beauty and pride; Nourished by
                            heaven's cool showers so sweet, It blossomed in beauty 'neath the summer's heat. But on
                            rolled the wheels ot progress and time; And autumn soon came her ripe sheaves to bind; With
                            fingers of magic her sickle she wields, And gathers her harvest from nature's vast fields;
                            But alas! what a change o'er creation is wrought, A s each living thing in its language has
                            taught No longer she stands in her gaudy array, For the harsh winds of winter have swept
                            them away. The lone barren sod and the once rippling rills, The woodlands, the mountains,
                            the valleys and hills, All tell that stern winter is bearing its sway, All, all tell the old
                            year is passing away; Passing, passing away is nature's refrain; , While our hearts unite
                            and re-echo the same, Passing away, swiftly passing away, Is the good old year with its
                            bright happy day Then let us pause while reflection we cast; On the wrong and unkind deeds
                            of the past, Let the wrong in the heart no longer stay, Let these with the old year be
                            passing away. May unkind thoughts that are false and untrue The angry words and actions too,
                            May these in each heart be cast out to-day, May these with the old year be passing away. May
                            the passions of envy, malice and strife, Which mar the happiness of human life, May these no
                            longer hold their sway, But with the old year be passing away. Then will our souls grow in
                            beauty and love, And mould in the likeness of the father above Then clearer we'll see love's
                            bright shining ray, When all with the old year has passed away.

                            </head><p TEIform="p">Quite soon, all the good and bad conditions that belong to the twelve months of 1891 will
                                be barred out, so far as date is concerned, and while some of the old things may pass
                                over the barrier and attract the attention of a few of the w7ondering thousands of
                                pilgrims, a new series of the good and bad ways of mankind will be inaugurated. Some of
                                these may possibly work their way into the life of the world, till the dawn of the great
                                millennium, or until the prophetic day of Wm. Miller or Prof. Totten conies to close the
                                scene. So far as we have learned, all the big and little sinners of 1891 are still at
                                work, as interested as ever to accomplish what mischief they can before being forced to
                                make a very radical change in their programme. Very few of this class will be brought to
                                believe that so soon as 1899 their little games of wickedness will suddenly collapse,
                                and their homes be far less congenial than was that of Daniel among the lions. But what
                                shall we say of the Christians ? The would-be guardians of the gates that lead into the
                                Holy City. Their mission of peace and good will on earth, can never grow old, even
                                though sadly neglected bv negligent minds, as the principle of being good, and doing
                                good haa something in it that savors very muck of what might be called everlasting.
                                Ezekiel, the prophet, designated those who were the guardians'of the City, as the
                                watchmen. They were expected to give immediate notice if any one was discovered
                                committing a trespass. The keening of the Law was the promise of peace. It was the
                                school-master of that dispensation to lead souls to Christ. All Christians should be
                                guardians or watchmen and as faithfully give notice as did the Jews, if anything should
                                be known to injure the harmony of our spiritual or moral life, in or out of the church.
                                It is always the privilege of the Christian watchmen to invite themselves and then to
                                invite all others<pb n="279" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> whether professors or non-professors to share in
                                the present and no lees in the blessings of a better life. What beautiful privileges are
                                offered for consecrated workers in the Lord's vineyard ! Every faculty can be brought
                                into requisition ; every ministration for spiritual life can become an exaltation, and
                                every form of God's love to man, a song of endless praise. Christians will make
                                themselves to be very unprofitable servants of God if they fail to follow the calling of
                                their divine 'Teacher in his mission among mankind,�"Come unto me," said he, "all ye
                                that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," and promises them, at the
                                same time, an abundance of the blessings of this life in the hundred-fold reward. If the
                                Christian watchmen are not earnestly engaged in their duty in the teaching of others to
                                think better and live better, that they may become the friends of humanity, as was
                                Jesus, then as Christians they are of but little account only so far as their borrowed
                                name makes them a speciality. To leave this simple form of evangelizing and enter into a
                                speculative theory seems to be the "one essential" with many minds. Through this theory
                                they would save the world from its sins. While we might hope that the whole world would
                                come to an end even so soon as 1899, when all that is good may be saved, and all the
                                wicked ways of mankind be burnt up : yet we quite fear that when the fire is over, the
                                seed of Cain will be found on the earth, as prolific as it was at the close of the
                                flood. Now we would kindly propose, even at this date, that those who expect to be good
                                in 1899 and be prepared for the heavenly ascension, would begin to-day and show their
                                faith by their works. "Depart from all iniquity." Prophetic calculations in the hands of
                                the mathematically wise, like Miller and Totten may warrant all the mystical statements
                                which time and ability can produce : but in the development of practical righteousness,
                                will be about as sure and as effectual, as it wTould be for a pilgrim to reach the Holy
                                City by marching through the labyrinth of Arsinoe.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Society record" TEIform="index"/> HOME NOTE.</head><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="South Union, Kentucky" TEIform="index"/> South.

                                47.41 2.22 in. Geo. M. W. Nov. 1891. Beloved Elder Henry :�If with the dial-plate we
                                could say, "I take no heed of time Save when the sun is shining," we could impress upon
                                each moment as it passed some interesting item; for surely so sunny an Autumn is
                                -unprecedented in our history. Were the poet Hood to materialize in our locality, we
                                think his negative description of November would be changed to the affirmative. Fourteen
                                consecutive, clear, crisp, cloudless days, which really would be delightful, were it not
                                that we think with a shudder�even on our hillside�of our almost dry springs, ponds,
                                reservoirs and cisterns, and fearing a water famine, we anxiously watch for, and welcome
                                the clouds. Such is life! But less sunny is our inner home. The rather sudden failure of
                                our loved Eldress Ann, has gathered the nimbus clouds about us. Now, that she is
                                released from public life and service, we had hoped, that as of yore, her sweet spirit
                                would linger for a while in happy old age, with her own home friends. And it may be so
                                yet; but now she is seemingly looking from life's west windows at a setting sun. To
                                supply the vacancy left by her removal, we of the Church lose in Eldress Augusta, a
                                valued friend, a firm pillar, and one as true as the needle to the Pole; and while1
                                others step to the front, we rejoice that in true worth we are still self-supporting.
                                May it ever be thus, which will be, if each member of our home, feels as did Ruth of old
                                that we have one God and one people, with interest undivided. Just at present we have
                                with us from our sister Society at Watervliet, Sisters, Samantha Bowie and Ella
                                Benedict. When the time shall come that we have more reunion, of our loved, our
                                Community friends, our views will be broader, our heart-love stronger and our interest
                                and life-work more to one purpose. A. J. C. Center Family. Nov. 1891. Beloved Elder
                                Henry:�Our Home Notes are rather concise at this time. Am glad to report that fall work
                                is pretty nearly finished so far as gathering in and housing the crops is concerned.
                                Some plowing to be done and some necessary repairs of fences around home. We have added
                                quite a number of sheep and cattle to our stock which we hope will prove profitable to
                                the family. Health of our people quite good. Tour Brother, T. D. R. Sorrtli Family. Nov.
                                1891. The harvest time has come and gone leaving many grateful hearts and pleasant
                                remembrances of the full reward of their earnest labors of fruits and vegetables. We can
                                have no cause to complain. We have stored in the cellar over two hundred bvxshels of
                                apples; seven hundred bu. were made into cider and we dried three and one. half barrels.
                                Of black and blue huckleberries we gathered, preserved and canned one hundred and fifty
                                gallons. One hundred and fifty gallons of tomatoes were put into stone jugs while there
                                were preserved and pickled three gallons of each. Of potatoes three hundred bushels are
                                placed in the cellar for winter use, while seven hundred bushels were sold. There were
                                eight acres of corn which yielded a rich supply, enabling us to dry between thirty-five
                                to forty barrels, the kiln being finished, afforded us an opportunity of using it which
                                proved satisfactory. We have gathered for the winter three hundred hubbard squashes for
                                home use. There is also an abundant supply of turnips, carrots and onions of which sixty
                                bu. were sold. I think we have every reason to be thankful. A. W.<pb n="281" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>
                                Nov. 1891. so we are to round the last notes for 1891. But not till after Thanksgiving
                                and Christmas, will the vibration cease. And after these have died away we shall long
                                hear the echo. Thanksgiving is a good time, to recall the many blessings it has been
                                ours to enjoy, and to bow our hearts in practical appreciation and gratitude. A good
                                time to "gather up the fragments that nothing be lost" Attention to little things is
                                what assures our prosperity. Christmas time seems a very appropriate season to look back
                                over the passing year and make note of all mistakes and blunders, in thought, word and
                                deed; with an eye on the future. A good time to renew and strengthen all our good
                                resolutions, and to form new ones. We have had most beautiful weather the past few week
                                with some very sharp freezing. Our streams and springs are very low, and unless we get
                                an abundance of rain before winter sets in we shall have considerable inconvenience.
                                There is no time we so fully appreciate the value of water as when it is scarce. It is
                                about the same with other good things. Our measure the past season has been filled to
                                overflowing; and it would seem as though there was nothing good enough. The first
                                Believers would say ' 'thankfulness made easy the way of God: and the unthankful were
                                unholy." With such a superabundance of temporal there is some danger of a wasteful
                                manner being entertained; which in no wTise adds to out comfort or gospel travail. We
                                have had a beautiful rain to-day for which we render grateful thanks. D.

Dear Editor
                                :�The busy finger of time significantly points to the date of present month, reminding
                                us that "Home Notes" should be forwarded to your ever interesting periodical. We have
                                been sojourning the past four weeks with dear gospel friends in the beautiful Conn,
                                vale, the land that teems with luscious fruits, golden grains, and flows with milk and
                                honey. Spiritual blessings abound in profusion and our extended visit here, has been
                                restful, satisfactory and highly beneficial to soul and body. May the heavenly powers
                                continue to sustain, bless and prosper the consecrated souls in this portion of our Zion
                                whose hospitality is proverbial, and whose labors of love are unceasing. Br. Ira, and
                                Sisters accompanying him, were two weeks in the state of New Jersey; then returned home
                                as financial business demanded Ira's attention. As he began to realize the beneficial
                                effects of the climate, it was deemed advisable for him to return, consequently the same
                                company journeyed thither, and remained another two wTeeks. The conclusion now is, that
                                he is improving in health and strength. May the power that assists to shape the destiny
                                of human beings, still uphold and grant to him and others the boon of health. Later
                                reports from home state that Br. Ira is now transacting business in New York City. Crops
                                of all kinds yielded fairly and are secured for Winter. Apples were more plentiful than
                                was anticipated earlier in the season. We were much interested in the account of

"Watch in all things." It is impossible to progress heavenward without
                                constant watchfulness. If we would see and know ourselves as we are seen and known of

                                past. Watch, said Jesus�and well we may. Our greatest opportunities may come to us
                                to-day. 4641 spaces of cream were sold in October. 918 bushels of apples have been
                                dried. Our apple crop will exceed 4000 bushels. Warmth, proper food and cleanliness mean
                                success in poultry raising. Cabbage is indispensable as a relish for hens, and a
                                sufficient supply should be stored to feed during the winter. Gravel should be placed in
                                barrels and scattered on the ground occasionally. Bran, with ground oats and meat scraps
                                'steamed in milk is an excellent mixture for hens. About one hundred hens for an acre is
                                considered to be the right number. D. Orcutt. SoTitli Family. Nov. 1891. The November
                                number of our Manifesto has arrived richly laden with good things, and is a reminder of
                                the duty to produce something of interest in and about home. The blessings which ever
                                attend the faithful are ours, and our hearts swell with gratitude and thankfulness to
                                God for his precious gifts of peace, plenty, and health. Winter again gives signs of
                                approach, a steady cold spell warns us to secure our crops. Corn is nearly all husked.
                                50 tons of beets and carrots are in the cellar, also 1000 bushels turnips. Winter apples
                                in great abundance are secured, and cider apples so plenty it has made it unprofitable
                                to gather and haul to the mills. Very little rain has fallen this Autumn making it a
                                favorable opportunity for pushing along the fall work, but causing fears of a short
                                supply of water during the winter. It is good for us to feel our dependence under Divine
                                providence, on our own exertions for temporal and spiritual blessings. M.

Dear Editor :�I have read with great pleasure, in the Nov. Manifesto, an
                                interesting account of the "Harvest Home." If we had more of such beautiful
                                entertainments, in our Zion home, I think it would be productive of much good. As the
                                outward is an index of the inner life, why should not our home be made pleasant and
                                attractive with everything of a useful character. As young minds are active in thought
                                we find among them a desire to beautify their gospel home. Should they not receive a
                                just appreciation of their worth and efforts in the right direction. Our good Elder
                                Elijah often prompted us to be faithful in looking after the neatness of our premcies.
                                There is a great responsibility resting on each one, to feel for the honor and credit of
                                their home. The relations are the closest of all relations, its harmony is most
                                sensitive, and the feeling of interest should be alive in every heart. Kudeness of
                                speech and action mar the harmony of our home and our characters are tried by the
                                multitude of trifles we meet, rather than by great trials. The larger usually give
                                warning of their approach and we summon all strength to meet them, but sittle things
                                come unexpected. To meet them successfully we need the spirit of Christ dwelling
                                constantly, within us. It is in the home life that the value of religion is most fully
                                tested. Here we can measure our growth in grace and learn what Christ is able to do for
                                us. If we find it easy to exhibit a Christian spirit in public and to serve Christ in
                                public, but not so easy in our home relations, we may have a good reason to question the
                                genuineness of our Christian experience. The Journal of home duties, informs us that
                                potatoes are harvested. Apples picked and the products of t the garden in the cellar.
                                Steam pipes have been laid to the dwelling of the Ministry and also to the Barn, and we
                                hope it may prove of use and be profitable in every place. A. D.

                                thousands of human beings in other countries are hurrying to escape from the flooded
                                districts, all of the New England states are suffering, more or less, from a protracted
                                drouth. Springs, rivulets and rivers are quite below the usual low water mark, and the
                                well-springs that are indispen sable in the blessing of life are fast growing less. With
                                a long winter before us, a thought of greatly increased labor is brought forward and we
                                are, at once, reminded of our finite position in nature. If the readers of the Manifesto
                                fail to observe that they are looking at the impression of a new and beautiful face
                                type, we shall recommend them to visit some oculist for defective eyesight. In 1792 the
                                Community at this place built their "Meeting House." The shingles which were placed on
                                the roof at that date, have just been removed and the house now has the adornment of a
                                new covering. Religious service has been held in the family Dwelling during the summer
                                and but few spectators have been admitted. The family Dwelling which was built in 1792
                                has also been under repairs, and with its new A 1 oven for the bakers, its new chimney
                                and eight dormer windows for the attic, it may be expected to hold its place for another
                                one hundred years. On the 12th inst. Elder Abraham Perkins and a younger Brother,�Frank
                                Theobald of Enfield, N. H., called to see their gospel friends at this place. They
                                leave for home on the morning of the 16th. Elder Abraham was for a long term of years
                                the senior Elder in the Order of Ministry, and during that time became strongly
                                identified in the general prosperity in the Society of Canterbury. We are very glad that
                                they loved us so well as to make us this pleasant visit. *</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shakers, New York" TEIform="index"/> Shakers, N.

                                apples, 270 barrels for Avinter use, and 750 barrels for vinegar. Since this month came
                                in we have bid a long farewell to two of our beloved aged friends. Sister Catherine was
                                one of six sisters, and all of them closed their days as members of our Community. All
                                were persons of integrity and fully devoted to the gospel cause. The grandmother of
                                sister Catherine was the first to embrace the faith after Mother xlnn came to America.
                                She often walked the distance of three miles to attend religious worship, and Mother Ann
                                would often say to the Sisters, "Nellie is coming, be ready to meet her." She passed
                                through severe trials as her husband was bitterly opposed to her religious faith, and
                                did all he could to prevent her from being a Believer. Sister Catherine's father and
                                mother accepted the faith of Believers, and permitted their children to do the same. J.

It seems but a few days since I was writing "Home Notes," and still it is
                                time for more. Rapidly the days are passing. Soon we shall all be where it is ever day
                                and Home Notes not needed. Since last writing we have been blest with the privilege of
                                meeting gospel friends from three of our Societies. Oct. 16th. Eldress Rosetta
                                Hendrickson and Sister Eva Larkin of Watervliet called and stopped over the Sabbath. We
                                enjoyed a beautiful meeting with them Sabbath P. M. The heavens seemed to come down to
                                us and angels of light ministered unto us. . Many soul-inspiring testimonies were borne
                                by faithful Brethren and Sis-<pb n="284" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> ters; also many of the young renewed
                                their determinations to be loyal to the cause. Just before the close of the service,
                                Eldress Rosetta spoke very impressively to the young upon the subject of obedience.
                                "Strict obedience" said she, "to our spiritual advisers and to our own conscience will
                                insure perfect happiness and safety." Though they tarried with us but a few days, we
                                felt strengthened by their presence. Hope when business calls them this way again, they
                                will not pass us by. Oct. 28th. we were again blest by meeting with two Sisters from
                                East Canterbury, Sisters Eliza A. Stratton and Mabel Liscomb. We had hardly time to get
                                acquainted and inquire after our Canterbury friends, their tarry was so short. Presume
                                they believe in the saying, "Short visits make long friends." Think Br. Pliny Worcester
                                of Sabbathday Lake must have been of the same mind, for he stopped with us hardly two
                                days. Nevertheless we were pleased with that short visit from the worthy Brother and
                                thank him (and all our gospel friends) for calling. Hope we may be privileged with other
                                calls, when there is more time to spare. The apple crop proved to be much better than
                                expected. 640 bushels have been gathered of grafted fruit. Of those made into cider for
                                vinegar there is always a plenty. Our Brethren think I should have mentioned in last
                                month's Notes, the hundred tons of corn ensilage that was raised on four acres. They
                                think it was doing pretty well for "away down east." F.

Beloved Eldek Henby:�What shall we say that will be interesting to our
                                Brethren and Sisters now that "The melancholy days are come, The saddest of the year, Of
                                wailing winds and naked woods, And meadows brown and sear?" Our fields and meadows are
                                brown and seared for want of the rain which has not yet appeared, and the wells that we
                                have always depended upon have failed, and all the water that we use has to be brought
                                from a distance. One of our old woodhouses has started on its travels out into the
                                world, having been sold to one of the neighbors. It has stood in our village for many
                                years, in neither of the rows of buildings and blocking up the street. It leaves a very
                                pleasant out-look towards the South which improves the beauty of the place. To-day a
                                letter was read in our meeting informing us that our dear Mother Eldress Ann had
                                resigned her place in the Ministry. It is now that we deeply feel what a true friend she
                                has been to us for many years. If it is so that we cannot see her again as we had hoped
                                to do, we know that she has those with her who will do all they can to soothe her
                                sufferings and administer to her every want. Our precious loving Mother the blessing of
                                all Zion rests upon you! We have lately enjoyed a very pleasant visit with beloved
                                Eldress Rosetta Henf drickson and Sister Eva Larkin of Watervliet, N. Y. They brought a

                                hands to do. The wheat threshing was finished for the season Tuesday the twenty-seventh
                                ult. No better wheat can be found in all the region round about Groveland than that
                                raised by our efficient apostle Paul R. Kingston, whose faithful services are ever in

                                secured in good time, but failed in points of perfection; all that matured are ready for
                                future disposal. Tuesday the third inst. we were favored with a very agreeable visit
                                from our friend, M. Otto Redans of Buffalo. He is a conductor on a passenger train on
                                the Erie Road from Buffalo to Dansville. For the last nine years he has passed the
                                Community twice each day on his route east and west. Since the twenty-third of last
                                month, the trains have ceased running to Dansville. Their eastern terminus now is at
                                (the city on the hill,) Mt' Morris. Mr. Redans improved the sunny day driving from town
                                to spend a few hours visiting and viewing the premises, till time to return to his
                                afternoon train. He says this is his first visit to a Shaker Community and we trust it
                                will not be the last. Well, who can tell what is more Avell than a well; well, time will
                                tell how well a well will prove. One of the great necessities of the day is a well,
                                which is now hourly attaining well proportions. Mr. William Dixon of Nunda is performing
                                the work. This is the second attempt toward well making; the first one proved to be more
                                of a gas well than a water one. At the depth of fifty feet gas was found in abundance.
                                Mr. Dixon continued drilling till one hundred and one feet were reached with poor
                                prospects of obtaining water. Another one was commenced last Friday; to-day fifty-five
                                feet is recorded with absence of water. Mr. Cook of Nunda, a non-professional, located
                                the water vein with a peach sprout. He is very positive that a flowing well will be
                                found. We earnestly hope so, time and patience will soon prove its future well being. A
                                light snow sprinkle last Thursday was the first reminder that old winter is nearing.

Hebe I come with a few items about our happy Western home, and it may
                                interest some one of the Manifesto readers. Office repairs and also those of our
                                newly-modeled horse-barn progress favorably. The Brethren finished digging potatoes on
                                Oct 9th. Had six hundred and forty bu. from 2% acres. About this time Elder O. C.
                                Hampton trims 1200 apple, pear peach and plum trees. Oct. 12th. Elder Napoleon Brown and
                                two other Brethren commence gathering winter apples; finished Oct. 15th. Had three
                                hundred bu. which are put away in the cellar. We have an abundance of squashes and
                                pumpkins which were brought from the field Oct. 16. Also raised 1684 bu. beets for the
                                milch cows this winter. I have been reading and reviewing the life of our blessed Mother
                                Ann. When we reflect and see what she was called upon to go through, the suffering and
                                abuse, it seems to me we are lacking, sadly lacking in gratitude for the homes we have
                                in this day, when she on different occasions like the Son of God had not where to rest
                                her head. All honor to her bright name! I am not ashamed to say I have a spiritual

White Water is still improving. We are taking down some old buildings which
                                makes the place look a great deal better. We are putting up a building for farm
                                implements 18x16. Farmers in this vicinity are husking corn of which we have a good
                                crop. The weather is very dry, and we need rain for small grain. Wheat does not look
                                well for this time of year. Farmers in this locality are holding on to wheat for a
                                better price. It now brings ninety cents per. bushel. We are drawing our winter wood
                                before bad weather sets in. The Center Family have remodeled their dwelling some and
                                have put a cornice<pb n="286" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> around the T. part and put on a new roof. The
                                roof is of iron. They also remodeled their Office barn, put new siding and a new roof of
                                iron on and painted it. Eldress Adeline from Pleasant Hill, Ky. paid us a nice visit on
                                the first of October. We have sold one team of horses for which we had no use, leaving
                                us two teams and a span of colts for later work. We have one rail pen filled with corn
                                containing in all about 400 bu. Cold weather is setting in, heavy frosts and cold days.
                                It is cloudy at the present writing and cold enough to stay by the fire. H. W.

H.</head><p TEIform="p"> Nov. 15, 1891. Dear Editok:�We have been abroad for a few days on a mission, hence this
                                delay in writing, and one of these days very fortunately, chanced to be the first
                                meeting of the National W. C. T. U. Convention, which we gladly attended. Noble women,
                                not only of America but from across the great waters were there assembled in earnest
                                prayerful work: and all among our people, who are interested in every movement that
                                helps to evangelize the world, have no doubt, kept well informed through the daily
                                papers. The opening prayer, the Annual Address, the White Eibbon Hymn, written for the
                                Convention, all spoke grandly for the glorious work which is being slowly but surely
                                accomplished by these handmaidens of the Lord. The half hour of devotional exercise at
                                the close was impressive, during which, was shown in language plain, our great need of a
                                prayerful spirit in daily service, corresponding or rather in divine accord, with the
                                words of our Mother, Ann Lee, "Hands at work, and hearts to God.'' The speaker said, "We
                                must all believe that we have a Heavenly Father, who knows best if our selfish prayers
                                should be answered, just as the parent knows, when the child wants a carving knife to
                                play with, it is not best," very true, but here is the point which seemed a little
                                incongruous; "He is cleaning house now, everything is tossed up." Now we never knew an
                                earthly father who wished to take upon himself this responsibility, have even heard of
                                those who sought other quarters until this distasteful but all-together needful work was
                                entirely done; "First that which is natural, then that which is spiritual." Now it
                                stands to reason that the Heavenly Mother, is at the head of this house-cleaning
                                business, which our English sister so truthfully said was in progress, and if
                                "everything is tossed up" it will surely take a mother's hand to bring order out of
                                chaos. "O there,11 be a song of triumph When the battle clays are o'er, When the house
                                is set in order, And the tempter conies no more. When with purity of purpose, Thy whole
                                life to God is given, All the world cannot contain it! It will rise for joy to heaven!"
                                This fact was so clearly apparent in her address, that we wondered if others' in the
                                audience not of our Order, did not have a ray of conviction in this wise; we whispered
                                it to the sister who sat next to us, who was the President of one of England's great
                                colleges, and write these few words, hoping it may prove as seed, which perchance, may
                                fall upon the right soil for germination, indeed, it seems the next step in the onward
                                march of our brave sisters abroad. Next time we will write more about home affairs. Love
                                to all from all. E. B.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Tribute of love for sister Marcia E. Astings" TEIform="index"/> A Tribute of Love for Sister

At that
                            date it was in a very secluded situation, being intended as a retreat, or as a hiding place
                            for Ireland, as he was persecuted for the testimony which he preached. The house was raised
                            in the night, to avoid the company that would be present if the work was done during the
                            cla}T. The proprieters did not even permit their children to know when the house was to be
                            built. Those engaged in the work, so far as can be ascertained, were David Hoar, Malabor
                            Bean, Isaac Willard, Abel Jewett, Samuel and Jonathan Cooper, Ethan Phillips, John Manor and
                            Zaccheus Stephens. A few others may have given contributions. Ireland contributed only by
                            his labor, as he had a family in Cambridge, Mass., but these he left in an obscure manner to
                            escape from his persecutors. The house had a square roof, surmounted by a cupola. This was
                            used as a watch-tower, that they could the more easily detect the approach of any stranger.
                            From the cupola there was a secret trap door, and a run of stairs by the side of the chimney
                            which led to the cellar. This passage had no other entrance, except at the cupola or in the
                            cellar, and these were so carefully constructed as not to be noticed. When the Elders
                            arrived at the Square House, Samuel Cooper and his family, consisting of four persons, held
                            it in charge. There was also present two aged women, the followers of Ireland. Mother Ann
                            was well acquainted with the place and the people, so soon as slie entered the dwelling, as
                            it had all been shown to her, in vision, before she left England. The followers of Shadrach
                            Ireland had accepted his religious doctrine with implicit confidence, and as he had
                            testified to tlieui that he should never die, they believed at the time of his death, that
                            it was only for a few days, when he would rise again to dwell on the earth forever. His
                            death occurred in 1780. As the reanimation of life delayed its return, his body was placed
                            in the cellar. It is not known how long it remained there, but from the odor that permeated
                            the house, it aroused a suspicion among those who visited the premises that a corpse must be
                            the cause. Everything concerning Ireland was conducted, by his followers with the utmost
                            secrecy. They seldom spoke his name, but called him ilThe Man." His body was now removed
                            from the cellar in the darkness of the night and buried in a corn field, but a few rods
                            distant. To add to the mystery of the scene, five hills of corn were carefully removed, and
                            after the burial, as carefully returned to their several places,<pb n="288" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/> where
                            they grew during the summer and in the autumn yielded a golden harvest. Tho deed of the
                            Square House and the adjoining farm had been given to Ireland, to be held as consecrated
                            property by those who contributed to the building of the house and to the purchasing of the
                            farm, and to their successors in the faith. After the decease of Ireland, David Hoar and his
                            spiritual helper Malabar Bean assumed the right to be the directtors. Hoar was an able and
                            influential man while his helper was a wealthy and designing woman. They occupied the Square
                            House less than two years, when Hoar was arrested and placed in jail for refusing to pay the
                            Minister's tax. Malabar left about the same time, and did not return. Aaron Jewett went to
                            live at the Square House in 1783, and was the director of the family at the time the Elders
                            arrived at Harvard. The Believers were so interested in the place that they proposed to
                            purchase the property, but encountered several obstacles, on account of the peculiar manner
                            in which the property was obtained. Thomas Robbins, a son-in-law of Ireland claimed the
                            property as the lawful heir, and from him the Believers were obliged to obtain it. The
                            property was valued at $570.00. Of this amount the Elders contributed 144.17. The balance
                            was given as a free-will offering by some thirty contributors. After it came into the
                            possession of the Believers, it was proposed to call it "Mother's House." The deed was taken
                            by Br. Aaron Jewett, who was appointed the first Trustee of the Church at Harvard, Mass. It
                            is still preserved at that place. We have no doubt that holy angels and justified spirits
                            have respect to the dwelling, as this agrees with the testimony of all good Believers who
                            visit it, and even those who are not of the faith have acknowledged that a heavenly
                            influence pervades the place.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Coming era" TEIform="index"/> THE COMING ERA.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anderson, M.

                            leave behind the habits and practices befitting the lower rudimental stage of development.

                            forms to perfect the productions of earth; and as science labors continually to develop and
                            refine plant-life ; should not human beings give more attention to the rational
                            consideration of the material that goes into the physical laboratory, out of which grows and
                            is sustained the organic system, "the house in which we live?" whose varied powers and
                            functions receive their energy and life from the elements, spiritual and material, which
                            surround us ; in the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. Climatic
                            changes have much to do<pb n="289" id="p27" TEIform="pb"/> with man's cravings ; still a greater
                            influence has long accustomed habit; that is the chain that binds him to appetites which
                            rule instead of reason ; and a positive knowledge of what is for his best good. The glutton,
                            like the drunkard, stimulates his abnormal tastes and vitiated appetites, until his
                            overworked and worn-out system rebels, and the many ills he has generated, culminates in
                            some terrible malady, and he comes to an untimely end: dies a fool for want of simple
                            understanding and power of self-restraint, which might have prolonged his days in health and
                            happiness ; thus thousands die annually. "Man needs but little were his judgment true,
                            Nature is frugal and her wants are few, Those few wants answered bring sincere delights, But
                            fools create themselves new appetites." The wonderful cereals that thrive so beautifully
                            under the sunny skies of spring and summer, with their corresponding luscious fruits, afford
                            ample food for blood, brain and muscle. Mother-earth yields enough for all, and in the years

                            forms of life have become extinct; so in the higher stages of development, different species
                            of animals will pass to oblivion, because man shall not need them either for food or use, he
                            shall be no more their servant nor consumer. God's holy chosen people, who sustain pure
                            angelic relations in their intercourse between the sexes, will rise superior to connection
                            with the generative animal creation, and will only hold such as they absolutely need as
                            beasts of burden ; and we may see the time when these can be dispensed with, as electricity
                            becomes utilized in all the fields of labor. Their employment will be to till the soil, and
                            raise grain and fruit, mingled with other occupations suited to a more interior spiritual
                            life, in which the esthetical shall not be ignored ; use and beauty shall harmonize in their
                            relations ; physical, mental and spiritual culture will be the result. Bright visions of the
                            near future open before us, when grand revelations of truth shall quicken our perceptions
                            and mould our lives more in the likeness of Divinity, from whose life we derive life, and
                            toward whose perfection we are tending. Mount Lebanon, N.

                                but of much more importance that the disciple understand the true meaning of the gospel
                                and learn to apply the principles to daily life. He that said "I am the Eesurrection and
                                the life," had no reference to the reanimation of the human body, of which it is
                                recorded, "Dust thou art, and unto dust slialt thou return," for "He that believeth on
                                me, though he were dead, (physically) yet shall he live," (spirit-<pb n="290" id="p28" TEIform="pb"/>
                                ually) indicates the possibility of soul growth after death. "He that loseth his life
                                for my sake shall find it" does not imply the necessity of crucifying or taking of human
                                life in order to rise with Christ in the Resurrection and inherit eternal life. The
                                crucifixion of Jesus, was the result of wicked persecution, just as all the advocates of
                                truth have been persecuted since that time. ''The flesh lusteth against the spirit" and
                                took the life of the first-born Son of God hoping to extinguish the light of gospel
                                truth, for which Jesus came to bear Avitness, but "God's ways are not man's ways," as He
                                makes persecution an instrument in his hands for creating thought and investigation
                                which result in a religious awakening and the conversion of souls. The life of Christ
                                accepted by any human being will bring the world of sin and selfishness to an end,
                                individually speaking. This seems to create considerable anxiety in the mind of the
                                natural man and woman. What will become of the world? not �What shall I do to be saved
                                to-day from the sins of the world? is the all-important theme. "The children of the
                                Resurrection neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels in heaven."
                                Then if the life of Christ is the Resurrection, only those who live as the angels in
                                heaven are his disciples, for "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made
                                alive." Judging by their fruits, which is the only criterion for a Christian, Adam has
                                more followers than Jesus Christ, which is not speaking very well of the nineteenth
                                century as a progressive Christian age We should be quite unwilling to till the soil or
                                adopt any of the old methods of performing hand labor on the farm or in the shop, that
                                were in use even one hundred, much less five hundred years ago, and still this is what
                                most people are doing in moral and religious life. If religion means anything, it should
                                be a practical application of those principles which will create a heaven on earth,
                                where peace purity, truth and love reign in every heart. This will constitute the
                                millennium�the Resurrection of the soul. Some of the Shakers and Spiritualists claim
                                that the different parties to whom Jesus appeared after death were simply gifted as
                                visionists. Some will say, "Why did Jesus not appear as an angel?" Because the disciples
                                being natural must see him as he was on earth, in order to believe that he was the same
                                Jesus who had been crucified, and it is equally difficult for the natural man of to-day
                                to believe and obey the gospel of Christ, which creates a wonderful transformation or
                                resurrection from the dead works of sin. Canterbury, N.

                            pure, We want a treasure at the last, Both permanent and sure. We cannot live on selfish
                            gain, We cannot live on trust, We must have the solid grain, We cannot live on husks, Give
                            us the bread and wine that's new, And waters pure and fresh, That we the journey may pursue,
                            Till we reach the eternal rest. O may we never weary grow, Or think the way too hard, The
                            higher up the grade we go, The greater the reward. And brighter scenes appear in view, As
                            onward we progress, Eternal blessings ever new, And robes of righteousness. We see beyond

                            to give our all, To receive a just reward. In silent hours of calm repose, We wander to that
                            home above, And have a partial glimpse of those, We once so dearly loved. What peace and
                            rest and joys sublime, Are treasured for the wise, Who leave all earthly joys behind, And
                            seek the heavenly prize. Where sweet humility and prayer, Love, peace and joy abound, True
                            charity is ever there, And watchers guard around. No enemy can enter there, To mar our
                            inward joy; Our long eternal home is where No tempest can destroy. May wisdom ever guide our
                            way, In thee our all-we trust; May we our sacred call obey, For it is true and just. True
                            meekness and a gentle hand, May we in truth extend to all, And aid the youth to firmly stand
                            An honor to their sacred call. That when life's journey here shall end, We may depart in
                            peace, And leave a blessing with our friends, That will eternally increase, In faith and
                            hope and love divine, And every blessing given, To give us strength while here in time, And
                            lead us safe to heaven. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>Deaths.

                                power, to his understanding of human nature. Frederick Bly, the blind phrenologist, well

                                for editoral capacity, and is a very readable sketch of experience and observations that

                                Science in Education is a well written article for skeptics to ponder. The Essential of
                                Early Education is from the pen of an eminent teacher, and in the same department the
                                Journal's English correspondent, Jennie Chappell, pleasantly describes a very well
                                managed nursery and child's hospital in London. The always welcome, because well

                                Sins Against Health is by the author of The Talent of Motherhood, an article that
                                received not a little attention a few months ago, and Father Kneipp's System of Cure
                                tells of a famous Bavarian Sanitarian. A good paper, Is Hypnotism Harmful? comes from a
                                subject of thirteen years' experience and is unique in its way. The editor discusses
                                somewhat ironically That Criminal Type that some scientists are trying to create, and
                                also Convict Labor and Mutual Life Benefit Associations. Price of the number, 15 cents.

Do you not wish to save
money, clothes, time, labor, fuel
and health, if possible? All
these can be saved by the use
of Dobbins' Electric Soap. Try
it once. We say this, knowing that if you try it once, you
will always use it. Is it economy to save one, two, or three
cents on the price of a bar of
soap,
and lose  five dollars or
more, in ruined, tender, rotted
clothing spoiled by the strong
soda, in the soap? Washing
powders, concentrated lye and
cheap soaps are low-priced, to
be sure, but they are terribly
expensive, taking ruined clotting into account.
Dobbins'    Electric Soap
        preserves clothes washed
 with it.     Bleaches white
 ones, brightens colored
ones. Softens flannels and blankets, and
contains nothing to injure the most delicate fabric. Ask your grocer for it. Take
nothing else in its place. Eead carefully
all that is said on the two wrappers and
see that our name is on each.
