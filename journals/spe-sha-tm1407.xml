POX'S
BOOK OF MARTYRS"
contains many frightful stories of most agonizing suffering. But
nothing, either in story
or picture, can be more distressful than the
sharp, severe, shooting pains daily and nightly
endured by those who are martyrs to that most
terrible torment, Neuralgia. To get rid of this
martyrdom is the llrst business of all who suffer.
Atiilophoros regenerates painful nerves,
and drives out the horrors of Neuralgia.
Atiixophoros gives health to Rheumatic
sufferers whom the most skillful physicians
have not been able to heal.
Atiilophobos operates on the blood, muscles, and joints; and dissolving the acids that
cause Rheumatism, removes them from the
system.
Athlophoros is pronounced by all who
have tried it an infallible specific for these
obstinate and painful diseases.
Read the testimony of one of the
sufferers. David Little, Sumner, Benner Co., Iowa, writes:
" I am past 77 years of age, have had the Rheumatism
three years and eight months; lost one-third of my
weight; could not walk, but shuffled along on
crutches; could not sleep; nerves shattered, no
strength in my hands, wrists, knees or feet. But
thanks be to God for your great discovery! The medicine arrived Saturday night. I took a dose Sunday
morning, felt it all over me, and kept on with it.
Monday morning I got up and dressed myself, and
walked out into the kitchen without the aid of crutch
or cane, and wished them all a happy New Year. I rest
well nights, am gaining in Ftrength, and once more
enjoy life. Wish I could rut Athlophoeos in the
hands of every sufferer frcm this terrible disease."
If you cannot get Athlophoeos of your druggist,
�we will send it express paid, on receipt of regular
price�one dollar per bottle. \Ve prefer that you buy
it from your druggist, but if he hasn't it, do not be
persuaded to try something else, but order at once
from us as directed.

                            perhaps we may be permitted to relate a mission we once made with J. S. T. On a morning in
                            August we started from our place, to visit a Quaker meeting, at Mass. We arrived there about
                            10 A. M. They are situated in a plain, retired village and employ themselves mostly by
                            agriculture. Arriving there and seeing the numbers already gathered, and still others
                            flocking in, we asked how the multitude were to be fed, sheltered and lodged, and how their
                            teams were to be cared for ! Every dwelling was a house of entertainment. Every barn, with
                            its ample store, was thrown open to the beasts of the stall. Chambers and beds were amply
                            provided for residents, brethren and sisters from afar, and the wayfaring sojourner, who
                            chose to tarry within their gates. As it was my first visit we were close observers. The
                            proprietors were happy in serving ; they gladly welcomed and entertained all. We learned
                            that such expenses are shared by all who should and do attend the meeting. As we gazed upon
                            the beautiful scene before us, we were forcibly reminded of similar gatherings among the
                            tribes of Israel, in other days. History informs tis, that at the Yearly Feasts of the
                            Jewish Commonwealth, when the trumpet announced the glad tidings that the great gathering
                            for confession, sacrifice and atonement was about to commence, all business was promptly
                            suspended, and in the better days of this chosen people, they arrayed their spirits in the
                            beauty of humility and devotion, to meet the God of their Fathers at his holy temple,
                                where<pb n="146" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> an army of Priests stood ready to meet the people, hear their
                            confessions and receive the immense herd of beasts driven from all parts of the kingdom,
                            without blemish, to be sacrificed without price, as food for Priest and people. The spirit
                            which ran through the host at that period, brought down the aristocracy upon a level with
                            the poorest. These very sacrifices coming from all quarters, published to beholders, where
                            all had come short, softened all hearts, awakened contrition and brought down all exalted
                            feelings. Every habitation throughout the kingdom, was, for the time being, turned into a
                            house of entertainment, as they passed to and from the altars of the temple, which leveled
                            all ranks into the beautiful spirit of consecration. Having secured our earthly resting
                            place, we all repaired to a plain, neat meeting house, which was well rilled. J. and the
                            Avriter were invited to be seated with the more prominent members in front. The Elders
                            occupied a place in front of the congregation, which numbered eleven brethren and thirteen
                            sisters. A board partition unpainted, divided the assembly in time of public service; the
                            women occupied the left, the men the right. In private meetings, another partition is run
                            up, which completely separates the sexes. About one hour was taken up by Elders, Eldresses
                            and people, in exhortation and prayer. At length a preacher from the East arose and
                            delivered a sermon, which stands second to none we ever listened to in eloquence and beauty.
                            He dealt largely in the scriptures, and his pictorial illustrations were so life-like, lie
                            could make the hearers almost see what he talked about. Their theology embraces the
                            atonement for sin, washing in the blood of the Lamb for regeneration; while they claim, that
                            Jesus had such a superabundance of righteousness, that he could furnish an outfit for the
                            whole human family. At 8. P. M. we were dismissed, with a request that all members attend
                            promptly to other meetings ; while outsiders present were invited still to attend, and to
                            bring other friends with them and to take part in the worship. We now retired for dinner. We
                            were pleased to observe that their dining rooms, tables and other fixtures were built with
                            particular reference to these gatherings, and in simplicity, quite similar to Believers.
                            Their bill of fare was ample. Dinner over, we passed into the sitting rooms. The one we had
                            entered for rest was well filled ; amongthe number, was one of their most talkative
                            ministers. He directly entered into conversation with us, and suddenly put these questions
                            fairly :�" Please allow me to ask, how you look upon the standing of Jesus ? How is he
                            connected with the Godhead? What was his mission to our race ? " We wTere now fairly in for
                            some of the most radical questions he could ask. It must be remembered, that J. is a Quaker.
                            We came on his invitation. There were many interested listeners, but we answered as best we
                            could under the circumstances. My friend, we came among you determined, neither to introduce
                            our theology nor interfere with yours. He now stated, that he once met two of our brethren
                            in the cars, while traveling in the west, who informed him that the Shakers considered Jesus
                            as a man, a preacher with higher light. This broke the bands.<pb n="147" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>We found
                            he had an honest motive in his questions, and we replied. We consider Jesus " as the
                            faithful and true witness ;" but a man born of a woman, with an organization capable of
                            receiving and teaching all that was required for the salvation of the race. If you claim
                            that he had a miraculous birth, we shall have no controversy on it. He then introduced God
                            as the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. We indorsed this, and asked if the Quakers did not
                            believe that these were three males, which they did not deny, we answered ;�A father always
                            supposes a mother, a son certainly does, and if the Scriptures are correct, there certainly
                            is a mother. When God was ready, He said to some one connected with Him, tbLet us make man
                            in Our image, after Our likeness, and let them have dominion over all the earth. So God
                            created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him, male and female created He
                            them, and called their name, Adam.

                            divides Them from Canaan's happy ground. Thousands have been impatient To find a passage
                            through, And with united wisdom, Have try'd what they could do ; But vessels built by human
                            skill, Have never sailed far, Till we found them aground, On some dreadful sandy bar. The
                            everlasting gospel Has launch'd the deep at last; Behold her sails extended Around the

                            Here we sail, you may rail, But we'll soon be out of sight. We're now on the wide ocean,
                            We've bid the world farewell, And where we shall cast anchor, No human tongue can tell:
                            About our future destiny, There need be no debate, While we ride on the tide, With our

                            prove transient; and, some teachings, that, in one age of human life pass for philosophy in
                            an advanced age are proved to be but sophistry ; but, Truth remains! The sources of truth's
                            manifestations or discoveries are two fold�revelation, through inspired media, and the
                            researches of human reason. In all a^es<pb n="148" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> of human history, there have
                            been, through these sources, discoveries of measures of truth, both in relation to
                            philosophies applicable to science and art, also to God, and the affinitive relations of man
                            to his Creator, and his fellow beings, spiritually, affectionally, and sympathetically. And,
                            though, in every age there has been, and still is, a vast amount of idealism which is simply
                            speculative, therefore, destined to pass away, yet there have been measures of solid truth
                            revealed and discovered which is as unchangeable as the orbits of the heavenly bodies ; or
                            as the institutions of day and night. Passing away is impressed on all mutable, material
                            ^.things ; and, as human progress discovers errors in speculative and ideal philosophies,
                            properly termed sophistries, the excitable temperament of the human mind is such, that, with
                            some constitutions, there is a tendency, under the influence of discovered errors, to doubt
                            the existence of truth in any supposed and generally accepted revelation, or discovery of
                            philosophic truth ; and, under a very ardent stimulus for change, some people are ready to
                            condemn all degrees of conservatism, seeming to conceive the notion that mankind have no
                            substantial basis of truth on which to rely, either in religion or philosophy ; while the
                            fact remains, that all truth stands firmly amid the ravages of time, the demoralizations of
                            dissipation, and the wreck of worlds, or the new discoveries of science. The fundamental
                            principles of the Law of God revealed to, through, and by Moses, and recognized by Jesus.�
                            i'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with
                            all thy might; and thy neighbor as thyself."'�A law of Love to right doing, is a basis of
                            life character necessary to human happiness that is securely and sacredly stored in the
                            archives of the tabernacle of God; unchangeable as the Eternal Throne! And the myriad
                            collateral ramifications of the principle of love to humanity and to God that have been
                            evolved from this fountain, and disbursed to humanity in theological requisitions, many of
                            which are interwoven into the fabrics of human creeds of theology, are measures of truth
                            that are unchangeable, though, as a whole, these creeds may be quite untenable. Inspired
                            media,�ascetics and recluses, have existed in all ages ; as Noah, Abraham, Moses, John the
                            Baptist, Jesus, and a nameless host; these, prompted by the inspirations and illuminations
                            of truth to them vouchsafed, as a fruit of their separation from the herd of humanity, and
                            honest devotional seeking to God; for truth and wisdom, have been, in varied degrees,
                            shining lights and conservators of truth and wisdom, and dispensers of the same to the human
                            family ; and the truths they enunciated have been blessings to our race, and they are as
                            eternal as God is true. No new discoveries ot truth theologically or scientifically
                            obtained, can obliterate the manifestations and principles of truth previously revealed. A
                            class of philosophers and scientists have been raised up from time to time, as Archimedes,.
                            Copernicus, Newton, and others, too numerous to mention, of both more ancient and modern
                            date, who have discovered principles of philosophic and scientific truth, that no progress
                            of humanity can ever justly gainsay, or eradicate. <pb n="149" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> Spirits of superior
                            dignity, and minds of the largest ability and capacity to search for, perceive, and acquire
                            truth and wisdom, have been, and ever will be, oracles to the masses, unto whom, as teachers
                            of truth, the multitudes of the human family ever will, and must, necessarily seek, as
                            teachers, and attach themselves as scholars and dependents, Noah, Abraham, Moses, John the
                            Baptist, Jesus, and successors, many have been teachers of righteousness whose enunciations
                            of truth, in measures adapted to the day and times in which they lived, and links in the
                            vast chain of truth's revelations that shall embelt the world ; and their revelations of
                            truth can never be ignored, justly, because they are steps in the march of human progress.
                            The Noachian dispensation of righteousness was a school for the masses of that dispensation
                            ; in like manner were the dispensations of Abraham, Moses and Jesus. The Christian
                            dispensation is a school, and of its scholars some are constitutionally organized with
                            capacities as teachers ; others as scholars ai-id learners of them, while, in turn, they are
                            also learners of teachers in advance of them ; thus, on in gradations, up to the Eternal
                            Throne.' The Christ Spirit and baptism is the Master in the Christian School! This Jesus
                            beautifully taught as a government of God, through ft vicegerency,�A Theocracy. Thus, " I
                            came not to do my own will, but the will of Him that sent me." John, vi., 38. "I can of mine
                            own self do nothing ; as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine
                            own will, but the will of the Father which sent me." John, v., 30. "And the Father, himself,
                            which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. " John, v., 37. "One is your master, even
                            Christ, and all ye are brethren." Matt, xxiii., 8, 10. This same government of God through
                            mediation of the Christ Spirit was also beautifully taught as a theocracy by the Ministers
                            of the testimony of Christ's Second Appearing, Ann and William Lee, as manifest on the
                            following occasion. One Col. Smith came to see the Elders at David Meacham's, in Enfield,
                            Ct. He asked, "Is there not a woman here that is the head of the Church?" Mother Ann
                            replied, "Nay, Christ is the head of the Church." Elder William Lee also said. " We do not
                            allow man nor woman to be the head of the Church." "But" (said Smith,) "there is a woman
                            here that teaches, is there not?" Elder William replied, "We must not suffer man nor woman
                            to teach, except they have the spirit of Christ in them, and then either man or woman may
                            teach. " But, while Christ's Church is in the state and capacity of the Church militant,
                            that is, of the Kingdom of Heaven Order " like a net cast into the sea, that gathers of
                            every kind, which, when it is drawn ashore, men gather the good into vessels, but cast the
                            bad away,'' there will be in it some who do not have the Spirit of Christ in them ; and, of
                            course, could not, with propriety, be authorized to teach, nor exercise government in a
                            democratic sense. And, when all the members of the Church of Christ are fully redeemed from
                            all that is not of the Christ spirit, the baptism of the Father and Mother,� God, they will
                            then be in the Father and the Father in them ; and not be " many masters" but their united
                            ministrations will be a full and complete government<pb n="150" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>of God, as the
                            Church triumphant over all the powers and passions that work divisions among men. This will
                            be a perfect Theocracy,�A Church not ruled of man nor woman, but by the Christ Spirit�The
                            Vicegerency of God ! Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            sacrifices, can, agreeably, to the inspired voice, live without incurring the penalty of
                            actual transgression. Whatever may have been our trials or temptations on the journey of
                            life, we have the privilege to turn from that which is evil, and in the spirit of the
                            Savior, " Go and sin no more." "My Savior, 0 I love thy life, So free from guile and stain,
                            Thy innocence and purity My adoration claim. " From this comes an inspiration to work for a
                            spiritual interest, to work for our salvation. It needs to be a system into which Believers
                            should bring their whole lives. It should be in prayer, in love and in earnest working for
                            the protection and prosperity of all who are ready to give their lives to God. The spiritual
                            should have as much care, if not more than the temporal. The children of this world are the
                            children of the temporal kingdom, and Jesus has told us that they were wTiser in their
                            generation, than are the children of light. They make more sacrifice and work with more zeal
                            to secure the treasures of this life, than professing Christians do to secure the treasures
                            of the Kingdom of God. In the affairs of daily life, the occupations of the hour, each has
                            his respective duties, and we look with earnest expectation for every person to act
                            faithfully in the part to him assigned. In the spiritual wo:k each one should occupy, as
                            faithfully, a place of equal responsibility. "Seek first the Kingdom of God. " How many of
                            us on rising in the morning and planning our business for the day, make equally as essential
                            the spiritual labors that shall cover the same time? It should be " Hands at work and heart
                            to God. " Had this been made as imperative as the duties of the d'-xy we might have been
                            made doubly satisfied by receiving the blessings of the temporal and spiritual interests at
                            the same time. Even our seasons for Avorship would have been abundantly fruitful in good
                            gifts. Our lives also should be so unfolded to the light that we could willingly and
                            confidently present the record of them to our Brethren and Sisters and this record should be
                            that of honest, faithful souls, those who are called to live in the light. This should be a
                            distinguishing feature by which our Church could be clearly recognized. Jesus in speaking of
                            his disciples has said, " Ye are the light of the world. " " No man hideth his light under a
                            bushel." With this gift all are made ministers of the word of God, ministers of truth,
                            ministers of light and salvation. Let us wait on our ministry Avhereunto we are called, and
                            devote our might, mind and strength to the service of the Lord. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="One of the greatest of all mental pleasures..." TEIform="index"/>

                            blessing down in greater or less degree upon its subjects. We may not be able to do great
                            deeds of goodness, yet many little deeds, like grains of sand or drops of water, make the
                            mountain of God's Holiness, and the boundless oceati of his mercy. Inasmuch as we arc
                            steadfast in obedience to our understanding of God's work, manifesting by a living example
                            its efficacy, thus leading others to enquire of the doctrine, are we not working for
                            Christ's kingdom? When we can lead another soul from darkness to light, by forgiving seventy
                            times seven, in one day and cheerfnlly working on and with them unto final resurrection in
                            good works, are we not doing for Christ through one of his little ones? "Whosoever shall
                            give a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall
                            not lose his reward. " Cold water has its peculiar refreshing qualities, and is, perhaps, as
                            simple an offering as could be bestowed. Our Savior used it symbolically to show that small
                            gifts and sacrifices are acceptable, when they are all we are capacitated to do or give. The
                            widow's mite wrought the greatest blessing to the giver, of all who put into the treasury of
                            the Lord at that time ; because cheerfully given though it was her all,�her whole living.
                            Even so is our all without reserve asked of us, in sacrifice,�the daily surrender of selfish
                            loves and appetites. while we bestow the kind word, look or deed which shall be as cups of

                            a recent issue of the Dietetic Reformer, Mr. R. Bailey Walker, Scc'y of the Vegetarian
                            Society, kindly gave me your address, and said he thought you would give any information I
                            might ask for�I refer to the Shaker settlement of which you are a member. From what I
                            understand of your ideas, the Settlement must have arrived at a state of high civilization.
                            Of course, a Community holding and practicing the principles of vegetarianism and religious
                            celibacy, would be, in the present state of society, far in advance of the most civilized
                            nation. I wish I had known of your Settlement in 1881, when I passed four months in the
                            States. For several years, I have been a Vegetarian, and for nearly fourteen years a total
                            abstainer from the poison alcohol. Nearly half my life has been passed in active opposition
                            to the drinking custom of society. My age is twenty seven, and have never been married. My
                            business life has been passed in a fruit store. I have an intense desire to live and work in
                            a society composed as yours appears to be. The institutions of your country, I have admired
                            for years, and am really American in heart, though English by birth. How I would like to
                            know whether you admit into your Community, outsiders who are prepared to bring their life
                            into harmony with your principles. Any information you can give me, I shall be grateful for.
                            I would send a stamped envelop for reply, only our stamps would not be of use in the States.
                            Hoping to hear from you, at your earliest convenience, with best wishes for the success and
                            happiness of your Community, I remain faithfully yours, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Ward, Herbert I." TEIform="persName"/> Herbert I.

                            stumps upon it. It was not properly directed�I hasten to reply� Of course, I am interested
                            in you. Hope you will come and see what God hath wrought. Your Temperance views and
                            Vegetarianism are so far a preparation for our Order. I am under the impression that there
                            are many people in England who, if they knew of our existence, would come like doves to the
                            windows. Yet, it is only fair and right that you should know that we are not yet, as an
                            Order, Vegetarian. When I joined the Society, fifty three years ago, the Order, was neither
                            Vegetarian nor Temperance. Twenty five years ago, our eighteen<pb n="153" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>
                            Societies, became Temperance orders, and also took one step towards Vegetarianism,
                            discontinued the use of Pork. True, many individuals became Vegetarian. In the North Family,
                            where I reside, we have for many years, set two tables, one pure Vegetarian, the other use
                            meat, moder-ately, once a day, except Sabbath day. When founded, the Society adopted
                            Community of goods, Celibacy and Peace, or non-resistance. In other respects, the members
                            brought in, with them, the common habits of the country. The whole American nation were
                            dyspeptic. They ate superfine white bread to produce constipation, and took Brandreth Pills,
                            by the ton, to overcome and remove constipation. By this process, Doctors and Druggists were
                            largely benefited, and Pill makers became millionaires. Your Vegetarianism would ruin all
                            the classes who live by making and vending medicine. Is that right? Please consider the
                            error of your ways, seek peace and ensue it. An aged brother informed me that he heard Ann
                            Lee say, the time would come that her people would not eat meat. All her teaching was
                            prophetic�She expected her successors to be better Christians than she was. Jesus did the
                            same�'� The works that I do, ye shall do also, and greater works than these shall ye do."
                            How could that be if he had been God the Creator? As an Order, we are in a travel�We have
                            passed through one Cycle of seven. The testimony of the first Cycle was, as I have stated,
                            Community, Celibacy, Peace. The testimony of the second Cycle will be, in addition to these,
                            Temperance in drink and Vegetarianism in food, and a scientific dress. Come and help us and
                            open the way for others who are like minded, and we will help you and do you good. You have
                            advocated temperance among a people who drink to drown care. First remove the care. Take no
                            thought what ye shall eat or drink, but seek first the Kingdom of Heaven and its
                            righteousness, wherein all these things�food, clothing, labor, houses, lands, shall be an
                            hundred fold, so abundant that the danger is, with these, uuthankfulness, nnappreciation.
                            The windows of Heaven are opened until there be no room to receive. This is not poetry,
                            fiction, but simple fact. Why then are there not more Shakers ? For the same reason there
                            are not more Total abstainers, more Vegetarians. They speak evil of you because ye run not
                            with them to the same excess of riot in sensual indulgences. Can a person who drinks tea,
                            coffee, wine, liquors of various kinds, relish water? Can a high liver relish simple food?
                            There must be, first, conviction of the right, then a daily cross, until appetite is
                            changed. " I see the right, and I approve it too; I see the wrong,-and still the wrong
                            pursue. " Until a change of heart takes place, there is no form nor comeliness in Christ
                            that a man or woman should desire him. After that, Christ is altogether lovely. Is it not so
                            ? Christ means the highest form of Spiritual Truth. Please write me about yourself, your
                            Family, Religious views, etc. Have you ever worked on the land ? Any information about the
                            move of things in the inner life of the people, will be interesting. Have you any thought of

                            thought is contained in these few words. Be not overcome of evil. Let not evil take
                            possession of your spirit. We should not yield to any form of temptation that may present
                            itself to our mind. Whenever the adversary whispers some excuse, some pretext for doing
                            wrong, we must not be deceived and overcome of that evil. We should not be overcome of evil
                            thoughts, either low cravings, in ourselves, or jealous surmisings of others. Neither with
                            evil speaking, insinuations and inuendos. When wesire tempted to say aught that will detract
                            from the truth, or in any way to enlarge more than is strictly truth, if in any point we
                            yield, we are overcome of evil. The Apostle says, " Be ye not overcome of evil. " What shall
                            we do? "Overcome evil with good. " How ? By resisting every impulse and tendency, which, if
                            followed would lead us to do wrong. To resist effectually, is to put down all temptation
                            when first presented, and not yield in any degree. This is the way we can overcome evil with
                            good. When an evil thought is presented, cast it aside and call some good idea to our aid,
                            fix our thoughts on some object worthy of our strife. If we would speak evil, then utter no
                            word, but those of love and blessing. When tempted to take one step in a wrong direction,
                            take more to do a kindness to another. If those around are annoyed or perplexed, then speak
                            soothingly, and not add to their burdens. Finally, be true to our own souls, and confess the
                            least departure from that which is good, thus mortify the evil nature within. By constantly
                            practicing these things, we shall not be " overcome of evil, " but eventually become able to
                            '' overcome evil with good. " Canterbury, N.

Besides giving us an insight into our
                            characters, they will if properly improved enable us to advance an,d attain every degree of
                            excellence. Discipline and trial if rightly met and borne will create the only true love
                            element in the soul; and love will make affection and affections bring home. It is a
                            wonderfully mistaken idea that the blessing of home alone is found in some magnificent
                            edifice whose towering lieight and ornamental architecture attracts the vision far and wide.
                            If love and affection constitutes the true home then we may find it in the log cabin of the
                            wilderness as in the mansions of the most gorgeous character, where fortune upon fortune
                            have been expended to feed the fancy of the pleasure seeker. If home is where there are
                            friends to love us, bound by the ties of affection, then we can find it in the quiet retreat
                            of the little village, as well as in the midst of turmoil and strife of the great
                            Metropolis. Reason teaches that home in its true sense and meaning implies contentment and
                            love. Where each other in turn are greeted by welcome feelings and an assurance that no
                            deception or caste is underlying the true spirit. It is welcome Brother, welcome Sister, to
                            your home again. It is meeting Brother and Sister with a salutation of good morning or
                            evening in meeting or parting. It is love where selfishness has wholly been extracted, and
                            in our heart lies as deep a love for our neighbor as for ourselves.

                            the buffetings and vexations which they encounter in their vigorous efforts to execute
                            justice and righteousness. You may not know their wrestlings iu prayer for wisdom to adjust
                            and conciliate, counsel and admonish, especially if required to deal with refractory,
                            unprincipled, disloyal subjects, vexing to the very marrow. Remember to be merciful that ye
                            may obtain mercy. Place yourself mentally in their trying situation ; measure, compare,
                            weigh. Would you probably do better under similar circumstances? Would you like to meet what
                            you are measuring to them? There may be a turning of tables by some mystic providence, and
                            you be brought into a responsible situation of which you now little dream, where there is no
                            turning either to the right hand or to the left, no shirking the burden. Treasure wisdom by
                            what you see and observe rather than bitterly censure and harshly judge the doings of
                            others, without profit. Those who are blessed with good discerning faculties, exercise them
                            to a right purpose, see and ponder how you might improve and make amendments in existing
                            legislations, not as rebels with hardness of heart and bitterness of speech, but with a
                            desire to promote the best interests of the community of which you claim to be members,
                            sharing its benefits and privileges. It becomes all, whatever their position, to feel
                            interested and united with the body, endeavor to cherish and strengthen all that is worthy,
                            and what is not try to correct and make it worthy ; bearing in mind to be merciful rather
                            than arbitrary, but just and wise, by no means supine or indifferent. What you sow you shall
                            reap. "Pay-day will come, " and if you do not render good service but sow thistles you will
                            reap dissatisfaction and vexation which may become pointed arrows to annoy with home-thrust
                            reflections that they are of the harvest which you have been dispensing. Again we would say,
                            be active and interested, with thought, Toice and every faculty. Zion needs all the
                            consecrated energy available, God's work demands it, and each individual soul for its
                            purification and quickening into the new life, the Christ-resurrection, needs constant
                            vigilance and activity judiciously aimed and properly directed, to effect the all-important
                            result. "Dare to do right" and always aim for that; be loyal to the high and hoty calling of

                            carefully the text of the revision as they have that of the authorized version. The large
                            number of changes that have been made in the book are a subject of surprise when we bear in
                            mind that the work was generally considered quite perfect, in fact a work of plenary
                            inspiration. The pruning, however, has been done by master workmen, and they have, no doubt,
                            felt warranted in this purifying of the text from its many and varied errors. Some of the
                            most important of those we note for the better information of those who are pleased to read.
                            In the xvii of Lk. one whole verse is erased. It is of no great importance and its erasure
                            can do no harm. The remaining part of the book of Luke has many doubtful passages and a very
                            important one occurs in the xxii., 43 and 44, also xxiii , 17. xxiv., 6. The words, "He is
                            not here but is risen. " xxiv., 40. " And when he had said this he showed them his hands and
                            feet. " xxiv., 42. " And they gave him a piece of broiled fish and a honey comb. " As the
                            most of this chapter treats of the resurrection, it was more visionary than real. Our
                            spiritualist friends might say it was a materialization, as such forms appear to them and
                            eat as did Jesus with his disciples. Those who wrote fish and honey comb went a little too
                            far, as our revisors have their doubts about the last article of diet, xxiv., 51. "And was
                            carried up into heaven " is not found in many of the ancient<pb n="157" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> MSS.,
                            hence it is doubtful. Jesus had already made the declaration while among the brethren that
                            he was in heaven. Jno. iii., 13. " And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but lie that came
                            down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven. " Jno. v., 3. The multitude of "
                            blind, halt and withered " that waited for the angel to trouble the waters of the pool can
                            have no farther privilege, as the fourth verse is wholly struck from the text. All the
                            sermons hereafter, based on that wonderful story will be at a discount. Jno. viii. From the
                            first to the twelfth verse is considered spurious and not entitled to a place in the New
                            Testament. Some churchal people think the change in Jno. x.. 16 to be very important. The
                            A.V. reads, "There shall be one fold and one shepherd. " while the revision reads, " they
                            shall become one flock, one shepherd. " We think it will make but little difference with
                            those who live "soberly, righteously and godly in this present world, " as they can well
                            trust to the ability of the true Shepherd to place them just where he would like to have
                            them. Acts viii., 37 an important passage is erased, ix., 5 and 6 verses are very much
                            changed. Paul on his visit to Athens xvii., 22 instead of finding the people "too
                            superstitious " he found them " very religious. " Rom. viii., 1. " There is therefore now no
                            condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." The remainder of the verse is erased. Horn,
                            ix., 5. Here is another singular passage and subject to much comment. The old MSS. do not
                            agree. "Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over
                            all, God blessed forever." The revision reads, " Whose are the fathers, and of whom is
                            Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. " The marginal notes
                            have changed the punctuation of the sentence and made it read entirely different from the A.
                            V. It might puzzle a lawyer to decide which form ot text belongs to the apostle. 1 Cor.
                            xiii. The word " charity " throughout the chapter gives place to "love, " and the " tinkling
                            cymbal " to "clanging cymbal." A large number of corrections of less note have been made
                            throughout the chapters of 1st and 2nd Cor. Eph. iii. 9. "And to make all men see what is
                            the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginni�g of the world hath been hid in God,
                            who created all things by Jesus Christ. " A decided change has been made in this verse which
                            must have been at one time in the hands of a trinitarian scribe. The revision reads. "And to
                            make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which from all ages hath been hid
                            in God who created all things. This makes God the creator instead of Jesus. Other variations
                            are found in the margin which may improve the text. Phil, xi., 5 and 6. Another mystical
                            passage, " Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of
                            God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God. " The revisors have changed the text and
                            made it less objectionable. The E. I), reads, Who though being in God's form, yet did not
                            meditate a usurpation to be like God. Dean Alford writes, Who being in the form of God,
                            deemed not his equality with God a thing to be grasped. In the future we can have the
                            satisfaction of choosing from the several translations. 1 Tim. iii., 16, Some officious
                            scribe evidently made this passage to suit the times, but the revisors have seen fit to
                            correct it. "And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifest in
                            the flesh, " etc. In the revision it now reads, " And without controversy great is the
                            mystery of godliness. He who was manifested in the flesh. " etc. The Catholic Bible reads. "
                            And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh. " 2 Tim.
                            iii., 16, " All sc-ipture is given by inspiration of God. " This has been one of the texts
                            to prove that the whole Bible was inspired.of God, every word every letter and some have
                            gone so far as to say every punctuation mark, and has probably caused more controversy than
                            any other text of the same number of words. The revision has ruined it for sectarians as it
                            now reads. "Every scripture inspired of God is profitable, " etc. The E. D. reads. All
                            scripture divinely inspired is indeed profitable, etc.<pb n="158" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> The Catholic
                            Bible was more consistent than the Protestant, as that reads, " All scripture inspired of
                            God, is profitable, " etc. 1 Jno. v., 7. This text has caused a great deal of loud talk
                            among sectarians. It has, however, been considered spurious, for many years, and the
                            revisors have thrown it out. It is not known who forged it, but it was written after the 5th
                            century. Rev. viii., 13, has one of the most singular errors. It makes John say that he saw
                            an " angel flying through the midst of heaven, " when he only saw " an eagle. " Can it be
                            that an Angel and an eagle look so much alike that it was difficult to determine the fact.
                            Who knows which is right? It would he as much of a wonder to hear an eagle crying woe, woe,
                            woe to the inhabitants of the earth, as it would to see an angel ftying in mid heaven.

                            Pretty soon there appeared a black stain upon a white surface. It did not look very dark at

As there is a wisdom which is
                            from beneath so (here is also inspiration from that quarter. In all great events for ill, or
                            for the welfare of the many, Inspiration is generally apparent. In smaller affairs it is not
                            so palpable ; the good and the evil get mixed up ; and the attempts at separation are
                            generally also of a mixed character. In created things, the lines between animation and
                            vegetable life runs so closely, as to be undiscernable. But of the difference between the

                        </head><p TEIform="p"> Beloved Elder :�We are now thinking of a letter received from you, which contained so many
                            good things as to make one's heart thankful for our brotherly, gospel relationship.
                            Accepting as we do all the burdens that are at this date falling so heavily upon every
                            community of Believers, there is at the same time a great many blessings for which we may be
                            superlatively thankful. No other class of people have the opportunity of making for
                            themselves so beautiful a home. Certainly, peace and contentment do abound. We have yet to
                            hear of a family of Shakers that are destitute of food or that suffer for the want of
                            sufficient clothing to make them comfortable. Some are abundantly supplied with all these
                            good gifts. All are privileged to reside in comfortable dwellings, and a few in mansions of
                            earthly beauty. At any rate in the externals it would seem that we are wonderfully blessed,
                            and then the fellowship which is shared by the whole household, has in it elements of love
                            and joy and confidence enough to make a Kingdom of God upon the earth. It is well that we
                            appreciate all the good gifts of the Kingdom from day to day and take pleasure in the
                            comforting assurance that it shall be well with the righteous. Of these things, so near and
                            dear to our own hearts, we suppose we shall write till time is no more. Now a few words on
                            the past. The spiritualism from 1837 to 1847 among the Shakers and the present spiritualism
                            of the world have many things in common which we can enjoy with much satisfaction. We have
                            always with very great pleasure placed our name among the spiritualists, and that name to us
                            lias a significance that far transcends all the dreams and visions that fall to common
                            humanity. The best spiritualism .that can manifest itself in an assemblage of Shakers must
                            be that testimony which is the outgrowth of a pure heart. Visions which allow us to see
                            ourselves are preeminently visions of God, and the exhortations of righteousness coming from
                            a consecrated life are far better than any angel messages from a foreign sphere, so far as
                            the prosperity of our Church is dependent upon them. When a man is well fed and well clothed
                            he may be a ghost-seer with a great deal of satisfaction, but when hunger pinches or
                            adversity stands at the door, then these illusions become of a very different character. If
                            these mind visions were the outgrowth of a pure heart, we might almost trust our salvation
                            to their keeping : but when we know that it is only the development of a natural faculty,
                            the same as singing or speaking, we assign it to its legitimate place. Some of the most
                            unprincipled men and women among Believers were equally gifted with the better class, and as
                            these same gifts are now abroad in the world, let us see how they come. One of the leading
                            spiritualists, a man in whom Believers have placed a great deal of confidence, has said that
                            many of the best mediums were loose and licentious. In fact, these low estates made them
                            more susceptible to influences, and of course better able to accept impressions from good or
                            evil spirits. We do think that while there is much that is sweet and choice in what we have
                            shared as spiritual gifts, there has also immense harm reached us from the same mediums. The
                            pioneers of our gospel work were gifted in visions but they were at the same time
                            indefatigable workers on the earth. They left their cozy homes and went into the world and
                            preached and prayed and held their meetings from day to day and from week to week and
                            compelled men to believe. John Meacham, Benj. Youngs and Issachar Bates did no less than
                            this on their visit to Ohio. Issachar had visions which comforted him but he also had the
                            confidence that he was a servant of God : and this man could walk from Mt. Lebanon to Ohio
                            and on to Ky. and preach a sermon in every log cabin on the way. Eastern Shakers did no less
                            in the day when the Church stood in its glory for zeal and earnest work<pb n="160" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> for God. In those days of which you speak the dreamers in some cases, astonished the
                            officers of Society, and some persons actually thought, that there could be no advance taken
                            that would be permanent. They even said that the Believers were not good enough and must
                            wait at home and grow better. What has been the result, East, west, north, and soutli so far
                            as our order is concerned? Believers hardly know what it is best to do, and like star gazers
                            are wondering what will come next. Now, in all this confusion of thoughts and feelings ; in
                            all this anxiety of dreaming and ghost seeing which is among the Believers in every Society
                            and family, we are not surprised, that they are seeking beyond our own order for a shadowy
                            satisfaction, and they will be fortunate if they get even a shadowAnother generation will
                            not know the spiritualism that was with us from 1837 to 1847The good they cannot know, to
                            appreciate' and much of it would require an able, relig_ ious interpreter or it could not be
                            under stood. But Believers must and will have spiritual, ism among themselves in some form.
                            If they neglect to cultivate it at home, they will seek for it abroad, and in all
                            probability where we now spend one day in Endor consulting the spirits, a coming generation
                            will spend a week. It is astonishing to see how zealous some of the good, substantial and
                            faithful believers in the doctrines have become in following after the deceptions of
                            necromancers and magicians that are covering the land as thoroughly as the frogs covered
                            Egypt. Father Joseph could walk the floor in agony of soul at the thought of introducing
                            even an educated physician into the Society, but we can introduce and bow down to almost
                            anything in human shape. We consult sleeping mediums, that can look into the patients and
                            see the heart, lungs, liver or anything else, and some think that is just nice. We consult
                            those that cure by the laying on of hands, and those ignorant and repellent old men and
                            women, who have lived among the Indians, so they say, and they perform wonderful cures. He
                            might well groan over our one hundred years' experience. As Believers grow lukewarm and lose
                            their hold on the various forms of spiritualism which belongs to their own order, they will
                            go out into the world to find them ; and so long as the world lasts the magicians will work
                            at their trade. Tippings, rappings and planehette have gone by but materialization has come
                            and this is the last bewitching phase. To become converted to the truth of this, one would
                            be obliged to see more to convince him than has the writer. Chittendon was for many years
                            the strong hold for putting the spirits into bodies of flesh and blood and making them talk
                            and dance. The best mediums for this work congregated there and yet some of them were not
                            especially neat and chaste. Now, Dear Elder, why do we need to wait for the coming years for
                            an inspiration from on high? Is not the revelation of the work of God a growing revelation
                            that shall make us what we profess to be, sons and daughters of a living God? Truly, and
                            this spiritual health, prosperity and happiness is in our own hands. </p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In memory of Elder Phidelio Collins" TEIform="index"/> IN MEMORY OF ELDER PHIDELIO COLLINS. </head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="S., J.

                                inevitable consequences. Sin is often not half subdued when you think it entirely so.
                                Don't parley with sin. " Give the adversary an inch, and he will take a mile. " Yield to
                                one of his wishes, and you may yield to all. " If you do not wish to travel to the end
                                of the " broad road, " shun it entirely. Once on the way, it is hard to stop. " Be wise
                                in time. Deny the first temptation, and you can more easily resist subsequent ones.
                                "Nothing torments like sin. " One sin leads to two, two lead to three, and so on, until
                                they are past counting. One sin, if not erased, will deprive you of real happiness. No
                                sins are small. Sins that seem small, are monsters, that deceive and destroy. Living in
                                sin, blights the soul. Break from sinful habits now. Sin promises joys, but pays
                                sorrows. Remember this truth. Sin grows fast. Subdue it thoroughly, or it will make bad
                                work. It don't pay to sow " tares.' " Sin don't make saints. " It is dangerous to
                                commence a life of sin. " Gird on the heavenly armor, " and keep it on. War against
                                sinful proclivities, with ceaseless vigilance. Fighting the rank weeds of vice, is time
                                well spent. "How low sin plunges its slaves ! " Give up sin, or give up hope of heaven.

While the savage
                            whose faith is strong in revenge to his enemies, the Christian faith, leads its advocates by
                            the tenets of Jesus, to forgive their enemies. Itsays, " Love your enemies ; do good to
                            those who hate you and pray for them that persecute you. " There are no two sects or
                            denominations who stand upon the same level of faith. And no two, seemingly, of the same
                            faith have the same opinion, thus bringing into use the old adage, "Vaiiety is the spice ot
                            life, " and I think well it is so, for without these different views life would become a
                            monotonous panorama tedious to bear. While our opinions of the non essentials vary let us be
                            a unit on the principles. Customs are ever changing and the old must give place to the new ;
                            but let the principles remain firm as the mountain rock. "Without faith it is impossible to
                            please God, for he that cometh to Him must believe that IT� is a rewarder of them that
                            dilligently serve Him.

                            wonders of the present day to find them conjoined. We have no end of religious speculations,
                            brought out by the multiplied shades of biblical reading and then by the thousands of
                            additional explanations. In our astute wisdom we have felt warranted in casting a sneer and
                            even in indulging in a laugh at the expense of a class we call heathen, because of their
                            long list of gods that preside over the public and private affairs of a semi-civilized
                            nation. However, as laughing, is not, as a general thing, followed by any disasterous
                            results the heathen can quietly worship as they may think best. Just now it may be well to
                            confine our remarks to those who are denominated Christians and let the class who make no
                            profession of religion as well as those whom we call anti-christians, rest till another
                            time. A Christian, Webster says ;�is " One who professes to believe in the religion of
                            Christ; especially one whose inward and outward life is conformed to the doctrines of
                            Christ." This is a very clear and very acceptable definition of the term, and if made
                            practical would insure a Kingdom of God upon the earth. It would afford the hundred fold of
                            all earthly blessings and give us an assurance of the promise of Eternal Life. But as
                            preaching has become an occupation through which one is expected to earn his daily bread, it
                            is largely a matter of the brain, and men are awarded for their ability in rhetoric rather
                            than for their goodness of heart. Every class of Christians preach and pray and it is one of
                            the wonder working features of the religious world that so many shades of belief can be held
                            forth, and these often becoming quite antagonistic, while at the same time they all claim to
                            accept one book, a work of divine inspiration, from which they make their scholastic
                            recitations. With this system of multiplied forms and ceremonies, it cannot be thought
                            strange that even the Christian world has been called a babel, a confusion of tongues. The
                            simplicity with which Jesus performed his ministrations, and the direct application of all
                            his words to the daily life of the individual, establishes a foundation for righteousness
                            upon which every one may build with confidence. This makes Christianity a work of the heart,
                            the conforming of the inward and outward life to the doctrines of Christ and establishes it
                            as the essential part of a Christian's duty. But as men are not usually paid a salary for
                            the manifestation of their piety, the practical life of Christianity is allowed to become
                            rusty and moth eaten, rendering it more or less unfit for presentation. Those who make a
                            close comparison between the life of the Teacher and that of his disciples, at the present
                            date, think it a subject of mirth, or of surprise as so little is found in the last that
                            harmonizes with the first. To make, the preaching, however, of the first consequence, a
                            cloak of excuses has been used to good advantage, and Christians like Free-thinkers and
                            Infidels are not expected to walk uprightly, for the Scripture has expressly stated in

                                apparent to warrant such a doubt. Undoubtedly many individuals imagine they are
                                particular in this respect when they are not. The fact is, very few persons know how to
                                properly manipulate a brush; nor do they snow what sort of brush to select. Scarcey one
                                in ten of the brushes manufactured are fit for use, and this statement is no
                                exaggeration. Many are too large and unwieldy ;o be successfully managed, and would be
                                more suitable for "nail-brushing." The majority of them are also too compact; some too
                                rigid and not sufficiently pliable to be useful, while others are too soft and little
                                better han rags. The brush for service should never be broader than the medium sizes
                                usually sold, nor over two thirds their length. The bristles should be elastic and their
                                ends rimmed in serrations, or "notched"�this form being best adapted to the shape of the
                                teeth. In use, the brush should be pressed firmly gainst the teeth, commencing with the
                                back nes at their cervical borders, and with a emi rotary motion slowly brought forward
                                nd toward their grinding edges in such a ing of man, that '' none doeth good no not one.
                                " Believing this to be true as the iiispir ed testimony from God1, it could not be
                                expected that good works wrought ou by the cross, through a discipline of the mind,
                                would ever be in very great de maud. The moral quality which makes man regard his
                                brother man with more or less consideration comes through his civilization and
                                education. As good as this may be it is not the spirituality that is found in the gospel
                                of Jesus Christ. Moses in his wilderness journey permitted his people to demand an eye
                                for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. It was not a matter of retaliation, springing from
                                a spirit of revenge, but rather a punishment inflicted to coi respond to the
                                transgression. While Jesus commended this course for those who believed in Moses, he at
                                the same time said, that if they would be his disciples they must pray for those who
                                were their persecutors. They must seek for the Kingdom of God and its righteousness. In
                                this they had the promise of abundant treasures in earthly wealth, and the additional
                                assurance of Eternal Life_ With him the preaching and practice were in divine unison. To
                                do right was the righteousness of God. In this work the disciples were carried above the
                                pleasures of time and sense and under the inspiration of the divine spirit became the
                                beautiful lights of Christianity and able to publish the good news and glad tidings. For
                                this, Jesus was well pleased to compare them to a city, built so high upon the hill that
                                it could not possibly be hid from view. They had become a light to the world, and this
                                is what Christianity should be at the present time.<pb n="164" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/>manner as to
                                force from between them accumulations that have found lodgment there; also allowing the
                                bristles to come in contact with all enamel surfaces possible to reach. Rapid horizontal
                                dashes should be avoided. A brush furiously driven across the teeth touches only points
                                of enamel that least require rubbing, leaving the accumulations that load their
                                interstices undisturbed and unmolested. It is not the frequency of brushing that best
                                preserves the teeth, but the degree of thoroughness with which it is done. The time for
                                performing this duty most effectively is just before retiring for the night. During the
                                twelve hours interval from the evening meal to the morning repast, particles of food
                                retained about the teeth, and subjected to the warm, humid condition of the oral cavity,
                                cannot fail to become decomposed or fermented, thus breeding an insidious foe that,
                                night after night, besieges the enamel walls which, unless of extraordinary compactness,
                                will sooner or later give way to its destructive forces. There is no objection to
                                cleansing the teeth when making the morning toilet, yet if thoroughly cared for the
                                night before, they require comparatively little of such attention in the early part of
                                the day. To brush them more frequently than this is a needless task. 1 Dr. C. E.

                                his son, Morgan Dix, in which is given an account of an interview with Abernethy, whom
                                the General had consulted for professional advice. It is gratifying to note that the
                                common sense advice of the illustrious physician was taken in a common sense way by the
                                distinguished patient, and that the result was a ripe and robust old age, (80 years,) of
                                which the dyspeptic youth of the General scarcely gave promise. After hearing a few
                                words of his patient's story, Abernethy cut him short as follows : " Sir, you are pretty
                                far gone, and the wonder is you are not gone entirely. If you had consulted common sense
                                instead of the medical faculty, you would probably have been well years ago. I can say
                                nothing to you excepting this : You must take regular exercise as much as you can bear
                                without fatigue, as little medicine as possible, of the simplest kind, and this only
                                when absolutely necessary, and a modest quantity of plain food, of the quality which you
                                find by experience best to agree with you. No man, not even a physician, can prescribe
                                diet for another. ' A stomach is a stomach;' ?nd itis impossible for any one to reason
                                *vith safety from his own to that of any other person. There are a few general mles
                                which any man of common sense may learn in a week, such as this: That rich food, high
                                seasoning, etc., are injurious. I can say no more to you, sir; you must go and cure
                                yourself.

                                truth, honor and usefulness. These qualities give each separate book a claim upon the

                                children. The present volume may well stand as a representative of the series in all
                                these respects. Margie is the youngest daughter of a country clergyman, and at the age
                                of fourteen is left without father or mother, but is cared for by kind friends. She is a
                                thoughtful and sympathetic child, and anxious to be of some use in the world. She often
                                wonders what her " mission " is to be, and at last it is opened up to her. It is by no
                                means a pleasant or romantic one, but she bravely accepts it, and although her trials
                                are neither few nor light, its fruits are abundant and permanent. We do not propose to
                                interfere with the reader's right to enjoy the s-tory by describing its plot, but simply

                            the mind. I could hardly wish to enter heaven did I believe its inhabitants were idly to sit
                            by purling streams, fanned by balmy air. Heaven to be a place of happiness, must be a place
                            of activity. lias the far reaching mind of Newton ceased its profound investigations? Has
                            David hung up his harp as useless as the dusty arms in Westminster Abbey? Has Paul, glowing
                            with God like enthusiasm ceased itinerating the universe of God? Are Peter and Cyprain and
                            Edwards and Payson and Evarts idling away an eternity in mere psalm-singing? Heaven is a
                            place of restless activity, the abode of nevertiring thought. David and Isaiah will sweep
                            nobler and loftier strains in eternity, and the minds of saints, inclogged by cumbersome
                            clay, will forever feast on the banquet of rich and glorious thought. My young friends, go
                            on; you will never get through. An eternity of untiring action is before you, and the
                            universe of thought is your field.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Being is before all Knowing and Doing, I affirm that education cannot repair the defects of birth" TEIform="index"/>

For the better understanding of those who wish to know of the
                            rules and regulations of our religious home, we have prepared the following brief summary.
                            Further information may be obtained by addressing any member of the order. 1. The form of
                            government in the Society is adapted to the different orders of which it is composed : its
                            powers and authorities growing out of the mutual faith, love and confidence of the members.
                            2. No one is excluded from the privilege of becoming a member on account of poverty ; nor
                            will they be accepted because of wealth. 3. Plain and explicit facts will belaid before the
                            investigator. To become a member, is a voluntary concession of the individual. 4. Those who
                            accept the privilege to reside wTith us, as well as those who visit the Society as
                            inquirers, are expected to regard the rules of the family where they are entertained. 5. By
                            the principles of this Society, no believing husband or wife is allowed to separate from an
                            unbelieving partner, except by mutual or legal agreement. 6. Parents that become members are
                            not required to give up their children : but they will be requested to see that the children
                            keep the rules of the family. Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the
                            Society, except by the request or consent of those who have the lawful right over them. 7.
                            No corporal punishment is approved in the government of the Society, nor any external
                            violence exercised on any rational person. 8. It is expected that the children admitted into
                            the Society, will receive an education suitable for the general management of business. 9.
                            Probationary members may retain the lawful ownership of their property, but the interest
                            accruing therefrom will be devoted to the benefit of the Society, until by their own free
                            will, and the consent of the Trustees, they shall consecrate said property to the support of
                            the family where they reside. 10. The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted
                            by persons, previous to the time of their membership. 11. Those who dispose of their
                            property to relations in the worldly order, should remain with those relations. 12. A person
                            wishing to become a member of the Society, must rectify all his wrongs, and discharge all
                            just and legal claims. 18. Those who ask for admission to our Home arc supposed to be in
                            search of more truth and light, hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church, is the
                            covfession of sin to God, in the presence of a witness. 14. Those who have dedicated their
                            property, and afterward withdraw from the Society,�according to the law of justice and
                            equity, there can be no ground for retraction. 15. To live as Brethren and Sisters in the
                            gospel of Christ, we can hold no private correspondence. All communications sent from or
                            received into the family, whether printed or written, will be subject to the examination and
                            advice of the Elders of the family. 1G. The leading authority of the Society is vested in a
                            Ministry, consisting of two Brothers and two Sisters. Elders and Trustees are also
                            appointed. These orders constitute the general government, of the Society, in all of its
                            branches.</p></div2><pb n="167" id="p27" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hallowed peace" TEIform="index"/> HALLOWED PEACE.</head><p TEIform="p"> Enfield, N.

                                    ; and these are beyond the reach of our senses. Eye hath not seen nor ear heard,

                                    nourished neither on materialization nor on miracles. Not in looking on strange

                    Interesting- Facts Concerningtlie men Who Stand Clone*!, to the Chief Executive. Visitors who, from
                    curiosity or business, have called at the White House, must have been impressed by the courteous yet
                    systematic manner with which they were received and escorted through the mansion. The gentlemen
                    whose duty it is to receive all persons coming to the White House are Colonel E. S. Densmore, Mr.
                    John T. Eickard and Mr. T. F. Pendel, and they have occupied their present positions tlirough the
                    various administrations since and even during the war. Mr. Pendel was President Lincoln's
                    body-guard; saw him to his carriage the fatal night on which he visited Ford's theater, and he has
                    now in his possession the blood-stained coat which Mr. Lincoln wore on that memorable occasion.
                    There is not a public man in America to-day who does not know, and who is not known by, these
                    gentlemen, and the reminiscences of public and social life which they can recount would fill a
                    congressional volume. During the weary yet exciting years of the war; through the more peaceful
                    times of Grant's administration; while Hayes held the reins of government, and when Garfield was
                    shot, it was these men who stood in the executive mansion, welcoming the advent of each new
                    administration, bowing at its departure, and receiving both martyrs through its portals. During that
                    long, hot and never to be forgotten summer when President Garfield lay between "two worlds," the
                    nation became aware of the deadly malarial influence which hung about the White House. But all
                    through that period these three men never deserted their posts for a single day, although each one
                    was suffering intensely. In conversation with the writer, Colonel Densmore said: " It is impossible
                    to^describe the tortures I have undergone. To be compelled to smile and treat the thousands of
                    visitors who come here daily with courtesy when one is in the greatest agony requires a tremendous
                    effort. All that summer I had terrible headaches, heart-burn and a stifling sensation that sometimes
                    took awray my breath. My appetite was uncertain and I felt severe pains in the small of my back. I
                    was under the doctor's care with strict instructions not to go out of the house but I remained on
                    duty nevertheless. You would be surprised to know the amount of quinine I took; on some days it was
                    as much as sixtefn grains. " "And was Mr. Eickard badly off, too?" " I should think he was. Why,
                    time and again we have picked him up and laid him on the mantel, here in the vestibule, he was so
                    used up. " " Yes, " exclaimed Mr. Eickard, " I was so weak I could not rise after lying down without
                    help, and could only walk with the aid of two canes, and then in a stooping position. Oh, we have
                    been in a pretty bad condition here, all of us. " "And yet you are all the embodiment of health, "
                    said the writer, as he looked at the three bright and vigorous men before him. "Oh yes, "said Mr.
                    Eickard, "we have not known what sickness was for more than a year. " "Have you some secret way of
                    overcoming malaria and its attendant horrors?" " I think we have a most certain way, " replied
                    Colonel Densmore, " but it is no secret. You see, about two years ago my wife began to grow blind,
                    and I was alarmed at her condition. She finally became so she could not tell whether a person were
                    white or black at a distance of ten feet. One of her lady friends advised her to try a certain
                    treatment that had done wonders for her and to make a long story short, she did so and was
                    completely cured. This induced me to try the same means for my own restoration and as soon as I
                    found it was doing me good I recommended it to my associates and we have all been cured right here
                    in the stronghold of malaria and kept in perfect health ever since by mean of Warner's Safe Cure.
                    Now I am not a believer in medicines in general, but I do not hesitate to say that I am satisfied I
                    should have died of Bright's disease of the kidneys before this had it not been for this wonderful
                    remedy. Indeed, I use it as a household medicine and give it to my children whenever they have any
                    ailments. " "Yes," exclaimed Mr. Pendel, "I use it in my family all the while and have found it
                    AD VERTISEMENTS.
the most efficient remedy we have ever employed. I know of very many public men
who are using it to-day and they all speak
weil of it. "
"I weigh 160 pounds to-day" said Mr.
Eickard, "and when my physicians told me
over a year ago I could not hope to recover I
weighed 122 pounds. Under such influences
you cannot wonder that I consider this the
best medicine before the American people. "

"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and
by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast
tables with a delicately flavored beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist
every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever
there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood
and a properly nourished frame. "�Civil Service Gazette.

Many people imagine they have consumption, when in reality they only have a bad cold, which can
easily be cured by proper care and the right kind of medicine. We could fill columns with testimonials, but
do not. believe in that way of advertising, our idea is to let everybody that is afflicted with a cough try
for themselves, and if not perfectly satis fied, return the empty bottle to the dealer of whom it was bought
and receive their money back.
