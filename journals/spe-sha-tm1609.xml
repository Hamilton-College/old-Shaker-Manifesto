TRADITIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT.
From " Perley's Reminiscences of Sixty Years in
the National Metropolis."
The Supreme Court then sat in the room in the
basement of the Capitol now occupied as a law library. It has an arched ceiling supported by massive pillars that obstruct the view and is very badly
ventilated. But it is rich in traditions of hair-powder, queues, ruffled shirts, knee-breeches, and buckles. Up to that time no Justice had ever sat upon
the bench in trousers, nor had any lawyer ventured
to plead in boots or wearing whiskers. Their Honors, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices.
wearing silk judicial robes, were treated with the
most profound respect. When Mr. Clay stopped one
day in an argument and, advancing to the, bench,
took a pinch of snufi" from Judge Washington's box,
�saying, " I perceive that your Honor sticks to the
;Scotch,' and then proceeded with his case, it ex�eited astonishment and admiration. " Sir," said Mr.
�Justice Story, in relating the circumstance to a
�friend, " I do not believe there is a man in the Unit,ed States who could have done that but Mr. Clay. "
Chief Justice John Marshall, who had then presided in the Supreme Court for more than a quarter
cof a century, was one of the last survivors of those
� officers of the Revolutionary Army who had entered
into civil service. He was a tall, gaunt man, with
a small head and bright black eyes. He used to
wear an unbrushed long skirted black coat, a badly
fitting waistcoat and knee-breeches, a voluminous
white cambric cravat (generally soiled,) and black
worsted stockings, with low shoes and silver buckles. When upward of seventy years of age he still
relished the pleasures of the quoit club or the whist
table, and to the last his right hand never forgot its
cunning with the billiard cue.
Bushrod Washington, who had been appointed to
the.Supreme Court by President John Adams, was
by inheritance the owner of Mount Vernon, where
his remains now lie, near those of his illustrious
uncle, George Washington. He was u small, insignificant looking man, deprived of the sight of one
-eye by excessive study, negligent of dress, and an
immoderate snuff-taker. He was a rigid disciplinarian and a great stickler for etiquette, and on one occasion he sat for sixteen hours without leaving the
ibench. He was also a man of rare humor. One
�day, as the Judges were disrobing, after having
heard Senator Isham Talbot, of Kentucky, argue a
case with extraordinary rapidity of utterance, he
dryly remarked, " Well, a person of moderate wishes
could hardly desire to live longer than the time it
would take Brother Talbot to repeat moderately
that four hours' speech we have just heard. "

                            Blinn. *' Ax one time I was severely bruised by being dragged from the house by wicked men,
                            and forced into a rude cart. They then drove through several o the streets, and across the
                            lots, and allowed me to be shamefully abused by the people who threw mud and filth at me
                            till we arrived at the court house. The court was in session and I was taken before the
                            judges who gave me the liberty to speak my faith unmolested. The case was then dismissed. "
                            " Sometimes the mobs would throw stones in at the windows, and disturb the worship, and
                            often put the family to much cost and trouble." At one time an attempt was made to seize
                            Mother Ann and the principal members of the Society while they were engaged in the worship
                            of God, that they might have a lawful pretence to punish ihem for breaking the Sabbath. For
                            this purpose several church officers and spies had been placed in the streets as watchmen,
                            under the plea of more carefully guarding the Sabbath. Mother Ann being forewarned of God,
                            had sent Father William out of the town, early m the morning. The Believers assembled and
                            began their worship, which was attended with a manifestation of the power of God. The report
                            was heard, the rumor spread<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> and anti-christ was roused. It was at the
                            time of the morning service, and several of the church officers came with a strong party to
                            seize the offenders. Mother Ann and her little family were worshiping God in the upper part
                            of the house. The mob surrounded the place, burst open the doors, ascended the stairs and
                            seized all the company, but were greatly disappointed iu not finding William Lee. A search
                            was made but it did not prove successful. Mary Hocknell was closely interrogated and
                            threatened by the mob, to make her tell where William Lee could be found, but she refused to
                            answer. After being shamefully abused she was taken before the officers of the church. Here
                            she was again examined, threatened, coaxed, nattered, and money offered to her, but all in
                            vain. Escaping from her persecutors, Mary returned to the family. Mother Ann and those who
                            were with her, were convened to the prison, where they continued to sing and shout and
                            glorify God, so as to be heard at a great distance. The next morning they were all released,
                            except Mother Ann and John Lee. These were taken to another prison and kept in confinement
                            for several weeks. Mary Hocknell frequently carried food and articles of clothing to them.
                            In this prison Mother Ann received the revelations of God. Deep and important mysteries were
                            revealed to her, and by the power and authority of the Holy Spirit, she was commissioned to
                            lead the Society. When she was released from this imprisonment, she took Mary Hocknell with
                            her, collected the Society together and opened her revelations with the most astonishing
                            power of God. All admitted that the candle of the Lord was in her hand, and that she was
                            able, by the light thereof, to search every heart and try every soul. From this time Mother
                            Ann took charge of the Society and was received and acknowledged as the first pillar of the
                            church of God on earth. Manifestations of the Spirit of God through Mother Ann. Those who
                            heard the testimony of Ann Lee and learned of the heart searching power of her spirit,
                            admitted that she was an eminent witness of the work of God. "Her words were like flames of
                            fire, and her voice like peals of thunder !" Well said the prophet, "Who shall abide the day
                            of his (Christ's) coming? For it is like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap. " " The
                            Lord who brought me over the great waters, " said Mother Ann, "has redeemed my soul. I hear
                            the angels sing ; I see the glory of God, as the sun in its brightness; I see souls coming
                            into the first resurrection. " "The work of God will grow more and more into a work of
                            spiritual discipline, and so exact and so straight, that if you willfully depart in the
                            least from the way, you will be lost." Mother Ann and the Elders abounded in visions,
                            prophecies, and revelations. These were administered to those that embraced the testimony.
                            They were given to strengthen, confirm, and establish the faith which the people had
                            received, and were preparatory to the substance which was to follow. These gifts were
                            numerous and at that time very important, yet being for the most<pb n="195" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> part,
                            mere outward signs and operations, they were considered of secondary importance, because
                            they could not, oi themselves, accomplish the real work oi redemption. In proportion as the
                            people entered into the more enduring substance of the gospel, these outward gifts became
                            less and less necessary for them. On the return of Mother Ann from her imprisonment in
                            Poughkeepsie, she spoke to the Believers as follows,� " You are called in relation to the
                            rest of mankind, and through your faith and obedience, they must receive the gospel. Sorrow
                            and suffering will never cease in the church, till all souls have heard the gospel of
                            salvation. This will be offered freely to every one, and will be a savor of life unto life
                            or of death unto death." " This testimony of Christ will overcome all nations. It will
                            increase and mankind will see the decayed foundation of anti-christ's kingdom. God will draw
                            the line between the righteous and the unrighteous. Fear not, neither be afraid, for God
                            will deliver his people." "Some among you may think that you will yet subdue and overcome
                            the nations of the earth, but you are mistaken. They have that work to do for themselves.
                            They will contend with each other, until they become so humble that they will be willing to
                            receive the gospel of Jesus Christ. They may build up, but God will pull down. They may
                            build upon a false foundation, but God will pull down, until they can build no more ; but
                            yeu can have nothing to do with it." '' After I have closed my work in this world, there
                            will be a great increase of the gospel. It will be as with &amp; man who begins with the
                            world and accumulates an interest. At his death he leaves his interest with those who will
                            improve upon it and gather more." �' The time will come when the church will be gathered
                            into order, but not till after my decease. The wisdom and knowledge and light of God will
                            increase in the church till Zion travels to her full glory. Joseph Meacham will be a father
                            to all the Believers in America, for God has called and anointed him for that place. When
                            the ministration of those who came from England, closes, then you will see peaceable times.
                            Then you can worship God under your own vines and fig trees, and none of the wicked shall
                            make you afraid. Then you will not need to teach one another to know the Lord, for all the
                            faithful will know Him." At the expiration of eight years the testimony closed, and then the
                            persecution ceased. The Believers were able to worship God, unmolested, in their several
                            places appointed for that purpose. Coming to America. In referring to the passage to
                            America, Mother Ann remarked, "It was revealed to me that I must come over to New England. A
                            meeting was appointed for the occasion. Many gifts were presented in confirmation of our
                            coming, as prophecies, revelations, visions and dreams. In the zeal of the meeting, a great
                            deal of patience had to be exercised, in waiting for each other to manifest their gifts. It
                            was a joyful meeting and continued for several hours. '' Elder John Hocknell then went in
                            search of a vessel in which to embark. He found one that was said to be con-<pb n="196" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>�f [For a more extended account of this voyage, see the little pamphlet, "Life

"</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Leonard, William" TEIform="persName"/> WILLIAM LEONARD. </byline><p TEIform="p">The ruder class of worldy men are those who, in early life were proud, arrogant, stubborn and
                            inclining to many evils. Such grow up to look with contempt upon a gentle spirit, " easy to
                            be entreated." They generally fall into great sins, become the refuse of society, and too
                            often spend their last bitter days in the penitentiary, or expiate their crimes on the
                            gallows. The class who succeed in the world, are reasonable, considerate, and seek good
                            counsel instead of avoiding it. Entreat such to alter a course that seems dangerous, and
                            they will listen candidly, steer clear of evils ahead, and in after years bless those who
                            guided them into honorable courses. If men start inexperienced in worldly life, how much
                            more so will they be in "starting in a godly life, on which their present and future
                            happiness depends. If they need a guide in beginning the world, how much more a teacher to
                            learn the Christian life. When any set out to follow Jesus in the path he really walked in,
                            they are ignorant of the ch anges they must make in their lives ar d the trial it will cost
                            them to make tbim. Ripe scholars in God's work caa soon see who will travel the surest an i
                            most pleasant in the work of salvation. When temptations are pointed out to the proud and
                            wilful, too often inotead of shunning, they run into them. When questioned concerning such a
                            course, they are haughty, independent, and anything but gentle. They pierce themselves
                            through with many sorrows, bring trouble upon their seniors, and often fall from the path
                            which leads to life because they are not " easy to be entreated. " A better class of young
                            or inexperienced Christians are thoughtful, considerate, and do not tower too high up in
                            self-esteem. They view the church of Christ as a school, and consider themselves pupils sent
                            thither to learn and increase in spiritual knowledge. They see that all military, literary
                            or mechanical students, need the aid of a master mind, till they stand before society having
                            mastered all they have undertaken. The real spiritual scholar sees that salvation from sin
                            must be studied as a science, and he bends diligently to his abor, becomes pure minded,
                            refined, peaceable, gentle and ''easy to be entreated. " Such stand as the brightest
                            ornaments in the household of faith, make the most reliable leaders and will stand first in
                            the Heavens ; they meet changing scenes, and they looked for them ; they bear reproof, for
                            they know hey cannot grow in the Lord Jesus demned. I told him that God would not condemn it
                            when we were in it. While we were on the voyage I was constrained to testify against the
                            wickedness of the seamen, for which they threatened to throw me overboard. I had no occasion
                            to fear them, for my trust was in God, and they were not suffered to harm me during the
                            passage. " "We informed the captain that he would not have whereof to accuse us except it
                            was concerning the law of our God."f<pb n="197" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Christ without it. Gradually
                            changing from the lower to the higher life, they meet fiery trials, and becoming spiritually
                            scientific, they expected all this. They see seasons of disappointment and sadness, bvit
                            learn that the great Master Builder met the same, and that they surely must. With all these,
                            they meet joy and comfort, ministered to them by angels, and they expected this also. Their
                            obedience prepares them to enjoy such ministrations in a manner which the self-willed,
                            disobedient and unrefined never did or can enjoy them, and this progress of spirit gives the
                            evidence that they are becoming '' Full of mercy and good fruits. " The godly experience
                            just alluded to renders the Believer, in his degree, like Him '' Whose tender mercies are
                            over all his works. " Man may be tender hearted by his peculiar organization, but gospel
                            experience will render him understandingly so. It will teach an honest mind that when men
                            speak or act against him, that in all probability, he has said or done that which has caused
                            it, at least in part; then, instead of retaliating, he will seek to find the evil in his own
                            breast and will diligently set about removing the cause, that the effect may cease. If he
                            has received injury, or is wounded by another, he concludes like a wTise philosopher, that
                            if he makes the worst of it, he will bring more affliction upon himself, than his adversary
                            has done. If he makes the best and thinks the least of it, and performs kindness instead of
                            retaliation, then as our Lord said "He heaps coals of fire on the head of his persecutor. "
                            The difference between the cruel and merciful man, is this : When a sinner disgraces himself
                            by crime, the unmerciful man cherishes little toward him but coldness and contempt, or a
                            desire to see the offender punished, with little regard who will suffer with him, while the
                            merciful Christian will feel charity for his folly, view it in the best light he can examine
                            it in, and will strive to save as much of his character and manhood as possible, striving to
                            lighten the burden of his friends. Our Lord once said to the Jews, " The poor ye have always
                            with you. " We as a people remember this, when called upon for charity, it is a rule with us
                            never to let the suffering or needy who call upon us, go destitute from our doors. A Shaker
                            Village is an excellent soil on which to bring forth the fruits of love and kindness. In a
                            family of an hundred, more or less, some are laborious, others not able to be so ; some are
                            patient, while others are impulsive. Some are inclined to study, some are indifferent about
                            it. Many are great burden bearers / others have an aversion to all care and trust. There are
                            wise men, and many not wise. You will find plain hearted members, others are prudent and
                            reserved ; some neat, some have much of this to learn. Some are free to converse and
                            examine. others more silent and indifferent. This condition of society, if we should make
                            the worst of it, would at least produce some friction and something of a pandemonium. If we
                            make the best of it and of each other, and keep striving to become agreeable to each other,
                            it is the best school to learn patience, charity, and how to live and labor, and sit
                            together in heavenly places, that there is on earth. Here then, is the-circle in which we
                            study human nature, the graces, and how to interchange a<pb n="198" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> thousand
                            little civilities peculiar to our institution. If heaven is made up of a large spiritual
                            family, existing in a joint relation, it certainly follows that we are learning, on earth,
                            both in theory and practice, what professed Christianity will have to learn, when they enter
                            the spirit land. Under this tuition we learn to live "without partiality." A spirit that
                            inclines a person to favor another, either through fear or affection, above all others,
                            seems to be the true rendering of the word partiality in the text. If the favorite is
                            virtuous, in a worldy sense, it is plausible in the professor, still in the spirit of the
                            world, but if practiced by one who professes to strictly follow Christ, he cannot find an
                            instance of it in any part of his example, and his teaching is against it. If the favorite
                            is vicious and gross, it is corrupting, even to the sensual man, but altogether abominable
                            in the professed Christian. I will not stop to examine any church which does not stand on
                            the Community system, the Christian Church started upon, by this text, but simply say tha(
                            when the Christian Church first started, the apostles following the instructions of Jesus,
                            struck a deadly blow against all partiality. History, the most sacred, declares that they
                            came together and had all things upon the most simple equality. The judgment upon Ananias
                            and his wife, shows that nothing like secret reservation, for selfish purposes, could stand
                            iu that order. Consecration seems to have given admission, reservation places them still
                            outside the church. We learn too, in their history, and in their whole narrative, that
                            houses, lands and possessions were extensively sold, and i proceeds handed over to the Apot
                            and finally to Deacons who were ake distribution to all church memL~_.., consulting the
                            needs of all and nothing else. Here was a blow against partial relationships, partial
                            favorites, partiality in high life, and in low life. The Shakers, as followers of Christ
                            receive this first pattern as the true sample of church relation. We have long been
                            interested in a self-made man or woman, one who could say be was born into this world
                            moneyless, friendless with scarcely a shelter, none to provide him a morsel of bread, or
                            assist him to the first degree of instruction.

                            Jews. The first were the Pharisees. Second, the Sadducees. Third, the Essenes. The Pharisees
                            were those who believed and trusted in Moses, and in the outward ceremonies of the law ; and
                            rejected Christ and neglected to cleanse the heart from sin and defilement; and were
                            analogous to that class, in our day who believe and trust in the outward ceremonies of
                            religion ; and in belonging to some church and who reject Christ in his second appearing ;
                            and depend more on an outward form of religion than they do by an honest confession of all
                            sin, and living a pure life. The Saddurees were those who did not believe in the
                            resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit ; and were analogous to those called infidels,
                            liberalists, independents, and those who deny all religion<pb n="199" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> and even the
                            bible itself ; and make no profession of religion, of any kind. The Essenes were the most
                            remarkable sect among the Jews, and the only class whom Jesus Christ did not reprove ;
                            because they lived lives so very near like his own, and that which he taught his disciples,
                            and the only order with whom he could affiliate. They were virgins. They were not defiled
                            with sexual intercourse. They were clothed in white raiment. Their garments were an index to
                            the purity of their lives. They lived lives of virgin celibacy. They lived in communities
                            and held their property in common, aud were quite numerous. They took in children from the
                            world, while they were young and pliable, and taught them the way of God and how to live
                            without sin, consequently how to be happy, for sin is the cause of all unhappiness. They
                            were analogous to the followers of Christ, in his second appearing, and the communities
                            which followed, founded on peutecostal revivals ; and with propriety might be called the
                            Essenians of the nineteenth century.f It must be admitted, however, that there was an order
                            among the Essenes which did tolerate marriage and offspring, under a protest, to perpetuate
                            the race, not for gratification, therefore they did not allow any sexual intercourse, only
                            for offspring, and that too under the most favorable conditions. Such were analogous to the
                            Moral Reform Societies, both in England and in America, who are beginning to educate the
                            reproductive classes, up to a higher moral standard, which is greatly needed. What is this
                            but history repeating itself ? j t See Josephus., Volume ii. Page 242, 243, &amp;c. X
                            See the foregoing quotations from Josephus, yd" lime second, Page 242, 243. We might,
                            indeed, fear a repetition in history of the second reign of antichrist, were it not for two
                            distinct laws ; viz. The law of Progress, and the law of Evolution. As long as these two
                            laws are in force, the kingdom of Grod which is an inward spiritual work, will increase,
                            while that of antichrist is bound to decrease. This is the reason why Mormonism can never
                            succeed in America; only in numbers, like the Mohammedans, and no better, because the law of
                            Evolution is against them, the civil law is against them; the law of Progress, and the
                            spirit of the age, is against them. Plurality of wives is no antidote against the "social
                            evil;" but if generally adopted would have a tendency to increase it, without improving the
                            race. Therefore, it is destined to become obsolete and reduced to monogamic marriage ; and
                            there let it rest, until the higher law of Christian celibacy can be reached, and
                            practically carried out by both sexes. Much more might be written on this subject, but I
                            choose to be brief.

                            water, which they poured into sieves. He could not restrain his surprise and disapproval.
                            "What a folly !" he cried ; "the water runs out as fast as they pour it in." The angel
                            sternly rebuked him for this second violation of his pledge, and showed him that the fine
                            sieves strained out leaves, and other matter floating in the water, which ran underground,
                            in numerous channels, all over the garden, to refresh the flowers and fruit trees. Peter
                            hung his head, and proceeded for some time in silence. In a little while, however, they came
                            to a gorgeous chariot whose driver was urging, with voice and whip, two pairs of horses
                            harnessed on his right and left� one pair headed to the east, the other pair to the west.
                            Peter forgot all his caution, and his former experiences. Was he not a teamster, and did he
                            not know ? In a loud voice he called to the charioteer, " Fasten your horses all in , the
                            same direction, or you can never move. " Suddenly a bitter repentance fell on him, for he
                            now saw that the horses had wings, and as they strove in contrary directions the chariot
                            rose in the air, as was meant. It was his third offence against the teaching spirit, and the
                            angel put a bandage over his eyes, seized him by the ear, and hustled him out of Paradise,
                            into the sterile place whence he had come. The human is admitted into the society of the
                            angelic, not to criticise, or condemn ; but to love, and assimilate. The first lesson,
                            therefore, is docility. The second lesson is energy. There is a multitude of ringing maxims,
                            with which the wise in all ages have tried to enforce this salutary lesson on idlers,
                            unbelievers, and shivering deserters. " Fortune favors the bold. " " Nothing venture,
                            nothing have." "What will you have? quoth God. Pay for it and take it. " The brawny arm and
                            the heavy hammer arc required to make the anvil of our opportunity ring, and to shape the
                            stubborn masses of our fortune. There are no obstacles which will not go down before the
                            fire and charge of enthusiasm, heroism, and decision. Thrilling voices breathe from the
                            monuments of the mighty dead, and thunder through the dome of fame the truth, '.hat
                            determination, strength, and perseverance, are the three champions of the world. The word to
                            us all is, " Push ahead?" The youth who tried to climb the Natural Bridge of Virginia is a
                            good illustration of this virtue. He had essayed to write his name on the topmost stone. But
                            the crag crumbled beneath his feet; he was fast losing his hold ; there he hung, a hundred
                            feet in<pb n="201" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> the air ; but he could not go back ; it was push ahead, or
                            die. * And he did push ahead; and at last reached the summit in safety. The third lesson is
                            submission. After the most puissant efforts of our knowledge and power, there are multitudes
                            o� facts with reference to which we are equally ignorant and helpless. Herein our best
                            wisdom is modest surrender and acquiescence. Man's freedom is tethered by law, and at the
                            inevitable limit of his energy, he should voluntarily kneel in submission. This is a lesson
                            we are slow to learn ; but nature is fast in teaching it, and experience thrusts it in on
                            our attention from every side, until, sooner or later, we become aware of its import, though
                            it may be not until we are at our last gasp. Perhaps an illustration will cause us more
                            vividly to appreciate this great truth. " A man" says the Oriental legend, " was once
                            sitting with Solomon, 'the sovereign of the Genii, when the Angel of Death, visible in a
                            human shape, passed by, and looked fixedly at him in passing. ''Who is^that?" asked the
                            shrinking companion of Solomon. "It is the Angel of Death," replied the king. "He has come
                            for me!" cried the man, in terror ; " blow me into India." Solomon raised a wind which swept
                            the trembler whither he had desired to be borne, and then asked the dread messenger of fate,
                            why he had gazed so sharply at the man. "Because, he answered, " sent to take him in India,
                            I was surprised to see him in Palestine. " The fourth lesson is faith. How clearly, all the
                            way through one allotted term, we are instructed to believe and trust. Nearly the first
                            thing we learn to do is to place implicit confidence in our parents. We are called to
                            believe in the reality and phenomena of Nature about us, and the beneficence of the order by
                            which we live in time and space. Hinting gleams of a concealed truth and glory, greater than
                            we can dream, awaken strange hopes in our breasts. Above all, the continued inspiration of
                            the Divine Spirit always lives, and works in us forever, breathing balm, whispering
                            promises, lifting veils, solving doubts, preaching glad tidings. Faith will lift us above
                            all the clashing elements of time, and enable us to feel that good will triumph over evil,
                            justice over injustice, right over wrong. " Had you faith to believe," asked a visitor to
                            the ex-president, J.ohn Adams, sitting under the shade of his trees at Quincy, then an old
                            man over ninety years of age,�as his mind went back to the stormy days of the Revolution,�
                            "had you faith to believe, amid it all, that you would succeed?" " Yes" replied the aged
                            veteran, rising and striking the ground with his cane, while the fire seemed to flash from
                            his almost sightless eyes, "I believed that God would guide the old Ship of State safely
                            through it all! " The fifth lesson is , love. Here we come to the crowning lesson of all
                            education. Love is the fruition of our faculties at their goals. God has made each scene of
                            beauty and each strain of music preach to the human soul with mystic eloquence, " Abjure
                            every form of pride and hate, and open thyself to all gentleness and love !" The snarling
                            cynic, soured, scornful, discordant, filled with dislike to everything, can take no comfort
                            anywhere. But the poetic, humane, devout man, who has expelled<pb n="202" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> from
                            every cranny of his being the wicked leaven of selfishness, whose soul overflowing with
                            cordial sentiment, embraces the fair round of nature, .the brotherhood of humanity, and the
                            all blessed Father, he has so learned the lesson of love as to have reached the summit of
                            mortal scholarship, where he clasps the eternal ends of being in their progressive
                            fulfillment. Love will make a heaven of earth, and change all our hells into abodes of
                            blessedness. St. Basil, says the monkish legend, was condemned by the pope to purgatory, to
                            be the companion of devils. But he went among them with so much love and good will in his
                            heart, and such beatific smiles on his face, that the devils all fled from him in dismay.
                            They could not endure the light that beamed from the face of St. Basil. They sent a
                            complaint to Lucifer, their chief. St. Basil was sent to a lower region still. But it was
                            all the same with him ; wherever he went purgatory was changed to heaven ; the devils hid
                            themselves from the light that circled his brow like a halo, and secreted themselves in the
                            deepest caverns of the infernal world. At length, St. Peter, in love to the saint, raised
                            him up to the abodes of the blessed, to be the companion of angels, for it was found that
                            they alone were fit associates for St. Basil. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            the work of convicting souls to righteousness ? Nay, not if they are Christians in thought,
                            word and deed ; for in that case they always have it with them an ever present minister, and
                            need only to put it in use to have the desired results. Conviction of soul comes by soul and
                            hand labor. Not waiting for some miraculous preparation. Power from on high is revealed to
                            those who work, not to those who wai^ while duty calls. The command is not to wait, but " go
                            work in my vineyard.'' Go preach with the promise, " Lo I am with you always. " "Pray
                            without ceasing" is excellent counsel but prayer and work together will bring better
                            results. "Wait upon the Lord" reiterates the Psalmist. '' They that wait upon the Lord shall
                            renew their strength." But this waiting upon the Lord and looking to Him continually for
                            strength is very different from waiting for Him to do our work. It is not waiting for the
                            spirit with folded arms, hoping for some great influx of power, that is going to fill the
                            net with good fish. As well might the invalid expect to get strength by lying in bed and
                            feeling of his muscles or invoking a supernatural power that would supersede personal
                            exertion to walk. Therefore, instead of waiting for the spirit to awake souls to a
                            consciousness of their lives, and produce a revival among them, let us enter upon the work
                            ourselves with perfect faith in God that his Spirit will go with us and give us strength for
                            the day and hour. True faith looks to God and laughs at impossibilities. What has been done
                            can be done again, say the followers of Christ, and with this faith they enter upon the work
                            assigned to them.<pb n="203" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> "Verily the storm rages and the ship is engulfed in

                            the "Offspring of God. " Acts, xxii., 22. The all important question arises ; What was the
                            object of our souls being sent to earth? Was it merely to live an animal existence to eat,
                            drink and gratify the desires of the physical body, or was it tor the glory of God, and the
                            development of the soul? If it was the latter, then ail our efforts ought to be, with energy
                            and all our ability and means, to attain to that exalted condition. Our sojourn on earth is
                            a time of probation to discipline the soul, to endure all trials and sufferings, which
                            through the means of temptation evil spirits throw in our way, to frustrate the design of
                            God. We were not created to be mere machines, but endowed with the gift of volition, to
                            choose between good or evil. If the good works outbalance the evil, there is a glorious
                            reward awaiting us in the spirit world, but if the evil deeds have gained the ascendency,
                            there will be guilt and remorse, and an adequate punishment * the consequence. Life on earth
                            is therefore a constant warfare, it is but a moment to compare to the countless ages in
                            eternity. In our Father's house are many mansions, or spheres. Our souls have to progress or
                            travel from one condition to another, until we have attained and reached the Christ sphere,
                            which is the nearest to God. The time has arrived, which people for tliousands of years have
                            been praying for, the Millennial day has dawned, the marriage feast of the Spirit and Bride
                            is made ready and all are invited to come in, who are willing to come out from among them,
                            to touch not the unclean thing," 2 Cor. vi., 17, and to put the wedding garment on, which is
                            the righteousness of the saints. In Christ's first appearing they saw only as through a
                            glass darkly, the vail of the temple was only rent; figuratively they could have merely a
                            glance into the most holy place, but we read that in Christ's Second Appearing the vail is
                            taken away, so as to see eye to eye, and face to face. Is" there any people on earth who
                            have greater light than Believers, of whom it is required, that they should be " a shining
                            light, a city set on a hill, a standard for the nations to gather to ? When they see our
                            good works, they may praise God in their day of visitation. " Hence our responsibility is
                            great, for " To whom much is given from him much is demanded." To illustrate these remarks,
                            we must keep in mind, that there are four distinct divine dispensations. The first was the
                            Adamic, when the waters of life reached to the ancles. The second was the Mosaic, when the
                            waters reached the knees. The third was Christ's first appearing, when the waters came to
                            the loins, and the fourth was Christ's second appearing, when the waters became so deep that
                            those, who want to cross this river of life, have to swim over it; and the less a person is
                                en-<pb n="204" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>cumbered with earthy affairs, the easier it is for him to swim
                            and to reach safely Canaan's happy shore. During the first two Dispensations was the proper
                            time to multiply and replenish the earth, that is, to obey strictly times and seasons, and
                            the laws of nature, as do all uncorrupted animals. The meaning of the waters going to the
                            loins in Christ's first appearing is this,�They had their choice either to live a pure holy
                            virgin life, such as the Church of Jerusalem did live, who were disciplined after the mosaic
                            law, or to live as those gentile Christian churches did, who had to be fed with milk, and to
                            whom, for the present distress sake, one wife was allowed, for they could not digest strong
                            meat to " make themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. " These last were the
                            antitypes of the outer court of the temple, whilst the former were the antitypes of the
                            inner and holy temple. Nevertheless, the Apostle told these gentile Christians, that the
                            time was short, those who had wives would be as those who had none, that is, the wife became
                            a sister, and the husband a brother. 1 Cor. vii., 2i). He pointed out to them a better way ;
                            "He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the
                            Lord, but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please
                            his wife. There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth
                            for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit, but she that is
                            married, careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband." "iFpr the
                            fashion of the wrorld passeth away. " " Walk in the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the
                            lust of the flesh, for the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
                            flesh, ai-.d these are contrary the one to the other." Gal. v., 1G. The Apostlevadvises us
                            to keep our vessels in sanctification and honor and not in the lust of concupiscence even as
                            the gentiles who know not Cod. Believers have borne for more than a hundred years a strong
                            testimony against all fleshly lusts and we rejoice to see, that some of our friends are
                            waking up to perceive the depravity of man, and loss from God in that way, as will be
                            obvious from the following extract of Tiffany's monthly ; Page 288, August, 1884. "The high
                            destiny of the soul is to perceive all truth, and dwell iu every pure affection, and
                            therefore the laws of its being must have true respect for such destiny. It is for this
                            cause, that all the various pursuits of man after wealth, fame, power or self-gratification
                            in any form have failed to give complete happiness. From this we can understand the origin
                            and nature of sin against the soul. It. may be summed up in one word�'' Lust"�that selfish
                            desire for gratification, which begets all the actions which antagonize with the high
                            condition and destiay of the soul. This lust provokes man to seek gratification in meat and
                            drinks. It breathes its polluted breath into the germinating immortal as, to fulfill its
                            desire, it begets him. It leads him early to eat of the forbidden fruit, and to blind him in
                            the perception of truth, and to convert it into error. The sentence of death is upon their
                            lusts, and when that comas, they can put up their hands, and pluck the fruits of heaven."

                            lives are what we make them. Shut in from all that is external, we are mostly the creatures
                            of the habits we form. We must then form good habits, and become good creatures. As day and
                            night follow each other, we may as well fill our minds with the gleams of one, as with the
                            darkaaess of the other ; as well recall pictures of delight, as those of distress and
                            anxiety. The latter may<pb n="206" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> sometimes visit us and tarry for a little
                            season; but we should never permit them to remain with us. In childhood's joy we come forth
                            to gather flowers, and because we have lost a few, we will not mourn, but rather interest
                            ourselves with those that remain. Sickness and ill health make us painfully dependent, but
                            God forbid our hearts s"hould repine, or our lips murmur. "The earth is the Lord's and the
                            fullness thereof. " It has been said that the cattle upon a thousand hills are his, and that
                            green pastures and running waters are in his hands, and be assured He is now disciplining
                            us, fitting and preparing us to do a work in his vineyard. In the love and good-will of
                            friends who take pleasure in ministering to our necessities, we have a fountain of enjoyment
                            as lasting as the goodness of the human heart. Our Brethren and Sisters are angels of
                            patience, though weary, they toil on for the welfare of all of the household of faith. When
                            I suggest that I am troubling, are not tender arms thrown about me, and do I not hear kindly

                            Father worketh hitherto and I work. I must work the works of Him that sent me while it is
                            day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work." He has promised to reward every man
                            according as his works shall be. Act maketh joy or woe. A man is, what he does, and what we
                            do is ours. And nothing but our own works, or their equivalent, is absolutely and
                            permanently ours. Hence another teacher says " If any will not work, neither shall he eat."
                            Happiness comes not as a gratuity to any, but is gained by labor, and merited by toil.
                            Emerson says truly, "Every man is a consumer, and ought also to be a producer. A man is not
                            a whole man who knows not how to earn a blameless livelihood. A man fails to make his place
                            good in the world unless he not only pays his debts, but also adds something to the common
                            wealth." Therefore, "Work and thou shalt bless the day, ere thy toil be done. " " Tis toil
                            that over nature Gives man his proud control, And purifies and hallows The temple of the
                            soul; It startles foul diseases With all their ghastly train, Puts iron in the muscle And

                            nerve and muscle, puts feebleness and fidgets to flight, and renders the body less pervious
                            to the attacks of disease. Of course it should not be too exhausting, but there is nothing
                            like work, temperately pursued, to drive away the blues, dissipate mists and melancholy,
                            cleanse the humors of the body and clarify the mental horizon. Among the most prolific
                            causes of human misery, hard times, oppressions and poverty, are licentiousness, tobacco,<pb n="207" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> opium, intoxicating drinks, novel reading, and immense swarms of
                            drones who contrive to sponge a living out of society by their wits, or apathy, without
                            rendering an equivalent in useful service. The law appointed to man acquainted with evil,
                            is, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, until thou return unto the ground."
                            Experience proves that attempts to evade this law, are followed by penalties. Idle persons
                            in their desires for ease and pleasure, not only expose themselves to temptation but invite
                            it, and fall an easy prey to its inroads. Hence it has passed into a proverb that idleness
                            is the parent of vice and misery, and it has become an article of popular belief with some,
                            that "an idle brain is the devil's work-shop. " In this way, one vice becomes the progenitor
                            of many, until ignorance, crime, and wretchedness, mar all the pleasant land. "Put your
                            hands to work and give your heart to God," is a divine precept. " Godliness doth not lead to
                            idleness. The devil tempts others, but an idle person tempts the devil. " "To work, to work,
                            is man's divine vocation, All work is worship, holy all employ, And God reultimates His vast

                            escape known in all the works of God, is by performance. You must do your work before you
                            shall be released. No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from
                            knowing ^� doing, is a step out of the chalk circle of imbecility, into fruitfulness. Work
                            is victory. Wherever work is done, victory is obtaiucd. There is no chance and no blanks. A
                            man or woman accustomed to work, is equal to any achievement resolved on. It is the
                            privilege of every human work that is well done, to invest the doer with a certain dignity
                            and self-poise, which enables him to deal on even terms with men of any condition. Every
                            one's task is their life preserver. The conviction that his work is dear to God, and cannot
                            be spared, defends and sustains him." �Emerson. The greatest and most perfect of all good
                            things, are usually the result of laborious exercise, and energetic, vigorous toil. It is
                            absurd for a man in persuit of excellence, to flee from labor by which excellence is
                            acquired. Good associates only with the directing will and permanent purpose. Mt. Lebanon,

                                long list of accidents that are of daily occurrence. To be saved from all of these
                                afflictions or even from one is a subject eliciting our humble thanksgiving to God for
                                his many loving and tender mercies. But if salvation comes as the good Physician,
                                healing us of our many spiritual infirmities, relieving us of the unwelcome bondage of
                                sin and making us able to enjoy the freedom of sons and daughters of God, it is then,
                                indeed, an angel whose presence we may desire from day to day, from month to month and
                                from year to year. Jesus informed his disciples, that lie had come among them to seek
                                and to save that which was lost. Any reader of the old Testament may very readily
                                enumerate a long list of transgressions and trespasses, and mark the crooked paths in
                                which men had walked, while they ostensibly professed to be walking Avith God. It is not
                                at all strange that the testimony of Jesus found so few that were able to accept it. It
                                was a new way, a life of self-sacrifice and crucifixion of all that was sinful He came
                                as the messenger of salvation and permitted them to accept of this saving gift so far as
                                they were able. He found much that was good and worthy of commendation. "Behold, said
                                he, an Israelite in whom there is no guile. " Other spirits of corresponding worth, were
                                no doubt, to be met with as among the companions of Jesus. Salvation had been found by
                                the honest seeker after righteousness, in a greater or less degree, from the earliest
                                knowledge that we have of mankind. It harmonized with the day in which they lived and
                                with the light of God that had been shed abroad in the earth. He came as the divine
                                Teacher, in the fulness of God's love for humanity and established an order in which the
                                test of discipleship was known by this new commandment, "By this shall all men know that
                                ye are my disciples, if you have love one for another. " Jesus accepted a simple,
                                ignorant class of Jews and began to teach them the rudimental lessons of the kingdom of
                                God. These first lessons in righteousness, were, to them the gift of salvation. They
                                were presented in words of simple instruction, in counsels, in reproof and in pleasant
                                stories. Incidents familiar to every Jew were accepted and brought out as lessons, which
                                were to lead the soul to the kingdom of heaven. To impress upon their minds the
                                uncharitableness of the selfish man, he '' rebuked them by saying ; You know not what
                                manner of spirit you are of, S EPTEMBER,<pb n="209" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> The son of man is not
                                come to destroy men's lives but to save them. " When they manifested a jealous spirit,
                                and asked which one of the disciples would be greatest in the heavenly kingdom, he gave
                                them a lesson in humility by placing a little child before them, and then saying, "
                                Except you are converted and become as little children, you shall not enter into the
                                kingdom of heaven." Equally with the degree of acceptance which they accorded to these
                                lessons of the Teacher was the corresponding salvation from sin and selfishness which
                                entered into their souls. Jesus taught as did the messengers of God before him, line
                                upon line and precept upon precept, and these lessons were learned as are those of any
                                class of pupils. First, a respectful obedience to the Teacher, then a separation from
                                the spirit of the world, from strife, coveteousness, evil speaking and defrauding. Men
                                who are deliled by keeping company with those conditions, carry the exhalations with
                                them for many years. Salvation is a work of degrees, so soon as one bad habit or
                                practice or soul defilement is conquered, a measure of this saving grace is secured, and
                                a faithful continuance in well doing, through an honest confession and repentance will
                                give the knowledge of full salvation to God's people by the remission of their sins. No
                                person can pass, at once, from unrighteousness, from a life that has been squandered in
                                selfishness and sin, to one of full c'onsecration to God any more readily than a child
                                can pass from infancy to adult age. A saving, spiritual or religious growth is the work
                                of years upon years. St. Paul understood this fact when he wrote to the Ephesians. " I
                                beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. With all
                                lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love. Endeavoring
                                to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. And to every one is given
                                according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Till we come to the unity of the faith,
                                and of the knowledge of the son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
                                stature of the fulness of Christ. It was a growing salvation, a work of meekness and of
                                long-suffering by the cross of self-denial that would ultimately make them as perfect
                                men and women in the life of Jesus Christ. </p></div3></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="There are very few..." TEIform="index"/>There are very few...

                                other papers. Perhaps our experience at the North family, Mt. Lebanon, may be of some
                                interest and service to the public. For many years wn have used bread made from wheat of
                                our own raising. We wash the �wheat thoroughly, kiln dry, grind it ourselves coarsely,
                                use it unbolted, and bake it in a soap-stone oven. No leaven in it. It is good wheaten
                                bread, and we are certain that it is pure and unadulterated as we are that no deception
                                is possible in the production of spiritual phenomena got up among ourselves arid
                                especially for our own delectation and edification. I doubt whether really good men and
                                women�Christians�can be raised upon poor bread, made of adulterated materials and
                                chemically corrupted by leaven. If a clean thing cannot be brought out of an unclean,
                                then how can a good thing be made out of bad materials? Have not a loaf to spare,

                                        To have it always ready and in good order, with little expense, place in a tall
                                        quart bottle of any kind a gill or so of good lime just slacked with water. Then
                                        fill the bottle with rain or other pure water, and allow it to stand quietly,
                                        well corked. The lime will settle, leaving clear lime water at the top. Pour
                                        this off gently, as wanted, adding more water as needed. Lime water, even when
                                        closely corked, often deteriorates; the carbonic acid in the air unites with the
                                        lime and settles as an insoluble carbonate on the sides of the bottle, which is
                                        nearly impossible to remove. This will spoil the bottle for any other use.
                                        Therefore select one from the store room which is not valued, but which has a
                                        good, tight cover. A wide mouthed bottle is preferable. The lime should be
                                        removed and fresh put in once a year or so, unless kept very tightly corked. A
                                        pint of cold water dissolves less than ten grains of lime, and warm water still
                                        less. The uses to which lime water may be put, are innumerable. If good milk
                                        disagrees with a child or a grown person, three or four tablespoonfuls of lime
                                        water added to a pint of it will usually help digestion and prevent flatulence;
                                        it also counteracts pain from wind in the stomach caused by eating acid fruits.
                                        Over-eating of candies and other sweets will sometimes cause acidity, for which
                                        this is a sovereign remedy. A tablespoonful for a child two years old to a gill
                                        or more for an adult is an ordinary dose, while considerable will have no bad
                                        results ; in fact, it is a simple anti-acid and slightly tonic. A small quantity
                                        put into a mug with the water for cleaning the teeth wilL harden the gums and
                                        prevent soft decay, which is a serious evil which many desire to avert. For
                                        burns and scalds, to two parts of linseed oil add one part of lime water, and

                                        church is a dying church, and a retrograding church is a dead church. The
                                        slumber of an unquestioning acquiescence is dropping buckets in an empty well.
                                        God is leading us upward and onward. He does not expect us to stand still and be
                                        bound within fixed limits. In every good and progressive church there must be
                                        freedom. There are systems, as we see, which God shakes to the ground in the
                                        earthquakes of history, because these systems are means, not the ends. They are
                                        the shadows which men take for the substance, and hold on to them with bigoted
                                        zeal when they should be allowed to give way for the progressive systems in
                                        which the real things are not changed at all. * * * * When doubt is sincere, as
                                        it very often is, then Christians should sympathize ; but when the trouble is in
                                        the moral nature, the doubts are hypocritical. * * * * Quench the life of God in
                                        the soul and soon no star of faith will gleam upon its cheerless midnight. But
                                        what shall we say to those who doubt in sincerity? There are many of them. How
                                        shall we guide these lost mariners to the true course? First, let them begin
                                        with what they know to be true. What are their doubts? About church
                                        organizations, about forms, about popular opinions, about miracles, about the
                                        sun's standing still for Joshua? Well, what oi them. If you cannot believe them,
                                        let them go. They are not essentials. To believe them will not make one wiser or

                                        robbery had been committed by a poor, inoffensive man, of the name of Palmer,
                                        who many of the people in the village said had taken away a wagon-load of
                                        turnips. Farmer Brown, much exasperated by the loss of his turnips, determined
                                        to prosecute poor Palmer with all the severity of the law. With this intention
                                        he went to Mollie Sanders, the washerwoman, who had been busy<pb n="212" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/>in spreading the report, to know the whole truth; but Mollie
                                        denied ever having said anything about a wagon-load of turnips. It was but a
                                        cart-load that Palmer had taken, and Dame Hodson, the huckster, had told her so
                                        over and over again. The farmer, hearing this, went to Dame Hodson, who said
                                        that Mollie Sanders was always making things out worse than they really were,
                                        that Palmer had taken only a wheelbarrow load of turnips, and that she had her
                                        account from Jenkins, the tailor. Away went the farmer to Jenkins, the tailor,
                                        who stoutly denied the account altogether ; he had only told Dame Hodson that
                                        Palmer had pulled up several turnips, but how many he could not tell, for that
                                        he did not see himself, but was told it by Tom Slack, the plowman. Wondering
                                        where this would end, Farmer Brown next questioned Tom Slack, who, in his turn,
                                        declared he had never said a word about seeing Palmer pull up several turnips ;
                                        he only said that he pulled up a turnip. This is a fit illustration of how

Our gardens are growing beautifully with them, and
                                the pink wild'rose begins to blossom in the fields and by the roadside where we love to
                                go and get them. There is much to learn about the rose family. It is a pretty flower,
                                and related to it are many plants and trees that you will be surprised and interested to
                                find classed with the pretty rose. Many flowers resemble each other very much, because
                                they are made from them. Some flowers we find in our home walks and pleasant woods, and
                                then, away in a distant State in a field, or upon a mountain-side, grows its own sister
                                or a near relative. There are books that would aid you in finding these wandering
                                families, though of course you do not expect to see every plant that makes each one, yet
                                there are plenty for us to visit and compare, quite within our reach. Each Summer God's
                                goodness gives us back these lovely roses, and we may be sure that all the rose-like
                                plants are cared for by Him who cares for all. Now I will explain a rose. I will take
                                the little wild one, for it is a real ros�. A large double one is not in its natural
                                state, on account of its cultivation. It has five pink petals a tuft of little golden
                                things in the center called stamens. Now there is a certain tree which has a flower that
                                looks very much like little roses. Strange as it may seem to you, this tree is an apple
                                tree "vith its little roses. They have five rosy petals, and a cluster of paler stamens
                                than the wild rose. This is only one but there are the pear, quince, cherry, a peach
                                too, all delicious fruits, whose flowers resemble roses clustered together. These silky,
                                pink Damasks came originally from Syria; the little yellow Scotch are British; the
                                hundred leafed and Moss came from southern Europe, and the pure white from Germany. So
                                you see you are looking at a rose many times when you do not know it.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="F., I. M." TEIform="persName"/> I. M.

                                had lost its way, and come on earth. It seems as if they could almost do what in reality
                                God alone can do, soften the hard and angry hearts of men. No one was ever corrected by

                            form to themselves three persons in the Godhead, and these all in the male order ! In
                            Genesis we are told that " God said, Let us make man in our image, in the image of God
                            created he him ; male and female created he them." The same as saying plainly that the
                            attributes of male and female, Father and Mother are united to form the Godhead. To come
                            down to later times, the apostle speaking of God says, "The invisible things of him from the
                            creation of the world are already seen, being understood by the things that are made, even
                            his eternal power and Godhead. " What can be more clearly traced through all the works of
                            creation than the two forces, positive and negative, or male and female elements? " The
                            eternal creative power of Deity, preceeding from the order of the Godhead, is the most
                            clearly seen and distinctly represented and demonstrated in nature, by the procreative power
                            of the male and female principles as existing and eternally producing beings and things in
                            their own image and likeness, or after their own kind, throughout all the ranks of creation.
                            These two principles then, are the foundations of all worlds�natural and spiritual." As we
                            pass through the realms of reason and test our theories from this standpoint, it becomes
                            impossible to conceive of the attribute of fatherhood without the corresponding element of
                            motherhood. We find this union in all animate beings. Whence comes it ? From the source of
                            life ; the Eternal Father and Mother of all created things. Why has this idea been so long
                            held in disrepute? Ever since the fall of man and the curse pronounced on woman, she has
                            been held in subordination, as a being quite inferior to man. Through the many ages that
                            have intervened, in the estimation of man, woman has hardly held a place above the brute
                            beasts ; but now, that the seed of the woman is bruising " the serpent's head" light is
                            dawning from the spiritual world, showing that she is the true help-meet and companion of
                            man, his equal in all things. More than this, some rays of light are falling on the darkness
                            which has so long veiled the Godhead, in the mystery of a trinity ; a mystery conceived by
                            the Romish church, fought over for many years, and at length, in the fourth century,
                            canonized and decreed to be an article of faith, which all must subscribe to, or, be
                            punished as heretics. Such is the inconsistency of man, to think to dictate another in that
                            faith which " Is the gift of God ! " Jesus never claimed that He was God. If the expression,
                            "I and my Father are one" proves that He was God, then were the disciples gods, for He prays
                            " that they also may be one in us." Shall we, then, worship the followers of Christ? True,
                            the apostle says, "they were called gods to whom the word of God came," even, were this the
                            case, there would still be as many female as male gods, which would overthrow the doctrine
                            of a trinity. After all that can be said, it is well to go back to first principles and
                            examine the subject carefully, and thus we shall find that there is an Eternal Two in One.
