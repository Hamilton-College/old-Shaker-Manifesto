possessing the unity, variety, and interest of a
magnificent poem. It deals with a series of
facts and exhibits a gallery of characters, which
to have invented would place its creator by the
side of Homer ; and which to realize and represent in the mode Mr. Prescott has done, required a rare degree of historical imagination."

                            Blinn. Ix the family of James Boyd Mother Ann was treated with great kindness, and was free
                            to testify her faith to those who came to see her. As the family were Believers, they felt
                            it their right to hold their religious meetings as often as they thought best. Some of the
                            lower class of the town however, objected and were excited to opposition and finally to
                            persecution. One night several of these sons of Belial, with painted faces and a costume
                            like the Indians, surrounded the house while the family were engaged in worship. The
                            menacing and yells of these false Indians foreboded a serious outbreak. They broke the
                            windows with sticks and stones and at the same time filled the air with threats of what they
                            would do to the people. Papers of powder were thrown into the house, through hope that they
                            would reach the fire place and then explode. In this, however, they failed to do any harm.
                            James did not hesitate to face the mob and to give them a sharp reproof for their wicked
                            proceedings. After a few more attempts to create a disturbance they withdrew from the place.
                            The Elders and those who remained in prison at the old Fort in Albany, were made to suffer
                            by the persecuting<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>spirit of their enemies, who endeavored to keep the
                            Believers from visiting them. A division of soldiers was also quarr tered in the Fort, which
                            included the prison, and by this means the Brethren were confined to a very limited space,
                            and their situation became most uncomfortable. In the month of November, David Darrow was
                            released on parole and permitted to return home to his family, for a limited time. At the
                            expiration of his term he returned to Albany and appeared before the Commissioners, to
                            deliver himself into their charge. But they now refused to receive him as a prisoner or to
                            have any more to do with him. After visiting the Believers who were still confined in the
                            Fort as prisoners, David returned to his family. The Commissioners were earnestly entreated,
                            even while walking the streets, for the releasement of Mother Ann and the Elders. Prayers
                            were incessantly made for their liberty from imprisonment. Overcome by entreaty, the
                            officers of the law, opened the prison doors on the twentieth of December and permitted the
                            Elders and those with them to go free, without even a formal trial. The Elders went
                            immediately to Poughkeepsie to see Mother Ann and to solicit her freedom. Elder James
                            Whittaker presented himself, on his knees, before Gov. Clinton and prayerfully asked for
                            assistance. The Gov. replied, "I will assist you as far as it is in my power. This is the
                            first knowledge that I have received, having reference to the imprisonment of yourself or of
                            any of your people. Had I known it they should have been released, and will give an order
                            immediately to that effect. All the Believers now returned to Watervliet arid were joyfully
                            received, by the Brethren and Sisters, after an absence of nearly five months. Although this
                            persecution was for the purpose of suppressing the work of God in this country, it was by
                            the over ruling hand of Divine Providence, made the occasion of the most extensive
                            circulation of the truth, and laid the foundation for a great ingathering of souls. Visitors
                            from various parts of the states of New York, Mass., and Conn., came to Watervliet to see
                            and to hear the testimony of a people who had been persecuted and imprisoned for Christ's
                            sake, and by seeing and hearing for themselves, they received faith in the work and embraced
                            the testimony. Constant labors were now made in planting, nourishing and building up the
                            faith of the gospel, and in the destroying of sin, root and branch, that souls might be
                            prepared for the Kingdom of heaven. Those who had been the most active in the work, who had
                            been faithful from the beginning and who were deeply interested for the present prosperity,
                            were Joseph Meacham, Calvin Harlow, Elizar Goodrich, Samuel Fitch, Israel Chauucey, Joshua,
                            Cogswell and Hezekiah Hammond. These spiritual labors continued through the winter and
                            spring. During this time the increase of the work was beyond expression. The Believers
                            increased in zeal, in light and understanding. Signs, prophecies, visions and revelations
                            from the spirit of God abounded. The purifying fire of the gospel searched the heart, while
                            the increasing power of salvation, and the enduring substance of eternal life, evinced in
                            every faithful soul the reality of the latter day of glory.<pb n="243" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> Mother Ann
                            converses with Eleazer Grant. Eleazer Grant, Elisha Gilbert and Dr. Averill called at the
                            house of John Spier, in New Lebanon, to see Mother Ann. They came as friends, and were
                            treated in that manner. They informed Mother Ann that they understood by re- j ports, that
                            the English people banished her and the Elders from their country on account of her
                            testimony. Elder James Whittaker made answer, that they were not banished, but that they
                            were persecuted and suffered many things for their testimony both by mobs and by
                            imprisonment. That for more than two years before they left England, they lived in almost
                            entire peace. In the time of their persecution, some who were friendly, advised the
                            Believers to take protection under the King. This they could not do. " We left our native
                            land by the special gift of God and came to America to bring the gospel of good news. While
                            we were in England, we knew by the revelation of God that he had a chosen people in America.
                            We saw some of them in vision, and when we met them in this country we knew them." uXo one
                            came to America with us. except those who felt it to be a special gift to their own souls. "
                            These men disputed that Mother Ann, or the Elders had any knowledge of another world. To
                            this she replied, "I see the heavenly hosts, I hear the angels sing and I converse with
                            them, daily. " Mother Ann then directed her remarks particularly to Eleazer Grant, and said,
                            "I was once as you are. I had feet but they walked in forbidden paths. I had hands but they
                            handled unclean things. I had eyes but they saw nothing of God aright; but now my eyes, see,
                            my ears, hear, and my hands handle the word of life. " The men left the place apparently
                            well satisfied with what they had heard.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Weighty considerations" TEIform="index"/> WEIGHTY CONSIDERATIONS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hampton, Oliver C."

                            selfishness so prevalent, that we find ourselves opposed to making great, and oftentimes
                            even little sacrifices for the comfort and benefit of our fellow beings. And yet it really
                            seems, that is what we were made for. When I was about eight or nine years of age a little
                            episode will give the reader an idea how selfish I was. I lived in a romantic corner of our
                            homestead called the Square House and situated in a beautiful valley. How many hundred times
                            I have longed to go back in my years and live over again the life and scenes connected with
                            that valley and the breezy hills and woods surrounding it. One day the Brethren from our
                            family and a number from the other families went out into the woods to the North of us a
                            mile or so, to fell great oaks to get their bark for tanning. All took their dinners along.
                            When dinner time came however, it was found that the pigs had made a raid on the good things
                            of this life which our Brethren from the village had brought with them. Of course our
                            Brethren from the Square House proposed immediately to shai'e our dinner equally with them,
                            which was gratefully accepted and we all sat down together and quite comfortably<pb n="244" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>and contentedly discussed what there was, and all went off' very pleasantly
                            with all parties except one individual, and that was your humble correspondent who was
                            almost enraged at a most provoking and vexatious liberality which deprived me and our family
                            of half our dinner. How many times in after years have I marveled how I could have been so
                            supremely selfish. What an excellent lesson and matter for serious and reformatory
                            reflection that little occurrence has afforded me during my lite. What a luminous insight
                            into my rudimental selfishness ; to be forever after strictly guarded against in every
                            possible relation I might stand in, toward my fellow beings. The present outlook relative to
                            the prospects and probabilities of our beloved Zion, are ominous and impress me solemnly.
                            For we are to be found watching and praying for constant accessions to our goodness and
                            holiness as individuals ;�and as a church, to be in the perpetual exercise of sacrifice and
                            self'-abnegaiion for the benefit and blessing of all humanity. This dear Brethren and
                            Sisters, is our solemn covenant before God and iti 'he presence of each other, which cannot
                            be ignored in time or eternity. These are the qualities of our heavenly Father and Mother
                            and we are exhorted by our Holy Savior to "be perfect even as they are perfect" including
                            the fartherest stretch of all benevolence (viz.) "making our sun to shine upon the evil as
                            well as the good" and "sending our rain of mercy and love upon the just and the unjust. "
                            How otherwise can we fulfill the conditions involved in our Savior's invocation in Jno.
                            xvii., 21, 22, 23. We cannot be one with Christ as he is one with the Father, only by
                            cultivating and developing in our spirit tke same mercy�benevolence�love�purity etc., which
                            are in them. Now as it is a time of spiritual dearth both in Zion and over the earth
                            generally, and our minds are not necessarily engrossed with the burden of many sinsick and
                            convicted souls flocking to Zion "like doves to their windows." it is a most excellent
                            season wherein to discipline ourselves into that perfect charity and goodness toward each
                            other which is every moment bestowed upon us by our Heavenly Father and Mother. This Kingdom
                            of Heaven is doubtless within us, but we need to rise iuto its realization by practical
                            self-sacrifice of all low rudimentalisms and selfish considerations. Then indeed may we sing
                            "Spring up O well; sing ye unto it: The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people
                            digged it by the direction of their law-giver. " Numb, xxi; 17. This is the well of water
                            springing up into everlasting life, and which is discovered and perpetually enjoyed in the
                            course of every truly self-disciplined spirit. If we will open the doors of the day with
                            prayer earnest and solemn, to walk in this holy discipline of Love, we shall undoubtedly be
                            able to close them in peace and inward consolation. Now if we can be persuaded to make this

                            vii., 20. It has been so often asserted by both the professing Christian and Infidel� the
                            former to justify themselves in mere belief without works, the latter to show the ignorance
                            of the great Teacher� that I have concluded to-day to take their most important questions,
                            with the answers given, and set them before you, in which, also, the consecration to God
                            will be considered, and the possibility shown that it can be made and lived by mortals here
                            below. Querist�"Mr. Eads, I understand you to affirm the possibility and man's capability of
                            practically obeying and following Christ. If so, I would be pleased to have you explain and
                            reconcile some of the commands of the Savior. " Christ says : ' Lay not up for yourselves
                            treasures on earth, and then commands us to clothe the naked and feed the hungry.' "I would
                            ask you to tell me^how I can obey the last without disobeying the first, by laying up
                            treasures to enable me to do it? " Answer�The community to which I belong have been obeying
                            both for more than a hundred years. Christ's command is: "Lay not up treasures for
                            yourselves;" this we do not. Querist�"Have you not been laying up treasures for yourselves
                            for more than a hundred years? If not to whom belong all those tine buildings and rich.
                            wide-spreading farm and gardens if not to yourselves ? " Answer�All you see here is a branch
                            of God's kingdom on earth, all of which belongs to Him, and all who dwell here are his
                            usufructuaries, and have only the use of them ; and it is free to all who will obey and
                            follow Christ in their practical lives. Querist�" Christ further says : 'Take no thought for
                            the body what ye shall eat, drink, or wear.' Do you obey this?" Answer�Most surely we do;
                            all persons who are consecrated to God have no need to trouble themselves about any of these
                            things, and I may say, in this fold, I have never known what I was going to eat until God
                            called me to it, and no matter what I found (and in early days it was very little,) I always
                            knelt before it, asking God's blessing, and the same after partaking, giving thanks, then
                            rise from my knees, and retire, never doubting but that God would call me again when
                            necessary, and never to this day have I been disappointed. All that God demands of any one
                            is to put his or her hands to work where He, by his order, has called them; by faithfully
                            doing this they need take no thought for the morrow, for all things needful will be given
                            them. Querist�'' Christ says : ' If a man take your coat, give him your cloak also.' To obey
                            this may we not have to go naked ? " Answer�This must have been spoken to those who owned
                            coats and cloaks. No consecrated person in the community owns either. God has given us the
                            care aud the use of thes3 things, and we can neither *rive nor sell them with-<pb n="246" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> out his permission, and through his order. Querist�"I now understand you; but
                            you certaiuly have feet and limbs of your own, and Christ says: 'If I compel you to go with
                            me one mile, you must go 'two.' Will you do so? I now demand its fulfillment. " Answer�I can
                            not do it, because the feet and limbs are in the same condition of the coat; they do not
                            belong to me ; they arejiicluded in the consecration ; they are mine only to care for and
                            use ; they are to take me nowhere only as God in his order directs. Any other use of them
                            would lead me into by and forbidden paths. I dare not use them only in God'ts service ;
                            therefore, if I desired, I cannot go with you. The consecration spoken of in the text
                            includes the body and all the faculties pertaining to it, together with the soul, mind,
                            will, and judgment. It is as the Apostle says : "They are God's, and not our own;" and
                            further, " We are bought with a price, and are not the servants of men. " 1 Cor., vi., 23.
                            The order itself must do the same as an example to others. In serving God we are freest of
                            the free, because " we are delivered from the bondage of corruption (under which the world
                            groans) into tht glorious liberty of the children of God. " Romans, viii., 21. This is
                            liberty worth having; it is the freedom of angels, and no other kind is worthy of the name.
                            The good Apostle seemed to comprehend the depth of the consecration better than most people
                            do now. Some think a partial consecration will answer the purpose. One keeps his will,
                            another his judgment, another his tongue, another his lust, and then asks, '�What did God
                            give us these things for if we are not to use them?" Answer�He gave them to be used,
                            controlled or subdued in accordance with his will, not to be let loose and driven by
                            passion, where "every step takes hold on hell " God, though all merciful, makes no
                            compromise with disobedience. The full consecration exempts nothing; we are to see, hear,
                            feel, taste, speak, handle, and do nothing for mere pleasure and no profit. But as the
                            Apostle saith : "' Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
                            glory of God. " 1 Cor. x., 31. Yea, as the text says, "glorify God in the body and spirit,
                            for they are God's and not our owu." It is not difficult to determine, in the use of
                            God-given faculties, whether it is for mere pleasure or profit. Christ said He always did
                            the things that pleased the Father; He was consecrated to God ; so are we, and what He did
                            we should do, all to the glory of God. Hence we should not go to see base ball, horse races,
                            dog fights, nor obscene pictures to merely gratify the lust of the eye ; nor use the ear to
                            hear filthy stories, nor slanders, nor fife, nor drum, nor cannon's roar. We should have no
                            tongue to speak anything but truth. Oh, how much this faculty needs to be guarded ; it is,
                            as the good apostle says, " a fire, a world of iniquity ; it is set on fire of hell. " The
                            same of will, taste and judgment; all must be given to God's service, for " we are His
                            servants and not the servants of men. " All, all the Lord's with nothing reserved ; a full
                            compliance with this will bring to the soul the sweetest bliss wrhich is possible to the
                            highest Archangel. But I return to the colloquy. Querist�" Mr. Eads, you astonish me to
                            expect this much of weak, fallen<pb n="247" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> man. How much easier it is to be saved
                            by faith. Now please allow me to come to some home questions. I do not think it strange that
                            Catholic monks and nuns, with their prison walls, bolts and bars and forced separation of
                            the sexes, with no mingling sociality, are able to live the celibate life ; but this is not
                            following Christ. Excuse me, I am slow to believe in its possibility with those who, from
                            infancy to old age, have enjoyed this sociability, in converse and employment, lodging in
                            the same houses without bolts or bars. Allow me to tell you, it is no vain curiosity that
                            prompts me to be so forward as to ask personal questions on this subject, but I wish to
                            learn the power that faith has in controlling one's actions through life. You are now an old
                            man and widely, honorably kuown, and I am sure you will speak the truth. Now, excuse me, if
                            you please, if I am too personal in my inquiries. I see, by a sketch of your biography in
                            the late history of Kentucky that you was removed, when a young man, sa?,,s ceremonie, from
                            the Order of the Ministry in Kentucky, and set down as a commoner, in the State of Ohio ;
                            this was nearly a half century ago, and I think you might now be willing to tell the reason
                            for this sudden removal, but I will not insist�you need not answer unless you are perfectly
                            willing to do so. Pardon me, if you please, was there no sex about this?" Answer�None
                            whatever. Querist�"It was a great change. ] am curious to know for what departure on your
                            part this move was made? It seems that you was not only taken from the highest order, but
                            was taken out of the State, as though a State offense had been perpetrated. Will you please
                            inform us why it Avas done,?" Answer�I would freely do so if I could, but I cau not answer,
                            because I do not know myself. I presume you enow that few persons are able to see
                            themsel\Tes properly. It is possible I may have grown too tall and needed a dose or two of
                            humiliation p^lls, but of :hat I know not. Querist�"Why did you not ask the reason for the
                            procedure?" Answer�Because it was none of my business. I considered myself consecrated to
                            God, and subject to his order. If I had been requested to go to London, it would have been
                            all the same, and I would have gone, even if I was not told what for ; and now were I
                            requested by the order before me to step down to the lowest rank, and employ myself in the
                            most menial service, I would do it without a murmur, or asking the reason why the
                            requirement was made. Although at times with my obscure vision all seemed dark and gloomy,
                            yet I have always had Go i's blessing, and have been prospered in trustingly obeying his
                            order, knowing that finally " all things would work together for good to them that love
                            God." Rom. viii., 28. Any person or persons, who would demand of the Order the reason for
                            their removal in order to effect a change in the gift felt best for them, or feel out gifts
                            for themselves, and press them on the Order, have not yet made the Apostolic consecration,
                            nor a fruitful travel in Christ's gospel. Querist�" Well, now, for the delicate questions I
                            had thought of asking, and must again beg to be excused. As you have spent your long life of
                            near four score years in familiar converse and social relations with the fair sex, allow me,
                            if you please, without of-<pb n="248" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>fense, to ask you if in all this time, in
                            youth, or vigorous manhood, you have never at any time felt at least a streak of love to one
                            or more, with a desire of marriage ? " Answer�O yea, I have been tempted in all points, as
                            Christ was, but in the particular cases you mention, I found upon critical and minute
                            self-examination, as many streaks of lust as there were of love ; this caused a hesitancy
                            and deliberation, when conscience began to speak and object, and faith stepped in, and the
                            two together enabled me to say as did the Savior: "Get thee behind me, Satan." O yea,
                            fortunes have been offered me, if I Avould fall down and worship the Beast, and each time
                            Christ's words rang in my heart. "What will it profit you if you gain the whole world and
                            lose your soul ? " This one electric flash settled the question. I have almost had his
                            experience in other respects�like Him it is possible I may have been carried to the holy
                            city, and (in imagination) was set on the pinnacle of the temple�where it is possible God
                            may have found me when lie sent me to Ohio to be fed on humble pie for a season ; of this,
                            however, I have not been informed. Querist�"One more question (have patience with me,
                            please) and I will cease to trouble you. Have you, in all these eighty years, never so far
                            departed as to have sexual connection with, or to kiss, or to be kissed, by any fair loved
                            one ?" Answer�Never : neither the one or the other ; and if my sainted and consecrated
                            Mother ever kissed me I am wholly ignorant of the fact. Querisl�" Well, Mr. Eads, I must sav
                            this much : Faith is a much stronger motor than J had supposed, but will add that you have
                            missed a world of pleasure. " Answer�And you. may further add and say : "You have missed a
                            world of pain. " Querist�"Possibly, and I must further confess that your works have been
                            better than mine, if your faith is not. I would prefer being saved by faith alone."
                            Answer�The multitude is with you. " For straight is the gate and narrow is the way that
                            leadeth unto life and few there be that find it.

                            1763. In my childhood I was instructed by my parents in the principles of morality and
                            religion. In my youthful days I became greatly, exercised in my mind about religion. My
                            earnest desire was to find some way of deliverance from sin�some religion which I could
                            depend on for salvation. In the former part of the year 1780, I joined the Baptist church in
                            Ashfield, (as I then lived in that neighborhood,) and continued in communion with it one
                            year. But I could not rest there ; because I could not find that godliness which I had so
                            earnestly desired, nor could I obtain power and victory over sin. I still found myself
                            destitute of Christ, and felt my soul reaching forward to find something that I could rest
                            upon�something that would feel like an enduring substance. When I heard of Mother Ann aud
                            the Elders, from the very nature of the report, I believed them to be the true followers of
                            Christ, and from the operation of the Divine Spirit in my soul I was fully confirmed in it,
                            and felt a great desire to go and see them. In February, 1782, I visited them for the first
                            time, at Harvard, being then eighteen years of age. Mother Ann received me with kindness,
                            and taught me the way of God. I felt full confidence in her testimony, and had a privilege
                            to confess my sins. This 1 did in the sincerity of my soul, as doing it to God, in the
                            presence of his witnesses, and found great releasement of mind by it. I then fell a full
                            assurance of salvation, provided I kept my faith and obedience, which, through the mercy of
                            God, I have never lost to this day. Some time in March following, Mother and the Elders
                            visited Ashfield, and took up their residence at the house of Asa Bacon, not far from my
                            father's, where they tarried about two months. While they were there I was with them most of
                            the time. When they left Ash-<pb n="250" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> Held I returned to my home. The next
                            fall they came to Ashfield again, and tarried till the spring following. I spent most of my
                            time with them. In the fall of 1783, I went to Watervliet, and lived with Mother Ann till
                            her decease in September, 1784. Taking the time all together, I lived in the house with Her
                            about a year and a half. Part of the time I lodged in the same room with her, and ate at the
                            same table, and was subject aud obedient to her in all things as a child. Indeed 1 felt
                            myself as a child blest with the best of mothers. Yea, I loved and feared her, because I
                            found that the spirit of Christ dwelt in her, and her life was a life of purity. She taught
                            me the way of God, and how to walk in it. She taught me to take up my cross against my own
                            carnal nature and all its propensities, and to forsake every sinful way and follow Christ in
                            righteousness ; and she promised that, in so doing, I should find full power and victory
                            over sin ; which I have found to be true. There have been many false and scandalous reports
                            published and circulated abroad in the world concerning Mother Ann ; but I certainly know
                            for myself, that she was not such a person as her enemies have represented. She was the most
                            temperate woman I ever was acquainted with, and an example of chastity aud godliness to all
                            womankind. She was, in truth, a woman who feared the Lord and faithfully served him. These
                            things I know, for I was with her at all times and seasons, in public and in private, by day
                            and by night, in her sorrows and sufferings, as well as in her joy and comfort. The conduct
                            and conversation of Mother Ann and the Elders, was at all times according to the gospel. I
                            have enjoyed many precious privileges with them, and have received much heavenly instruction
                            and much good and wholesome counsel from them, both in public aud private. They were
                            faithful in their duty, at all times, " both in season and out of season. " In teaching,
                            admonishing, reproving, encouraging and comforting, they spared no pains. Mother Ann,
                            especially, was always alive in the work of God. Her spirit seemed wholly devoted to God,
                            and in reproving sin she was like a flaming sword ; yet she knew well how to separate
                            between the precious aud the vile. She would not indulge any evil propensity in herself nor
                            in others ; yet her charity to souls disposed to repent and turn to God, would often seem to
                            melt her soul in tears. I cannot feel the least doubt or scruple of her being a chosen woman
                            anointed of the Lord, any more than I can doubt her existence. These things I can testify ;
                            because I have seen and heard aud felt them, and know them to be true. And I feel myself in
                            duty bound to maintain the cause of justice and truth, and to stand as a witness against
                            injustice and falsehood. Mother Ann's spirit and testimony was a swift witness against all
                            sin ; and this is the very reason why such a flood is cast out of the mouth of the dragon
                            against her, to try, if possible, " to destroy the remnant of her seed ;" but ''the earth
                            will swallow up the flood." Balaam may come from the east aud try to curse ; but the Lord
                            will bless. The present generation of people boast much of living in an enlightened age, and
                            of being blessed with the bright effusions of the gospel of light; and yet how few there are
                            who appear to under-<pb n="251" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> stand even the plain and simple comparisons which
                            Jesus Christ made of the natural things of time and sense ! There are many who do not seem
                            to understand that a tree is known by its fruit ; that a thorn-bush cannot bring forth
                            grapes, nor figs grow on thistles. "0 faithlecs and perverse generation !� How is it that ye
                            do not understand?" Many Bible Societies have been formed, and missionaries have been sent
                            abroad with the professed object of spreading the sacred truths of the gospel of Christ, as
                            recorded in the scriptures ; yet blindness and ignorance are so prevalent at home, that the
                            people " are like the heath in the desert;" they know not Avhence good cometh. It is indeed
                            lamentable that darkness, depravity and loss have so covered the earth�that such a vast
                            portion of the human race are so involved in blindness that they do not know the day of
                            their visitation. How evident it is that the Jews did not know, though they were called
                            God's chosen people: for if they had known that Christ was the Lord from Heaven, they would
                            not have crucified him. 1 Cor. ii., 8. And did the Gentiles of that day know any better? Or
                            do those of the present day know any better? There are but few, in this day, who will
                            pretend to deny the agency of the first woman in leading mankind into sin. Why then should
                            it be thought incredible that the agency of a woman should necessarily be first in leading
                            the human race out of sin ? Mother Ann's testimony and example, evidently show that she was
                            led by a spirit totally opposite to that which led and influenced the first woman. To the
                            truth of this, all who have heard her testimony and faithfully followed it, can bear"witness
                            ; because they have in reality, been led out of sin ; and they are able to testify that,
                            "she taught as never woman taught before. " I was present at the funeral of Mother Ann. Many
                            people from Albany and the neighborhood around us, attended with solemnity. Elder James
                            Whittaker and others of the Believers addressed the Assembly, at her grave, with much
                            feeling. Samuel Fitch said that, " the deceased had been one that had faithfully served the
                            Lord; that she had been greatly persecuted by the wicked ; that she had l'een more
                            persecuted than any other person in his knowledge ; and the reason was, she had more of God
                            in her than any other person in his knowledge. " I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ in
                            its first nor second appearance ; for it has been '' the power of God unto salvation" to me
                            ; and for it I feel to give thanks to God always. These things I have testified from my own
                            knowledge and experience, and have written them with my own hand. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                seen<pb n="252" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> is not hope ; what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for ? If
                            we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. Now we see through a
                            glass darkly, but then face to face ; now I know in part, then shall I know even as I am
                            known. The Apostle at one time, having a spiritual sight of himself, exclaimed, "O wretched
                            man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" Thank God through Jesus
                            Christ our Lord, there is deliverance through a living faith which works by love, purifies
                            the heart and overcomes the world. The first man Adam was of the earth earthly ; a.
                            generative man after the law of a carnal commandment. The second Adam was Jesus Christ, the
                            Lord from heaven, a quickening spirit, who is made not after the law of a carnal
                            commandment, but after the power of an endless life. A Regenerator,�a term significant in
                            that it cuts off the works of generation. The Prophet Daniel said of Jesus, " Who shall
                            declare his generation?" Who shall declare the generation of his true followers who daily
                            deny themselves of all that constitutes the world and follow Christ their Lord in the work
                            of regeneration, until they, like him can say in truth we have overcome the world. The
                            apostle Paul says that Jesus hath appeared, to put away sin, by the sacrifice of himself. He
                            also says many things are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
                            come. St. John informs us what the ends of the world are. He says all that is in the world,
                            the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but
                            of the world. Be of good cheer, said Jesus for I have overcome the world. "Him that
                            overcometh the world, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as 1 overcame, and am
                            set down with my Father in his throne. " "I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that
                            believeth in me though he were (previously) dead (in trespasses and sin,) yet shall he live
                            ; and whosoever liveth (the Virgin Life) and believeth in me shall never die." This is the
                            Resurrection. "They that are accounted worthy to attain that world and the resurrection from
                            the dead, neither marry nor are given in marrage ; but are as the angels in heaven. " The
                            Lord hath promised to create new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness;
                            and that the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind. The former shall pass away
                            with a great noise, and St. John in his vision beheld the old Adamic heaven depart as a

                            one. Not being properly directed it failed to reach me as soon as it otherwise would. I am
                            pleased to be reminded that you have not entirely forgotten your old friends. I know of no
                            better way of expressing my regard and interested feelings for you than by proffering a
                            little friendly advice. This I trust you will accept and consider as from one who desires
                            your prosperity morally as well as materially. Firstly, let me urge upon you the paramount
                            importance of industry as a foundation pillar for success and happiness. Squander not a
                            moment. Every fragment of time should be utilized for your improvement.<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> From your description of your present, employment, I should not think it calculated to
                            encourage industrious habits. I have reference to the unseasonable hours of its duration
                            rather than the character of it. However it may be the best you can do at present. A very
                            large part of the day is left you to dispose of in cue way or another. It is in the disposal
                            of this that I am concerned. Your business has one point to recommend it. Obliging you to
                            rise early, the keeping of late hours is prevented. You can use your leisure time to no
                            better advantage than to devote it to reading. Select some good reading matter and establish
                            a taste for reading by every means you cau command. Discard all sensational matter, sr.ch as
                            novels of the yellow covered variety, love stories etc. Such fictitious reading distorts the
                            mind, unfitting it for that of a substantial nature. There is an abundance of good
                            literature, the perusal of which will develop and expand the mind and aid in moulding a
                            respectable and lovable character. Were I to pursue the tenor of my feelings I would counsel
                            you to be particularly careful in your choice of companions. Bad companions and bad books
                            are alike pernicious in their influence. Shun them both as the emissaries of the devil. Let
                            the sphere of your acquaintanceship be small and, select, rather than large and promiscuous.
                            Turn a deaf ear to the pleadings of either internal or external influences to engage in
                            anything which your conscience condemns. Be honest in word and deed. Be economical in your
                            expenditures. No matter how much you earn, spend no more than your necessities require. You
                            cannot begin too soon to save for a "rainy day." When you cau and desire to, come and see me
                            and perhaps you will want to live with me. Hoping to hear nothing but good from and of you.

                            long ago Leaned there and knew his peace. And the brave toil worn soldier Has gained a sweet
                            release. A wail of bitter mourning, From myriads doth rise. But it cannot drown the peans Of
                            welcome from the skies. To him that overcometh, This is the strain they sing. He shall have
                            power forever In the city of our King. And the many he has rescued Shall join the loud
                            acclaim, And bless him for the work he wrought Tn the Redeemer's name. Groveland, N.

                            with pleasure appreciate the spirit in which it was penned. Formerly the manner<pb n="254" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>of treatiug such subjects as we have broached, was dogmatic and controversial,
                            the parties assuming an antagonistic attitude, the main effort being to stultify one
                            another. The more becoming attitude in the present state of spiritual and physical
                            knowledge, is to make a statement of facts with their collaterals, as seen from the
                            individual's stand-point, seasoning the whole with the feeling, that we are but the mediums
                            for an influx and reflux of truth and good. With regard to your first position ; the order
                            and harmony visible in the creation of physical things, forbids any other conclusion than,
                            that, it is the mind and will of the Creator, that man should constitute a happy and
                            harmonic order of Society. As regards the second, under these harmonial conditions, nuui
                            could have brought forth his likeness in justification. Your third rests on the second,
                            therefore, the above covers the ground. But if man has lost his harmonial relationship,
                            everything lie does, whether propagating his species, or anything else must be out of joint,
                            wrong, sinful. Your efforts to bring man back to harmonial relationships and your personal
                            toils and triais (though never seen with my natural eyes) are before me, and induced me to
                            present you with an analysis of the forces which has brought forth the Adamic, and Angelic
                            orders of Society. If Society is to be reconstructed on the Adamic plane, the forces of that
                            plane alone can operate. If on the Angelic, the forces alone of that plane can operate. They
                            cannot be mixed. And an examination of evidence primafacie and analytic ; scriptural and
                            philosophic on the subject, will lead to the conclusion, that matrimony is of the world ;
                            that the children of this world marry anu are given in marriage ; and that those who account
                            themselves worthy of a higher life, " neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as
                            the angels arc in heaven. " By accepting Jesus as a celibate from principle, I find his life
                            logical throughout. If circumstantially only, [ do not find him so. Had it been his mission
                            to have regulated the race on the procreative plane, and leave them there, He and his
                            followers to be full and perfect patterns, ought to have married, that they and their
                            families might have been examples of a true, natural, and harmonic life. But neither Jesus,
                            the Apostles, nor the Pentecostal Church, set such an example. The memorable saying of the
                            Apostle '�'the younger widows refuse, for vvh?n they have begun to wax wauton against
                            Christ, they are willing to marry, having cast off their first faith"�the faith once
                            delivered to the saints by Jesus, sets the matter at rest on that point scripturally. You
                            inquire "if our order of Society is designed or expected to become universal here on earth?"
                            Strait is the gate that leadeth unto the higher life, and few there be that find it at
                            present. But if it should become universal, the race would become extinct. On that subject
                            we have no doctrine to present, nor dogma to assert. Believing that, "that which is natural
                            is first, and afterwards, that which is spiritual." The order of the world exists here, and
                            in the spirit land. The order of Christ's kingdom exists here and also in the spirit land ;
                            its universality does not lie with us either here, or in the laud of souls, and so we leave
                            that matter. The voice<pb n="255" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> on earth is " whosoever will, let him come" the
                            voice in the laud of souls is the sataCi If it i� the design of God to bring the 1'ace to an
                            etld, I presume you will think with Us, that it would comport more with mercy and love, to
                            have it brought to ah end, by the free choice of the race to ascend into a higher life, and
                            so he harvested spiritually, than to have the earth peopled to its utmost capacity, and then
                            suddenly atid painfully exterminate all its inhabitants. Years ago, our friends of the order
                            of the world, were in some trouble, because we held to the non resurrection of the body ; by
                            perseverance public opinion has changed on the point; hence we find some room to hope, that
                            the bugbear "running the world out" will also drop off. Outside of our order, the subject of
                            matrimony is beginning to be understood as we understand it; and bye and bye, well informed
                            persons of the world will see as clearly as we do, that the matrimonial order of Society,
                            and the angelic, are organically distinct; or to use a chemical phrase, atom-ically
                            incompatible, that is, the forces that inhere in the one, cannot coalesce with those, which
                            inhere in the other, or form an organic whole. The order and beauty of the atomic
                            arrangement of the primary particles of matter, and tl e forces thereof, which compose our
                            planet, when measurably known, will I have reason to believe, throw light on spiritual
                            matters not clearly seen at present ; and will form a physical foundation to an
                            understanding, of the now invisible things of God; which, bye and bye, will be clearly seen
                            by the things that are made. Agaiii, \yjth regard to the extinction of the race ; netting
                            aside the geological and astronomical considerations of the subject ; how long man may be
                            able to sustain himself physiologically on the earth, can only be a subject of conjecture. 1
                            have some suspicion that the whites, cannot endure as long as the blacks, and that the
                            latter will exist a long and lengthened period after the former has disappeared. And with me
                            it is an open question, whether it would Hot be well for all the other races, to have the
                            white gathered home to God in the line of Shaker Communities and taught to bear faithfully
                            the cross of Christ against their warring enslaving, greedy, grasping, and cruel
                            dispositions ; lust-gratifying, and disease begetting doings, than to have them go on as
                            they have been doing for these centuries past. But this perhaps desirable consummation
                            cannot be effected at present, because my worthy friend whom I have the happiness to
                            address, and others of his standing, are not yet gathered home to the fold of Christ, to be
                            taught of his spirit, fitting them to be indeed subjects of his kingdom, and fitting them at
                            the same time to be kings and priests unto God and to the Lamb, an1, to their poor white
                            brethren who need redemption from sin, and that, that induces thereto. Yours with much

                                spiritual life, led arid governed by a growing inspiration is quite evident from the
                                testimonies of Christ and his immediate followers. Belonging as it does to the
                                resurrection order of souls, it must stand above and beyond all that claimed a
                                fellowship to the old dispensation or worldly inheritance. The Church now becomes a
                                laborer and occupies the place of the sower that went forth to sow. Some of the seed may
                                fall on good soil, and some may fall on poor soil, all of which will be determined in
                                the day of harvest. W the Church, through neglect, fails to sow the word of God, the
                                apostle warns us of what will be sure to follow. Whatsoever a man, a family or a Church
                                soweth, that also they shall reap. God's law falls with equal force upon the just and
                                the unjust. lt He that overcometh shall eat of the iree of life. He that walkcth
                                uprightly and worketh righteousness, and spcaketh truth in his heart. " This comes from
                                God and those who live in this light and in the testimony of Jesus Christ, can never die
                                any more than Christ, the Son of God, can die. The Church must be the living exponent of
                                the peaceable fruits of righteousness, which will aid mankind to become friends of
                                humanity and earnest advocates of the much anticipated millennial age. In the
                                consecration which is demanded, the bodies as well as the souls are to be included.
                                "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto the Lord, which is
                                your reasonable service. " " Ye are the temples of the living God, He that defiles this
                                temple, him will God destroy." These religious lessons so well calculated to promote
                                this new order of life are brought forward and forcibly impressed upou the mind as
                                imperative for the obtaining of a full reward of the proffered earthly and heavenly
                                treasures. The acceptance of the testimony of Jesus, in its fulness, positively assures
                                the disciple of an hundred fold reward of God's blessings on the earth, and in the world
                                to come, Eternal life. Iu this church the disciple is to learn that good will, is to be
                                the ruling element, and that all men will become brothers and the children of one
                                creative mind. The voice of the peacemaker so essential to our happiness in this life
                                will have a loving influence wherever the spirit of the Lord finds a place of rest. We
                                are well assured that the children of this world have been diligent workers for the
                                increase of mammon through many thousands of years, and that the care of self and
                                selfish relations have <pb n="257" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> reached the ascendency that quite
                                overshadows all the better qualities of the mind. The dark state is so apparent and the
                                daily transactions of life so clearly manifest that even the most careful among men, at
                                one time, thought that the evil quality largely predominated, and that no mas could be
                                found that did good, no, not one. The tendency has seemed to be powerfully toward the
                                interest of the earth and to the cultivation of its relations in the soul. In the time
                                of all this darkness Christ came as a spiritual light and his message is, God's love to
                                r.-.sin. On this foundation, his church is built. Peaceful relations will follow and
                                these, in time, will bring that prosperity which has been promised to all the fa'tlit'ui
                                Sons and Daughters of God. The Church of God is ihe home of the resurrected sou!, a
                                place where the poor in spirit may find rest, far away from the passions which rule the
                                lives of the children of this world. It is the privilege of the seeker after
                                righteousness to share ii the blessings of this heavenly tinier where the treasures of
                                the Kingdom can never be harmed by moth or rust, and which the wicked can never take
                                away. Our faithfulness in the consecrated inheritance of God's people is the sure test
                                of our discipleship, and we shall do well to regard, in all carefulness, the apostolic
                                advice,� ;iHold fast that which thou hast gained, let no one take thy crown.

                                        is any greater than it would have been had no stimulants been used. It has been

                                        stomach which is benumbed by ice water is practically paralyzed. It can neither
                                        secrete, absorb, nor contract upon the food." And further, that i'the sudden
                                        chilling of the stomach by the drinking of ice water, eating of ice cream,
                                        swallowing pieces of ice, etc., is a very hazardous proceeding, and one which
                                        those who value health above the transient gratification of a depraved taste
                                        will sedulously avoid." A weak solution of salt and water is recommended by good
                                        physicians as a remedy for imperfect digestion, and for a cold in the head it is
                                        a complete cure snuffed from the hollow of the hand. We have Known severe cases

He is
                            generally a male, but there are premonitory symptoms that he will soon make his appearance
                            in the female also. The crank has never received a systematic education. His early training
                            having been neglected he is prone to spell God with a small g, but never, nay never, will he
                            fail to employ a capital in the personal pronoun I. He reads a book or hears a lecture�no
                            matter what the subject�he there meets with ideas or learns of facts hitherto unknown to
                            him, and he immediately pounces upon them as his individual property. His education is
                            finished. If he ever condescends to absorb any further information, or if he stoops to
                            notice the facts of human experience, they are all twisted and tortured to conform to his
                            fixed idea. Henceforth he has a mission. In season and out of season, wherever opportunity
                            offers, he will inflict his platitudes upon his unfortunate fellow men. The capital upon
                            which the crank works is a borrowed idea, an adamantine cheek and a tongue hung in the
                            middle. If he is a married man, you may at once pity the wife; if he is unmarried, lie is
                            either a libertine or a hater of women. Rarely is he a worker; lie is content to let others
                            do the world's drudgery. He has no reverence for the religious opinions of others : ego is
                            the only God he worships. In politics, ten to one he will be a mugwump. He has tried his
                            hand at perpetual motion, and still thinks that if he only had time and means he could
                            demonstrate it. If he is a temperance man, he will present his arguments in a very
                            intemperate manner. He always wants to reform something or somebody; he never dreams of
                            reforming himself. He is not a pleasant person to meet, for in his self-conceit he
                            monopolizes all the conversation. There is one thing which the crank never is, namety, a
                            humble, devout and consistent Christian. The crank is aperson in whom self-esteem lias
                            become so abnormally developed that he has lost the true sense of his proper relation to his
                            environment. Hath then the crank no use? He hath; so has the mosquito and the potato-bug,
                            but, like them, his useful purpose has not as yet been discovered. What are you going to do
                            with him? If you oppose him he will strike an attitude before the world as a martyr; if you
                            seek to convert him, he will talk you blind. Let him alone. He is a nuisance. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                some of us went out to see the apple blossoms. It was a pleasant evening and we all
                                enjoyed the walk very much. The trees looked beautifully�some blossoms were entirely
                                white and others were tinted with pink. They grow in little clusters five or six in one
                                bunch. They all grow to be little tiny green apples, then drop leaving one, and that
                                grows to a nice round apple which I am sure all like to taste. We found some very pretty
                                violets in our walk also. We enjoyed the pleasant evening and the walk very much. I am
                                very much pleased with my garden and will try to keep it from weeds, which grow up so
                                fast. I have planted some Candy Tuft around the edge, and I think it will look very
                                pretty. Once I found a piece of quitch-grass with a root twenty-six inches long. It is
                                very troublesome because when you try to pull it up it sometimes breaks off in the
                                centre and then it grows again. I am very much interested in Arithmetic. The class are
                                to go from page 181 to 207, which takes us over to duodecimals. I will improve the time
                                given to learn and in this way learn to become a good and useful sister.

                            reminded of the many thousands now living upon the earth that are in the spring-time of
                            their lives that possess all the health strength and vigor that rightfully belongs to |
                            youth. We understand that the buds do not form on a tree until the sap has started, also
                            that it has the appearance of a lifeless object through the Winter months during which time
                            it retains the germ of life and when spring-time comes with its bright warm sunshine and its
                            pleasant April showers, the sap which has flowed only through the roots and trunk is
                            distributed through the branches and small twigs, and the buds begin to swell and finally
                            burst forth in loveliness of bloom filling the air with its fragrance. The whole tree seems
                            full of life and strength, but let a destroying worm find its way to the tree and there
                            perform its destructive work we should see in due time that something was M*rong although
                            for several months the tree does not appear to be other than in good condition, it will
                            sooner or later show the effects of the little worm's work. It is just so with our lives
                            although we may appear well in the sight of others if we harbor the selfishness of an
                            unthankful heart, slander, pride or any of the evils either inherent or acquired it will
                            sooner or later tell upon our lives. On the other hand every little act done unselfishly,
                            every little step of obedience also, every kind word or smile given to encourage those who
                            are perhaps a little weaker than ourselves will be one step nearer heaven and happiness and
                            will finally enable us to stand as a power for good and not for tjvil. I believe that when
                            one is striving very hard to discard an evil they should fill the vacancy left, directly
                            with good or else we should be like the man who swept and gar- j nished his house, then grew

                            natural propensities are ever at war with the things of the Spirit, until the victory is
                            gained through' the second birth, when we shall have "Put on the new man, which is after the
                            likeness of God, created in righteousness and true holiness." "Love is the fulfilling of the
                            laAV. " " Him that overcometh, will 1 make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go
                            no more out; and I will write upon him the name of ray God, and' the name of the city of my

                                of Pictures is the title of twelve short talks upon art with young people,.by Mrs. Sarah
                                W. Whitman. They deal with the principles which underlie the various branches and
                                processes of art�oil and water-color painting, etching, engraving, photography and the
                                reproductive processes. This instruction is prefaced by a chapter upon "The Beginnings
                                of Art Training," and supplemented by �ne upon " Exhibitions and Sales. " Although the
                                volume is not a large one, it contains more sound, practical sense regarding art than
                                most of the elaborate and costly works that have been written upon the same subject. Its
                                author is an artist and understands fully what she is writing about. She has ,-i direct,
                                straightforward style, opinions based on study and experience, and competent reasons for
                                them. She insists that in art, as well as in morals or in mathematics, there are great
                                laws to go by, and that without a knowledge of these laws one cannot speak of pictures
                                intelligently. Art is not mere imitation ; it is the expression upon canvas or paper,
                                not only of what the artist sees, but of what he feels and thinks, and this is done in
                                accordance with the laws of composition, of form, of color, and of light and shade.
                                However simple a picture may seem to be, the making of it involves careful and obedient
                                intelligence to all these laws. In the chapters upon the processes, Mrs. Whitman docs
                                not attempt to instruct farther than the broad, underlying principles of each, so that
                                the book is not in any sense a " handbook." To the young reader with a taste for art in
                                any of its forms it will afford valuable assistance . </p></div3></div2><div2 type="recipe" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hydrated farinacea" TEIform="index"/> HYDRATED FARINACEA.</head><p TEIform="p"> Or how to cook oat, and whole wheat meal'.

National   Metropolis."
Mail robberies were not uncommon in those days,
although the crime was punishable with imprisonment or death. One day one of Reeside's coaches
was stopped near Philadelphia by three armed men,
who ordered the nine passengers to alight and stand
in a line. One of the robbers then mounted guard,
while the other two made the terrific 1 passengers
deliver tip their money and watt lies, and then rifled
the mail bags. They were soon afterward arrested,
tried, convicted, and one was sentenced to imprisonment in ihe penitentiary, while the other two were
condemned to be hung. Fortunately for one of the
culprits, named Wilson, he had some years previously, at a horse-race near Nashville, Tennessee,
privately advised General Jackson to withdraw his
bets on a horse which he was backing, as the jockey
had been ordered to lose the race. The General
was very thankful for this information, which enabled him to escape a heavy loss, and he promised
his informant that he would befriend him whenever
an opportunity should offer. When reminded of
this promise, after Wilson had been sentenced to be
hanged, Jackson proinpth- commuted the sentence
to ten years' imprisonment in the penitentiary.

Be affectionate in your general school-room

chief attraction. It is too wearing upon the
nervous system. Use this heart fervency as
a stimulant to love of school. See to it that
it is the love of tlie school rather than love
for yourself tliat Isolds them. Love for the
teacher must come first : love for the school
must be developed : love for knowledge must
follow; and the end must be love for the use
of knowledge. The teacher who knows how
to win the love of her pupils is a good teacher, but she who knows how to transfer it is a
greater teacher.� The American Teacher.
Simplicity is the invariable characteristic
of truth.
