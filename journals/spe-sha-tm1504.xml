INFORMATION POE INQUIRERS.
For the better understanding of those who
wish to know of the rules and regulations of
our religious home, we have prepared the following hrief summary. Further information
may he obtained by addressing any member
of the order.
1.  The form of government in the Society is adapted to the different orders of
which it is composed : its powers and authorities growing out of the mutual faith,
love and confidence of the members.
2.  No one is excluded from the privilege of becoming a member on  account
of poverty ; nor will   they  be accepted
because of wealth.
3.  Plain and explicit facts will be laid
before the investigator.    To   become a
member, is a voluntary concession of the
individual.
4.  Those who accept the privilege to
reside with us, as well as those who visit the Society as inquirers, are expected
to regard the rules of the family where
they are entertained.
5.  By the  principles   of this Society,
no believing husband or wife is allowed
to separate from an unbelieving partner,
except by mutual or legal agreement.
G. Parents that become members are
not required to give up their children :
but they will be requested to see that the
children keep the rules of the family.
Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by
the request or consent of those who have
the lawful right over them.
7.  No corporal punishment is approved   tn   the  government of the  Society,
nor any external violence exercised on
any rational person.
8.  It is expected that the children admitted iuto the Society, will receive an
education suitable for the general management of business.
!). Probationary members may retain
the lawful ownership of their property,
but the interest accruing therefrom will
be devoted to the benefit of the Society,
until by their own free will, and the consent of the Trustees, they shall conseerate sai3 property to the support of the
family where they reside.
10.  The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to the time of their membership.
11.   Those who dispose of their property   to   relations   in   the worldly order,
should remain with those relations.
12.  A person   wishing to   become  a
member of the Society,   must rectify all
his wrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims.
13.  Those  who   ask for admission to
our Home   arc   supposed to be in search
of more truth   and light,   hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church,
is the confession   of sin to   God,   in the
presence of a witness.
14.  Those who have dedicated their
property, and afterward withdraw from
the    Society,- -according to the law  of
justice andequity, there can be no ground
for retraction.
15.  To live   as  Brethren and Sisters
in the gospel of Christ, we can hold no
private correspondence.    All communications sent  from or received iuto   the
family,  whether printed or written, will
be subject to the examination and advice
of the Elders of the family.
1G. The leading authority of the Society is vested in a Ministry, consisting
of two Brothers and two Sisters. Elders
and Trustees are also appointed. These
orders constitute the general government,
of the Socieiy, in all of its branches.A D VER T1SEMEN TS.

                            smoothly, peaceably, unruffled ; the most ferocious man of nature can do this. When the
                            oppressor, the slanderer or evil workers are abroad and take the field against us, who can
                            be calm and long-suffering then? Undertake to strip the worldly man of his property, his
                            character or his liberty, insult or smite him, and the chances being equal, he will turn and
                            tight or perhaps slay you on the spot. This is characteristic of the political man. When
                            abused he calls to his aid the most stern passions of his nature. The lion, the tiger, the
                            savage, when deeply stirred, depends upon his ferocity and strength for battle and conquest.
                            It is so with a host of men, they place no reliance on Divine power for aid, they depend on
                            themselves, and when triumphant, they take to themselves all the glory. It is so with the
                            combatant, and more especially so with the hero. Our Lord saw the race in this condition as
                            a man boholds himself in a mirror. Under the full view of man's murderous resentment, he
                            uttered this God-like rule of action for the Christian. uYe have heard that it hath been
                            said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, but I say unto you, that ye resist not
                            evil. " Whatever war-like resistance, political power delegates to the earthly man, Jesus
                            takes it all from him, when he enrolls himself under his banner. He then stands him out in
                            the sight of all, on the quiet plain of non-resistance. If he professes to be truly rising
                            with <pb n="74" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>Christ, he must have, all that is ferocious and combative beneath
                            on the earth plane. As a child of God, when assailed, he may use his best harmless endeavors
                            for protection, and leave the rest to the l- Wisdom from on high. " Amidst all the storms of
                            persecution and bitterness of life. Jesus invariably placed his whole dependence on the "
                            wisdom from above, " and found protection till his work was done and his mission ended. The
                            first real proclamation of his divine errand in which he gave men to understand that he was
                            auointod as Christ, was in Nazareth where he was brought up. They heard him till he compared
                            their hearts with their fathers of old, in rejecting the prophets. In the midst of his
                            illustrations, they seized him, " led him to the brow of a hill, that they might cast him
                            down headlong ; but lie, passing through the midst of tiiem, went his way.'' Jesus did not
                            resist them by blows or anger. He did not break away and run from them like a criminal, or
                            creep away and hide himself. He did not falter or take back what lie had said, or beg for
                            his life, or attempt to debate, calling their cruelty in question for such an act. The power
                            which he stood in protected him ; like a man of God he stood boldly up, non-resistant,
                            walked through the very midst of them, went his way on his Father's business, and they had
                            neither power to abuse or hinder him. He stood up in the dignity of his mission when they
                            sought to seize him in the temple, and completely overawed them. When about to stone him he
                            never changed from rebuke to persuasion, but they could not harm him. He even shielded the
                            woman proved to be an adulteress, from their barbarity and put her accusers to shame. When
                            the officers returned and the chief priests put the question, "Why have ye not brought him?"
                            They answered, "Never man spake like this man. " It was not the sound of his voice ; but,
                            like the electric tire that precedes thunder, they felt the power of the holy spirit in all
                            that he uttered. This word put forth in the power of God, cut down their murderous
                            intentions as a mower would cut down the grass of the field. It is beautiful to observe how
                            this protecting, non-resisting power passed from Jesus to his disciples. His work being
                            finished he no longer needed it; their labors were about to commence and they could not
                            exist without it. When the band of ruffians, headed by Judas found him in the garden, he
                            could have escaped them, for by intuition he well knew they were coming. By not turning from
                            them he placed his physical life in their hands, and delivered up the protecting power which
                            he had stood in, to his disciples. When they stood before him, like one having authority, he
                            enquired " VThom seek ye?" They answered, "Jesus of Nazareth." In his reply he ministered a
                            power which caused them to go backward, and they fell to the ground. Again he enquired "
                            Whom seek ye, " and from policemen prostrate, he received the same answer. Then pointing to
                            his disciples he added, "If ye seek me, let these go their way. " Had not their adversaries
                            been smitten down, the disciples would have been seized and slain with their Master. Peter's
                            swrord, the hand that smote, and the rebuke of Jesus, showed plainly that all rebuke should
                            be left to the powers on high ; that as men they should not resist,<pb n="75" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> in
                            violence, even their persecutors. The power that shielded them at the crucifixion, clothed
                            them at the day of Pentecost, and struck down thousands at their word, needed no additional
                            aid from men. That power checked persecution by changing Paul from an opposer lo an Apostle.
                            It opened the prison doors to Peter at Jerusalem, when bound in chains. It delivered Paul
                            and Silas from the dungeons of Philippi, by shaking the very flmndations ot a prison, by an
                            earthquake. This power delivered the Church by revelation, before Jerusalem was destroyed by
                            the Romans. It enabled the martyrs to carry forward God's word from age to age, and to
                            triumph over the tortures of the rack and the flames. It broke the power of Romanism,
                            produced the Reformation, aud planted the Shaker Church in America, inhabited by a people
                            who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

                            that of the man of Nazareth. There is such a thing as being immersed--covered all over with
                            water. It reaches but to the surface; even should it penetrate through the body, it would be
                            but a water baptism. In it, there is no power capable of affecting a living elevating
                            change. We read of being buried with Christ in baptism, and raised in the likeness of his
                            resurrection. An organic change having taken place. "I am not of the world, etc. " To be
                            raised into his likeness, is to be raised into newness of life. In him, " all old things are
                            done away. " Therefore, there must be a baptism of death to the world, and to its mode of
                            procedure. Again we read, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened
                            till it be accomplished. Implying a succession of baptisms. First, an organic change, and a
                            succession of baptisms to complete that change. To be deeply repentant, to die to sin, and
                            to be alive in newness of life, is a resurrection. This agrees with--"He who repenteth, and
                            is baptized will be saved. " Hence the necessity first, to be deeply repentant, to find an
                            organic change. Second, to keep the door open to a succession of baptisms, and of

                            is done. What would be thought of the man who having laid the foundation of a dwelling, went

                            the parties who under the guise of building, burrow under to substitute something more

                            resurrections than have yet been reached ; increasing in us a separation from the world. It
                            is a mistake to suppose that by lessening that separation, we will draw people to our
                            principles. The City set on the hill must keep its place, or lose its attractive power.

                            sufficient salt and meat can be preserved as long as trees grow or rivers run." Jesus says,
                            "Ye are the salt of the earth." That is, the testimony which ye have received from me will
                            prove a power, where it is obeyed, to save the soul from the sins of the world, and preserve
                            it to the kingdom of heaven order. "If the Salt hath lost its savor wherewith shall it be
                            salted. " When once the saving principle is destroyed it can serve no useful purpose
                            whatever. The expression is very significant, "It is cast out to be trodden under the foot
                            of man. " Brethren and Sisters let us look well to our goings that the gospel of eternal
                            life and truth lose not its saving power in our souls, and we be cast out of the kingdom at
                            last. More than this, more than the salvation of our own souls is required : "Ye are the
                            Salt of the earth." As much as to say. This saving power is given to you as unto chosen
                            vessels, to hold and dispense the life-giving principle of salvation for the redemption of
                            humanity, from under the curse entailed by the fall, and should you lose this saving
                            testimony, where would hope be found for the perishing ones of earth? How can they be saved
                            if the salt is not good ? Therefore, we see how necessary tha*. we hold and bear in our
                            daily lives that quickening testimony which shall condemn the world, within and without.
                            "For every one (who is iiaved) shall be salted with fire as every sacrifice is, salted with
                            salt." And, " Our God is a consuming fire" to consume and destroy all evil; but love
                            unbounded love, to the penitent soul that seeks his saving power, and is willing to accept
                            mercy on the terms approved, which is to confess and forsake all sin. Canterbury, N.

                            at length, the little symbol of discipline andperfectness. As I caught it up and unrolled

                            these words : " Measure the thoughts that are filling thy mind; Measure the words thou art

                            the rest to follow. l Very well, " remarked Father, that is the way I want you all to go.
                            but I am going to Alfred, " and immediately turning his horse, he soon rode out of sight.
                            Barnabas Bangs, a resident of Gorham, attended all the meetings held at that date. He says
                            that while the Shaker ministers remained in Gorham, they were entertained by the best people
                            in the place. They would be taken by tlib hand, at the close of the meetings, and urged to
                            accept the hospitality of their homes. The people were so kind and cordial, that Father
                            James said it was uncommon to find such friendship, and expressed great love and respect for
                            them. On the return of Father James to Alfred, he visited many families where by his
                                affable,<pb n="80" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> simple and loving manners he won the affection of old and
                            young. Eldress Rebecca Hodgsdon was at that time five years of age. A number of the little
                            girls were called to see Father James, and after some very pleas, ant conversation with
                            them, he said, "Hold out your little hands and say, Come sweet love. " Father then blessed
                            the little children. Many meetings were held in Alfred by Father James and his associates.
                            The testimony of the gospel was opened very plainly and the young believers were taught the
                            necessity of bearing a full cross against every evil passion. It was shown to them the ne'
                            cessity of a full separation from the world and a perfect consecration of soul and body to
                            the work of Christ. This served to strengthen the faith of the Believers and to establish
                            them more firmly upon a true foundation . In one of these meetings, when Father James was
                            under an inspirational influence, he raised his hands and exclaimed, "Keep the sanctuary
                            clean. We have an altar for our sacrifice; upon this the wicked have no right to place an
                            offering." Among the listeners were some that still doubted whether it was best to unite
                            with the testimony, or not. Many of these were now awakened by the living testimonies of
                            Father James and his companions, and firmly decided to bear the cross of Christ and to
                            become members of the society of united inheritance. At times the accomodations for holding
                            meetings seemed very limited, and when large companies were present they converted the barns
                            into houses of worship. The peo. pie, however, soon decided to build a place of worship and
                            in the Summer of 1786 raised a building that was 36ft. long and 28ft. wide. While on this
                            eastern journey Father James delivered several able, public dis. eourses, and spoke many
                            times to the Believers in their social meetings. He was gifted in inspirational speaking and
                            sometimes was prompted by the spirit to speak after a prophetic manner. At the time when
                            Father James and the Elders were taking leave of the Believers at Alfred, many of them were
                            anxious to receive a parting blessing, when Father James raising his hands, said, "There
                            will yet be a famine in this place ; not for the want of bread, nor of water, but of the
                            word of God. After a short pause, he added, but after that there will be a great gathering
                            of people, that will walk in the simplicity of the gospel. " The brethren and sisters then
                            returned to their respective places, feeling that they had been blessed with a very great
                            privilege. John Barnes, afterwards known as Father John, made a visit to Harvard, Mass, to
                            see Mother Ann and the Elder--. He was your.g and proud and wanted to appear like a
                            gentleman. On arriving at Harvard he inquired if the elect Lady lived there. A brother
                            replied, that the woman to whom he probably referred, was in the house. This brother then
                            invited John to walk in and see Mother Ann. As he stopped to brush the dust from his nicely
                            polished Doots, with his silk kerchief, Mother Ann stepped to the door. His profusion of
                            ruffles attracted her attention and she soon discovered that he was absorbed in the vanities
                            of this world. Mother then said to him, "You are a proud and haughty young man; you should
                            kneel where you are, and humble yourself before God, and then pray for a spirit of humility.
                            " John said he felt most keenly the force of her rebuke, and knelt on the grass, very much
                            ashamed of his vanity and, at once, apologized for his appearance. Mother then invited him
                            into the house, and cared for him as for a son. His visit was prolonged to several days, and
                            during this time he made confession to Elder William Lee, and became more firmly established
                            in the faith. John Cotton, David Barnes, Robert Me. Farland and Joseph Whitney were on a
                            visit to Harvard at the time that Father James was abused by a mob. He was tied to a tree
                            and so cruelly beaten that his back was lacerated and the blood ran profusely; yet as soon
                            as his cruel persecutors released him, he knelt and prayed : " Father, forgivethem, they
                            know not what they do. " O blessed in nocent servant, and son of the living God; how like
                            thy divine Teacher. What a lesson it taught all the Believers that witnessed the
                            heart-rending scene! Its effect, however, was to strengthen the faith and increase the<pb n="81" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> zeal of the young converts and inspire them with greater boldness and
                            confidence in bearing a public testimony against the powers of evil. The "meeting house"
                            that was built in 1,786 was never wholly finished. Twelve rough beams could be seen,
                            overhead, in the room for worship, and these were twelve inches square'and hewn from the
                            clearest of pine lumber. Two rooms had been finished in the attic for sleeping rooms,- but
                            this was not done till 1788. The ministers that came to the state of Maine at this date,
                            were Ebenezer Cooley, Elizur Goodrich, Eliab liarlow, Job Bishop and Eleazer Rand. These
                            ministers made it a rule to come twice each year, till the organization of the society into
                            gospel order.

                            interesting as we advance into the knowledge of their history. This is particularly true
                            while engaged in biblical studies and on matters illustrative of the life of Jesus. The many
                            examples that are given of his manner of diffusing spiritual knowledge, abound in words of
                            wisdom and loving kindness. The parable referring to the three servants who were entrusted
                            with their maste/s goods, is as potent in its application at the present time, as it was on
                            the day of its utterance. It was and is a powerful admonition to every one, that all of
                            their faculties belong to God, who will demand a strict account of the use which is made of
                            them. The parable which is found in the twenty-fifth chapter of Matt., is very interesting;
                            but our notes are made more particularly in reference to the servant, who after receiving
                            the one talent, went and digged in the earth and hid the Lord's money, and then excused
                            himself bv saving. " I was afraid and hid thy talent in the earth. " It does u.t state that
                            this unfortunate man had anv possessions previous to this gift : provided he had not. this
                            one talent was a snug litfle sum with which to begin. We assume to be astonished that the
                            man had no mor \ foresight, and yet we have no occasion to be astonished ! Since the world
                            began there has not been wanting men of this class. T\ e call them miserly, covetous,
                            close-fisted, and this spirit, whether illustrated in the bible or in the hearts of those
                            present with us, is the embodiment of meanness. Selfishly hoarding up the gifts and
                            blessings of a kind Providence an1"7 dwarfing themselves through neglect, they in a
                            corresponding manner are trammeling others. Probably, no one at this date would care to
                            claim a relationship to the poor felloAV that so foolishly buried his treasures in the
                            earth. Can you not see the penurious old servant, as he receives the shining silver from the
                            hand of his master? It was a treasure to make him happy and a blessing which should have
                            been the joy of his life ! See him as he sneaks away from his friends and buries his
                            beautiful gift in the earth ! As unfortunate as this may seem, it has a personal application
                            ; the one talent may be the one essential gift or faculty with which nature has so kindly
                            blest us, and which should be used for the honor and glory of God. Whoever luts the two or
                            five or ten gifts from the hand of our Heavenly Father has also increasing responsibili-<pb n="82" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>ties, that is, if we believe that God will require his own with usury.
                            Phrenologists tell us that there should be harmony in the mind, as well as in music, and
                            this harmony arises from the blending of the faculties. If there is a defect, it may be
                            partial ; there is also a corresponding defect in the mind. But it is not so mvich the small
                            number of gifts that one possesses, as it is the judicious use that is made of them. Perhaps
                            you are a benevolent man. Have you received in the distribution of that gift, five talents
                            so that you take pleasure in being generous and in conferring a benefit upon those less
                            favored? Are you kind hearted, charitable and forgiving? Doing unto others as you would wish
                            that they should do unto you ? How utterly mean a man tu--y become as he prostitutes his
                            faculties to the god of this world ! Thorns and thi-tles are superlative ble- -iugs upon the
                            earth, when p'aced in comparison wit!) such minds. Receiving no personal enjoyment from the
                            treasures that are in possession, and through a sordid selfishness effectually preventing
                            others. How many of these blessings are carelessly lost ; choked bv the cares of this world.

                            consciousness of doing right. Have you the gift of language? A beautiful treasure from the
                            master's hand. Are you careful in the selection of your words? Have you two, five or ten
                            talents? Upon a careful self-examination you may readily determine to what use you have
                            consecrated this heavenly gift. Whether in public or private it should be subjected to a
                            .willing and constaut discipline. To a grammatical and moral training which shall oblige the
                            speaker to say what he means. In the Cnristian it should be the active vehicle through which
                            to publish the gospel of good news. Do not allow it to be hid in the earth, or to be thrown
                            aside among the rubbish of this world's goods to be moth eaten and rusted, and made wholly
                            unfit for the Lord's service. Remember that every faculty of the mind belongs to God, and in
                            the name and in the spirit of that God, we should so live that we may be willing to render a
                            faithful account of our stewardship. With all our kind readers we will renew our covenant,
                            before our God, that henceforth we will do right because it is right. It may be to us the
                            door of hope and the voice of an angel of mercy in our hour of need. Canterbury, N.

                            " his life being a living example of the testimony he preached. No earthly friends had he to
                            counsel with him, to encourage, none to commend him for his self-sacriffce : but worked
                            alone as far as human helpers. He never turned aside from his noble purpose, neither for the
                            scorn and contempt of the selfish, nor the persecution of his enemies. Fearless in rebuking
                            error, having lain down his life for the good of humanit , he had no earthly friendship to
                            lose; yet his soul abounded with love, sympathy and forgiveness for the weak and erring.
                            Weary, foot-sore, without an earthly home, he at last fulfilled his glorious mission, and
                            died as he had lived, true to that spirit of resignation and self abnegation which
                            characterized his whole life. My soul expands with admiration in contemplating the beautiful
                            character of our Savior and inspires me with energy to work unselfishly and unceasingly till

                                    who do nothing but talk religion, who never live it at home, among the'r friends and
                                    neighbors, had best hold their tongues. Their silence would be far more edifying
                                    than their speech. True religion is practical; it is to shine out in the life, and
                                    to speak in1 the daily conduct. It is not for the cloister, but for the home, the
                                    shop, the counting-room, the market. It is not for Sundays only, but for weexdays.
                                    It is seen and heard not only in the conference-room, but in the walks of business
                                    and social life. It consists not only in devout feelings and ecstatic emotions, but
                                    in helpful, self-denying acts of liberality and kindness. It has not only prayers,
                                    but alms. It not only vies "with Gabriel while lie sings In notes almost divine ; "
                                    it cheerfully descends to the lowliest paths of Christian service and toil.<pb n="84" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> Religion is not philosophy or speculation or mysticism, but
                                    something for the everyday warp and woof of life. It makes a man honest, charitable,
                                    kind among his fellows, as well as reverential and believing before God. It is the
                                    source and origin of all true morality, of all right living, of whatsoever things
                                    are honest and lovely and of good report. This is the religion that the world needs,
                                    a religion that shows by its fruits that it is divine</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Watchman" TEIform="index"/>Watchman.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Joy" TEIform="index"/> JOY.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Horton, Lewis" TEIform="persName"/>LEWIS HORTON.</byline><p TEIform="p">Across the shadowy river, A gleam of sunlight glows ; Through mists of doubt and darkness A

                                    like the listless, playful foam. Between an endless past and an endless future, it
                                    rides the undulating wave, gladdened in the sunshine, gloomy in the storm. Out of
                                    darkness into light, bewildered, into darkness it returns. .Airy sparkles of light
                                    continually issue forth out of the mystic cloudy deep. Sent out from the bosom of
                                    the great soul, crowned with a halo of glory, befitting a source so divine. Though
                                    possessing the grace of an angel and the apprehension of a God, encircled by the
                                    process of nature, unending, unbroken, unceasing, man does not learn one halt the
                                    meaning of fleshy body, or half the grandeur of spiritual power. Though divine in
                                    origin, and heavenly in destiny, he worships age after age, a battle ax or a
                                    yard-stick, while unseen are the glories of a sun that shines forever, unseen the
                                    emotions of a soul that crowns the essence of all being. Spiritual, as man is, there
                                    is a carnal element in his nature that weakens the finer sense and blinds the eye to
                                    the highest glories of the universe. The man of the five senses simply stares at
                                    nature. To him the highest glory is never revealed, lie looks without seeing. He
                                    listens without hearing. Worshiping the form, its spiritual meaning is lost. Blinded
                                    to the depth of thought there is in the elaborate handiwork of the Creator, he gets
                                    not a glimpse of the symbolic richness there is in a world of objects, boundless,
                                    vast and grand. lie resolves man into flesh and blood ; nature into substance, form
                                    and machinery. To him there is no beauty in "the emerald girdle of the tropics, or
                                    the lichen gray cliffs of the pole. " The ocean is only so much water; the
                                    mountains, so much sand. He can see nothing but cord-wood in the forest primeval,
                                    and learns no lesson from the symmetry ot the stately pine or the blended colors of
                                    the rose. lie beUeves that the poet raves at arj illusion when he becomes ecstatic
                                    over the azure tints that drape a magnificent sunset. But the man of insight is the
                                    symbolist who sees alike in man and nature qualities higher than the material, and
                                    believes, with the immortal Carlisle, that what we see with eyes and feel with hands
                                    is but the vesture, the visual appearance of a living soul that is behind it. The
                                    eye cannot see. The ear cannot hear. The hand cannot feel. It is the soul alone that
                                    gives acuteness to the outer sense or wakens emotion within. The soul is a prism to
                                    the eye, resolving every sunbeam into a rainbow. Men, countless as the stars, have
                                    gazed into " the spacious firmament on high, " but only Addison sings their songs of
                                    eternal praise. Erom everlasting the sun has silvered the mountain top, but the
                                    scene found expression only in the hymn of Coleridge. We daily rest upon the bosom
                                    of nature, and none of us can offer the tribute of a Cowper or a Bryant. Only to an
                                    Agassiz or a Dana does stern and rocky nature " sing a more wonderful song or tell a
                                    more marvelous tale," Long ago Locke said, "It needs a sunny eye to see the sun. "
                                    No one can see the ocean who does not have oceans in his soul. No one can enjoy the
                                    mountains unless he has mountains on his brain. No one but a master musician can see
                                    the soul of a Mozart. Only an artist can know the mind of a Raphael Looking at
                                    nature, --'-- the senses simply stare, the mind sees law, taste finds beauty and
                                    enjoys art. " But the .soul alone gains the highest spiritual meaning. Insight of
                                    soul unveils the secret glory an grandeur of the universe. Instead of dead
                                    substance, it makes it a living idea. It finds man a lump of clay, makes him a
                                    symbol of divine thought; it finds mortals worshipers of form, chained to substance,
                                    blinded and groveling, makes them worshipers of what the form symbolizes, free from
                                    matter, gazing on the sun and on divine light--developing a spiritual nature that
                                    shall grow and flourish, when, " Like the baseless fabric of a vision, The
                                    cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palace, The solemn temples, the great globe

                            contemplating penning you a fraternal letter ; but, there are such a variety of subjects
                            engrossing my mind, whenever I contemplate writing, upon which I would love to lavish upon
                            you a few of my thoughts, that I seem at a loss upon which I may launch out. But, suppose I
                            start out upon the power of my God,--Love ! Our God, my dear brother, is Love ; our Savior
                            is love; our Mother is love! All the chain of their monitions and admonitions is love. The
                            fraternal bond of fellowship of all Zion's true sons and daughters is pure angelic love ;
                            not the blazonry of animal passion, that often devastates both body and soul. But 1st. What
                            is the true character of this love ? 2nd. On what objects is it bestowed? 3rd. To what eud
                            and purpose is it administered ? 4th. Who are its recipients? 5th. Who are profited by its
                            dispensa" tions ? Ans. 1st. Of its character, it is pure, impartial, universal, charitable,
                            forgiving; but, included in its train, are mercy, tempering justice and judgment. 2nd. It is
                            bestowed on all the creation of God, in some appropriate manner, and some just degree. 3rd.
                            Its purpose is to benefit,--bless, the creation of God. 4th. Its recipients are all persons,
                            who, either intuitively or educationally look to a superior Being for aid. 5th. Those
                            recipients are profited by it who, by the strength of its influence act the part assigned
                            them, by the constitution of their existence, and the knowledge of truth to them committed ;
                            :hese, alone, are benefited. That ostracism of God which culminates in infidelity, and
                            independence, in the human family, bars and bolts the door opening to the fountain of God's
                            love! The absolute atheist, and the absolute deistic infidel, is a lamb shorn of God's love,
                            and metamorphosed into a wolf! In reviewing human history, man appears to have been like a
                            pendulum bob, hung upon the rod of God's charity, forbearance and mercy; it has been
                            swinging, alternately, between Atheism, on the one extreme, and superstitious obsequious
                            worship, on the other. Its religious worshipful sensations have been throbbing with
                            sacrifices and offerings, manifested in each one and all of the multiform religious
                            institutions, inaugurated and established by the human race. Over the shriue of every human
                            sanctuary, has been engraven, by the finger of man, '-bloody sacrifices, " but, over the
                            shrine of the temple built by our God of Love, is engraven by the finger of God's Son. "
                            Sacrifices" (material) " and offerings, thou wouldst not; but, a body hast thou preparedst
                            me. " Humanity's ordeal standard of sacrificial worship, has been bloody, and crowned with
                            death. On human altars for worship have been sacrificed, not only the blood, muscle and fat
                            of fed beasts, but, the freshly throbbing human heart, torn from the living immolated human
                            sacrifice, even beneath his very living anguish striken eye, and his swimming death stricken
                            brain ! If we turn our vision on the present state of so called civilized or religious
                            society, we find it in a transition crisis.<pb n="87" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> The hawsers tethered to the

                            investigation, and criticism, aye, and of doubt, and abandonment of religion ! Bibles, of
                            almost all classes of religious professors, are being shelved, multitudinonsly ! Not only
                            the Puranas, the Shasters, the Vedas, and the Koran, but the Pentateuch, the Prophets and
                            the New Testament--the Christian's Bible, is sharing, with many, the same fate. Yet, while
                            one class of society, with reason and common sense, on the one hand, is rejecting legendary,
                            interpolated, and polymorphous, and artfully devised scripture and abandoning it to its
                            proper position among posthumous productions, yet, preserving, reverencing, and receiving,
                            as the authoritative guide to virtuous life, the prophetic deliveries and revelations, and
                            the Divine inspirational instructions of the " first born son of God, " another class is
                            relegating all scripture to the tombs of oblivion, abandoning themselves to the neglect of
                            all religious service, dissipation and voluptuousness ; to sinful sensualism and
                            indifference to virtuous life ; repudiating every standard for virtue ! These are the days,
                            when every Christian who is loyal to his Heavenly King and Queen of Zion, has the duties of
                            a soldier to perform, to do battle for the right, against all, and every opposition. Our
                            blessed, but tried and suffering Ziou. cannot live on the merits of the past. When any
                            institution survives only on the merits of mere respectability and the dead weight of former
                            character, without a change of conduct, its dissolution is only a question of time ! What
                            has given Ziou respectability, good character? The consecration of the life and services of
                            its devotees to the principles of purity, peace, separation from the world ; its honesty in
                            deal ; in short, its righteousness, when judged from the Christian tribunal .' While these
                            elements are a living spring among Zion's Sons and Daughters, gushing forth with energy
                            devoted to the Christian's Gospel Cause they survive hopefully ; but. if this spring runs
                            low, and its waters become turbid, and the stimulus of its inspiration smoulders into
                            hopeless ease and indifference, woe be to the future harvest, and woe to the harvesters, for
                            want of nourishment ! In spring time, every culturist of the soil who is wise, first
                            prepares the soil by much labor of amelioration, for the germination of the seed, then, when
                            the seed is therein deposited, his hopes for a crop is not upon the dormant seeds, nor upon
                            the rotting seeds, but, upon the germinating seeds,--those springing into life ; such, push
                            aside every obstacle to peer out iuto the beautiful and quickening sunlight of the heavens,
                            to be warmed, and expand their tiny leaves, to drink up life from the heavenly dews. Thus it
                            is spiritually ! Though an hundred years have elapsed since Zion's husbandmen ploughed the
                            fields and sowed the seeds of truth of the dispensation of Christ's Second Appearing, it is
                            still in its spring time. And, though some of the plantation toilers are worn out in the
                            service, and have earned a glorious reward, have reaped a bounteous harvest of salvation,
                            and gone to <pb n="88" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> the sanctuary of their redemption, the soil is still needy
                            of the ploughman, the sower, and the culturist. Though, to the vision of some professing the
                            Christian character the pole star dimly shines, the clouds of Zion's horizon hang low, and
                            the rays of the sun of inspiration seem enveloped in a haze of gloom, yet, to the spiritual
                            aeronaut, soaring above the gloomy mists of era-th. attached to his balloon of spiritual
                            perception, in his parachute of faith, and borne up above earthly conditions into the
                            atmosphere of God's love, power, and purposes of will the sun is shining, above the clouds
                            of gloom ; and. he sees the car of progress in the great arena of human action, rolling on
                            to a better and brighter destiny. Inquiry into, and investigation of principles will
                            ultimate in heavenward resolution for the human race, as a whole though, among the millions
                            of voyagers many run off oq a side track, into the sloughs of deception, folly and sin ;
                            and, like a tar and feathered criminal, they have to endure much greasing, soaping and
                            scrubbing, before being able to get on to the right track of heavenly progression, and
                            resume the journey out of loss smoothly and profitably. Many, in Zion's Gospel net,
                            sometimes, under the burdens of their day of toil, want to get back into the worldly sea ;
                            and some, who are wishing to become "New Creatures in Christ" appear to imagine, that,
                            simply to be caught in the Gospel net, and put into Zion's tub, is a passport for them into
                            the New Creation ; while, Indian like, they neither forgive their enemies, nor give vigilant
                            effort to sustain their friends in the work of self-denial. It is reasonable to conclude
                            that a good travel in Zion's pathway ought to enable a soul to leave behind all animosities,
                            hard feelings, trials with Zion's discipline, bufferings of Satan, and all sin, in something
                            less than an hundred thousand years, and even less than an hundred, with the thousand thrown
                            off! But, dear Elder Abraham, I set out to write a fraternal letter, but, what room have I
                            left for fraternal greetings ? Ah, my mind is out on the periphery of the great wheel of
                            human progress ! Let me gravitate to affection's centre ; to love's secluded chambers, the
                            abodes of Zion's true children who are pure in heart, and separate from sin and sinners.
                            Here, my dear elderly brother, let us quaff, for a season, the wine of gladness that we were
                            early caught in the gospel net, and, added thereunto, have found it profitable to be dressed
                            for the Master's use ; not only to be beheaded and scaled, but emboweled, and, have attained
                            some degree of comeliness in the form of a "New Creature" hi the Kingdom of Christ. And,
                            thus can sing some of the songs of the New Jerusalem, never learned by Moses, while on the
                            earthly plane. Come, Brother. O how sweet the name.' Let us. with our precious gospel
                            relations, have a little ki feast of union and flow of soul" in the parlors of our Heavenly
                            Father and Mother, and, for the nonce, bid the troubles of old time adieu ! We shall soon
                            put up this frail mortality in its earthly casket, and then, wing our way to fairer mansions
                            ! Suppose we anticipate a few of its blessings, and then, renew our flight from this vain
                            world of earthly habiliments with a newer fledged, and broader wing ! Accept, please,
                            everlasting love, and enduring and affectionate friendship. Your affectionate Brother.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B."

                            readily the position occupied by those who make a profession of Christianity, and that class
                            whom they are inclined to designate as the children of this world. The separation, however,
                            may not always be as distinct as the terms would imply. The iuterblending of relations, in
                            this case, is so subtle that it may be difficult to ascertain where the first begins and
                            where the last ceases. The sons of God and the sons of Belial have walked, more or less,
                            side by side on their pilgrimage, from Edenic days and enjoyed with rare felicity the
                            wrarmth of the sun, which God has so kindly made to shine on the evil and on the good, and
                            also enjoyed the blessedness of the rain which he sends upon the just and the unjust. These
                            names, no doubt, quite often become somewhat mixed as ignorance, nncleanness and brutality
                            are found marching under Christian banners, while order, benevolence and civility, are by
                            this class so readily denominated schismatic or Infidel, if found outside of their church
                            dogma. It is not at all singular that Consistency has been placed among the precious jewels.
                            Tho^e who have found it, have wealth that gold and silver cannot purchase. In this search
                            for righteousness, hungering and thirsting, in our efforts to obtain it, we soon learn that
                            our divine Teacher has placed before us a lesson which must command our attention. Walking
                            as he walked, praying as he prayed, we have opened before us, in all the beauty of holiness,
                            the strait way which leads to life eternal. We learn that his people are not of this world,
                            even as he is not of this world, for they have been called into a spiritual work, and that
                            they are to deny themselves, take np their crosses daily and follow him, on that heavenly
                            pathway where the children of this world can have no place. To us this seems to beau evident
                            fact; that righteousness cannot dwell with unrighteousness, and culminate in fruit for the
                            Kingdom of God. The same truth is made plain to those in the broad way ; they know that the
                            people of God, or the disciples of Christ are not of then* order, and on this account the
                            world hates that which condemns its life. Jesus was quite anxious to have his disciples
                            understand this, and said to them, " If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before
                            it hated you. " But this hatred was against the testimony that was borne, and not against
                            the person. Remove tin- sharp sword, the testimony of the cross, and all the hatred would
                            vanish as dew before the sun. The cross gone, all would be of the world and the world would
                            love its own. Jecus so informed his disciples, that while they were of the world, the spirit
                            of the world could not hate them. While the one order is exhorted to seek first the Kingdom
                            of God and its righteousness, and to store up its treasures where moth and rust doth not
                            corrupt, the other is over anxious about what they shall eat and drink and wherewithal they
                            shall be clothed. They are emphatically the children of this world <pb n="91" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> and
                            are giving their whole lives to maintain its existence. The apostle, however, has spoken
                            wisely upon this point in which he, no doubt, felt a deep interest. "But ye have not so
                            learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him." Christ
                            teaches that we must put ofF the corrupting influences, the deceitful lusts and be renewed
                            in spirit to God. lie would not have us live contrary to the manifestations of the spirit
                            through him. To assume to be his disciples in the spiritual work of regeneration, and then
                            at the same time follow the deceitful lusts of generation might form a mixture better suited
                            for the sons of Belial, than for the sons of God. His disciples were distinctly informed
                            that the life of generation wras not his calling. It belonged wholly to the children of this
                            world who were given in marriage. It was an earthly order, while the children of the
                            resurrection neither married others nor were themselves given in marriage. '"And Peter said
                            unto him, liehold we have forsaken all and followed thee, what shall we have therefore? And
                            Jesus said to him, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me in the
                            regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit
                            upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." To develop into manhood and
                            womanhood is simply the work of nature, but to develop into the perfect stature ol men and
                            women in Christ, is the work of the Holy Spirit. That beautiful lesson which the man Jesus
                            so clearly presented to the hearers of his day, shoulc be carefully impressed upon the mind.
                            " Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the Kingdom of
                            Heaven." Engaged as was the Teacher in a work of universal love, he became to the little
                            children more of a parent, more of a protector than was possible for those who had
                            cultivated wholly the selfish ideations of the children of this world. </p></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p"> FREE. The Shaker and Shakeress makes a :&gt;ook which we are furnishing to Individuals

                                        deviations from health, the result of nervous depression and abnormal reaction
                                        produced by a chill. The chill may be either general or partial; i. e.,
                                        experienced by the whole or a part of the body, and so may be the effects to
                                        which it gives rise. The general derangement thus induced is popularly known as
                                        "a cold in the bones, " or " a feverish cold," and is so designated from its
                                        being attended with a dull aching all over the body and feverish excitement, the
                                        symptoms, indeed, when severe are those of fever; but they may be so slight as
                                        to amount to nothing more than a sense of malaise. When the effects are partial,
                                        it is;. usually the head, throat, or chest that suffers. Catarrhal affections of
                                        these parts are unfortunately too common in our damp and variable climate to
                                        call for description. Of course, both local and general derangement may. and
                                        frequently do, exist together. Colds although spoken lightly of, are not all
                                        ways easily shnken off, and sometimes lay the foundation of and end in serious
                                        disease, This is especially likely to be the case with those who inherit taints,
                                        or, as they are gen-<pb n="92" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/>craily called, il weaknesses, " and
                                        such persons should be very careful about neglecting a cold. As i% prevention is
                                        better than cure,"' we will first consider how the system may be hardened and
                                        its susceptibility to cold lessened. The besv means of prevention, are to
                                        develop to the fullest extent the heat-maintaining power of the body, and to
                                        avoid everything likely to give cold. The first object may be accomplished by
                                        wearing only just sufficient clothing to keep us comfortably warm; by
                                        accustoming ourselves to sudden changes of temperature by the daily use of the
                                        cold bath: and by preserving the best state of health. While our clothing should
                                        ensure us against any feeling of chilliness, we must remember that cold is
                                        bracing, and heat relaxing, and that of the two it is better to be rather under
                                        than overclad. The regular practice of cold-bathing educates tho power by which
                                        the depressing effect of cold is resisted. When thj .-hock of the shower and
                                        plunge-baths is more than can be borne, a mere sponge dipped in cold water
                                        should be passed rapidly over the body, and then a rough towel applied
                                        vigorously until dryness and warmth are fully restored. Let it be understood
                                        that the water used for this purpose need not be of the same temperature as the
                                        atmosphere, for water is really cold; i e., in reference to the body, when it is
                                        of a lower temperature than the body. Beginners should use tepid water ( about
                                        GO dg. Fahr.,) and reduce the temperature gradually, as they feel able to bear
                                        it. The effect should be stimulating, not depressing; we should feel warmer,
                                        fresher and better after it; and if we do not, it is a sign that the water,
                                        whatever its temperature may be, is too cold for us, and the result will be
                                        injury instead of benefit. In winter, then, and in Summer also, when the water
                                        in our bath is of too low a temperature to be agreeable sufficient hot should be
                                        added to raise it to the desired point. Anything which lowers the tone of the
                                        system, as fatigue, prolonged fasting, want of sleep, care, anxiety, grief and
                                        fear lessens its power of resistance, and acts as a predisposing cause. The fear
                                        of taking cold has this effect, and consequently increases our susceptibility.
                                        The things likely to give cold, i. e., its direct or exciting causes, are not
                                        wearing appropriate clothing; sitting about in wet things ; wet or cold feet;
                                        casting some garment to which we have become accustomed; throwing off some
                                        article of dress, sitting down, or standing still when overheated, and exposure
                                        to draughts. Clothing may be inappropriate in character or amount. Of whatever
                                        materials our outer garments are composed, those worn next to the body should
                                        consist exclusively of wool, as, being a bad conductor, it protects us, when
                                        hot, from the risk of rapid cooling. While clothing must be sufficient for
                                        comfort, it is better, for the reasons already given, that we should be under
                                        rather than overclad. Sitting about in wet things is one of the surest ways of
                                        catching cold. As long as we are moving about we shall take no harm; for
                                        exercise prevents the depressing effect which the large abstraction of heat,
                                        consequent upon evaporation, would otherwise produce. The warmth of any part of
                                        the body depends upon the vigor of the circulation in it, and if our feet are
                                        cold, in spite of being well shod, our only remedy lies in increasing the
                                        circulation. This may be done by improving the health generally; washing the
                                        feet every morning in cold water, if cold occasions any feeling of numbness or
                                        discomfort, tepid should be used, and rubbing them briskly with a roujih towel
                                        until quite dry and warm ; taking plenty of walking exercise ; and not allowing
                                        them to be compressed. This last condition is an essential one, for how can the
                                        circulation be free and vigorous in tight boots? Too much care cannot be taken
                                        in casting any article of dress to which we have become accustomed. An
                                        exceptionally warm day should be chosen for this purpose, and the change
                                        effected gradually by the substitution of a similar, but thinner garment. It is
                                        very imprudent to throw off any portion of our clothing, sit down, or stand
                                        still, when overheated ; we should keep moving slowly about until we become
                                        cool. Surely the reader need not bo cautioned against draughts. A feverish cold
                                        has three distinct stages, each requiring different treatment. In the first or
                                        shivering stage warmth is plainly in-<pb n="93" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> dicated. The hot-air
                                        bath is not only the most effectual means of applying heat; but by the free
                                        perspiration which it induces the cold may be cut short, and a serious illness,
                                        perhaps prevented. Any bath-room, unless unusually large, i. e.. not exceeding
                                        1,200 cubic feet, may be turned into this form of bath (HO Fahr,) in about 20
                                        minutes by the aid of a Calorigen stove, containing a moderately large coal
                                        fire, and having a hot-air pipe three inches in diaxieter; or one may be taken
                                        in our own loom by placing a lighted spirit-lamp under a wooden-bottomed chair,
                                        sitting down upon the chair, and being encased in a blanket, which must be
                                        fastened closely round the neck and reach the floor all round. If a lamp be not
                                        at hand, a saucer with two or three tablespoonfuls of brandy, whisky, or any
                                        other spirit, may be used. After free perspiration has taken place, which may be
                                        promoted by hot drinks, the person should be put into a bed previously warmed,
                                        and well wrapped up. In two or three hours let the additional coverings be
                                        removed, one by one, at short intervals, so that the patient may cease
                                        perspiring. All the necessary apparatus for a hot-air or vapor bath, either
                                        sitting up or in bed, can be obtained for a small sum. A large fire, hot drinks,
                                        and physical exertion of any kind, are also agents not to be despised. The
                                        second or feverish stage is the result of reaction, and is attended with heat of
                                        the skin, loss of appetite, thirst, and throbbing pains in the head The
                                        treatment consists in rest, low diet, acid drinks, and the application of cold
                                        to the temples. The third stage : The feverish symptoms may terminate suddenly
                                        in profuse perspiration, or subside gradually without this. A partial cold may
                                        proceed from a general or a partial chill, and, like the feverish cold, has
                                        three stages. The chill, if perceived, must be treated in the manner already
                                        described. The period of reaction calls for a warm atmosphere, an unstimulating
                                        diet, and a brisk purge. If the appetite be good, and considerable local
                                        disturbance may exist without impairing it, the strength will not suffer
                                        materially, and the third stage, that of convalescence, be speedily recovered
                                        from. These local affections are --usually, but not invariably, more serious
                                        when accompanied by general indisposition. If a cold be attended with great
                                        languor and depression, severe fixed pain, vomiting, difficulty in breathing, or
                                        any acute local symptoms, if the feverish excitement be great, or if there be
                                        any " weakness " inherited or acquired, a medical man should be immediately sent
                                        for.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Herald of Health" TEIform="index"/>The Herald of Health. </bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Correspondence" TEIform="index"/> Kind Words.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="We are surprised every month..."

TEIform="persName"/>JAMES S. PRESCOTT.</byline><p TEIform="p"> It is evident from the signs of the times that the party destined to rule America, is that
                            party which is the most progressive, and is the embodiment of all reforms, although that
                            party may be in the minority for the time being, yet, the time is coming when they will be
                            in the majority, because the government is in the hands of the people, and the people are
                            progressive, otherwise, they could'not have reached the intellectual plane on which they now
                            stand. The world was never more progressive than it is to-day, even the boys and girls
                            around us, are more developed, intellectually, at the age of ten years, than they were
                            formerly at the age of fifteen. take them in the aggregate. There is no hope for the
                            redemption of the human race, only by reforms, based upon the "law of progress." They cannot
                            travel out of their loss all at once. It must be done by degrees, little by little, step by
                            step. To illustrate. If we ascend a night of stairs. we begin at the bottom step first, and
                            take only one step at a time and keep on rising by degrees, until we reach the top. It is so
                            in ascending a ladder. Only one round at a time, un'il we reach the top, and this may be
                            hard tugging, sometimes, especially if we have a hod of brick on one shoulder. A brick house
                            is erected, only by laying one brick at a time, and by this constant and unceasing
                            repetition the house is built. A Lancastrian school, is another illustration of the " law of
                            progress, " beginning with the lowest, and youngest class of juveniles, who- are just
                            beginning to learn how to form the letters of the alphabet, with a little wooden pen, in
                            sand, and so progress by degrees, until they reach the highest class of readers. So it is
                            with the moral and spiritual development of the human race, they cannot reach it, all at
                            once, this is impossible ! It is too high a step to take from a low, sensual, animal plane,
                            to that high condition, all at once. It can onlv be gained by degrees, one step at a time,
                            one round on the ladder of progress at a time, until the top of purity and innocence is
                            reached. And this high condition can only be gained by keeping up with the " law of
                            progress," and those who continue to violate this law, will have to suffer its penalties.
                            For it is the law of the a'je in which we live, and cannot be violated with impunity. Every
                            man and woman who is not progressive, in this day, is violating the "law of progress." North

                            in their lives he lives and loves again. So one by one the evils of the earth Are fa.ling:

"By a thoroiigli knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and
by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast
tables with a delicately flavored beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of sucli articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist
every tendency to <..' $:ise. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever
there is a weak point. \Vf> may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortiQed with pure blood
