                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 16.</head><p TEIform="p">THE DINING HALL. The usual and regular times for the taking of our meals were at 6-30 for
                            breakfast, 12 for dinner and 6 o'clock for supper. The tables are about twenty-eight inches
                            high and three feet wide. Four persons form a square, and three squares are seated at one
                            table. The people are called to their meals by a signal from the large bell and subsequently
                            to the table by the ringing of a smaller bell. All remain standing in their respective
                            places, till quietness is restored, when a few moments are spent in silent prayer, while in
                            a kneeling posture. The same order of prayer also follows at the close of each meal. All the
                            varieties of food were served that were known to be acceptable at the time, and especially
                            those that could be provided by the Community. In the infancy of the Society, the kinds of
                            food were very few and the manner of preparation of the simplest kind. This however, has
                            increased from year to year, till at the present time, (1850) our table is bountifully
                            spread. So early as 1789 bean porridge was one of the principal articles of food, and this
                            with potatoes and bread would serve for a meal. At a later date new biscuits were eaten for
                            breakfast, with fresh pork and potatoes, accompanied with pie or sauce and tea or coffee.
                            Pewter plates were quite universally used at the beginning of this century, and in some
                            families they were retained as late as 1823. Porcelain plates were next introduced, from
                            which to eat, but the wooden plates were retained for several years longer on which to serve
                            the bread. The most of a departure from the plain, simple fare of the week was made for the
                            supper on Sabbath evening when the best flesh, fish or fowl was presented, accompanied with
                            various kinds of pie, cake and preserves. This plan was also followed on Christmas and
                            Thanksgiving days, as it was a general custom observed by most of the people in this section
                            of the country. In 1841 a great change was made in our mode of living. Swine's flesh was
                            wholly removed from the articles of diet, and all kinds of meat and fish were dispensed with
                            on the Sabbath. <pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Cider, which had been used at the table till this
                            date, was wholly removed, and tea, coffee or water was accepted. tea. At first, the Society
                            used but a small amount of foreign tea, but in place of this used Sage, Red-root,
                            Aven's-root and Liberty tea. In a few years the tea from China was accepted and used with
                            milk and sugar, particularly for breakfast. In 1808 tea was used, largely, without
                            sweetening, and this continued for several years. In 1840 all foreign tea was removed from
                            the table and used only by direction of the physicians. Domestic tea was now used by the
                            family. Some preferred to drink milk while others accepted milk and water. Foreign tea and
                            coffee were again introduced in 1855 and Believers have been more or less effected by the
                            prevailing sentiment around them. Several persons accepted the reform views of Sylvester
                            Graham, and abstained from the use of tea and coffee, and from the eating of meat, and all
                            animal fats. The vegetable diet had found some earnest advocates, who believed that all food
                            should be prepared in a simple and healthful manner, BOOKS AND PERIODICALS. There is perhaps
                            no subject in the history of the Community which has been more varied than the one now under
                            consideration. In the warfare which engaged the attention of the Believers, they only
                            thought of the world, as the one thing from which to be free, and their literary studies
                            shared the same fate as every other temptation toward a worldly life. The laying of a
                            foundation in the temporal and spiritual interests of the Church was of the first
                            importance, and for several years the reading of books and papers claimed but a very small
                            part of the time. After the gathering of a second class into the order, it was found
                            necessary to give more attention to the education of the children and youth, and especially
                            after the publication of our faith, in 1808. A public school was instituted in 1817 and the
                            number of books increased quite rapidly. Soon after this it was thought best to open a
                            library, and for this purpose all the books were collected and arranged in order tor use by
                            the family. In 1833, one hundred and twenty volumes including works on History, Biography,
                            Morality, Mechanics, &amp;c, formed the library, and to these additions were constantly
                            being made. As Iat,e as the year 1812 but little time was used for either the reading of
                            Books or papers. In 1858 some ten or twelve periodicals were regularly received into the
                            family. Two agricultural papers and the Scientific American were also received. The
                            physicians subscribed for two papers, the teachers of the school for one, while several were
                            taken at the Office. A journal of passing events has always been kept by the Church, and in
                            this could be found an account of our business transactions ; our struggles with the state
                            legislature ; our troubles and expenses with opponents in law, and our afflictions with
                            apostates.

                            fishing in the sea, and all the fish tliey take out of the sea, are rendered incapable of
                            propagating their kind afterward. Uo those who argue that the world will be depopulated if
                            the gospel of Christ prevail, which is the gospel of virgin purity and continence, also
                            object to fishing iu the sea for the same reason ? Do they have any fears that the sea will
                            become depopulated, by all that men can do, or that the fish thereof will not fulfill the
                            purpose of their creation ? If not, then is the fear that the gospel of virgin Brotherhood
                            and Sisterhood will run the world out proved a selfish fear, and objections based thereon
                            have not the least foundation in principle. Jesus said he would make his disciples "fishers
                            of men." All the fish which his fishermen take and prepare as subjects for the heaven of
                            eternal life, can no more propagate a carnal, worldly offspring, for they have become
                            eunuchs, spiritually speaking, "by means of the kingdom of heaven." Will the earth therefore
                            cease to be peopled? It* will if God so designs, and men cannot prevent it. If such is not
                            the design of the Author of the gospel, no more fish will be inclosed by the net than are
                            required for the Lord's use, and there is no more danger that the earth will become
                            depopulated thereby, than that the sea will be deprived of all its fish by fishing. A net
                            allows little fish enough to keep the sea stocked, to pass through. It is the animal or
                            psychic man that propagates animal life, and while employed thus, he can receive only a
                            rudimental knowledge of spiritual laws and principles. Not till he is ready to seek and
                            practice the truths of the higher, spiritual uses of life, will these rudimental knowledges
                            germinate as seeds and grow into a preparation for the gospel net. Until such is the case,

                            remarks by Elder Henry C. Blinn, who called the attention of the Brethren and Sisters to the
                            additional blessing realized by the presence of beloved gospel friends from two of our
                            sister Societies, viz. Enfield, Conn, and Gloucester, Me. Br. Daniel Orcutt, Sisters,
                            Elizabeth Copley and Maria Lyman of Enfield in return for the kind welcome extended,
                            communicated love from Gospel friends at their home, accompanied by expressions of loyalty
                            and confidence in God's work. Br. Samuel Kendrick, and Sisters, Sarah Fletcher, Amanda
                            Stickney, Prudie Stickney and Ada Cummings of Gloucester, were next introduced. Br. Samuel,
                            whose age numbers some eighty years, spoke as one who has found immortal youth in the
                            spiritual life which he has led from early childhood ; having had more than seventy <pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> years experience with Believers. He stated, "I have found peace and
                            satisfaction in obeying the principles of the gospel as taught by Mother Ann Lee. I believe
                            the highest light is found among this people. If there is a higher light, I am willing to
                            investigate and accept it." The Sisters accompanying Br. Samuel sang a beautiful piece
                            commencing, "I will take down my harp from the willow," &amp;c, after singing, each gave
                            satisfactory testimony of the goodness of God and of the hundred fold relation they had
                            found among his people, expressing unchanging determination to bear the cross of Christ. The
                            piece entitled "Inasmuch" was next sung ; and immediately followed by a request from Elder
                            Nicholas Briggs that the beautiful piece which originated at Mt. Lebanon, "We shall meet,"
                            should also be sung. After the singing, Elder Nicholas referred to a dream of the previous
                            night in which he found himself enjoying a beautiful meeting with those who possessed the
                            brightness and whiteness to which the sentiment of the piece referred. "The dream," said he,
                            "caused me to spend an hour in soul reverie, in consideration of the relation which
                            Believers sustain to each other individually. Is the life actually lived which ensures a
                            place with those whose garments are clean, made spotless white ? If the past, viewed in the
                            light of the present is unsatisf actory, the latter affords an opportunity for amendment. If
                            we have sown weakness where we should have sown strength, let us not repine, but with
                            greater earnestness and better efforts seek to attain unto the perfection of spiritual
                            purity which we profess to maintain." These remarks were followed by the singing of the
                            spirited piece, "Lion hearted brave and true." Some of the Sisters spoke appreciatingly of
                            the blessing of a correspondence held with Brethren and Sisters in the several Sot cieties,
                            it being a stimulus to good works. With many, a correspondence commenced in youth with
                            gospel friends has proved of life-long benefit. Words may not be able to portray the spirit
                            of the choice testimonies of the beloved Ministry and Elders, but their united call to raise
                            higher the standard of Christian excellence is written in the hearts of the people to whom
                            it was addressed. Many worshipers feelingly responded to the promptings of the divine
                            influence. One young Brother said, "I will be brave in the battle, that I may know the joy
                            of victory." Another added, "When I made my choice to serve God I did not confer with flesh
                            and blood. The loss of companionship cannot change the pledge of consecration then made,
                            standing face to face with a truth received. I resolved to obey the same without even a
                            thought whether I should find companions or realize the loss of them in attempting to follow
                            the perfect pattern. No one can feel alone who can truly sing, 'I have feet with God they're
                            walking.' The Lord our God will sustain his people and in his service is eternal joy." These
                            remarks were subsequently followed by Br. William Briggs who said, "John the revelator
                            wrote, 'I heard a voice from Heaven as the voice of many waters.' My <pb n="221" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>
                            soul has heard that voice to-day in the testimonies of Brethren and Sisters. It is
                            impossible, as has already been stated, to hold the world in one hand and the gospel in the
                            other. We cannot serve two masters, if we support the relations of the world, although none
                            of our Brethren or Sisters may be conscious of it, we are not" giving our strength to the
                            cause which we profess to support. We would not prove recreant to our call, nor forsake the
                            spiritual interests of a home that has sheltered us from early childhood to the present age.
                            Let us renew ourselves in obedience to our faith and a closer walk with conscience." "Christ
                            of the Ages" was then sung followed by more speaking and singing. One Brother who with his
                            companion and children, has recently united their interests with our Society, spoke of the
                            higher aspiration after the divine life of the Master which continually filled his soul, and
                            testified his appreciation of the spiritual life which he found practically illustrated by
                            Brethren and Sisters. One of the last speakers added, "The import of all the good words
                            spoken in worship this morning may be found in the Apostles injunction to put on the whole
                            armor of God. It is the whole armor that is needed, not merely a part of it, to make us able
                            to withstand all evil. Whoever possesses the full armor does not shine with light that is
                            the reflected goodness of another, but with that which is the result of personal endeavor
                            and self-sacrifice." At the close of the services Elder Henry called the attention of the
                            assembly to the subject of the Manifesto ; stating, "It is one of the avenues through which
                            the light of truth can be published to the world ; and Brethren and Sisters who have the
                            ability to speak, will find themselves equally able to write the same thoughts which they
                            express so clearly in the time of worship. I would request all to regard the Manifesto as
                            one of the essentials of our life ; to mention it in conversation with friends and
                            conscientiously do what we can for its support." At the close of the services, we thought
                            that the worshipers might well feel that they had tasted of the good things of the Heavenly
                            kingdom. It was one of many seasons where the soul feels what language cannot portray.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Gather up the fragments" TEIform="index"/> "GATHER UP THE FRAGMENTS."</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Pick, Ernest" TEIform="persName"/> Ernest Pick.</byline><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">I.

                            from Laura and one from Aurelia, and instead of auswering each or writing to others as
                            requested, I thought I would address my letter to you. I have much I could write that I
                            think would interest you and them, as well, but I shall have to desist for the reason that I
                            find so much to see, to learn and to admire, that I do not feel that I can do justice to the
                            season in such a letter as I shall be able to write, in the short time allotted for this
                            purpose. Therefore, I will confine myself to a simple statement of facts as they exist. I am
                            here and enjoying the company of the blest. We arrived at the time appointed. Were met at
                            Laconia by our kind friends, according to agreement. Have been well received by Ministry,
                            Elders and all. Have had several good meetings, where we gained much love and have been
                            greatly strengthened and encouraged. The continuous rain has not diminished our enjoyment so
                            far as visiting is concerned, but 1 have felt very sorrowful at every recollection of the
                            situation of <pb n="223" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> our crops at h')ine, and at Alfred, as well as at this
                            pla-�e. On account of much weariness I have kept my room most of to-day. I have felt a sort
                            of ''all goneness," if I may be allowed the expression. I think my case may be like the
                            person who applied to an M. D. for advice aud was told that rest was all that was needed ;
                            but says the patient, "Please look at my tongue." After doing so the Doctor remarked, '�That
                            needs rest also." But I must admit that my pen has no reason to complain of overwork, and as
                            it will not go of its own accord I think I will place it in the rack as an unprofitable

                            how swiftly time flies, as ever it comes laden with many beautiful truths and testimonies,
                            offerings of sincere, devotedly consecrated souls to the service of God and the uplifting of
                            humanity. It is ever a source of encouragement to me to read of soul battles valiantly
                            fought and victories won. I was forcibly impressed while reading in the August Manifesto,
                            "Soliloquy," by Oliver C. Hampton, the truths it contained aud the necessity of frequent
                            self-examinations. It stirred within my soul latent forces and nerved me for greater action.
                            I always love to read the good teaching? of my older Brethren and Sisters. From good Brother
                            Daniel Orcutt's instructions, I have received much good. The Manifesto is a power, a
                            blessing and I would say, speed on thou swift-winged messenger of truth, flood all the laud

                            style half gothic and half Roman, a large breviary�the daily prayer-book of the Roman
                            Catholic Church�richly adorned with illuminations, may be observed. It is protected from the
                            rain by a little pent-house, and from thieves by an iron grating, which however permits the
                            turning of the leaves. By the side of the book is a narrow arched skylight, cross'ed by two
                            iron bars, which is the only opening that permits the entrance of a little light and air
                            into a small cell located within the wall of the building. The quietness which reigns there
                            is the more profound and the silence the more gloomy since the noise and the crowd of one of
                            the most popular squares of Paris surrounds it on every side. This cell had been famous for
                            centuries. Madame Roland, who mourned deeply the loss of her father who had perished in the
                            crusades, had caused it to be excavated in the wall of her own mansion, in order to confine
                            herself within it forever, retaining nothing of all her possessions but this poor lodging,
                            whose door was walled up and whose skylight was open to winter and summer alike, giving
                            everything else to the poor and to God. The desolate woman awaited death in this anticipated
                            tomb for twenty years, praying night and day for her father's soul, sleeping in ashes,
                            having not even a stone for a pillow, clad in a black sack, living only upon the bread and
                            water which the pity of some passer-by deposited upon the little shelf in <pb n="224" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> front of the opening; thus receiving charity after having been charitable
                            herself. At her death, when about to pass into the other and final sepulchre, she bequeathed
                            her cell in perpetuity to such afflicted women as had great cause to pray much for others or
                            for themselves, and who choose to be buried alive on account of great grief or great
                            penitence The poor of her time buried her with tears and benedictions; but to their great
                            regret the pious daughter failed of canonization on account of lack of influential friends.
                            Those among them who were somewhat bold in their opinions expressed the conviction that that
                            matter would be more easily accomplished in paradise than at Rome ; but the greater part
                            were content to hold Madame Roland's memory sacred and to venerate the tattered remains of
                            her garment as relics. The city on its part, according to the intention of the lady,
                            provided and maintained a public breviary by the side of the cell, not so much for the
                            purpose of inciting to prayer as to draw attention to the poor inmates who had become heirs
                            to Madame Roland's cell, and to prevent their dying from hunger and neglect. This sort of
                            tomb was not at all rare in the middle ages. One met them in the most frequented streets, in
                            the very middle of the noisiest markets, under the feet of the horses and under the wheels
                            of the carriages, a cave, a pit, a walled-up hovel, with iron gratings, where a human being
                            prayed night and day, voluntarily devoted to some eternal lamentation, to some great
                            expiation. And all the reflections which so strange a spectacle awakens in us to-day; that
                            horrible cell, a sort of an abode between a dwelling and a grave, between a city and a
                            cemetery ; this living cut off" from human companionship, being regarded outside of it,
                            numbered among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the shadow ; those
                            remains of life flickering in a ditch ; that sigh, that voice, that prayer eternal in a box
                            of stone; that face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already illumined by
                            another sun ; that ear pilloAved upon the wall of the grave; that soul prisoner in that
                            body, that body prisoner in that dungeon, and under that double prison of flesh and granite,
                            the moaning of that soul in pain : nothing of all that was perceived by the crowd. The piety
                            of those times was not very rational nor very delicate and did not regard an net of religion
                            from so many points of view. It; accepted the fact unquestioning, honored and venerated the
                            sacrifice, but did not attern t to analyze the sufferings and commiserated them but
                            indifferently. It carried occasionally some pittance of food to the miserable penitent,
                            looked into the hole to see if he were still alive, ignorant of his name. hardly knowing how
                            many years had passed since he commenced to die, and the stranger who inquired of the
                            neighbors regar ing the living skeleton he saw in the cave was simply answered : ''It is the
                            recluae." It was on a winter's day of the year 1482 when some charitable women who had
                            remembered the poor inmate of the cell situated on the Place de Greve approached it with
                            some food at d drink. The populace had named the poor woman living there La, Sachette on
                            account of the sack she wore, and they called her abode le trou aux rats� the rat hole :
                            probably a very realistic appellation. It was a sorrowful sight that presented itself to the
                            women aa they peered through the grated opening into the interior. Upon the bare stone floor
                            of the narrow cell crouched the figure of a woman. Her chin rested upon her knees, her arms
                            were folded before her. Clothed in a brown sack which covered the entire form in long folds,
                            the long fjray hair falling even to the feet, it was a strange spectacle to see. It was like
                            a spectre one see-, in a dream, pale, immovable, sinister. Hardly could one dit-eern in the
                            dark twilight the severe lines of a pale emaciated countenance; hardly could one perceive a
                            bare foot upon the frozen, rigid floor of stone. The little one could see of the human form
                            clothed in that robe of mourning, made one shudder. That figure crouched upon the flags
                            appeared to have neither movement, thougnt nor breath. Under that thin robe of linen, in
                            January, lying upon that bare floor of granite, without fire, in the shadow of the dungeon,
                            where the sunlight never entered, she did not appear to suffer, nor even to feel. One could
                            have said that she was stone with the dun- <pb n="225" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> geon, ice with the winter.
                            The han ds fold ed, the eyes fixed. At the first glance one took it to be a spectre, at the
                            second for a statue. But from time to time those blue lips half opened for a sigh, and from
                            those mournful eyes went forth a look ineffable, profound, lugubrious, imperturbable. Such
                            was the creature inhabiting le trou avx rais. When the spectators at the window perceived
                            this immovable attitude they said to each other in low whispers, "Let us not trouble her;
                            she is in her ecstacy; she is praying." But when they finally decided to make their presence
                            known, they clled many times: "Sister! Sister!" before the slightest motion gave evidence
                            that death indeed had not overtaken the miserable woman. Then a long shivering fit seemed to
                            run through her body from head to foot, her teeth rattled, she took her feet in her hands
                            and said: "Oh, they're terrible cold!" "Poor woman! do you wish a little fire?" She shook
                            her head. "Well, then take this flask of spiced wine; it will give you some warmth." Again
                            she shook her head and said, "Water!" "No, Sister! that is no drink for you in January: take
                            this wine and eat this cake we have bought for you." She pushed back the proffered cake and
                            said: "Black bread!" Then one took off her warm woolen cloak and endeavored to have her
                            accept it, but met with the same refusal. At last she said : "Give me some water : I have
                            had none for two days, the world has forgotten me, and why should it not?" [These acts of
                            severe and unreasonable self-mortification, whether practiced by Christians or Hindoos, have
                            their origin in the religious instinct which seems to be more or less common to all mankind.
                            It is the doctrine of works pushed to the extreme. The reaction against that system
                            culminated in Calvin's dictum : "Only believe!" Both systems, carried to the radical
                            ultimate, are absurdly unreasonable. If faith without good works is dead, then are works
                            that of themselves are not good, also dead, though they are done in the name of faith. A
                            simple, peaceful life of virtue and usefulness is the best evidence of repentauce, the only
                            atonement sanctioned by revealed religion and by common sense ; it is the highest act of
                            human devotion possible. To live that life requires more of self-denial than La Sachette was
                            ever called upon to practice.]</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Tickets to heaven" TEIform="index"/> TICKETS TO HEAVEN.</head><p TEIform="p">According to a correspondent of the Pittsburg Dispatch, the Swiss federal authorities have
                            just been calling to account the abbot and monks of a celebrated monastery for driving a
                            thriving trade in "Tickets to Heaven." Since the first of the year, 45,000 tickets have been
                            sold, which indicates an immense amount of gullability in those parts. But really these

                            recovery of Palestine from the Mohammedans, was resolved on in 1095 by Pope Urban II. But
                            through the enthusiasm of Peter the Hermit, the people could not wait for regular
                            proceedings, and four bands of unorganized crusades started. The first 20,000 headed by
                            Walter the Penniless; the second 40,000 by Peter the Hermit, and the third consisting of
                            15,000 Germans, and an immense mob of 200,000 from England, France. Flanders and Lorraine.
                            These were either destroyed before reaching Palestine, or routed in the engagement there. It
                            was only now that the true crusaders entered upon the scene. Six armies, embracing all the
                            chivalry of Europe, headed respectfully by Godfrey of Boullion, Hugh the Great, Robert
                            Curthroses, Count Eobert of Flanders, Prince Bohemond of Tarentum, and Count Raymond of
                            Toulouse started for . Jerusalem. Uniting their forces, the first conquest was the capture
                            of Nice, in June 1097. The sultan Soliman was next defeated and the principality of Edessa
                            taken. Antioch was captured after a siege of seven months, mid reverses, and they at last
                            saw the way open to Jerusalem. The city was taken on the 15th of July 1098, and Godfrey of
                            Boullion crowned king of Jerusalem. But such a victory was easier gained than held. The
                            Christians of Jerusalem, surrounded as they were by countries of hostile Mohammedans,
                            frequently lost the city; and seven other crusades were called out between the years of 1147
                            and 1270, all of which failed in the object for which they started, the entire subjugation
                            of Palestine. But such energy in what they deemed a righteous cause, was not destined to be
                            counted an entire failure : for it led to results more beneficial than the crusaders'
                            wildest dream. Western Europe became acquainted with two civilizations, more advanced than
                            its own, the Greek and Saracenic. Thus a powerful impetus was given to the literature and
                            commerce of Europe, breaking the spell, of the dark ages. Richard the Lion-hearted of
                            England, was a leader in the third crusade, and Prince Edward, afterward Edward I. of
                            England, a leader of the eighth and last. The Children's crusade, one of the strangest
                            events of history, started in 1212, consisting of three armies of French and German
                            children, numbering in all 70,000. They thought that miracles would be performed for them
                            and by their means the Moslems become converted. Some were discouraged and returned home,
                            some stopped by the way, but most of them perished on the march, or were sold into slavery.

                                    Marriage Wrong. [Translated from Count Tolstoi's Manuscript.] (From the Philadelphia
                                    Press.) I have received and still continue to receive, numbers of letters from
                                    persons who are perfect strangers to me, asking me to state in plain and simple
                                    language my own views on the subject handled in the story entitled "The Kreutzer
                                    Sonata." With this request I shall now endeavor to comply. My views on the question
                                    may be succinctly stated as follows : Without entering into details it will be
                                    generally admitted that I am accurate in saying that many people condone in young
                                    men a course of conduct with the other sex which is incompatible with strict
                                    morality, and that this dissoluteness is pardoned generally. Both parents and the
                                    Government, in consequence of-this view, may be said to wink at profligacy and even
                                    in the last resort to encourage its practice. I am of the opinion that it is not
                                    right. It is not possible that the health of one class should necessitate the ruin
                                    of another, and, in consequence, it is our first duty to turn a deaf ear to such an
                                    essentially immoral doctrine, no matter how strongly society may have established or
                                    law protected it- Moreover, it needs to be fully recognized that men are rightly to
                                    be held responsible for the consequences of their acts, and that these are no longer
                                    to be visited upon the women alone. It follows from this that it is the duty of men
                                    who do not wish to live a life of infamy to practice such continence in respect to
                                    all women as they woiald were the female society in which they move made up
                                    exclusively of their own mothers and sisters. � A more rational mode of life should
                                    be adopted, which would include the abstinence from alcoholic drinks, from excess in
                                    eating and from flesh meat, on the one hand, and recourse to physical labor on the
                                    other. I am not speaking of gymnastics, or of any of those occupations which may be
                                    fitly described as playing at work; I mean the genuine toil that fatigues. No one
                                    need go far in search of proof that this kind of abstemious living is not merely
                                    possible, but far less hurtful to health than excess. Hundreds of instances are
                                    known to every one. This is my first contention. CUPID TO BE 8IIUNNED. In the second
                                    place, I think that of late years, through various reasons into which I need not
                                    enter, but among which the above mentioned laxity in opinion in society and the
                                    frequent idealization of the subject in current literature and painting may be
                                    ment'.oned, conjugal infidelity has become more common and is considered less
                                    reprehensible. I am of opinion that this is not right. The origin of this evil is
                                    twofold. Tt is due, in the first place, to a natural instinct and in the second to
                                    the elevation of this instinct to a place to which it does not rightly belong. This
                                    being so, the evil can only be remedied by effecting a change in the views now in
                                    vogue about "falling in love" and all that this term implies by educating men and
                                    women at home through family influence and example, and abroad by means of healthy
                                    public opinion, to practice that abstinence which morality and Christianity alike
                                    enjoin. This is my second contention. In the third place, I am of opinion that
                                    another consequence of the false light in which "falling in love" and what it leads
                                    to are viewed in our society is that the birth of children has lost its pristine
                                    significance, and that modern marriages are conceived less and less from the point
                                    of view of the family. I am of opinion that this is not right. This is my third
                                    contention. CHILDREN OVERFED AND SPOILED. In the fourth place, I am of opinion that
                                    the children (who in our society are either an obstacle to enjoyment�an unlucky
                                    accident as it were) are educated not with a view to the problem which they will be
                                    one day called on to face and to solve, but solely with an eye to the pleasure which
                                    they may be made to yield to their parents. The consequence is that the children of
                                    human be- <pb n="228" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> ings are brought up for all the world like the
                                    young of animals, the chief care of their parents being not to train them to such
                                    work as is worthy of men and women, but to increase their weight, to add a cubit to
                                    their stature, to make them spruce, sleek, well-fed and comely. They rig them out in
                                    all manner of fantastic costumes, wash them, overfeed them, and refuse to make them
                                    work. If the children of t^e lower orders differ in this last respect from those of
                                    the well-to-do class, the difference is merely formal; they work from sheer
                                    necessity, and not because their parents recognize work as a duty. And in over-fed
                                    children as in over-fed animals, sensuality is engendered unnaturally early.
                                    Fashionable dress to-day, the course of reading, plays, music, dances, luscious
                                    food� all the elements of our modern life, in a word, from the pictures on the
                                    little boxes of sweetmeats up to the novel, the tale and the poem�contribute to fan
                                    this sensuality into a strong, consuming flame, with the result that sexual vices
                                    and diseases have come to be the normal conditions of the period of tender youth,
                                    and often continue into the riper age of full-blown manhood. And I am of the opinion
                                    that this is not right. It is high time it ceased. The children of human beings
                                    should not be brought up as if they were animals, and we should set up as the object
                                    and strive to obtain as the result of our labors something better and nobler than a
                                    well-dressed body. This is my fourth contention. LOVE OVERRATED. In the fifth place,
                                    I am of the opinion that owing to the exaggerated and erroneous significance
                                    attributed by our society to love and to the idealized states that accompany and
                                    succeed it, the best energies of our men and women are drawn forth and exhausted
                                    during the most promising period of life; those of the men in the work of looking
                                    for, choosing and winning the most desirable objects of love, for which purpose
                                    lying and fraud are held to be quite excusable; those of the women and girls in
                                    alluring men and decoying them into liaisons or marriage by the most questionable
                                    means conceivable, as an instance of which the present fashions in evening dress may
                                    be cited. I am of opninion that this is not right. The truth is that the whole
                                    affair has been exalted by poets and romancers to an undue importance, and that love
                                    in its various developments is not a fitting object to consume the best energies of
                                    men. People set it before them and strive after it, because their view of life is as
                                    vulgar and brutish as is that other conception frequently met with in the lower
                                    stages of development, which sees in luscious and abundant food an end worthy of
                                    man's best efforts. Now, this is not right, and should not be done. And, in order to
                                    avoid doing it, it is only needful to realize the fact that whatever truly deserves
                                    to be held up as a worthy object of man's striving and working, whether it be the
                                    service of humanity, of one's country, of science, of art, not to speak of the
                                    service of God, is far above and beyond the sphere of personal enjoyment. Hence it
                                    follows that not only to form a liaison, but even to contract marriage is, from a
                                    Christian point of view, not a progress, but a fall. Love and all the states that
                                    accompany and follow it, however we may try in prose and verse to prove the
                                    contrary, never do and never can facilitate the attainment of an aim worthy of men,
                                    but always makes it more difficult. This is my fifth contention. How about the human
                                    race? If we admit that celibacy is better and nobler than marriage, evidently the
                                    human race will come to an end. But if the logical conclusion of the argument is
                                    that the human race will become extinct, the whole reasoning is wrong. To that I
                                    reply that the argument is not mine; I did not invent it. That it is incumbent on
                                    mankind so to strive and that celibacy is preferable to marriage ave truths revealed
                                    by Christ nineteen hundred years ago, set forth in our catechisms and professed by
                                    us as followers of Christ. MAN NATURALLY CHASTE. The same truth is confirmed by our
                                    reason, which tells us that the only solution not repugnant to the sentiment of
                                    humanity of the problem of overpopulation is afforded by the systematic striving
                                    after chastity, which though distasteful to animals, is natural to man. <pb n="229" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> It is a most extraordinary thing when you come to think of it;
                                    Malthusian theories can be broached and propagated; millions of children may be
                                    allowed to die every year of hunger and want; millions upon millions of human beings
                                    may be butchered in war; the State may strain every nerve to increase and perfect
                                    the means of killing the people and look upon this as the main aim and object of its
                                    existence�all these things may be done under our eyes without striking us as in any
                                    way dangerous to humanity, but let some one hint at the necessity of celibacy, and
                                    immediately the cry is raised that the human race is in danger. When a person asks
                                    you his way to a place there are two methods of directing him. You may either point
                                    to a distant tree and tell him to make straight for that, thence on to the village,
                                    and from the village along the river bank till he comes to the hill, &amp;c, or
                                    else you may give him the general direction, telling him to walk due eastward and to
                                    let the inaccessible sun and stars serve him as finger-posts. The former of these
                                    methods is that of transitory religions with their detailed prescriptions and
                                    instructions; the latter is that of the inner consciousness of eternal,
                                    incorruptible truth. In the former case certain actions are described as having to
                                    be performed or avoided, in the latter the goal only is pointed out�a goal which,
                                    though forever unattainable, is recognized by our inner consciousness as 'the true
                                    one, and communicates the right direction to our life work. Keep holy the Sabbath
                                    day, perform the rite of circumcision, drink no spirituous liquors, do not steal,
                                    give a tithe of your goods to the poor, do not commit adultery, make the sign of the
                                    cross, receive the sacrament of communion, &amp;c. Such are the formal precepts
                                    of Brahminism, Buddhism, Israelitism, Mohammedanism and the ecclesiasticism called
                                    Christianity.

One
                                    was ruddy, and red as blood, And one was clear as the crystal flood. Said the glass
                                    of wine to the paler brother, Let us tell the tales of the past to each other; I can
                                    tell of banquet and revel and mirth, And the proudest and grandest souls on earth
                                    Fell under my touch as though struck by blight, Where I was king, for I ruled in
                                    might. From the heads of kings I have torn the crown, From the height of fame I have
                                    hurled men down ; I have blasted many an honored name, I have taken virtue and given
                                    shame; I have tempted the youth with a sip, a taste, That has made his future a
                                    barren waste. Far greater than king am I, Or than any army beneath the sky. I have
                                    made the arm of the driver fail, And sent the train from the iron rail; I have made
                                    good ships go down at sea, And the shrieks of the lost were sweet to me; For they
                                    said: "Behold, how great you be! Fame, strength, wealth, genius before you fall, And
                                    your might and power are over all." Ho ! ho ! pale brother, laughed the wine, "Can
                                    you boast of deeds as great as mine?" Said the water glass : "I cannot boast Of a
                                    king dethroned or a murdered host; But I can tell of a heart once sad By my crystal
                                    drops made light and glad; Of thirsts I've quenched and brows I've laved ; Of hands
                                    I have cooled *,nd souls I have saved; I have leaped through the valley, dashed down
                                    the mountain, , I lowed in the river and played in the fountain, Slept in the
                                    sunshine and dropped from the sky, And everywhere gladdened the landscape and eye. I
                                    have eased the hot forehead of fever and pain, I have made the parched meadows grow
                                    fertile with grain; I can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill, That ground out
                                    the flour and turned at my will; I can tell of manhood debased by you, That I have
                                    lifted and crowned anew. I cheer, I help, I strengthen and aid; I gladden the heart
                                    of man and maid; I set the chained wine-captive free, And all are better for knowing
                                    me." These are the tales they told each other, The glass of wine and paler brother,

                            </head><p TEIform="p">Whatever may be for the advancement or the stability of our Community, which has become
                                our religious home, should claim the special attention of every member who may be
                                interested in its prosperity. The basis upon which this home is established, its
                                Covenant, its order and its religious obligations, are so diametrically opposite from
                                that of the little, selfish communities of the world, including as they do, the very
                                relations we ignore, that we must, in our system of management, follow that order which
                                makes peace in our secular and religious life, and which will lead to the Kingdom of
                                God. A community which rests upon Christian principles, as enunciated in the testimony
                                of Jesus, and has within itself the power of remoulding the life of its members and of
                                establishing in them the peaceab e fruits of righteousness as it supplants the life of
                                the world, must rest under the Divine care of an overruling Providence. The beautiful
                                promises which Jesus so kindly proffered to his disciples will be claimed as
                                compensatory, and indeed, they will flow into the Christian's path as naturally as the
                                rivulets and rivers flow into the great sea. The religious work of the Community must
                                always be in close correspondence with the work of the divine Teacher which the sacred
                                Record informs us was to do good to suffering humanity. That valuable lesson of the good
                                Samaritan which Jesus so carefully illustrated for the benefit of his disciples, will
                                ever find a resting-place in the hearts of those who accept the beautiful mission of
                                Christian kindness, and assist them in their earnest efforts to do God's will on the
                                earth as it is done in heaven. We then can ask in all confidence, "Give us this day our
                                daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those wTho trespass against
                                us." It is the spiritual life of the Community that develops the relation of Brethren
                                and Sisters, and which gives it a position above the selfish and unhallowed relations of
                                the <pb n="231" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> world. For its greater prosperity, the Community must accept
                                what the experience of a century has so thoroughly taught. "Order is heaven's first
                                law." It is the harbinger of peace and a crowning glory of a gospel home. It then
                                follows that those who would wish to enter into the new and heavenly relation, while
                                upon the earth, must become the subjects of a good and protective system of order. That
                                rule which governs the natural man in his relations with the world, may not be
                                calculated to protect him in the spiritual relations which he is expected to maintain
                                with his Brethren and Sisters. The good apostle fully realized this fact as he grew to
                                be a disciple in Christ, and was led to make this remark, "I glory in the cross of
                                Christ, by which I am crucified to the world, and the world to me." It is, indeed, a
                                crucifixion of the selfish nature of man to enter a Community that urges the necessity
                                of living a life in harmony with the life of Christ. It needs no creed to fetter the
                                mind, and needs no elaborate ceremony to demand recognition ; it only needs that the
                                life shall be changed from wrong to right, that the path of the Lord shall be made
                                strait, and that all ungodliness and every worldly lust shall be crucified that a new,
                                spiritual life may be developed in the soul. By zeal and earnest labors of many faithful
                                souls who have consecrated their lives to God, our Communities were carefully organized
                                and maintained as religious homes for those who are willing to leave the old inheritance
                                of the world and become the followers of Christ. As we have accepted the new and sacred
                                inheritance the prosperity and perpetuity of these religious homes must devolve upon us.
                                We know the great value they have been to our gospel parents, and also to the present
                                generation, and may well grow anxious in our prayers for the present and future

                                The Home Notes Corner seems like a family circle, where each instructs as well as
                                learns. Let us hear more of the various improvements peculiar to each Society, that all
                                may he benefited. It gives us a oneness which should mark our organizations. Not a
                                oneness in inert laxity, but a determination to struggle for the perfect life which was
                                the grand plan of our founders. One of the marked improvements in our Society in the
                                past few years, is the beautifying of our homes by well-kept lawns, and neat paths about
                                our dwellings ; and we hope, to see the boundary line of care widen each <pb n="232" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> year until the mudless village path appears. The home care speaks of
                                interest and vitality especially when it is the work of the young; and of an unselfish
                                interest, when it is blest and aided by those whose whitened locks hint of the home
                                "over there." Tidiness in the home, order in its environs, says to the passer-by "Come;"
                                while long rank weeds and grass out of place reminds one of the pestilent-cursed city
                                where grass grows in the market places and the death knell urges all to pass by rapidly.
                                Our homes are missionaries. What are they teaching of our inner life? The Census
                                enumerator whose duty called him to our Society in June, felt that he had struck a
                                bonanza. So many names in so brief a time, with no wasted moments over suppressed names,
                                ages or employments. He said he had done better in our village than in any part of his
                                district; and should henceforth refute the idea that the "Shakers were running out." A.

                                from the amount of straw gathered should think we will have a large yield of grain. The
                                week previous had 6% inches rain so that the earth was literally soaked and still the
                                rain came and we were almost disposed to worry about it, but to what purpose; it would
                                neither improve the weather nor our spirits, hence the best thing to be done was to bear
                                it patiently. We wonder what has become of the feathered songsters that used to regale
                                us with their sweet music. Birds are to be seen but they give us no notes of joy.
                                Perhaps the singing ones have taken themselves off to a more genial clime to cheer other
                                of earth's pilgrims with their delightful carols. This week Monday we put up our first
                                batch of tomatoes of the season, 20 galls. They are much later this season than common
                                in ripening although we spent much time potting the plants, having an idea that by so
                                doing we should get them eight or ten days earlier. Our people think highly of them cut
                                up and served on the table raw. Elder Danit-1 and Eldress Ann left their Central home
                                for Watervliet on the 25th. and expected to be joined by Elder Giles and Eldress Harriet
                                during the week. Finished digging and storing potatoes. They are large; the quality is
                                excellent and we have a large crop. Br. Alonzo Hollister returned yesterday having spent
                                4 weeks in visiting the Believers at Gloucester, Alfred, Canterbury, Harvard and
                                Shirley. He conies back to us refreshed and invigorated and with renewed energy. He
                                reports having had a delightful time and expresses heartfelt gratitude to God and to all
                                his kind friends who have entertained him. It will long be, he says, as an oasis of
                                happiness to dwell upon in memory. Sep. 10th. Men commence this morning laying a tile
                                floor in the kitchen department. We hope it will prove a complete success and keep out
                                those pestiferous rodents that inhabit our cellars and gain access to the kitchen to the

                                admirers of punctuality, so send Bible answers that you may know we have studied the
                                Sept. Manifesto and like it. We have been busy at work, as usual; but one day last week,
                                (Friday) fourteen persons from our family went down to Lake Queechey for a change. All
                                enjoyed the day very much as it was the finest one of the season. We were rowing and
                                singing on the lake most of the time. At twelve o'clock we sat down to a good dinner. It
                                was prepared by Sister Mary Jane the day before. She has taken charge of over seven
                                bushels of blackberries the past two weeks that were gathered near home. For every
                                blessing we are thankful. There are several improvements we want to make before winter
                                sets in, knowing full well that "a stitch in time saves nine," always, neither can we
                                forget the good old maxims, "cleanliness is next to godliness," and "a soft answer
                                turneth away wrath" and "honesty is the best policy" "the hand of the diligent maketh
                                rich," and then, "waste not want not." Will close by saying that none are sick among us.

                                1890. Beloved Elder Henry :�Your very kind letter of the 8th. inst. reminds me of
                                blessed Mother Ann, and of the marvelous changes that have been wrought in our own
                                order, and in the outside world. It is now one hundred and six years since Mother Ann
                                passed to spirit life. If changes in spirit life have been effected in Mother and her
                                companions in the same proportion they have here, what glory and beauty there must be
                                unfolded. I think it very profitable to take a retrospective view of the progress that
                                has been made, it gives hope and courage for the future. It is thought that moves the
                                world, without it we are as the beasts that perish. It was thought that brought the
                                steamengine, the spinning-jenny, the reaper and binder. It is thought that has given us
                                the electric light and motor, the telephone and phonograph. It is thought that is
                                developing the bounties of kind Providence, and it is thought that will bring about a
                                system of justice, under which, everybody will be made happy, and the whole earth turned
                                into joyfulness. It is evil thought turned to selfish ends and purposes, thoughts of
                                hatred and revenge, of mocking scorn and uncleanness : tt ese form the hells and create
                                all the misery there is in the earth, while every good thought helps to make heaven, and
                                everybody happy. Within six weeks we have had over one foot of rain. The general cry is,
                                enough. As we come near the apple harvest time, we more fully realize the scarcity
                                Potatoes all around are rotting, and it is so wet it makes very tedious digging. Winter
                                wheat is up and looks very fine. Eye not yet all sown. Have had nearly three in,ches of
                                rain this week, but no rain on Sundays that prevented our meeting together at the
                                meeting-house. The strangers who have met with us, have been exceedingly attentive, and
                                must have received some ideas that set them thinking. If the amount of good done by
                                Believers through their public meetings, could all be Summed up, what a mighty pile
                                there would be. So we will toil on, and pray on ; sow early and sow late; and never
                                forget the assembling of ourselves together. The brightest spots in my life are the
                                blessed experiences with gospel friends in our spiritual meetings : they are living
                                springs from fountains that never fail. In kindest love, and a renewal of every good
                                resolution, I close. D.

                                In looking over the Notes about Home, I find nolhing from the Valley to inform our
                                Brethren and Sisters in other parts of the vineyard that we are laboring for a full
                                share in the gospel harvest, although as of old the harvest is great and consecrated
                                laborers are few; yet these few are earnest, zealous souls working out their own
                                salvation from sin, and as earnest for the elevation of others who may seek help. The
                                South Family have harvested a fair crop of hay, rye and oats, and now the farmers are
                                preparing the ground for winter grain We have commeuti-d canninu: tomatoes which bid
                                fair to \ ield a g&gt;od crop if these cold nights do not hring on the t arly frosts. We
                                have been moving our canning department to make it more convenient for the Sisters and
                                to economize our time in handling the goods. A small company went last week on an
                                excursion to our Mohawk valley farm and found the B.oom corn and Indian corn looking
                                quite well. The rain came just in time for earing. We had harvested a fine crop of oats
                                and threshed them by steam power while on the field. We obtained 578 bushels. We are now
                                making some more ch:mgi s, and have taken down our old dwelling and are building a new d

Beautiful, refreshing anil restful are the lovely days that are at present ours

                                joys it offers. Autumn conies to us in her vernal dress, laden with choice and abundant
                                gifts, amply rewarding the husbandman for his arduous labors. All crops, excepting that
                                of fruit, gave a bountiful yield and are of good quality. Br. Ira tells us that the
                                potato crop is superior to any that has been produced in this section during the past
                                twenty years. Also that oats and corn average well. Hay was stored in fine condition and
                                was considered equal in quantity to that of last year's growth, which was, in the
                                opinion of competent judges, the best that has been grown on the hillsides and valleys
                                of famed old Berkshire in many years. Cutting and drying sweet corn will soon be the
                                business of the day. but will be despatched in a brief snace of time, as the quantity
                                raised does not compare with that of former seasons The Brethren have added somewhat to
                                their many home cares by preparing a long bed for strawberries, in which two thousand
                                five hundred plants have already been set, and more will be added later in the season. A
                                two inch water-pipe under fifty-five ft. head has been put down, connecting with other
                                pipes for the purpose of irrigating the plants if necessary. Our blackberry patch of
                                nearly four square rods yielded a fraction over eight bushels. They are of the Snyder
                                variety and added much to the delicacies of our table. In our former note we stated that
                                pears with us were a total failure. Since then our Brethren have found and gathered a
                                small quantity of the choicest varieties. The Bartlett, Duchess de'Angalene &amp;c,

                                watched their <pb n="235" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> growth ever since they presented the appearance of
                                bean poles, waiting for the vines to grow and cover them. Now we notice as keenly the
                                first tinge of crimson that foretells autumn. Soon the woods, and even our own
                                door-yard, so convenient for the robins, because of the leafy homes it offers them, will
                                be resplendent with colors of every hue. And so the seasons rotate; who could have
                                planned a better world so far as variety is concerned? Our summer has been far more
                                summerish than was the same period of time last year. We have had a large number of
                                strangers inspecting our premises this season. It seems to be the fashion, just now, to
                                get away from home, even if in the getting away you get into close, inconvenient
                                apartments and wish yourselves back again, as one woman told me was her experience;
                                consequently we have had some intelligent investigators, some well intended pleasure
                                seekers, and more ignorant curiosity seekers than usual. Have they tarried with us for a
                                brief space of time, sufficient to get a dinner, a birds-eye view of the locality, and
                                departed with the antique idea that we sold apple sauce and brooms, did not marry
                                &amp;c? Or have they realized the good influence which should emanate from pure,
                                honest lives, an idea, at least, that here is a Community based upon the radical
                                principles of Christianity, which, with all its defects (not in principles but
                                individuals) is the strait and narrow way, of which, our Savior said, "But few there be
                                who walk therein?" These are questions that have occupied my mind, as I have beheld the
                                different companies all-absorbing ideas of some description, the effects of which they
                                bear to their respective homes. Our apple crop, according to the estimate of our Br.
                                John Cumings, who for many years has cared for the harvesting of this much-used
                                esculent, is hardly half its usual amount. We who attended the apple cutting last
                                evening, believe this, if tangible proof is worth anything, for we dressed some of such
                                diminutive proportions, that after dressing, we queried which was the good fruit, and
                                which was to be relegated to the offal barrel, but as we were thereby reminded of the
                                economizing virtues taught by our good fathers and mothers in this branch of the
                                "Vineyard," it may prove a blessing, making us grateful for "small things." E.

                                intermingled with bright sunny days. Elder Joseph arrived home from Cleveland yesterday
                                in good health. The potato crop which is now all harvested but an acre or two, though
                                poor will probably be enough for our own use. But we have no fruit. Other crops moderate
                                in yield except grass which was heavy. We are beginning repairs on a moderate scale and
                                if we can only hold on to Elder Joseph, we think in a few j ears we shall be able to
                                shine out with something of our ancient splendor not only, but with many moderate
                                improvements superadded. Let us conclude we have deserved about all the severe
                                chastening we have received and that now we have had about all we need and that we are
                                about to enter on a more prosperous career. We can thus "raise a tax on our calamity"
                                and find spiritual sustenance from the same until we can get into better shape. We are
                                putting into our Luandry a new washmill, new floor and a new rotary wringer. We have
                                about three hundred swine and two carloads will be ready to ship in about two and one
                                half months. We are also selling off six or seven hundred logs of sugar tree timber to a
                                last factory. We have quite an amount of wheat for sale and that is better than having
                                to buy. Your correspondent has once more finished his annual cutting of weeds over one
                                and one half miles of road, besides going over the yards two or three times. The grass
                                is very green and beautiful since the showers and those sugar trees I set out around the
                                Laundry about the time ycu were here are perfectly beautiful, large and of a deep green
                                and makes a perfect paradise of a place. Here comes the best of all. On the 7th of
                                August our Beloved Ministry from Mt. Lebanon arrived here, and we had a perfectly

                                not stop to count, though 'tis many a day. Now if you'll just come when our notes become
                                due, We'll then have new notes we can tender to you, The greatest of strikes in our town
                                you will hear, Are the clocks, they all strike each hour of the year. Among the many
                                Manifesto notes made manifest, one we will just now take note of; � he reporter from
                                Canterbury testifies to the new and cold method of preserving rhubarb in all its summer
                                freshness and greenness. Happily we at Grovel and are among the class known as disciples
                                of the new and better way, advocating best systems of being and doing, thinking and
                                acting, therefore we have tested the cold water plan for rhubarb preservation, and shall
                                hereafter renounce the old way of saving by fire. Other fruits are found to be superior
                                by adopting the water-cure plan: peaches, plums, apricots, quinces and many more
                                varieties preserved in this way will long retain the flavor of newly gathered fruit.
                                Then when winter winds blow and showers of snow Go dancing through the air, You'll have
                                fruits that are fresh your table to bless, Healthful, delightful and fair. The sweet
                                corn culture that for many years has been the leading occupation through the fall
                                season, will this autumn be remembered as a venture of the past, with anticipation of
                                its future renewal, but if not practicable to continue in the corn scheme, we hope to
                                develope a substitute of greater revenue. The multiplied and added rain-storms of the
                                spring and planting division of the year, was the principal medium that caused the
                                subtraction from our long-accustomed yearly transaction, (Sweet Corn Drying.) The weeds
                                of New York State grow as rank and tall, as big and small as those we read about and are
                                made note of by the note perfector from Enfield, Conn. We remember a suggestion advanced
                                in the long ago by the late Henry Ward Beecher that "constant cultivation of weeds will
                                ultimately eradicate them." If Beecher had been a tiller of the soil instead of an
                                expounder of religious theories, his declaration concerning weed life would have read
                                thus : What we cultivate will grow, Weeds or flowers we all well know. Tuesday noon of
                                the 26th. of the past month we were favored with the arrival of Elder Giles B. Avery,
                                Eldress Harriet Bullard and Elizabeth Cantrell of the Mt. Lebanon Society. The following
                                evening the family were most agreeably entertained for nearly two hours with a recital
                                by Elder Giles of their journey through sections of <pb n="237" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> Ohio and
                                Kentucky, also their visits to the Societies in said States. The account was interesting
                                from beginning to its close, and was listened to by an appreciative audience. Thursday
                                morning the company left here for their own home in the East. Saturday the 30th. a party
                                of three left home on the 4-30 P. M. train for Rochester to attend the funeral of John
                                Siddons who for many years has been a kind and valued friend of this Society. The
                                company followed the remains to Mount Hope cemetery, witnessing the beautiful and
                                impressive services in honor of the worthy dead Whose life in this world was ever One of
                                beneficent deeds, Whose soul was the Soul of goodness Unclouded by forms and creeds :
                                Whose love, was the love of giving, Not giving for worldly fame, But living, giving and

                            He will not forsake us even if we do wrong, then we should ask his forgiveness and try to do
                            better. King David did wrong but God forgave him when he asked. Temptation is wry strong and
                            we have to keep very close watch of ourselves to keep out of the way of it; even Christ was
                            tempted but he did not yield he had trust in God his Father. It should be our labor to
                            follow his example and then we will have our reward in heaven.

                                    "gentle" voice, though not necessarily "soft" or "low," is a means of grace to
                                    teacher and taught alike. Few teachers realize how accurately their gain or loss in
                                    influence can be measured by the quality of the tone in which they talk. There is no
                                    excuse for the hard, sharp, rasping tone, so common as to be usually reckoned one of
                                    the characteristics of a "Rchoolma'm," even in the noisiest room or among the most
                                    unruly children. The law of similia, similibus curantur does not hold good in such a

                                    and they must be angelic, indeed, who can escape such transformation. The teacher
                                    should know how to make distinctness serve in place of force to the end of sparing
                                    her own throat and the nerves of her pupils.�Caroline B.

                        </head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">In a little account of India, Herodotus says that it is the finest of all the
                                    countries of the East. He says that, with the exception of the horses, the beasts
                                    and birds in India are the largest in the world. He says that the people get their
                                    gold by washing it out, while other people have to dig for theirs. And then, as the
                                    acme of their lazy prosperity, he says their wool grows on trees. "The trees there,
                                    in a state of nature, bear woolly fruit, which in beauty and in strength surpasses
                                    the wool from sheep, and the people of India wear clothes made from it." This is the
                                    first allusion to cotton made in western literature. It is a little curious, indeed,
                                    that no distinct reference to it is to be found in the Bible, which runs back to
                                    much further than Herodotus. The Jews must have seen cotton awnings and probably
                                    cotton clothing in Babylon; and there could hardly have been an army from the East
                                    on the soil of Palestine but embodied many cotton-clothed soldiers. Herodotus, it
                                    will be seen, cites it by way of gratifying that curious natural wish of the human
                                    heart, that things may grow on trees. In all travellers' stories, their accounts of
                                    such marvels are the most attractive. Roast chickens, growing on trees, are a part
                                    of the bill of fare in Peter Wilkins. In the same category, Herodotus, wishing to
                                    commend India to his readers, tells them in brief that there is no need to feed or
                                    wash sheep,�none to clip their wool: an end to shepherds and to wolves; no nightly
                                    watches; no daily tramp for the recovery of ram or of lamb. All this disappears when
                                    he tells his readers that the wool grows on trees. � And, alas, the readers believed
                                    him as much and as little as the readers of Peter W'ilkins believed him! �From ''
