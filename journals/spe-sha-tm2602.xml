                            desiring to speak with him. Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
                            stand without, desiring to speak with thee. But he answered and said unto him that told him,
                            Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his
                            disciples and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of my
                            Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother." To the natural
                            parent-heart, whose affections are wrapped up in the life and interests of their exclusive
                            familes, this language of the Master sounds harsh and unfeeling, because the narrow range of
                            vision precludes the broader view of life taken by him who has a wider horizon, and sees
                            things in their superior relationship. Not the mere ties of consanguinity, constitute true
                            and lasting friendship ; there is a moral unity that springs from soul sentiments, and this
                            sublime doctrine was emphasized in the text. The mind of Jesus glanced upward from every
                            topic. He loved not his own mother the less, for her heart was in sympathy with his mission.
                            It was as if he had said, "She is truly my mother, and they are my brethren in the higher
                            life ; but not alone she who bore and reaped me, but all who are likewise doing the will of
                            the universal Father and Mother of all souls, who have the well-springs of goodness and
                            truth in their hearts, are my relation." All true union and harmony of spirit springs from
                            moral conditions and not from those human instincts that we hold in common with the animal
                            creation. Sexual love and physical attraction, spring from the sensual naFEBRUARY <pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 26 THE MANIFESTO. ture, and is not man's highest estate of happiness The true
                            affection of the natural, should open to our thought the universal love and affection,
                            which, in the progressive state of unfoldtnent, shall exist between all truly good and pure
                            natures. "In Christ there is neither male nor female," which represents a condition of human
                            advancement, when fleshly lusts and desires shall be consumed by the indwelling of God's
                            Spirit. We should always seek in those that are nearest us in kinship of the Mesh, not that
                            which affiliates them to us as natural persons, but that which is to be perpetuated when the
                            body dies; we should strive to lift our heart's affections into the exalted sphere of
                            universal and permanent blending of heart and soul. Have we not all formed social,
                            intellectual and moral affinities that have proved stronger than natural ties ? Soul
                            friendship and comprehensive exchange of thought and feeling unknown in our own family
                            circle, where there is often estrangement because of difference of opinion among the members
                            of the household? There is a growing tendency in this age of alliances, to concentrate for
                            mutual good. There seems to be two spirits at work in opposite directions, one in the form
                            of trusts and monopolies for individual aggrandizement; another in the form of co-operation
                            and guilds for the fraternization and benefit of the masses, who are the wage slaves of the
                            moneyed classes. Progress, like the spiral motion of all things, tends to ever increasing
                            life and activity, which draws humanity in its vortex, for the process of unification of
                            thought and feeling. What seems to be evil in our present state of civilization will
                            eventuate in good. The higher tendencies of human nature have their root in the lower life.
                            There is a wise Parental government over this earth and that same power that rules not only
                            the earth but the heavens also, will through natural evolutionary processes, bring order out
                            of chaos. Think for a moment how many associations are formed for wise and noble purposes,
                            how many men and women are aspiring for, and working toward the ideals of Edenic life. How
                            they are striving to ameliorate misery, studying its causes and applying the remedy for
                            injustice and wrong that is grinding the faces of the poor, creating crime, want and
                            wretchedness. The interchange of kindly services of good-will and active benevolence, binds
                            heart to heart, and in this universal love, mankind feel that they are all brothers and
                            sisters; that the strong must protect the weak and the more fortunate uplift those who have
                            not the impulse or will to rise to superior conditions. Unsanctified passion and not love,
                            produces much of the unhappiness, in family and social circles. If there was more of real
                            love in the natural home life, there would be less evil generated and perpetuated in the
                            world. And no greater work of human love and uplifting can be accomplished than to search
                            out the sources and springs of immorality and licentiousness, <pb n="27" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFES TO. 2 7 which are undermining the sacredness of family, the purity of society, and
                            the stability of the state. We are drifting toward the condition Rome was in previous to her
                            downfall. When the youth are corrupt what have we to hope for? There is no remedy for this
                            laxity of morals, only that man shall be equally culpable, and equally judged and ostracized
                            with woman; sharing with her the disgrace of sinful acts. There are a few individuals who
                            have the courage to cry aloud and spare not, fearing not to lift the veil that screens
                            social uncleanness. Our children are not protected as they should be, even in the sanctity
                            of borne life; their instruction is meager on the most important themes that concern their
                            welfare and happiness especially in the relation of the sexes. When the moral sense is
                            blunted, the avenues of the soul are closed to the receptivity of spiritual truth as taught
                            by Jesus when he said unless a man hate his own life, (the carnal life) he could not be his
                            disciple. Truly has the thought been expressed "Purity of heart and life is the richest
                            human possession." Through this is sustained holy associations in the sphere of divine love.
                            The respect that grows from an appreciation of positive excellence, is a unitizing
                            iufluence, and helps to break down distinctions between men and women. The more interest we
                            take in the good and happiness of the many, and not center our entire thought in our own
                            interests, the more we shall enlarge our sphere of blessing as did the good Master whose
                            whole desire was continual service, and who was ready and willing to lay down his life for
                            his brethren. Mankind are evolving toward the spiritual, through the perfect natural state,
                            where self-restraint and continence, subdues the animal and the savage in their natures,
                            where love engendered in the coronal region of the brain, holds in control the selfish
                            propensities, that develop their foi'ce in the cerebellum or lower portion of the brain. The
                            essence of true religion is chastity and love which bind the soul to God. Human affections
                            are never carried to their exaltation of sweetness and beauty until they are made manifest
                            in the sphere of unselfish devotion. We should be nearer to each other as human beings in
                            those things we have in common with God, than in that we have in common with the animals.
                            All the great natures among mankind that have progressed under the influence of the genial
                            and all-illuminating sun of righteousness, and have shown the color and fruitage of the
                            seed-life of the Christ, have risen unto the resurrection of immortality. Jesus said,"If I
                            be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me." Why are churches divided into sects ? and why do
                            men look coldly on each other? Is it not because they place too much stress on difference of
                            opinion in minor matters, and chill the love of God in their hearts ? They expect to share
                            their heaven in common in the future, and yet drive themselves assun- <pb n="28" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>

                            bounds nor limits. The only true union and fellowship lies in the interest and upbuilding of
                            a faith in man, "if we love not our brother whom we have seen, how can we love God whom we
                            have not seen." Jesus taught the law of love as expressed in the text, and in contiguous
                            passage, which it would be well for all to read and consider. The outcome would, if
                            practically carried out in every day life, result in the establishment of the Kingdom of
                            heaven, for which he prayed, and which we all have desired might come on the earth. May we
                            all be united in one common cause and kinship; to do good, to carry out the vital spirit of
                            religion which is "Love to God and the neighbor." Then they who do the will of God the same
                            will be our Father and Mother, our brother and sister. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            memory. Each day we are borne further from youth's shore. We should all remember that youth
                            is the time to lay a solid foundation for true and real happiness in after life, by the

                            conscience, he was sinful, and needed the forgiveness of God, can fail to appreciate the
                            worth of this divine blessing, and feel himself under some obligation to extend it to other
                            souls. In John, xxi., 15, Jesus asks, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?
                            " We may infer that Simon was surrounded by those who constitute the vine of the earth ;
                            fathei, mother, sister and brother. He said unto him. "Yea, Lord ; thou knowest that I love
                            thee." Then Jesus answered, "Feed my lambs," thus giving a practical demonstration of
                            professed love for him. Thrice the question is repeated, "Lovest thou me?" each time
                            receiving an affirmative answer, Simon is commanded, or requested to prove his love for the
                            Master by feeding his sheep and lambs. How unselfish the return desired, for the love the
                            disciple bore the Master. How unlike the element which seeks to accumulate and appropriate
                            for selfish ends, rather than befriend and minister unto his little ones, in his name. Again
                            Jesus says, "I am the good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine. As the Father
                            knoweth me, even so know I the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep
                            I have which are not of this fold ; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice,
                            and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd."John, x., 14, 15, 16. May we not imagine the
                            millennium very near, if not already come, when all the lost sheep of the house of Israel
                            are found by the good Shepherd, brought home, and there is one fold and one Shepherd?

                            which was so ably treated in our last Sabbath evening Service had the effect to draw from
                            many hearts the silent resolve, to henceforth use all powers of mind and body to make this
                            home so beautiful that no person having shared its benefits would wish to choose interests
                            less broadening in their relations. It is well to keep this "ideal home" before us through
                            all the difficulties of life's journey. Those who have been educated in this Church, and
                            have witnessed the various changes that have taken place within the last fifty years, have
                            realized some bitter disappointments, and have passed through many tssts of our faith in the
                            religion of our Fathers, who have "fought the good fight, and kept the faith," and whom we
                            believe are still on the upward march in the line of spiritual progression. They have left
                            not only their physical bodies, for which they have no further use, but also their errors
                            and miscon- <pb n="30" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 30 THE MANIFESTO. ceptions of the truth as it is understood
                            by the most spiritually enlightened minds of the present day. It is well with us, if our
                            experience has taught us lessons of charity, and forgiveness; if we have learned to be
                            consistent and kind in all our dealings with our fellow beings ; if we have learned to take
                            a deeper, broader view of God and of his dealings with the children of men, ever remembering
                            that "In our Father's house are many mansions" and there are different divisions in the
                            Christian army, all equally indispensable in working out the great plan of salvation. If we
                            have learned this grand truth, then we are better able to reach*the conditions of suffering
                            humanity. It becomes us as a band of Christian workers to "keep step" in the great battle
                            for justice, truth and right, by putting our "hands at work, and giving our hearts to God,"
                            ever maintaining an interest in the spiritual home which is ours by right of inheritance if
                            we are faithful to our early vows of consecration. We should never forget our obligations to
                            those who have laid the foundation of our Church, nor our duty to the teachers of the
                            present day. If our relationship as spiritual Brethren and Sisters is what we claim it to
                            be, then we must continually discountenance every element that is foreign to this grand
                            result,perfect equality. It is not enough to know that the spirit of Christ was made
                            manifest one hundred years ago, through one inspired woman whom we honor with the endearing
                            title of Mother; but we must manifest this same Christian spirit in our lives. Let us ever
                            bear in mind, that no question pertaining to the spiritual, social or financial growth of
                            our Church will be permanently settled until it is done in conformity to the spirit of
                            Christ. When we are filled with the enthusiasm, which our cause demands, we can sing with
                            the spirit and with the understanding, Ye little rills as ye gently move, O waft the breeze
                            of a Savior's love! Ye mighty waves that in majesty roll, Carry the boon to every soul! Tell
                            them that I have come again, And in my kingdom forever shall reign, Where male and female
                            equally stand, United with the angelic band. Already is light dawning upon the world, and
                            many may be found in this enlighted age who, in some respects, are carrying this spirit of
                            equality and the recognition of this divine principle to even greater perfection than we
                            are. But this is no reason why we should renounce the strife, or forsake the field where our
                            Mother fought and won such glorious victories. Rather let us listen to the heavenly
                            footsteps marching to the strains while we sing the song triumphant, "Surely, Christ lias
                            come again." Now is come complete salvation, Perfect order is revealed, Sons and daughters
                            standing equal Eeap with joy the gospel field.</p></div2><pb n="31" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="Section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Correspondence" TEIform="index"/>Correspondence.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Elder Henry;--A rumor reaches us..."

                                if so concluded the conclusion will be reconsidered. This is the feeling of the
                                Societies in Maine. As Home Notes would have nothing of especial interest, will you find
                                room for the following reasons so well stated by Br. Alonzo Hollister in his Morning
                                Star Bible Lessons. Why Believers in the past as well the present appeal to the Bible to
                                sustain their views. I. "Because it is a true and impartial witness that we are guided
                                by the same spirit which inspired the utterance of Ancient Seers, Apostles and Prophets.
                                II. Because nearly all who claim to be Christians, forming a large part of the more
                                enlightened nations profess to receive the Bible as the only test of all religious
                                truth. III. Because many candid people can more readily perceive and acknowledge truth,
                                when they find it agrees with Bible doctrine, than when it stands solely on its own
                                merits. IV. Because only axiomatic truths which are common to all can be firmly
                                established in the mind without witnesses; which means proof by other acknowledged
                                truths which agree with, and confirm it. V. Because the work in which we are engaged, is
                                fulfilling many grand and wonderful predictions recorded in the Bible. A strange work,
                                which the children of men are no wise disposed to believe, though angels declare it to
                                them. VI. Because it is a work, which to minds not experienced in its effects, finds its
                                strongest evidence of being the work of God, in those inspired predictions, and the
                                lives of its subjects. VII. Because the spiritually sensitive feel a substance in the
                                language of the Bible, which speaks to the interior, and can not be found in any book of
                                less spiritual origin. VIII. Because the greater the number of agreeing and truthful
                                witnesses to any doctrine or principle, the stronger and more established it is to the
                                reasonable mind of true understanding." We believe as he does "that nothing is gained by
                                disparaging the Scriptures. A blow aimed at the Bible is a blow at spiritual-mindedness
                                and is liable to recoil with serious loss to the sower of contemptuous remarks thereon."</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Vance, John B."

TEIform="persName"/>By Oliver C. Hampton.</byline><p TEIform="p">"TjlAITH in God, in Christ and Mother is the first requisite toward ClirisJL' tian repose,
                            but it is not the only one. To be sure, without this it is impossible to attain to celestial
                            tranquility, but with this alone, it is also impossible. So long as anything with which the
                            mind is connected seems unpleasant, peace and rest will continue to be wanting. But these
                            unpleasant states of mind can be removed in two ways. First by removing the cause if
                            possible. If this can not be done, then second, by patient, cheerful waiting and endurance.
                            This is mental and spiritual discipline, and though sometimes painful, yet is indispensably
                            necessary for without it Christian repose is out of the question. This discipline is easily
                            found if we will only wait and take it as it comes. Our abnormal conditions may be pain,
                            sorrow, and even agony at times. It may be selfishness, envy or revenge; it may be a desire
                            for carnal indulgences ; but the endurance of this discipline may be made valuable by some
                            relieving considerations which crop out with my experience of later years and afford great
                            comfort at times. If moved to anger, in every instance I feel better and rejoice in my
                            spirit if I give no vent in angry words. Spiritual repose and serenity soon follow. In
                            sorrow, from whatever cause, I ask myself, "Is this normal? Does the spirit of the Lord ever
                            feel sorrowful?" I answer, "Never." Then if "I and my Father are one," this sorrow and agony
                            are abnormal, so "I look to the rock that is higher than I" and ask for a measure of
                            consolation from the infinite store-bouse of all consolation to fill this vaccuum in my
                            spirit. Soon better feelings prevail and sweet Christian repose silently settles upon me
                            like the dew of Herman and as silently, for noise, tumult and war are not favorable to the
                            removal of sorrow. I say from the Bible, "Be still and know that I am God," or, "Stand still
                            and see the salvation of God." So, gradually the sun comes out and the clouds of sorrow take
                            to themselves wings and silently pass away. If anything like envy appear, I say "All the
                            good of the universe is on its way to you and how foolish you must be to envy the little
                            tittle of enjoyment some one has who waited for it for years. Then I try to rejoice in the
                            good fortune of him who was the envied object. Then envy dies and love overflows on all.
                            When low or sensual thoughts intrude upon the mind how beautiful and salutary is prayer. One
                            who seeks shelter in this good gift is soon able to cause low suggestions to flee, even to
                            the uttermost parts of Egypt, leaving the emancipated spirit in profound Christian peace and
                            repose. There is one perpetual consolation that can never wane nor grow faint through our
                            long journey to our destined rest,that is, that these periods of uneasiness and discontent
                            became fewer and fewer, and farther and farther between, in the Christian's life and finally
                            culminate in invulnerable peace and everlasting joy.

                            share with him an anxiety for the protection of the church of God. His love for humanity
                            urged him to present all the dangers that were to be found in the way of their Christian
                            progress. Paul had received the testimony of Jesus and in publishing it had found that while
                            the Greeks lookt upon it as foolishness, it was to him the power of God to salvation. He had
                            preacht its simplicity of, faith and its simplicity of good works to the Romans, to the
                            Corinthians, to the Ephesians, and to many others. In these places he establisht churches
                            "in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God." Do you wonder at his
                            anxiety lest thru the cares of the world and in the philosophy of a class of speculative
                            teachers they should be led aT.-ay from the truth? Knowing so well as he did of the dangers
                            that were to be found on every side, his warning voice was distinctly heard among his
                            people. "Beware lest any man spoil you thru philosophy and vain deceit, after the rudiments
                            of the world and not after Christ."Col. ii., 8. This Pagan philosophy would no doubt, spoil
                            some. Whatever may absorb the attention and turn the spiritual interests away from the
                            Kingdom of God, will undoubtedly lead toward a worldly life. That this same philosophy has
                            spoiled many beautiful minds and thrown them from the path which led toward God has all the
                            force of historical evidence. All men do not walk the same road as they go down to
                            perdition. There are a thousand avenues thrown open and filled with enticing allurements,
                            thru which every man may pass that turns from right to wrong or from light to darkness. The
                            school of Alexandria was, no doubt, ruinous to that order of Christianity that was
                            establisht by the sacred teacher, as it made itself busy in amalgamating the doctrines of
                            the Christians and Pagans and by filling the churches with that which was spurious. From
                            that day to this it has had a markt effect upon the Christian world. Osterwald wisely
                            observes"Carnal men could not endure the cross nor divest themselves of the love of wealth
                            and pleasures, and by this means they corrupted the pure doctrine of the gospel. Their pride
                            and presumption prompted them to stand at the head of affairs and they wickedly contrived
                            means by getting into power and assuming an author- <pb n="34" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 34 THE MANIFESTO.
                            ity and expounding the writings of the Apostles by a blind philosophy which carnal men like
                            themselves had invented." Mosheim writes,"These men invented questions about the Christian
                            religion sufficient to perplex and puzzle the whole world." What a comment on the simple
                            testimony of Jesus and on Christianity at that early date. Here is another sad example of
                            the church walking by the side of the world. In this case the church "stoops to conquer" by
                            accepting the friendship of the world, but unfortunately the church has never been able to
                            rise again and stand erect. It is not strange that men were ruined by these flattering forms
                            of philosophy and then thru the deceitfulness of these enticing illustrations. But the end
                            is not yet. Men are at t his day equally perplext and puzzled to determine what is genuine
                            Christianity as taught by Jesus and what may be set down as the spurious innovations of
                            Pagan philosophy. Some who would be good Christians are sadly deceived. They know that the
                            church of Christ must be a pure church and that to be a disciple of Jesus they must fulfill
                            the law of righteousness, agreeably to the sermon on the Mount, and when the voice of God
                            cames to them to enter in at the strait gate they find themselves quite ready to pass into
                            the broad way. They have been flattered by the world, and have foolishly wandered into the
                            elements of a carnal life. They have persuaded themselves that as it was a Christian
                            philosophy it would lead directly to the Holy City. Here comes the danger.Should they fail
                            to fulfill the law of righteousness, they may be spoilt, as they mourn for the old
                            inheritance. Called of God to forsake the world with all its affections and lusts they
                            soothe their consciences by catching at the words of one who offered carnal indulgences to a
                            licentious class of would-be Christians. They had heard the words of Jesus the Christ
                            preacht again and again, but had failed to see the fruits of practical righteousness
                            developt in their own lives. We may readily suppose that the Apostle knew quite well the
                            dangers that were around the church. He knew that the testimony of Jesus had proved amply
                            sufficient for the salvation of those who had accepted it. That it was a religion that
                            entered into the life of man and was manifested thru a living and growing righteousness.
                            That the kingdom of God was obtained thru the sacrifice of every selfish interest. There was
                            nothing mysterious in the requirement and it needed no philosophy of the schools of Pagan
                            wise men to give to it their interpretation. <pb n="35" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 35 It is
                            remarkable how easily one class of men can undo and scatter to the winds that which others
                            have earnestly and prayerfully labored to establish in the heart. The Apostle well
                            understood the operation of this upon the mind and hence his caution to the brethren to
                            beware of that class of men who made it a money business to talk religion. They were not
                            workers of righteousness, interested in the welfare of the race, but they were talkers and
                            Paul saw the danger, that thru their philosophy, and thru their deceitfulness, and thru
                            their ministration of the spirit of the world his brethren might be turned from God. This
                            same danger is as apparent at the present time. It may not be found to be exactly after the
                            manner of this historical record, but it comes as effectually and ruins us as thoroughly.
                            With the light that is now upon the earth and the many degrees of righteousness that are
                            operating in the hearts of men, there exists the same danger lest thru the deceitfulness of
                            this seductive element many faithful souls may be turned from their honorable course as
                            God's workmen and be again lost in the wilderness of sin.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.

                                and roaring and pouring" down the hillside, and the air was just cool enough to create
                                one of the prettiest and most interesting panoramas which Nature is pleased to give us.
                                Fringes of transparent ice hung along its margin, while each obstacle to its steady flow
                                was a "thing of beauty." It was a novelty to be roaming the brown hillsides on the first
                                of January, to admire waterfalls etc., and while we liked the mild weather, we knew the
                                cold was somewhere in keeping for us, and desired it to come in its season. But we have
                                no longer any hopes nor fears for an open winter. Old Borealis has pressed the mercury
                                down far into the zeros. Snow has covered the brown hillsides. The brook has gone to

                                better. Real good manners and courteous behavior, spring from kindness of heart. The

                                abundant water supply enabled our good Brethren to change the location and appearance of
                                a large woodpile. They have also been hauling gravel with which to improve the road
                                leading to Lebanon Springs. Christmas-tide abounded with joy and blessing. A beautiful
                                tree well hung with gifts was particularly appreciated by the youth and children who
                                helpt in its decoration. Eecitations and offerings from old and young were a pleasant

                                occasions to be more faithful in life's duties and help advance upward the great

According to Nature's inexorable laws we have passed the last stepping-stone
                                in the yearly circuit of time. The old year now lies upon his bier, soon to be Luried in
                                the dust of the past, while Boreas howls a mournful dirge in discordant notes. Sorrowful

                                and we journey on, very much as before, till we are another circuit nearer that unknown
                                land, "where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest." We commemorated
                                Christmas in a manner befitting the day. A morning song announced the hour of rising. In
                                the afternoon the young people entertained us with singing and personified rehearsals.
                                All received some token of kind remembrance and thus the day was happily and profitably
                                spent. May these holidays serve to awaken the latent good in the human heart that the
                                world may be made better by them. In the early part of December winter asserted his
                                powers so strongly that ice eight and nine inches thick was formed. All preparations for
                                harvesting it were made, when the rain descended and in less time than it took to
                                freeze, it was all gone, and we were disappointed. We are now hoping that winter is

                            small degree will harden the heart and lead to greater departures from right. Only those who
                            have done well can expect the "well done." Commit yourself to God for guidance and
                            instruction. How much happier you become when you feel that He is shaping your lives, and
                            you are content to let Him, knowing that not one more trial comes to you than you are able
                            to bear, and that every cross and affliction is for your eternal good; and how much peace it
                            brings to you if you yield your entire will to his blessed keeping. Give thought, care and
                            pains, in forming a noble character, and* create a spiritual atmospere in which it will be
                            good to live. The crown that awaits you is bright, be guided by truth and right.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Orcutt, Daniel" TEIform="persName"/>Daniel Orcutt.</byline></div2><div2 type="Section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Correspondence" TEIform="index"/> KIND WORDS.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear Sisters:--I was much pleased..."

                                certainly they are quite often found in close companionship. Rum generally enters by way
                                of the back door, while tobacco stands at the front. Christians take the tobacco with
                                them even to the church and poison the air. And then the minister takes it into the

THE MANIFESTO.
The Phrenological Journal ,\nd Science
of Health for January, 189(5, leads with a
phrenograph of Dr. M. L. Holbrook, the eminent hygienic author and lecturer of New
York. It is from a personal examination, by
Dr. Beall, and shows many points of agreement between well-known facts of Dr. Holbrook's career ami the developments of his
brain. Another phrenological description
follows of the same man made by Prof. L. N.
Fowler forty two years ago. Written so many
years apart by two men, neither of whom saw
the work of the other until after his own was
made, they afford very interesting material
for comparison. Prof. C. T. Parks explains
some striking peculiarities of eminent women, especially as regards their manner of
holding the hand. Two drawings are given
showing a strong and a weak thumb. Mrs. C.
F. Wells gives an account of her famous
brother, the late Prof. O. 8. Fowler. Many
will be interested in a portrait of John W.
Hildreth, the boy train-wrecker, also an imprint of his hand from which the editor, without knowing whose it was, gave a reading.
A sketch of Harry T. Hayward, the Minnesota murderer, with a table of measurements of
his head will attract attention in the North,
west.
Dr. H. S. Drayton continues his valuable
series on "Practical Psychology." Prof. Nelson Sizer describes "Household Pets" in the
Child Culture Department. The contributions
on hygiene present the usual variety, and the
editorial pages are especially strong. Dr.
Beall replies to a distinguished medical opponent of phrenology, and demonstrates the
utter fallacy of the objector's position, New
York; Fowler & Wells Co., 27 East Twentyfirst street. $1.50 per year. 15 cents single
number.
Ex-President Benjamin Harrison will discuss "The Presidential Office" very comprehensively in his "This Country of Ours" series;
in the forthcoming February Ladies' Home.Journal. He will detail the provisions and methods of electing a Chief Magistrate, and will
have much to say bearing upon the eligibility
of a President for re-election; will give his
views as to the length of the Presidential
term, and express rather decided opinions relative to the annoyance to which Presidents
are subjected from office-seekers. The article
is practical, based upon experience and observation, and is very timely. General Harrison
believes that the fears (expressed by the
framers of our Constitution) that the power
of the office is such as to enable an ambitious
incumbent to secure an indefinite succession
of terms have never been realized. In "practice the popular opinion has limited the eligibility   of   the  President to   one re-election.
But some of our lea ling and most thoughtful
public men have challenged the wisdom of
the four-year term, and have advocated six
years, usually accompanied with a pronibition of a second term. And unless some
method can be devised by which a less considerable part of the four-year term must be
given to hearing applicants for office and to
making appointments, it would be wise to
give the President, by extending the time, a
better chance to show what he can do for the
country.
Among the fruit and flower novelties which
1896 brings us, we notice that the enterprising
and reliable firm of James Vick's Sons, Rochester, N. Y., are already calling attention to
three, which seem to have won great favor
where known. They are the DOUBLE SWEET
PEA, the only one in the world true to name,
"Bride of Niagara," the "Early Leader Tomato," the earliest of all the early tomato
family and sure to become a great favorite,
and the already famous blackberry, the
"RATHBUN."
By the way, readers, are any of you so far
behind the times as not to know "Vick's
Floral Guide?" If an5' of you have never
seen it, send 10 cents to this firm at Rochester,
N. Y., and get a copy. You can deduct this
from the first order lor seeds anu the pleasure
and information their Guide will give you will
certainly induce you to keep up the acquaintance.
We have received a beautiful "Columbia
Pad Calendar" for 1896. Its nice arrangement
is in advance of former years, and presents a
greater charm by its liberal illustrations.
The Calendar can be obtained for five 2-cent
stamps by addressing the Calendar Department of the Pope Manufacturing Company
at Hartford, Conn.
The Pulpit for December has no less than
five sermons by the ministers of Presbyterian,
Congregational and United Evangelical. Each
is the embodiment of the best thoughts that
these Reverend brethren are able to present
to the readers of the Pulpit. The special
theology of these several churches may not
be of so much value to the general reader, but
the matured thoughts and the earnest lessons
on morality, the reverence for God and the
respect for religious subjects are all worthy
of the most careful attention.
Published by G. Holzapfel, Fredericksburg, Pa.
Word and Works for February opens with
a chapter on the moon, and the advice is,
"Ponder these things in your minds, study
the diagrams and above all familiarize yourself with the actual movements of the moon
in the heavens." A correct knowledge of the
moon as learned from Word and Works is far
preferable to the foolish whims that many
entertain. Not only has this number many
valuable articles on the subject of Astronomy
but one writer whose mind is more absorbed in the things of this -world writes about
Gold Bugs, and certainly we shall want to
know all that may be learned about them.
Send ten cents to the Office of Word and
Works, St. Louis, Mo. and read of these wonders of the heavens and the earth.
