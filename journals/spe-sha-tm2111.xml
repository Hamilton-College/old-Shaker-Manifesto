                            sublime figures was couched the whole purport of the Schismatic vision, the corning of the
                            Lord's kingdom with power. A one body of people, united in Christ by the pure bond of love ;
                            the house, habitation or dome of the king of kings, in which the groanings of Presbyterians,
                            Methodists, Baptists and Christians, for the wounds of their petty, party causes should not
                            be heard. A Zion or pure gospel church, shaking herself from the dust, from every thing
                            unclean ; all that belongs to the serpent, and shining forth like the sun in his brightness.
                            Making the people to tremble, and shaking terribly the nations. Consuming the man of sin,
                            and opening a stream of everlasting righteousness upon the earth. Thrse were bold figures,
                            and that they were just about to be substantiated, required something more than a vain
                            imagination to evince. Sleeping and waking, the whole topic with these Schismatics, was the
                            increasing work of God, and the blessed kingdom just about to appear, and each one
                            contemplating it through some special dream or vision, in which they felt confident they had
                            a particular revelation of the Lord's Christ. This was the kind of manna which they were
                            daily gathering. In some of these rapturous scenes, they professed to be carried out of the
                            body, and to be favored with a particular interview with the spirits of their departed
                            friends., and to see and learn their different allotments in the invisible world. Sometimes
                            they mixed with great multitudes who had embraced religion in the past century, and were
                            waiting for the new Jerusalem to appear, and the way to be opened into the holy City. At
                            other times they professed to see the holy City in the bright and heavenly glory, and to
                            hear the songs of the angelic host; and attempting to join them in<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>
                            their music, occasioned the melodious sound, that entering into the overshadowing cloud of
                            such celestial witnesses, perfumed their whole soul and body with a peculiar fragrance,
                            which rendered everything of a mortal nature, disagreeable and unsavory. This peculiar
                            fragrance, which could not be found in any thing upon earth, but the subjects of these
                            strange operations, seemed of all other things, to bring the heavenly state the nearest to
                            the senses of these people. Under the influence of this singular perfume, they would swoon
                            away sometimes three or four times in a day, recover, rise and dance with such elevated
                            springs, as might render it doubtful to the spectator, whether they properly belonged to the
                            inhabitants of this globe, or to some other family of beings. Besides these singular
                            transports, they had another species of vision, more universal, in which the sun, moon,
                            stars, mountains, rivers, plains, vegetables, animals and a thousand particular things and
                            circumstances in nature, were used as emblems of things in the spiritual world, or kingdom
                            of Christ. One has a night vision of two suns, another of three moons, another, wide awake
                            sees a great platform of- bright stars in the noon-day hemisphere. From these they descend
                            to apparitions of strange things upon earth. One discovers a certain spot of ground
                            illuminated all over with the brightness of burning lire, and thousands of human beings
                            Hocking to it from all quarters, and instantly purified from all the effects of a gross and
                            fleshly nature. Another sees the air crowded with birds of prey, commissioned to devour the
                            flesh of every dead beast. Another sees a road marked out in the color of bright light, a
                            thousand miles long, and stands with his visual faculties intensely fixed upon it, until he
                            discovers certain persons coming forth with good news from afar. Some in their visions were
                            employed in crossing rivers, climbing mountains, finding treasures, fighting serpents, or
                            more delightfully employed in eating the fruits of the tree of life, bathing in clear water,
                            casting off old garments and putting on new. In a word, all nature seemed to be impregnated
                            with a new and spiritual quality, which rendered every object and every transaction
                            presented to the mind, whether sleeping or waking, susceptible of some signification which
                            respected the then present work. These short sketches may serve to recognize the astonishing
                            raptures in which the Schismatics were carried along in full expectation of the kingdom of
                            Christ. Such was the unrenritted flow of that spirit, which transmuted every thing into a
                            different appearance, that were it supposable that disembodied spirits could enter living
                            men and women, it might be thought that every visionary, recorded either in sacred or
                            profane history, had rendezvoused in the Schismatics, and borrowed their active powers to
                            revise their endless train of types and figures. At least it was, no doubt with the greatest
                            propriety, that these singular people appropriated to their day the full and perfect
                            accomplishment of the following prophecy of Joel.<pb n="243" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> "I will pour out my
                            spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men
                            shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams�and I will show wonders in heaven
                            above, and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and vapors of smoke." They did not
                            consider that the spirit of prophecy, or their dreams and visions and other signs had any
                            thing in them to be depended upon for salvation. But as the merchant hangs out signals about
                            his door, to direct the people where to come for merchandize; so were the prophesier, the
                            dreamer, the visionist, the sweet singer, and fragrant dancer, hung out to the view of the
                            world, to show where God was about to open his everlasting kingdom of righteousness, peace
                            and joy in the Holy Spirit. This kingdom was what the Schismatics were peculiarly interested
                            in, and short of this they determined never to stop. About the latter end of the year 1804,
                            there were regular societies of these people in the state of Ohio: at Turtle-Creek,
                            Eagle-Creek, Springfield, Orangedale, Salem, BeaverCreek and Clear-Creek. And in Kentucky ;
                            at Cabbin-Creek, Flemingsburgh, Concord, Caneridge, IndianCreek, Bethel, Paint-lick and
                            Shawnyrun, besides an innumerable multitude dispersed among the people in Tennessee, North
                            Carolina, Virginia, and the western parts of Pennsylvania, who were exercised more or less
                            with the same spirit. Praying, shouting, jerking, barking or rolling; dreaming, prophesying,
                            and looking as through a glass, at the infinite glories of mount Zion, just about to break
                            open upon the world. At least those who were foremost in the schism, expected beyond a
                            doubt, that another summer would not roll by with any degree of the light, gifts and power
                            of God, short of that which bringeth full and complete salvation from all sin. In this
                            expectation, besides the common exercises of shaking hands and pledging themselves to each
                            other by every thing sacred, that they would persevere in the sin-killing work unto the full
                            feast of the lamb, they practiced a mode of prayer which wfis as singular as the situation
                            in which they stood, and the faith by which they were actuated. According to their proper
                            name of distinction they stood separate and divided, each one for one; and in this capacity,
                            they offered up each their separate cries to God in one united harmony of sound, by which
                            the doubtful footsteps of those who were in search of the meeting, might be directed
                            sometimes to the distance of miles. Whatever this portentous concert might have addressed to
                            God in the inner man, a sensible spectator with the slightest attention might have gathered
                            the general import of their univocal prayer, from such language as the following :� "Lord
                            God, Almighty ! Thou hast promised unto us eternal life, and this life is in thy Son. Thou
                            art no respecter of persons. Glory to thy name, we believe it is thy will that all should be
                            saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. We venture upon thy promise, and roll our
                            souls upon thy truth and faithfulness, as<pb n="244" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> the rock of eternal ages.
                            Thou hast invited us to come to the waters, without money and without price. Heaven's King,
                            thou knowest that we are thirsty. We have long wandered in the dry, sandy desert of sin ;
                            but glory to God, we believe there is an everlasting fountain opened, and our souls have
                            already begun to taste the blessed waters. But Lord, we are net satisfied. We want the
                            fulness ; and we believe thou hast given us the foretaste, not to disappoint us ; but to
                            encourage us to press on to the overflowing fountain: and short of that we cannot stop. We
                            want to bathe in the ocean of redeeming love, and wash away the last and least remains of a
                            fallen nature. Jesus, Master, we want to be like thee ; holy, as thou art holy, without
                            spot, and blameless. Come, Lord, and finish thy work! Cut it short in righteousness. We
                            doubt not, it is thy will, even our sanctification. Thy perfect will is all we want to know.
                            O send by whom thou wilt send. Work by means of thine own choosing; only supplant, root out,
                            consume and destroy the man of sin, the son of perdition, and set our souls at perfect
                            liberty from his iron bondage. Jesus, Lord, inscribe thy character on our every faculty.
                            Make our bodies the fit temples of the Holy Spirit. Diffuse thy nature through all our
                            active powers ; and let every member be moved and actuated by the impulse divine." Could
                            language b3 invented more expressive of the near approach of the day of real, positive, and
                            full redemption? It therefore remains to give some account of those important realities, to
                            which the foregoing signs and wonders pointed, and for the entrance upon which, they served
                            as a preparation. "Shout, Christians shout, the Lord is come! Prepare, prepare to make him
                            room! On earth he reigns, we feel him near, The signs of glory now appear." (to be
                            continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shaker harvest-home" TEIform="index"/> SHAKER HARVEST-HOME.</head><p TEIform="p"> On Thursday afternoon, Oct. 1st. at the North Family, Mount Lebanon, N. Y., an industrial
                            exhibition and harvest home gathering took place, consisting of work produced by the family
                            ; mostly of recent date, also of old times. Several Brethren and Sisters from other families
                            were present, among whom was Eldress Eliza Ann Taylor, of the Miuistry, and to that aged
                            Sister a hearty welcome was given. Eldress Anna White, in some introductory observations,
                            said that they were greatly blessed, that day, in the harvest work. There were sowing,
                            planting and reaping seasons; then came the harvest season, when the farmer gathered in
                            cereals, fruits and vegetables, and garnered them in storehouses, before the approach of
                            winter. The little exhibition was suggested only on the previous Sabbath. They would find a
                            considerable number of objects to examine ; for some of the work of the North Family was
                            shown, from the year 1820 to the present time and it was al.so the work of old and young.
                            They would have accepted the work of those in other families who had once lived in this
                            order ; but the exhibition was rather premature. In a central position, they would observe
                            an ever-<pb n="245" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> green tree, which was planted by Elder Frederick, ami upon it
                            were a few leaflets of his publication. There would be an opportunity of walking around and
                            inspecting all the contributions, after a few readings and recitations. Six youug Sisters
                            sang "Flowers of Heaven.' Readings by Martha Bur� ger, "My Offering;' and Cora Vinneo, 'A

                            heav enly road." Br. Daniel OfFord said that this was a surprise to him, as, he presumed, it
                            was to many others, it was the Sisters' gift and an evidence that the Sisters v. ere keeping
                            the gift for them ; and the Brethren would bless the Misters. Remarking upon some of the
                            objects placed around the room, he said that he was largely concerned in water pipes : a
                            half-inch pipe could be seen there, which was used, in old times, to supply the family with
                            water. Forty years ago, they had three faucets for kitchen, second house and wash house:
                            now, they had over three hundred faucets. (Br. Charles Graves: And every one of them to be
                            taken care of.) The family is supplied with water from a four inch pipe of sixty times the
                            capacity of the half-inch and which will throw a stream of water over the house. It is also
                            used for the bathrooms. The baptism of the body is as essential to our existence in this
                            world as the baptism of the spirit is to our souls ; we realize that there is much in
                            physical existence that can aid in spiritual welfare. Here is our aged brother, Henry
                            Cantrell, whom we are favored to have with us ; thirty years ago, Henry, a first-rate mower,
                            used to mow with the old scythe hanging in the opposite corner: now, one of the little boys,
                            twelve years old, could, with the mowing-machine, do six times as much work in a day. There
                            was an old sickle ; an acre of grain used to be a great day's work for an average man : but
                            now, with the patent reaper and binder, a comparatively feeble person could go round the
                            field and reap at the rate of ten acres per day, with all those bundles bound up. lie then
                            alluded to the results of the progress of horticulture, pointing to some specimens of flue
                            and large yields of apples, tomatoes, squashes, potatoes and sweet corn. All the sunflowers,
                            said he, were from the labors of the boys, and he expected that the sun of righteousuess
                            would shine upon the dear children. The various objects of industry and the display of fruit
                            were then inspected by the company. The celerity with which these products of labor and skiU
                            had been brought together and arranged reminded one (of course, on a small scale,) of the
                            rapid construction and artistic arrangement of "houses of London in the olden time," which
                            were so much admired at the Healtheries Exhibition, South Kensington, London, in 1884. The
                            roof was dressed with asparagus bcughs, covered with red berries, with hanging baskets of
                            flowers and trimmings of hawthorn; and an evergreen tree was a central figure of the room.
                            Upon the walls were two beautifully enlarged photographic portraits of former Elders of the
                            Order: Elder Richard Bushnell and Eldress Antoinette Doolittle. Upon the mantel<pb n="246" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> stood a row of lights, from the homemade tallow candle and lamps, to Edison's
                            electric burner. Flower stands were arranged by the side of the room on which were pots of
                            rare plants; another with varieties of flowers ; a sloping frame, covered with wood-moss,
                            dotted with floral designs ; then there were bouquets, in handsome form, of different
                            flowers, each one grouped by itself, all raised at home. Two stands were occupied by the
                            fruit that had been preserved in glass jars, this season ; peaches, pears, pineapples,
                            cherries, plums, gooseberries ; also dried fruit was exhibited; dried cherries, plums and
                            pears. One long table was devoted to the fruit and vegetables gathered from the gardens,
                            farm and orchards: apples, 20 varieties ; pears, 7 varieties ; plums, 2 varieties ; (rather
                            late for plums ;) a fine variety of quinces, peaches and musk-melons. Four varieties of
                            grapes ; 4 of squashes ; 3 of sweet and yellow corn, and some very large pumpkins and
                            mammoth sunflowers. A nest of double-yoked eggs. Three varieties of beans; root-celery;
                            sheaves of wheat and rye, atd a miniature stack of hay. Second table, manufactured articles.
                            Various articles of home-knitting, from our own wool; gloves of fur and silk ; various
                            useful fancy articles. Ryestraw, gathered in June and made into bonnets and mats, the
                            various processes shown ; also, styles of caps worn during the last hundred years; miniature
                            suits of Brethren's and Sisters' clothes, aud specimens of spinning and weaving. Third
                            table, upon which the printed literature and the writings of the family were exhibited. In
                            the center of th table of literature was a model of the ark of the covenant, from Biblical
                            description, pure white, with a gold band around it and draped in white ; modelled by
                            Cecelia De Vere. Placed in the ark was a portrait of our late beloved Minister Giles B.
                            Avery. The third table also included literary compositions, penj;nauship and ornamental
                            designs by the Sisters ; a specimen of William Offbrd's printing; a specimen of shorthand
                            and typewriting. Near the center was a table with refreshments, ornamented with small
                            bouquets. Here was the produce of the dairy, a large sage-cheese, and some gilt-edged
                            creamery butter. Among the curiosities were a model of an old spinningwheel ; some worsted
                            and skeins of yarn, spun by the Sisters many years ago. Upon a shelf were several pairs of
                            home-made shoes of different kinds. A little plot of grass with a poem attached, 'The
                            Beautiful Grass;' also floor-mats aud carpets. Elder Frederick W. Evans said this was a time
                            of gospel union, and he was very glad to see so many young people enjoying life in the
                            gospel. Reverting to the Mosaic dispensation, he spoke of the Hebrew festivals aud Sabbaths,
                            and contrasted the Jewish with the puritanic Sabbath. He had been told by Elder Henry B.
                            Bear that, in the Ohio Society, they had a large preponderance of men, and found difficulty
                            iu getting women converts. He (the speaker) thought that the numbers of the Sisters ought to
                            predominate, as at Lebanon. There were all the chores, attention in sickness, many things
                            necessary for them all, that required the care of Sisters, and a good company of Sisters was
                            one of the blessings that they could not be indifferent to.<pb n="247" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> He
                            congratulated the Sisters upon not being drawn into the whirlpool of fashion, as they would
                            have been if in the order of the world. The Elder then read a short poem by Harding, a
                            spiritualist, pathetically referring to an aged pilgrim "walking on the strand, waiting for
                            the boatman." "A welcome to the boatman," and mourning, were common feelings in the world,
                            by aud for the aged : but he was walking upon the strand of life and enjoyed it; aud if he
                            could be sure of as good a place aud company in the next world as he was blessed with here,
                            he would be quite satisfied. The nearer to the spirit world, the union grew stronger aud tne
                            enjoyment greater. In concluding, Elder F. W. E. said uOur Shaker order protests against the
                            closing of the World's Fair upon auy oue of 'the seven sabbath days ;' aud against all
                            religious legislation, under our secular government, as being in violation of the
                            Constitution, which guarantees to all citizens, men and women perfect liberty of conscience.
                            "The Shakers respectfully suggest that, on the Constantiuiau Sunday, the poor�common
                            people�be admitted to the Fair, free, and that a lunch be provided, of good h\gienic food
                            and drink, free of cost. Therefore, we urgently plead for the laboring-classes, the real
                            producers of the larger portion of the World's Exhibition, aud repeat that the World's Fair
                            should be kept open on all the seven sabbaths of the week. Eldress Anna remarked ; While
                            gratified that the Brethren appreciated the labors of the Sisters, they should be glad to
                            have more good Brethren. She then spoke of some of the labor-saving appliances and
                            inventions. She used to stand, all the forenoon, over the wash-tub ; but th.it is done away.
                            She also spoke of the present famine in Russia, and the "hunger-food." Among the exhibits
                            was a broom with a paper attached ; entitled 'The Inevitable.' This was read by Rosetta
                            Stephens. Life's common and daily necessities follow us e\ erywhere. Ruth Barry, read 'The

                            brightens this earth of ours." Br. Charles Graves spoke of what all had done, to help the
                            exhibition alou^r; each had contributed in his or her way. Br. Walter is the herdsman. He
                            represents his charge by this large sage cheese. Again, others put on certain finishing
                            touches so as to produce other articles of food that are here ; j for instance, the cake and
                            pie. "Otherwise, it will be un-American, j Br. Daniel: We all put a finishing untrue to the

                            grown in Kentucky, and spun and knitted there, by hand ; some of these articles were, at an
                            early date, presented to Eldress Polly Reed. The visitors then returned thanks. Sr. Emma J.
                            Neal, had to leave for the Church office ; said that she was beyond time, having become
                            entangled in the magnetism of the place ; for something so good was there, that she could
                            not stay out. Sr. Minerva Reynolds was very thankful for the opportunity of meeting her
                            Brethren and Sisters, and seeing the products of their industry and the products of their
                            minds, also. She desired to be united with them in all that was good and true. Sr. Catherine
                            Van Houten had observed the progress of the North Family during sixty years, from the time
                            of her early childhood; its increase and blessing. Sr. Phoebe Van Houten said that this was
                            a gathering that tended to a great increase of love and charity. Sr. Martha Anderson
                            remarked, ' have to thank Sr. Phoebe for care during childhood" and, thought Sr. Grace
                            Bowers would, too. Br. Alonzo Hollister characterized this as a "feast of reason and flow of
                            soul." In regard to new-comers, remarks had been made about the difference between "men"
                            only, and those who truly became "Brethren ;" but it should be borne in mind, in regard to
                            the future Brethren and Sisters, that it must necessarily take time to complete the gospel
                            work and transform them from the worldly to the spiritual. He was not behind any one in
                            prizing his good Sisters, or his good Brethren. Elder Timothy Rayson congratulated the
                            Brethren and Sisters upon the success in gathering the various articles and in arranging
                            them, aud presenting them for mutual benefit. It is really a "Harvest-Home." I enjoy these
                            occasions as much as any one. I would have been glad if more from the other families could
                            have had an opportunity of being present, but a great many of them, it being a busy season
                            of the year, were attending to their duties at home; and we know that there is a good rule
                            to be observed, "Duty first; pleasure afterwards." I thank the North Family for the
                            privilege of meeting with them, and for the invitation to enjoy this social gathering. One
                            of the Sisters, in speaking of flowers, had quoted, that "a thing of beauty is a joy
                            forever." The present occasion caused in the mind a happy reflection of meeting so many good
                            Brethren and Sisters, all contributing to make their home beautiful and a joy forever, to
                            each and every one. The choir sang, "See the goldea fruits that come from our heavenly
                            Harvest-Home." There was then an interval for refreshments; aud, after singing a piece
                            entitled "Blessing," and some friendly conversation, the company separated. The exhibition
                            will remain open until next Monday, to give other visitors an opportunity of attending; an
                            offer which has been accepted.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Miles, Martin W." TEIform="persName"/>Reported by Martin W. Miles. Mount Lebanon, N.

                            Labor truly has its reward. The union, love and<pb n="249" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> kindred friendship was
                            enhanced many fold. In support of the allusion made to the necessity of keeping the World's
                            Fair open on Sunday, we would add that, although invitations had been freely extended to all
                            the families of the Society since Thursday, and we had entertained successive companies from
                            that time up to 4 P. M. on Saturday, still on Sunday P. M. we had in every sense the fullest
                            and richest gathering, in the presence of the Elders of the Church Family, our venerated
                            Trustees, and other faithful burden bearers, whose pressing duties on previous davs had
                            prevented their attendance. And this is a Christian Community, where love is the only
                            incentive to labor and a ''United Inheritance" in all the blessings of life, the recompense.
                            No wage-slavery,�no task-masters, no monopolists ; yet even under this beautiful, free,
                            industrial system, not until the Sunday could they participate in that which, as they
                            feelingly expressed, '�would have caused life-long regrets to have missed." Br. Daniel
                            Offord, who is ever alive to the interests of the laborer, asked for the tenants on our
                            farms to have an opportunity. They came through his invitation, much to our gratification
                            and their happiness."

                            softened and chastened with joy. For the good it has been, around what remains of the
                            fragile, long-suffering form, we tenderly wrap the tomb shroud, and by law immutable,
                            virtually consign it to the consuming elements, from whence proceed no sigh of fear, of
                            blighted ambition or cry of distress. Of the soul, the spirit, the being to be judged,
                            rewarded and rejoiced, we speak with the select, sacred language of tenderness and love. We
                            incline to go back to the days of childhood and review the good of that early period, and as
                            we walk hand in hand in every-day association through youth and mature years, we note the
                            progress of the Christian character, the growth of ability consecrated. Almost at the
                            beginning of a promising life of willing activity, came the serious injury, productive of
                            over thirteen years intense suffering. Even then though "A veil hid from our eyes the events
                            of succeeding years" it came like a heavy blow. Did her cheerful spirit lose any of its
                            vigor and interest? Nay, nor the deft hands now cold in death, cease to do for the good of
                            others. Kindness of heart and willingness to help others, especially the sick, have been
                            corner stones to the character so well begun here, and as she nears her celestial home�open
                            swings the door, and on Jasper walls in the light of divine promise we read. "Blessed are
                            the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." And patience, a virtue so much needed and well
                            tried by her extreme physical condition, was more than remarkable. When she was first
                                afflictAverill<pb n="250" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> ed, we missed her from the family circle, and as
                            each passing duty or pleasure appeared, we distinctively felt that a link had been broken,
                            but because of the inevitable fact, that health was almost totally and forever gone, we
                            gradually relinquished hope to reason, and have been the pitying, sorrowing witnesses of
                            prolonged sickness and pain. Now that relief has come, her spirit will find a more healthful
                            atmosphere and continue the development of virtue and usefulness. Yet not afar is the spirit
                            world, nor the souls of our invisible loved one, and as we seek to draw them around us, the
                            sainted circle will be widened and strengthened by one more who has sought "The Pearl of
                            great price" conscientiously and patiently filled out her measure of life toil and
                            suffering. And who, when the Virgin roll is called, can answer in the confidence of the
                            upright.

                            said, but I think you will preach many more.� Your sermons were always good, and this is the
                            best one I have seen or heard from you; I think you should keep right on with them. The
                            reproof of the speculator in the horse trade was good; but he ought not to have been allowed
                            anything for his time, as that was an easement for a wrong, fraudulent act. I am glad that I
                            spent a year or more at Union Village, because the prevailing spirit was Love. I am not
                            sorry that I have pursued the religious thought still further�till I can no longer believe
                            that an organized system exists on earth, sufficiently large, to meet the demands of the
                            Universe, (but there is one large enough for our planet. H. L. E.) The Buddhists are a pure,
                            sincere and apparently honest people; and have never murdered any body for their religion,
                            though their population embraces about one third of all on the Globe : (The number in Asia
                            is 295, 000,000,) and yet millions have been put to death for Christ's sake. I cannot regard
                            God as a person, for that means one among many ; but<pb n="251" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> as the Great Soul
                            of the Universe, composed of millions of inhabited worlds, which are ruled by love. God the
                            Infinite, is everywhere, and lives in all that lives�He is in us and we in Him. To
                            constitute the Supreme Divinity, takes all of mind, soul, spirit and matter; so that God is
                            all and in all. To whom then must I pray but God within? I oftentimes pray to my spirit
                            friends, who come to me in answer to prayer; sometimes in materialized bodies, whose
                            language is plain and distinct to my natural ear. If you object to the term, materialized
                            bodies I will say just such a body as Jesus had when he was journeying to Emmaus with the
                            two disciples, the third day after the crucifixion. Excuse my rambling letter, my dear
                            Brother, and give my love to all the faithful friends.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Jacobs, Enoch" TEIform="persName"/> Enoch Jacobs.</byline></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Elder Harvey:--The letter from your dear friend..."

                            his visit to Canterbury in Sept. 1846. I was at that date twenty-two years of age and
                            assisted in printing one number of "The Day Star," a copy of which is now before me. I also
                            bear the dear friend and Br. in pleasant remembrance and am sorry when I call to mind the
                            forces that obliged the beautiful little "Day Star" to fall below the horizon. More gospel
                            light would have been before the world to-day, if that Star could have been held in its
                            place. The number to which I refer is largely the testimony of Believers and no doubt, did
                            much good on its mission of gospel love.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="B., H. C." TEIform="persName"/> H. C.

                                In the preaching of Shakerism...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">In the preaching of Shakerism, which is only another name for Christianity, we can have
                                no other object than to preach the whole truth as God has permitted it to shine into our
                                souls. Every moral and every Christian Society has a measure of influence bearing upon
                                this same question, and all are more or less anxious, when directed by uplifting
                                inspirations, to have the good prosper and maintain an ascendency ovei every low estate.
                                When Jesus remarked that "the truth shall make you free," he was the messenger of an
                                inspirational influence that should from that day hold permanent possession of the human
                                mind. , Whatever may transpire in the world to allure man from the principles of
                                righteousness, or to engulf him in the vortex of sin, there has ever been a light from
                                God, revealing the power and glory of a better life. We are ascetics in any other sense
                                than that which occupied the mind of Jesus, where he says, "Ye are not of the world, but
                                I have chosen you out of the world." This declaration of Jesus must find a resting place
                                in the heart of every one who believes in the mission of the Christ. The life of the.
                                world is the life of animal generation, a place not in the least above that upon which
                                Adam and Eve lived during their Edenic visitation. The amalgamation of the life of the
                                world with that manifested by the cross of Christ has been the superlative desire and
                                the untiring effort of every form of pseudo Christianity. To force this upon the mind of
                                man that he may be held by the influences of a sensual world has been the priestly
                                influence of every credent church. "Wars and rumors of wars" have been heard at every
                                point of the compass, and with the poison of asps under their tongues, a stream of
                                private or public persecution, has in the name of religion,<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> been a
                                plague spot on the earth and an affliction to all dissenters. The opening of a church
                                service was recently made by reading a portion of the sermon on the Mount. It was
                                beautiful beyond expression and breathed an inspiration so lifegiving that one might be
                                transported to a realm where God-men or good men dwell in peaceful prosperity. It
                                requires no studied effort to accept the ministrations of that life which was above and
                                in advance of the world. It was the embodiment of goodness�one with the Father� and
                                kindly permitting us the privilege to share in the same great blessing. A man on the
                                earth, "tempted in all points as were his brethren" and yet a living example of a
                                present resurrection, in which all must participate if they would be among the members
                                of his church. A freedom that is wrought out through the acceptance of this truth, must
                                permeate the whole being, and make of every recipient of this divine favor, a man or
                                woman of God. We can see no inducement for those who accept the cross of Christ, who
                                know that they can, by faithfulness in the truth, obtain the promised reward, to
                                anticipate or even to hold in possession those treasures which savor of selfishness or
                                which lead to a life-in the world. Better say with the, apostle, "God forbid that I
                                should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, by whom the world is
                                crucified unto me, and I unto the world." Gal. v., 14. Here we have a Christian
                                testimony that gives forth no uncertain sound. Through this comes a freedom which the
                                truth only could establish in the mind. As it made the apostle a free man, a son of God,
                                so in like manner, the growth of the same divine truth in the soul will make of all
                                others, free men and sons and daughters of our God. We have no occasion to say that this
                                is like "our testimony" for it is the testimony which the gospel of Christ came to
                                establish, and becomes our treasure by accepting it into our daily life, and by
                                establishing it in the kingdom of our God by practical righteousness.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p"> Through the kindness of friends we are able to distribute several copies of the Manifesto

                                anew the all-important lesson, "We reap what we sow." In this case we also gather where
                                has been planted. From spacious orchards we now gather the delicious fruit of trees,
                                most of them planted by those whose tireless labors, have won for them the invitation:
                                "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." The planting of trees by those on the shady side
                                of life, seems to me to be the embodiment of an unselfish interest in those who are
                                their successors. In this, our loved ones gone before have set a noble example. Will
                                those now in life's prime, "go and do likewise." If every one numbered in our ranks
                                should take for their text the golden words uttered by Elder Giles as reported in Notes
                                from Enfield, N. H., "We should be producers as well as consumers," both spiritually and
                                temporally, where would ever come a de. cline. O let not one who shares the blessings of
                                our Home, draft upon its treasures without doing all in their power to return the same
                                to the Lord's storehouse with no stinted measure. The picking of our winter apples was
                                finished on the 10th. inst. and one thousand one hundred and twenty-five bushels have
                                been taken from the trees, and now nearly as many still remain to be gathered for drying
                                and for cider. And such beautiful apples. It has been like viewing a delightful
                                panorama, to watch their growth since the early spring gave us the clustered blossoms in
                                such abundance. Center Family. Oct. 14, 1891. Beloved Eldek Heney;�We have abundant
                                cause to be thankful for both spiritual and temporal blessings; for abundant crops of
                                hay, corn and potatoes, also fruit of all kinds commonly cultivated here. Fruit is
                                generally fairer, and pears sweeter than in most years. Apples are less perforated with
                                the fly maggot than in other years of late. This pest was little known here twenty years
                                ago, but of late, has destroyed the value of a great deal of otherwise fair and
                                excellent fruit. We are well along in our apple picking, and the fruit is fairer and
                                more of it, than we saw reason to expect in the forepart of summer. Our tomatoes also
                                have yielded bountifully, when once they could be persuaded to ripen. But the frost
                                keeping its distance from our hills until the 10th. of October has given us ample time
                                to reap the benefits of the care bestowed on our spacious tomato patch. We hope abler
                                pens with more time than ours, will report the pleasure which we as a village enjoyed
                                from the first to the fifth of October by the "Harvest-Home Gathering" at the North
                                Family. All were invited and during the days it was open, nearly all of our village
                                attended to see the collection of fruits, flowers, vegetables and industries of that
                                devoted family ; to be met with smiling faces, gentle voices, and to listen to
                                recitations, speeches, songs, etc., suitable to the occasion. "Coming events cast their
                                shadows before" sometimes. Is this a forerunner of a Society "Harvest-Home" for our
                                Centennial, 1892, to show what progress our Community, starting from almost nothing, has
                                made in one hundred years. When my thoughts turn to our possibilities as a Community,
                                volumes seem to open before me, and- - - - -but I must write no more at this time, lest

                                have been seasons of deep spiritual interest, and movings of the waters of life,

                                season for every righteous proceeding under the sun, moon, or stars. But never, nay
                                never a time for unrighteousness. Souls endowed with spiritual talents, are enriched in

                                The summer has past, and the harvest most brought to a close. We are now engaged
                                gathering in our apples of which we have a great abundance, and very nice. The weather
                                the past few weeks has been beautiful; no frost till this A. M. Everything has ripened
                                up, and we had some very large yields. Our patch of tomatoes a little more than half an
                                acre, has yielded at the rate of one thousand bushels to the acre; never saw tomatoes so
                                thick and so nice. Sweet corn was a very heavy crop. Winter squash (white chestnut) on a
                                little over half an acre we had six tons and a half. Beans were likewise very good.
                                Indeed we are most bountifully blest with every good thing pertaining to this life, and
                                if we don't have a grand thanksgiving, it will be because we are too selfish and have
                                not done our duty, loving our neighbors as we do ourselves. In working our gardens the
                                past season, I never before realized the benefit there was, in frequently stirring the
                                soil; the weeds in this respect prove a great blessing to the diligent cultivator; if it
                                were not for the weeds, our gardens in many cases would seldom be cultivated or hoed.
                                The appearance of the weeds constantly remind us, and of necessity we stir the soil.
                                Straight rows, and uniform distance apart are a great advantage, in field, or garden.
                                Irregular crooked rows, mean careless cultivation; careless cultivation gives
                                indifferent crops; poor crops are no incentive to gratitude; unthankfulness leads to
                                impatience and poverty; thus crooked rows have a depressing, downward tendency. While
                                straight rows, and clean culture ever tend upward towards perfection. Our gospel friends
                                at Hancock are an example to all who pass their street; and there is no doubt, that many
                                a one passing tlieir straight-rowed, clean kept gardens, and witnessing their enormous
                                crops, has caught an inspiration inciting him to go and do likewise. External
                                surroundings have a marked influence on the internal growth of young people. A company
                                of boys put to work in a field or garden where the rows are crooked and overrun with
                                weeds, where the fences are covered with briers and bushes and the walks in a slipshod,
                                slovenly condition, and it will be very easy for them to be rude and disorderly. I love
                                straight rows, clean of weeds and neatly kept borders; they make it easier to be
                                    good.<pb n="256" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> Well, it looks as though our Society Meetings would soon
                                be closed; for upon the arrival of cold weather we have no means of heating our meeting
                                house that is satisfactory, and no thoroughly scientific way of ventilating it. I think
                                the house where we meet for worship, should be made the most comfortable; where the best
                                knowledge of art and science should be embodied, to warm the house equally all over, and
                                where the ventilation is so perfect, that at the close of the meeting the air is in as
                                pure a condition as when first entered; and it should be out of the reach of anybody to
                                stop the breathing process going on. Every house where humans, or other animals live or
                                meet, should be constructed so that it as really breathes, as does the animal body.
                                Shall not this knowledge be brought into one or more of our meeting houses as a
                                preparatory step for our centennial 1892. In kindest love, D.

                                which have all been very good. We are about done canning tomatoes, which have yielded
                                far better than we expected. A warm Sept. ripened the fruit nicely. The amount of
                                tomatoes canned in the Society must be about 4000 doz. The Church family have dried over
                                100 bbls. of sweet corn and the Second family will have nearly 200 bbls. They will
                                finish cutting about the 16th. of this month. We are digging the potatoes and they are
                                affording a good crop. The apple and pear trees have been breaking down with abundance
                                of fruit. We certainly should give thanks to the Lord for this bountiful harvest of
                                temporal blessings. We have also received spiritual blessings, at the hand of the Lord
                                as we were found worthy. The South family have been building an addition to their family
                                dwelling, which is nearly finished, and is a much needed improvement; for while they
                                always have room in their hearts to welcome those who wish to be Believers, still their
                                house was rather small. They are now well provided with room in the dining hall and in

                                fruit, corn and tomatoes so fast, that it required diligence to keep pace with the
                                growth, and not allow it to go to waste. The last week in Sept. this family put up seven
                                hundred dozen cans of tomatoes, the largest yield we ever had in one week. At the same
                                time we were cutting and drying corn, also cutting ensilage. We have obeyed the counsel
                                of Mother Ann in "hands to work," and hope we have done as well in giving our hearts to
                                God, who has so bountifully blest us with an abundant harvest. Oct. 4th. was the warmest
                                day of the season. We had a pleasant surprise about three weeks ago by a call from
                                Eldress Martha Johnson and five young Sisters from Hancock. They came to Albany for an
                                outing, but as it was raining hard on their arrival, the Elders of the South family who
                                were there to escort them, concluded it would be better to spend the day at Watervliet.
                                So all came out and made a running visit and returned the next day. We enjoyed it more
                                perhaps for the lack of formality. We hope to hear that Br. [ra Lawson has improved in
                                health and we, with his friends at Hancock, hope that God may grant him a longer lease
                                of life. Our Ministry are still with us except one familiar face, which we miss, but
                                hope to see the next time they arrive at the Valley. Elder Joseph returned to our home
                                in good health and gave us the love of gospel kindred in western Societies at our

                                the hope laid up for you in heaven." The reason of his thankfulness is found in the fact
                                that the Colossian Church had remained steadfast and true to the foundation principles
                                of the gospel. Through temptations, trials and persecutions the hope which they
                                cherished had comforted and sustained them. What was true in the experience of those

                                since. The hope laid up for them in heaven has been an anchor to their souls, holding

                                should be regular, certain hours being fixed upon for that purpose, but they are few who

                                size and quality. Corn is cut, and ready to be brought to the barn, and is also
                                satisfactory in every way. Nothing is wanting to remind us of that love which governs,
                                and the power that has created all these blessings which we daily receive. We have
                                enjoyed a visit from two Sisters from Philadelphia the past month which has proved
                                beneficial in many ways, the bond of union is strengthened, gospel love has been
                                diffused, and the living testimony of Mother's gospel enjoyed. These elements increase
                                our thankfulness and zeal, to make greater effort for this "Beautiful gospel, this soul
                                saving gospel." M. Withain.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Ayer, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Ayer, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p"> Oct. 1, 1891. We are just now having glowing accounts of the future of our people by a
                                spiritualistic medium who has been with us a few days. She has looked into the future of
                                Society and tells us what we are to be in three years from this time. All very good, but
                                I fear there is a work to be done before reaching that glorious state. No condition in
                                Society can be attained without work and the more glorious, the more ardent and severe
                                the labor of those who are the pioneers of the work. The strongest test of character is
                                the power to work free of personal spirit. No change has ever been accomplished without
                                a great sacrifice on the part of some of the members of Society, hence the great
                                necessity of help from the powers of wisdom. To have a power to work while out of
                                sympathy with many of the methods and yet in entire sympathy with the true purpose of
                                the work is a great gift of<pb n="258" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> grace, and belongs to the best
                                characters. A unity of purpose can exist where there is diversity of opinion as to how
                                the purpose is to be accomplished. True devotion is not shown by tenacity of opinion,
                                but by a spirit of investigation to discover how far that tenacity of opinion is true
                                and can be justified. Wliere the object of each worker is the good of all and to build
                                up the true principles, there will be but little opposition to meet. Success then will
                                not rest on "I Think" but on "these are the facts, how can we meet them." A
                                misunderstanding may sometimes arise, but it is not due so much to personal feelings, as
                                a lack of frankness of expression of the true feeling. "Let us reason together," is good
                                logic, and where there has been a mistake made, let us look upon it as a mistake of the
                                head and not of the heart. Duties of the household stand about the same from month to
                                month, though the Sisters have shaken from their shoulders the work of herb-picking and
                                are now engaged in the preserving of fruit. The farmers have filled the silo with
                                eighty-five tons of the best of corn fodder. Nothing pleases the farmer more than to see
                                the fruits of the harvest coming in bountifully, and he feels assured that "God helps
                                those who help themselves." As there is, generally, a strife among gardeners to have the
                                first ripe tomatoes, I would suggest that they try Maul's Tree tomato. If you have not
                                had it, try it next year and let us know of your success. I think it is one of the
                                wonders of the garden. I set 175 plants and I think every plant yielded not less than
                                three pecks of good tomatoes. A. D.

                                since early spring, we have sent out our usual stock of hopes and fears, as touching the
                                closing of the fruit harvest of 1891, and especially the blossoming and fruiting of
                                those trees that hold in reserve for us the treasures for use during the winter. All the
                                small fruits have been thankfully received and many of them placed in the cellar to be
                                used as an appetizing comfort in connection with other substantial food. The abundant
                                crop of pears, including some of the best varieties, has been even more than one could
                                wish. However, the daily influences that are brought to bear upon them, so continuously,
                                will no doubt relieve us from all undue anxiety. A liberal supply of winter apples has
                                far exceeded our expectations and we gladly give vent to many free-will expressions of
                                thanks. Several hundred bushels of excellent fruit are being carefully laid away for
                                use, as the good of the Community may determine. While we now feel thankful in thinking
                                and knowing, in the months to come we shall be thankful in having,�and in being able to
                                partake of them as our daily food. A few days since we received through the mail, a
                                little package of "Buckeyes." For these we are indebted to the kind remembrance of Br.
                                Watson Andrews of Ohio. The novelty of the name in this section, threw many quite from
                                their guard, and they were puzzled to determine the size, shape or quality of a
                                "Buckeye." Soon, some one says, "They are just like Horse-chestnuts," and as that was so
                                near correct, the guessing closed. The tree should be better known, for its beauty of
                                foliage and its pyramidal racemes of beautiful pink and white flowers. And now comes a
                                package of Everbearing, strawberry plants from Br. Daniel Orcutt of Enfield, Ct., for
                                which he has our kindest thanks. We shall hold the plants in fond remembrance, and when
                                they "grow and nourish," we shall be<pb n="259" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> interested to make farther
                                investigations. Sept. 23. We were visited by a large delegation of Free-will Baptists,
                                and for one hour our home was busily engaged in entertaining not less than one hundred
                                and twenty persons. A religious service of three days had been arranged to take place
                                some two miles from our Village, in the interests of the Baptist church, and while on
                                their way the above number called to see their Shaker friends. The hour passed very
                                pleasantly, and closed with singing, both by the Shakers and their visitors. Well, the
                                harvest is not yet past, and although the New Englanders are not remarkable for the
                                abundance which they may gather, they have the enjoyment of getting quite a good supply
                                of God's earthly blessings and for which we hope all may carry a thankful spirit.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Enfield, New Hampshire" TEIform="index"/> Enfield, N.

                                square look at himself." My eyes casually rested on this quotation in looking over a
                                paper that might rightfully have been termed a waste of printers' ink and precious time,
                                had it not been for one redeeming feature:�a short column, called "Sands of Gold," and I
                                thought, why not call the attention of some young, would-be Christian, to this homely
                                truth, it may help another to see himself as others see him, which is one of the
                                important achievments. Evidently some soul had been illumined with the light of truth
                                sufficiently, to see ones natural state far removed from God, greatly in need of both
                                justice and mercy to bring out the qualities that ally one to the heavenly kingdom, and
                                cleanse, as with fuller's soap, from all ungodliness. The thought also suggested itself,
                                that as Believers in Christ's first and second appearing it was our duty, privilege
                                also, to square our accounts at the closing of each year; to take a "good square look at
                                ourselves." If it is necessary in the business world, as is generally conceded, why not
                                ten-fold more necessary in the things that concern our growth mentally and spiritually.
                                Let us see, not where we have tipped an uneven balance, for very few are exposed to this
                                temptation in our Community homes, but where we have in thought, word or act wronged
                                another, and make restitution, where we have been in any degree disloyal to the banner
                                we professedly march under, where our omissions of duty, either temporal or spiritual
                                have been recorded by the unseen guardians, and what our relations are with the
                                Infinite, which relationship we may form and maintain through the sacred channel of
                                prayer. Our summer has indeed been enjoyable, so far as weather is concerned; more
                                consecutive pleasant days than for many seasons past. Our pear, tomato and apple harvest
                                has been abundant, and we think and speak often of those who have not these blessings in
                                such abundance. No extreme cases of sickness in the Society, though the too common
                                ailments that poor humanity is heir to, afflict and annoy. Our love and good wishes to

After an exceptionally mild autumn, we are reminded by a little freeze that
                                summer is past and winter will soon be here. Our sweet corn did better than anticipated,

On looking over the "Notes'1 of last month's issue of the Manifesto, we are
                                reminded that the time is at hand for more and wonder what we can say that will be of
                                interest to its many readers. We have heard that "there is nothing new under the sun."
                                This of course does not include a bit of news now and then. The last flat roof in our
                                village has been removed and a more modern one taken its place. Our ox-barn has been
                                undergoing repairs and is now almost an entire new building. It has been quite an
                                expensive job. Now all our barns are in good repair. We wish we could say that about our
                                other buildings. The ensilage corn which was cut and put into the silo last week grew to
                                a great height, some of the stalks measuring fourteen ft. and eight in. A goodly harvest
                                of squashes has rewarded the Brethren for their labor. About five tons and of splendid
                                quality, the genuine Hubbard, and we are saving the seed for market. We have also an
                                abundance of pumpkins, have cut and dried over one hundred good-sized ones, beside
                                having a plenty for present use. Thus for many days to come we shall have the much
                                prized pumpkin pie, while our Sister Society is enjoying the appetizing cranbei'ry
                                sauce. And we can say with our good New England poet:� "What moistens the lips and what
                                brightens the eye, What calls back the past like the rich pumpkin pie?'&gt; Our aged
                                brothers, Samuel Kendrick, Thomas Noyes, Paul Nowell and Pliny Worcester are bright
                                examples of industry and patience. During the long days through the heat of summer, we
                                have seen these good fathers busily at work on the wood. They have split and wheeled
                                into the wood houses about 200 cords. Brs. Pliny and Paul have also husked and strung on
                                wires all the sweet seed corn for market. Br. Pliny has also driven the team to Poland
                                Springs twice each week all through the season. We love and cherish these dear aged
                                ones, for the time will come when they will not be with us. Now we want to tell you how
                                veiy near our good Sister Aurelia came to losing her life yesterday. She was walking
                                through the dwelling house with company and stepped backward from the head of a flight
                                of stairs without thinking she was so near. She fell the whole length and came to the

                                thankfulness at every thought that her life is spared, and are glad to tell you she was

                                work successfully. The potato harvest was finished Saturday the third inst., two hundred
                                and nineteen bushels were grown on two thirds of an acre, the entire crop is free from

                                and they viewed their work and found it good and they rested on the twenty-seventh day.
                                The past week has been devoted to gathering winter apples, and fall ones and all that
                                have fallen, the gathering has shown a greater supply of the unlooked for article than
                                the inhabitants a mouth previous dared hope for. Apple drying is now the chief
                                occupation. While the apple bee hums and hums away, providing good food for the long

Deab Manifesto :�Our health is very good and we are trying to move the
                                wheels of our destiny in the most favorable direction possible so far as we have
                                anything to do with it and that is a good deal, as I view it. Elder Joseph Holden made
                                us a short visit about the 9th. ult. but short as it was we felt very greatly blessed
                                and comforted thereby. He also made a flying visit to White Water and Watervliet and
                                thence took his flight for home via. Groveland. We are beginning to harvest our potatoes
                                which are a fine crop. We have dried about sixty-five bushels of apples, (I have to say
                                bushels because I don't know how many pounds a bushel of dried apples weigh.) We shall
                                continue until time to gather the winter apples, saving all that fall from the trees in
                                this way. We westerners need to learn a good many lessons in saving all that is savable.
                                Our corn has ripened up splendidly and is out of the way of the frost and is a huge
                                crop. Our Office is undergoing quite a metamorphosis. We have a Society meeting at 9-30
                                every Sabbath morning and a singing meeting at 2-30 P. M. We have a meeting for
                                practicing and learning music each Monday evening at 7-15 and another for the same
                                purpose Thurs. evening at 7-15. We have a spelling school every alternate Friday evening
                                and propose to have some kind of intellectual exercise on the intervening Fri. eve. If
                                any one feels inclined to furnish any suggestions as to the manner of conducting such an
                                enterprise, here is an openi ig for him or her and sucli suggestions will be gratefully
                                received. We are not of the class, be it known to all men, who believe that there is,
                                ever was, or ever can be, any antagonism between science and religion. We think with
                                dear Elder Frederick, that they have joined hands in a holy and eternal compact. We must
                                hold to this sentiment so long as we believe all Truth is of God. We believe that "Who
                                would divorce this mystic band supernal Or break the ties their holy compact rule With
                                atheistic ministry infernal* Must be a gibbering madman 01 a fool." We still persist in
                                preparing medicines and this department is superintended by Br. William L. Lincoln, who
                                is very faithful and efficient in all the arduous burdens and details thereof. We who
                                lived in the Office are at present occupying the Meeting House and adjoining shops,
                                where the hired help and those stopping transiently, receive their board. We find it
                                pretty difficult to entertain strangers, but so iar we have man-<pb n="262" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/>
                                aged somehow to do it. Our Sisters all round spare no pains to care for and make the
                                Brethren as comfortable as they possibly can, for which we feel sincerely grateful and
                                vastly more contented and happy than if it were otherwise. Indeed life would not be

                                place. On Sunday, Elder Oliver preached a good sermon, and many thank him for his good
                                advice. I also enjoyed the company of the good Elders while at Watervliet. Many thanks
                                to all the Brethren and Sisters at Watervliet for their kindness to me. Elder Henry Bear
                                and Elder Lafayette Parker made a visit to Union Village on Sept. 28. The farmers in

                                    was strictly prohibited, and no one using the weed can be a delegate to the annual

                                    another dries; and by the single form where one person both washes and dries.
                                    Petitions came in to repeal these rules and to allow churches to wash feet according

                                    to shave on Sunday, or to hear of a minister of the gospel who goes fishing on any

                                    "sects" because to go to a less noble place of prayer would be a dishonor to God; it

Any Article that has outlived 22 years of competition
and imitation, and sells more
and more each year, must have
mehit. Dobbins1 Electric Soap
first  made in   186y,   is  just
THAT   ARTICLE.         Those   who
use it each week, and their
name is legion, save clothes
and strength, and let soap do
the work. All that we can
say as to its merits, pales into
nothingness, before the story
it will tell, itself, of its own
perfect purity and quality, if
you will give it one trial. Ask
your grocer for it. He has it,
or will get it. Try it next
Monday.
There are many imitation
!N". B. Electric Soaps in which electricity plays no pirt. Dobbins'
is tlie original one, all Magnetics, Electrics, and Electro-Magics are fraudulent
imitations. Ask for Dobbins' Electric.
See that our name is on every wrapper,
and if any other is sent you by your grocer when you order ours,�send it back to
him.
