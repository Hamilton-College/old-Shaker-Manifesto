TUNES.
That's a large number, but the Symphonion plays it. The Symphonion is an unlimited
music box instead of a cylinder playing from
one to six airs. The Symphonion uses steel
plates as shown herewith.
These plates revolve and their teeth strike
the teeth of the steel combs, thus producing
the tones. Plates are changed in a moment.
They may be boughtby the hundreds and each
plate represents a different tune. One may
thus have sacred music, old favorites and lat:st songs of the day, as he chooses.
The Symphonion is simple in construction
and docs not get out of order, as the old fashion music boxes always do. They are rich and
melodious intone and not the least expensive.
We are headquarters for the trade and are
prepared to quote lower prices than ever before with all the latest improvements.

No. 1.</head><p TEIform="p">The establishing of a Society at South Union, Ky., was accomplished at the expense of much
                            suffering. The preaching of the gospel of Jesus the Christ is always followed by the
                            persecuting spirit of darkened or sensual minds; and it is not uncommon to find among the
                            low classes, the ministers of such churches as believe in the hanging and burning of those
                            who may differ from them on some special theological point. The question of practical
                            righteousness is not of so much importance to a searcher for heretics, as it is to know
                            whether they were baptized in still waters or in a running stream. A remarkable revival of
                            religion had been in progress in the state of Kentucky for more than a year. This was in the
                            year 1801. It included the rich and poor, the educated and the ignorant, and no less the
                            church professor and those who manifested no interest on the subject of religion. The news
                            of this wonderful outpouring of God's spirit reached the Believers at New Lebanon, and
                            seemed so much in harmony with the prophecy of Mother Ann that it became a matter of very
                            deep interest. There were many persons then living who had heard the prophecy and believed
                            without a doubt that it was in process of fulfillment. In the exaltation of the spirit,
                            while in the worship of God, Mother Ann raised her hand and said to the Believers,�"The next
                            great opening of the gospel testimony will be in the southwestern part of the United
                            States." It was a quandary in the minds of many, why that section of the country should be
                            designated. Very little was known of that part of the country except it was supposed to be
                            largely inhabited by Indians and wild beasts. The word, however, that was spoken in the gift
                            of God, some years previous to this date, had been retained in the minds of the Believers as
                            prophetic, and was now being fulfilled. The faith of these soldiers of the cross was as true
                            as the compass to the pole, and they saw the hand of God outstretched to do a great and
                            marvelous work, and they heard this voice of God, which called for the messengers of light,
                            to buckle on their armor and engage in the work of harvesting souls from the low estates of
                            the earth. Three Brethren were then selected NOVEMBER,<pb n="250" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 250 THE

                            to leave home on the first day of January, 1805, and make this journey of more than a
                            thousand miles on foot. One horse was provided to carry their baggage, and on which they
                            could ride in case of sickness or accident. ' At the early hour of three o'clock in the
                            morning they bid adieu to their gospel friends and commenced their journey to the state of
                            Kentucky. They traveled through Poughkeepsie, New York City, Philadelphia, Pa., Baltimore,
                            Md., Abington, Va., Hawkins, Tenn., to Paint Lick, Ky. They now learned that they had been
                            on the inarch two months and twenty-two days, and had traveled the distance of one thousand,
                            two hundred and thirtythree miles. On March 3rd, they attended a religious service and
                            opened their testimony of a life in God. They informed the leaders of the revival of their
                            mission into Kentucky and were very pleasantly received. Other meetings were held as
                            occasion offered, till the twenty-first of the month when they went on to Turtle Creek, now
                            Union Village, O. A warm welcome was extended to them by Malcham Worley and his family, and
                            the Believers felt blessed of God for the Providential care that was over them. To meet the
                            wishes of the revivalists and to attend their meetings, Issaehar traveled on foot and alone,
                            a distance of ninety miles. He was obliged 'to cross one creek three times where the mud and
                            water was two feet deep. Before he reached the place of his destination, his feet were very
                            badly blistered and it was with difficulty that he proceeded on his way. By the 23rd of May,
                            1805, not less than forty young Believers were added to the Community in Ohio, and as might
                            be expected, the spirit of persecution was aroused. Mobs armed with staves and hickory
                            clubs, threatened to use violence, but were persuaded by some of the company to wait still
                            longer and see what the Shakers were intending to do. Meetings were held from day to day,
                            and the Brethren made visits to different sections of the country to inform the people of
                            their gospel mission. By the month of June, the congregation had become so large that no
                            ordinary house would accommodate them, and they were obliged to build preaching stands in
                            the woods. The Brethren were now able to find assistants among those who had been converted
                            to the faith, and with these they traveled from Turtle Creek to Gasper, and as often as
                            opportunity offered, held revival meetings in the several villages through which they had
                            passed* (to be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Progress is our being's motto..." TEIform="index"/>Progress is our being's motto...

                            principle or end; a complete exhibition of essential principles or facts arranged in a
                            rational dependence or cohesion; an assemblage of objects arrange! in regular subordination,
                            or after some distinct method, usually, logical or scientific; a regular union of principles
                            or parts forming one entire whole." And who can study our system of orders, and notice its
                            perfect adaptation to the objects to which they are applied, and not see the exact
                            correspondence with the above definitions. Or observe the lots of care and gener al
                            membership,�Ministry, Elders, Trustees, Deacons, Teachers, Brethren, Sisters and
                            Children,�and note how perfectly these by-laws and orders meet the requirements of every day
                            life; and not realize that neglect or disregard of these orders by even one individual of a
                            community, must unavoidably produce inharmony, and to that extent, disintegration. The four
                            cardinal principles underlying our church relation, as we all know, are the following ;
                            virgin purity of life, community of interest, parental control, and filial respect. These
                            are, it may with propriety be said, the four corner stones upon which our gospel temple
                            rests. Does any one suppose that one of the corner stones or supporting pillars of a
                            building can be taken out and the building stand as secure as before? Or that any one of
                            these foundational principles can be ignored and yet our Zion home be secure ? Let us see.
                            First, without virgin purity of life, we should be obliged either to adopt the common
                            practice of the world, and marry, which would inevitably bring us into the common condition
                            of the world ; "or do worse ;-'-'� and this would bring our homes to-sure1 and swift
                            destruction, and our name to the annals of infamy. Second, without community of intei'est,
                            our institution would contain all those elements of discord which result from diversity of
                            interests, which are legion, and which render community life impossible ; and all life
                            inharmonious, and in that degree, unhappy. Third, without an adequate controling influence,
                            a community of any name or nature, and no matter for what purpose instituted, anarchy and
                            confusion must inevitably prevail, and speedy dissolution follow. Fourth, and equally as
                            important as adequate control, is due respect. Harmoijy, and hence success in community
                            life, as has been proven over and over many times, is impossible without a systematic code
                            of by-laws and orders corresponding to the underlyingprinciples of the institution; and of
                            course, strict obedience to those laws. This being the case, and such a code of orders
                            having been found indispensable in the formation, and for the protection of the church, when
                            under the influence and in the immediate presence of the leaders and founders of the gospel,
                            and the Holy Spirit by which they were inspired; is it reasonable to suppose that this
                            spirit can be kept, union maintained and temporal<pb n="252" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 252 THE MANIFESTO.
                            interests secured in any other way, or by any other means than those to which we owe our
                            Zion homes to-day? 1 Believe it not! The demon of license and disorder, under the guise of
                            liberty, is abroad in the earth; and anarchy and confusion is the result. And to the extent
                            that system is ignored, and order disregarded, anarchy and confusion will prevail in Zion.
                            Our gospel system is that introduced by the "Comforter, the Holy Spirit," on the day of
                            Pentecost; and our government that of the heavens, viz., Parental, and our duty, that of
                            children. Only in the degree that we "become as little children," can we create a heaven

                            With all my being I give thanks, In humble prayer and grateful, praise That I'm permitted to
                            behold, These bright and glorious latter days. This sacred honor does belong, To God, our
                            Father and our friend, For all who raise their cries to Him With out-stretched arms He will
                            defend. While on the shores of time, I stay, I will rejoice in heavenly mirth, That I was
                            called while in my youth, To. leave the transient joys of earth. How sweet the moments as
                            they glide, What solid joy what peace of mind Have those who give their lives to God, And to
                            his will become resigned. Thus has it been in days gone by, Since first I walked in gospel
                            light, This light's increased, until to-day, My soul is filled with pure delight. No earthly
                            joy can equal this; No worldly honor this bestow, On those who've found the way of life,
                            While works of love they freely do. The present time, this very day, Has brought me to my
                            fortieth year. One half of life I've given Thee, Oh, God! to love, to serve, and fear. The
                            few remaining days or years, That I'm permitted here to stay, Will ever be to honor Thee And
                            magnify thy holy way. The promise of an hundred fold Is given unto all in time, Who freely
                            leave all things for Christ That in his glory they may shine. But still more glorious
                            they'll appear, When earthly scenes with them are o'er, When their immortal spirits land,
                            Upon that bright and blissful shore. Endless life in realms of light In which the saints and
                            angels move, Whose greatest joy and chief delight, Are in the works of heavenly love.
                            Eternity, thou blissful thought, What pen can paint, what tongue can tell? While ages shall
                            on ages roll, Yet in God's presence we shall dwell.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Reverie" TEIform="index"/>REVERIE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Mason, Moore" TEIform="persName"/>Moore Mason.</byline><p TEIform="p">"What do ye more than they.''1 Matt, v., 47. We are constantly informed that numerous

                            about the fields being "white for the harvest." Still, conscientious persons say,�Oh, they

                            Father's storehouse? And although the commandment says: "Go ye into all the world," may it
                            not be wise for u.s in our detennination to perpetuate this gospel, to consider that earnest
                            people to-day, in their thirst for advanced thought ask of us "What do ye more than they?"
                            and will not be satisfied unless we show that we follow Him who went about doing good. And
                            is it not our doing that will demonstrate to the world that we have passed from death unto
                            life and have become partakers of the divine nature? It is doing that the world needs, doing
                            those things that exhibit the divinity within the soul; deeds of kindness, deeds of
                            beneficence, deeds of self-sacrifice, deeds of heroic opposition to all forms of individual
                            and organized wickedness. We want to make all feel anew and forcibly our earnest, determined
                            warfare in opposition to wrong, and in favor of truth and righteousness ; and is it not time
                            to be up and doing, dropping good seed at every opportunity. Only let us be sure that those
                            seeds are the truths taught by Christ, and nothing else, so that in the spiritual upheaval
                            we are passing through, when startled with the cry "Lo here or lo &gt;there" we may always have
                            the Teacher's injunction in our mind, "What is that to thee, follow thou me;" and doubtless
                            He who can temper the winds to the shorn lamb, will safely guide his followers, who "walk
                            not after the flesh, but after the spirit." Only the man who presses succeeds, No man
                            becomes very religious wli) does not press himself often into unpleasant duties and engage
                            in unpleasant service. The church that stands still dies, but the one that keeps on a heavy
                            pressure is the oue that moves on and up to higher and better things, and it is the
                            discipline and trials on the way that make the narrow path more shining and cause us to
                            exclaim : "Keep thou my feet, I do not ask to see the Distant scene; One step enough for
                            me." When we think of the vast numbers who love to gaze upon that weary walk from the manger
                            to the cross, thosL' few years of such great sadness, how few we find who are willing to
                            regulate their lives by the one test of motive, "do good to all men ;" and thus show they
                            have a claim on Him who aloue founded his empire on love, and who to this day millions would
                            die for. What a happy change it would be if professors of theology would stop trying to
                            regulate the kingdom of heaven with their purblind theories, and teach that all should give
                            their hearts and souls to doing good and rendering justice to their fellow men; and while
                            thus endeavoring to lead the Christ life here on earth, we may have a kingly march from

                            Ismaelites. They originated in the 9th century, and after a period of great power, sank into
                            oblivion. The story of their rise and fall is an intensely interesting one, but only the
                            merest outlines can be given in a brief article suitable for the Manifesto. The founder of
                            the sect was Ismael, who was considered to be the last and greatest of seven Imams, or
                            Messiahs; the six preceding ones were Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed. In
                            him culminated the knowledge of all science, natural or spiritual; he was to be followed and
                            obeyed in all things; he was the incarnate God, there being no personal God beside him ;
                            neither did he die, but dematerialized himself, to be re-incarnated at some future time in
                            another person. Meanwhile he left the occult mysteries of his dispensation to a line of
                            successors who were to reign till he should come again. His doctrines were not openly taught
                            but kept secret, and his adherents were divided into divisions and orders. The system was
                            brought to perfection by Hassan, who declared himself absolute ruler and successor of Ismael
                            ; and became known as the Old M an of the Mountain, from the hill fortress where he had
                            established himself. The lower orders were kept in ignorance and submission, and the
                            strictest observance of the tenets of the Koran was enjoined upon them; they were the
                            laborers and mechanics, 'i here was also a band of select fanatical young men, the
                            "devoted," who were the ever ready executioners of their chief, who craftily inflamed their
                            minds, causing them to see visions and hallucinations, by the use of Hashish, an
                            intoxicating preparation of the hempplant, which led to their being called Hashishim or
                            hemp-eaters. From this word is derived the term "assassin," the signification of murderer.
                            The doctrines revealed to the higher orders exempted them from all religious obligations and
                            observances, except so far as they might serve as a means of concealing their real opinions
                            and practices. The precepts of the Koran were explained allegorically, and all actions held
                            to be morally indifferent. It is amazing to read the instructions given to missionaries, how
                            they should worm themselves into the confidence of the intended proselytes. "Then, again,
                            there will be those to whom you must preach the belief in a living Messiah. Say Ismael is
                            alive at this moment. Be very gentle and modest with them ; pretend to despise gold and
                            silver; make them recite fifty prayers a day ; recommend to them to abstain from lying and
                            other vices, and from wine. These people are of the utmost use to us. Leave them in their
                            special creed, only just telling them some of the mysteries of the number Seven ; but break
                            their spirit by a surcharge of prayer. These will be our best proofs against the assertions
                            of an advanced disciple if he should betray us. Furthermore, these people, when properly
                            managed, will leave you at their death all their mon-<pb n="255" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO.
                            255 ey, as they would during their lifetime give you everything without a murmur. The more
                            advanced you may inform at once of the abrogation of Mohammedanism by our Messiah, of the
                            worthlessness of the Koran and its laws in their literal sense,"etc., the whole ending in
                            complete atheism. Branches of this sect terrorized Arabia, Syria, and Persia for many j^ears
                            ; they became powerful enough even to conquer Mecca and carry off the sacred black stone,
                            which was restored only for an immense ransom. The valor of the soldiers was irresistible.
                            The knowledge of the human heart and its weaknesses displayed by the principal leaders was
                            wonderful. It is said that they offered devotion to the believer, liberty and license to the
                            free in spirit, philosophy to the strongminded, mystic hopes to the fanatics, and miracles
                            to the masses. Of course, such a system, originating in fraud and perpetuated by fraud,
                            force and assassination, could not endure; but the memory of the terrible Old Man of the
                            Mountain and his secret minions of blood and cruelty is still to-day a fearsome tradition
                            among the unhappy people of the East. There is nothing essentially new under the sun.
                            Changed conditions will modify events, but the unredeemed human mind is what it always has
                            been, erratic and irrational; and never more so than when under the power of degrading
                            religious superstition, furthering the schemes of unscrupulous, ambitious demagogues and
                            charlatans. It is not therefore so very strange that in these enlightened days we should see
                            the dormant anthropolatry, man-worship, of the darkest ages revived, beginning in the spirit
                            and ending in the flesh. The ancient Old Man of the Mountain was a satanic genius in power,
                            resource and address ; the modern one, without an original thought, is but a feeble
                            imitation.

                            stone. The forms of life, the motions of the stars, The opened secrets of the earth and sea,

                            magnify the truth by Nature taught, And stamp it with the holy seal of right. In Aryan
                            forests by the cooling streams, 'Seath shady branches of the sacred trees, The learned
                            Hindoos searched their mystic dreams, And demonstrated life's realities. Or in the temple,
                            safe from vulgar eyes, Discoursed the sacred office of the soul; And caused the spirit to
                            materialize, Thus made its secrets but an open scroll. And through the gift of prophecy,
                            foretold A perfect time when righteousness would reign; When each his human brother would
                            enfold In loving arms, dispelling every pain. When unto earth the Saving One wouldcome, And

                            their senses every rare delight. And Egypt's trusting children longed for rest In God's
                            Great Spirit where there is no night. And Chaldean shepherds watching on the hill, Divined

                            degrees of development from the natural to the spiritual, will enable us to gain a truer and
                            more enlightened interpretation of the mysteries of life. There are the positive and
                            negative forces, life and death; heat and cold; all proving in a more or less tangible way
                            the universal law of correspondences, the centripetal and contrifugal, also the loving and

                            elements that make man the aspiring creature that he is. It was this cry for mercy which

                            the Infinite for deliverance from the cruel slavery of Egyptian bondage, and it was this
                            same earnestness and fortitude of soul which Moses felt for the people of Israel that

                            having had two peaks the other was called Sinai from Seneh, a bush, because it was in a bush
                            that the appearance was made. It is said that the spiritual element of fire pervades all
                            space, is its life and soul; and it was this spiritual element that Moses beheld, while
                            watching the flocks of the priest of Midian, as he led them through the desert and came to
                            the Mountain. This manifestation of the Divine Spirit in the midst of the Burning Bush was
                            an evidence that God's ear was not heavy that He could not hear the pleadings of his
                            children, nor his arm shortened that He could not protect his chosen people through
                            afflictions that weighed heavily upon them, for it was during their journey through the
                            wilderness that they were guided in a marvelous manner. The Lord went before them in a
                            pillar of cloud by day, and by night in a pillar of fire which gave<pb n="257" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>

                            were credited with worshiping visible fire? The Parsees were so charged because they faced
                            the fire, also the sea and sun as they represented to them the Light of Lights, source of
                            all Life, and which they named Hormazd, which signifies the eternal principle of Good. And
                            again no true Parsee will ever smoke, as they consider it a desecration or profanation of
                            the sacred symbol�Fire. The Burning Bush, as also the pillar of cloud and fire was a
                            beautiful symbol of the Divine presence, and was a continual proof that the Lord was ever
                            near his people to guide and protect them. It has been related of Zoroaster that he retired
                            to the mountain, to study wisdom, and also for the benefit of solitude, and that while there
                            the whole mountain was enveloped in a flame, out of which he descended without harm, and for
                            which he offered a sacrifice to God as an evidence within himself that God had appeared to
                            him in the midst of the flame. The Burning Bush, so beautifully spoken of, is a significant
                            emblem of the Israelites in their various stages of affliction and persecution. Though they
                            passed through the fires of adversity yet they were not comsumed; it also represents the
                            Church of God in the wilderness, where the enemy of souls was hurling the fiery darts of
                            envy and jealousy to destroy and scatter those who would follow the true and living; God ;
                            yet through faith and firm reliance in a Divine power, they were preserved from all harni,
                            as is every one who drinks at the spiritual fountain of life, after which they may enter the
                            Koly of Holies and bow before the altar of living inspirai ion, and feel the fires of truth
                            fanned within their own being, and are continually made purer by this flame which consumes
                            the evil yet preserves the good. What was it that saved the three Hebrew children from being
                            destroyed in the fiery furnace, because they would not worship the golden image set up by
                            the king, when the decree was sent forth that all who would not bow in reverence at the
                            sound of the dulcimer, harp and other instruments would be cast in the furnace ? Knowing the
                            command, ' 'thou shalt have no other gods before me, thou shalt not make unto thee any
                            graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
                            beneath or that is in the waters under the earth, thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve
                            them," could they be false to their faith when they knew that God's promises were sure and
                            would save to the uttermost? Nay, they cast all fear and doubt aside and passed through the
                            flame unharmed though the furnace was heated seven times hotter than ever before, proving
                            that they walked with God, clothed with an invisible power or substance that no external or
                            natural fire could penetrate and consume. "A cloud has gathered over the fire altar, the
                            once fragrant wood of Truth is wet with the deadly dews of doubt." May the spirit of
                            caviling be cast aside, that the fires may be renewed and burn with greater intensity until
                            all wrong shall be consumed, and as this cloud<pb n="258" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> 258 THE MANIFESTO.

                            present time, with an increased power and emphasis. It is indeed the call of the Holy
                            Spirit, unto souls who would live the higher life, apart from the sin and selfishness so
                            prevalent in the greater part of humanity to-day. In order to make this choice to our
                            everlasting advantage, due consideration, aspiration and true moral courage is required on
                            the part of every individual, to rise above the power of Mammon, and turn aside from the
                            transient pleasures of the world, and find those eternal joys whose source is divine. Only
                            those who have been touched by conviction, who have received into their hearts the light of
                            truth, are prepared to make the full and necessary sacrifices, are willing to subdue all
                            vain ambitions, selfish desires and sensual passions, all of which constitute a worldly
                            life, that they may in deed and in truth "serve the Lord" with their whole hearts. Besetting
                            temptations and vain allurements of an earthly life, are spread out before the gaze of the
                            young like a panoramic scene, painted in bright, though false colors, and what is the
                            result! Many being deceived, choose unwisely and turn away from the beautiful path of purity
                            and uprightness into the dark valley of woe. We who have heard the command of the Spirit,
                            "Choose ye this day whom ye will serve," know its real meaning and realize the importance of
                            yi.-lding implicit obedience thereto ; there can be no reserve of selfish ties and
                            affections, the natural and earthly mast be sacrificed that the spiritual and divine life
                            within us may be more fully developed ; and this is not accomplished without real
                            determination and a daily struggle against the powers of our lower being, lest they gain the
                            ascendancy. Therefore when the decision comes, as come it must to every individual, whom
                            they will choose to serve, whether the Egyptian gods of their ancestors,�an inheritance of
                            accumulated sins resulting in War, Marriage and Private Property�or whether the living God,
                            who has led them out of the house of bondage and from Egypt's dark land, into a land "for
                            which they did not labor, and to cities which they built not, and to vineyards which they
                            planted not" and to an hundred-fold relationship. Mark the difference! The wise, true and
                            heroic soul could never falter in making the decision, "As for me and my house, we will
                            serve the Lord." Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="It is our privilege..." TEIform="index"/>It is our privilege...

                            that he gains the dominion over his lower, selfish nature and all his former habits
                            gradually are changing so as to be brought into harmony with his better feelings. Under the
                            divine influence, shining into their souls, men lion-like in-their passions, grow into a
                            lamb-like disposition ; here we perceive the lion and the lamb walking together, and a child
                            leading them. Beautiful picture, portrayed by Isaiah, picturing all the fierce passions of
                            men subdued and changed into gentleness, meekness and love. The direct influence the spirit
                            of God has on the soul is to develop the good and to expel the evil. All who obey the gospel
                            testimony and square their lives by it, are brought into nearer relations with God. Holy
                            angels are their guides and guardians, ever willing and ready to administer to their
                            necessities and to bear them through all the vicissitudes of life. What a change is wrought
                            in their characters! The truly spiritual, the love bearing elements which before were
                            dormant, are now quickened into new life. The Flaming Sword, in an article of Sept. 2nd,
                            states that the body of Jesus did not see corruption, but ascended with Him to heaven. His
                            body, (physical) did not ascend to heaven; it returned, like all other physical bodies that
                            die, to the earthly elements from which it was taken, It was his spiritual body with which
                            his soul was or is clothed, that ascended with Him to heaven. This spiritual body, not his
                            physical, was seen by his disciples and the five hundred witnesses at one time, their inner
                            sight being opened. After we are through with earth-life we lay this body aside like a worn
                            out garment. It has fulfilled its mission. This doctrine of the resurrection of the body is
                            passing rapidly away; men growing wiser and more enlightened. They see that all that Paul in
                            his epistle says about the resurrection of the dead, has to be taken in a spiritual sense.
                            Our souls must be resurrected from dead works, must arise out of the grave of sin; buckle on
                            the armor and strive to live faithfully to the teachings of Mother Ann's testimony. As Jesus
                            came to reveal the Fatherhood in God, so Mother Ann came to reveal the Motherhood in God,
                            and to place woman in her right position, equal with man. Mother Ann never placed herself
                            above Jesus, the anointed, but declared Christ to be her Lord and Teacher. Shakers, N.

                                The very simplicity of the work which enrolls one as a disciple of the divine Teacher,
                                brings it most beautifully into the illustration which he was pleased to make to his
                                followers. '"Except ye become as little children, ye can not enter into the kingdom of
                                heaven." It was the confiding trust which little children gave to their teachers that
                                makes this lesson so valuable. When Jesus said, There is none good, but God, he had
                                reference to the source of goodness, so that to be God-like is for men to turn their
                                attention toward God, and in doing that which they think God would like to have them do.
                                This creates goodness. The whole being becomes good, and then out of this abundance of
                                good that is in the heart, the mouth speaketh. Under this system of education all the
                                thoughts and words and deeds become good agreeably to the Christian standard. On this
                                subject of the establishing of goodness in the soul, no better advice could be given
                                than that of St. Paul when he said to his Brethren : "Let every one be persuaded in his
                                own mind." It is a lesson which the Christian student must learn for himself, as his
                                goodness is an outgrowth of the soul, and can no more be obtained by demand, than can
                                the power to create a new world. No creed, nor baptisms, nor protestations of faith can
                                ever develop the spirit of goodness. To believe that there is one person, or two persons
                                or three persons in Deity, is to some Christians the pearl of great price, and will
                                insure the salvation of the soul. Jesus never burdened himself with this form of
                                doctrine through which to establish the gift of goodness. His work was that of practical
                                righteousness, and he gave it an individual application.<pb n="261" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                                MANIFESTO. �261 The heart must be made pure, to be enabled to see the goodness of God.
                                He must become a peacemaker among men, that he may be called a child of God. A valuable
                                lesson has been laid down by the apostle Paul for those to learn who. would be good.
                                "Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
                                devil." With this individual preparation, there is an assurance through the spirit of
                                God that the gift of goodness may be established in the soul. Now we would ask those who
                                have obtained one or more degrees of this precious treasure, In what way can it be made
                                valuable ? A passive goodness is about of as much value as would be a nice garment if
                                carefully laid away where no one could use it. And then moth eaten garments and moth
                                eaten goodness would have about the same value. To do good requires action. Help those
                                who need help. Prepare the way of the Lord and make his paths straight. Live soberly,
                                righteously and godly in this present world. It is said of Jesus that he went about
                                doing good, healing the sick, restoring sight to the blind and raising the dead. To do
                                good after this manner is to accept an abundance of hard work, and is quite like the
                                working out of one's salvation, with some fear and an anxious hope, as we render a
                                Christian care for others.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Card of thanks" TEIform="index"/>CARD OF THANKS.</head><dateline TEIform="dateline"><index level1="New Hampshire, Enfield, October 20, 1893" TEIform="index"/>Enfield, N.

                                1893. It is not every year, nor in all localities, that we can say, "Nature puts on her
                                brightest robes to die in;" but we find that our pleasant summer is being followed by an
                                equally delightful autumn. Early and severe frosts sere the leaves, causing the russet
                                and brown to prevail; while fully ripened foliage, minus the frost, gives a predominance
                                of the brilliant red and yellow, as is seen in the autumnal pictures of to-day. Frosts
                                as yet have not been heavy enough to hurt either the tomato or the morning-glory vines;
                                both of which succumb readily to the frigid touch. Sweet corn, tomatoes and peaches
                                appear upon our table up to date. Apples this year a light crop, but will be so well
                                cared for during the winter, that they will last until the early fruit time of next
                                year. Pears and peaches have been as abundant as the number of trees would allow. It was
                                not two-fifths of a mile of pears that our garden produced but peas. When we have time
                                we will count our pear trees, and allowing a rod between each they will make a long,
                                long row. Forty years ago peaches were abundant on our hillsides. Later the severe
                                winters killed the trees, and peach culture was considered an impossibility.
                                Twenty-three years ago delicious peaches again appeared on every branch which had
                                out-lived the storms, and an interest in home grown fruit again revived. Trees were
                                again started everywhere, to be again and again winter killed. But now comes the reward
                                to those who amid failure still planted trees. How nicely this illustrates the adage,
                                "Get your spindle and distaff ready, and God will send you the flax" and shows us how
                                amid every discouragement, we should be prepared to bear the perfect fruits of
                                righteousness, to feed those who, when the harvest cometh, are seeking only that
                                religion which yields a life practice of good works. But spiritual progression like all
                                other reforms, comes not without sacrifice. If we would march on to conquest, we must
                                leave self behind, hew down our prejudices and idols, and let the sunshine of truth
                                light us out of the dismal haunts of selflove and self-worship, into the grand highway
                                where each seeks to serve God, by serving his neighbor. Amelia J. Calver. North Family.
                                Oct. 1893. We are just home from Society Meeting. This day will probably close what has
                                been a most remarkable season of Society Meetings. Not once during nearly five months
                                has the weather prevented our assembling for worship. To those Societies who are not
                                aware of the fact, we would say that we have issued a new music book (a 1,000 copies
                                edition.) To those who have not had experience in this line, we would say that it costs
                                considerable money, very much time and a scarcely conceivable amount of careful,
                                exhausting work to publish a music book. We have undertaken the expense and give the
                                time and labor freely from love of the public weal, and hope we may confidently rely
                                upon the patronage of all good, interested and progressive Believers. The book is a
                                credit to all concerned. It is issued at bare cost. We trust every family will want
                                some. The celebrated Congress of Religions is closed. What is the result? Many speak<pb n="263" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> ' THE MANIFESTO. 263 slightingly of it. But the fact of the

                                with patience and respect, while expounding the central principles of their respective
                                system?, ought to produce an increase of fraternal feelings, a broader charity, and less
                                narrow egotism on the part of all. We thought prior to the opening of this Congress that
                                Believers ought to be represented in it to testify of an unadulterated, radical
                                Christianity. To this end Elder Daniel, with the consent of the Ministry, opened
                                communications. Much pleasant and friendly correspondence has passed in regard to it. We
                                expected for some time to be invited to arrange for a deputation to attend, but the
                                ultimate concession granted to us was the preparation of a brief paper on our system,
                                which the Chairman of Committee would read before the Congress. Our Sisters promptly
                                prepared the paper and sent it out. We expected the still small voice would not be
                                noticed during the confusion of tongues; but if our paper gets into the records it may
                                meet the eye of the student, suggest thought and answer our purpose. Walter S.

                                department of Home Notes in our dear little Manifesto is a blessed source of union and
                                social communion with gospel relation. We read with great pleasure the monthly reports
                                of different Societies. Owing to sickness in the Church family our meetings have been
                                held, lately, at the different families, and on the last Sunday of Sept. the Society met
                                at the North family. The heavens were opened; many realized the presence of those
                                blessed souls who formerly resided here, and some were seen by our clairvoyant mediums.
                                The spiritual aroma of their presence pervaded the house and was plainly felt. The cycle
                                of a year is about run since we made our advent in this Society, and it has been a year
                                of spiritual blessing. We were told by a beloved Elder and Minister that we would find
                                good Believers here, and it has been verified. We have found those who are saints of
                                God, who are ready, both physically and spiritually, for the heavenly messenger to say,
                                "Come higher up." We have also found those who have put on the whole armor of God and
                                are valiant soldiers in maintaining the testimony of virgin purity, which is the
                                foundation pillar of our faith. Blessed Mother, may we be worthy to commune with thy
                                dear children; and not be a dead weight bringing tribulation on the faithful ones. In a
                                temporal sense we have had a prosperous year. The earlier part was somewhat dry, but
                                crops have averaged fair. To one reared in a wheat section it seems a little strange not
                                to see any wheat growing. We understand the Second family are sowing some this autumn.
                                Of garden vegetables we have had a good supply. Our melons were excellent, but our

                                steady perseverance in the daily routine of harvesting. Potatoes proved a fair yield of
                                extra good quality. The dry weather has left its mark. Every thing seems dry, including
                                the springs. The rains we have had do not seem to show much effect. The weather has been
                                quite warm and showery of late which is helping on late sowed grass and rye, also
                                beneficial to the strawberry plants of which sixteen hundred have been set, and are
                                looking well. We are changing our cow-mangers into stanchions with water in front of the
                                cows. This is an improvement as the cows can be left in the barn all winter. The apple
                                crop is good, and we find a ready market for all we do not want for home use.
                                Temporalities require much attention, but we are striving to live in the spirit of the
                                gospel. There are, no doubt, many in the great Babylon who are wrought on by the spirit
                                to desire a way of escape from the evil days. These are the proper fish for our net. And
                                the Father and Mother spirit is .surely at work seeking for some to worship in spirit
                                and in truth. May many be guided by conviction into the ways of peace and purity. May we
                                work with the spirit in striving to minister the life of the gospel to inquiring souls.

Oct. 1893. We have had a very dry summer, but recently have been blest with
                                several fine rain-falls that have done an immense amount of good. Seeding is about
                                finished in this vicinity. Wheat and oats yielded fairly well. Corn, considering the
                                drought, looks well. Potatoes are very poor compared with the productions of other
                                years, but we shall have enough for use during the winter, which will be a great
                                blessing. We were favored with a visit from Watervliet in August, by Henry Fredrick,
                                Ferdinand Buddinger, Mary McBride, and Eliza Jimason. Then on the 20th of September we
                                were pleased to entertain a company of four Sisters from the same Society. I think if
                                Believers would visit more among each other, the bond of union would grow stronger; and

These has been much sickness in our home this fall and of a malarial type, yet
                                no deaths have occurred. The season in some respects has been an eventful one. The
                                spring was a continuous downpour of rain and at one time it seemed as though we should
                                never get anything planted. Then came a severe drought which injured the crops, and yet
                                as a whole they are quite good. We are now preparing the ground for sowing wheat and
                                shall put in about four hundred acres. Sweet potatoes will all be housed the coming week

                                fairer day. What is life without external beauty? and the calm of inner consciousness,
                                that love is universal and sympathetic. Come ye and "partake of the waters of life

                                said of a man in the long-ago that he went out to sow, and his seed fell on different
                                kinds of ground. He sowed his seed broadcast. But we are putting in ours with the drill;
                                and putting fertilizer with it, to make it bring forth an hundred fold. The sound of the
                                hammer, too is heard in the land. The Office Sisters took up the spirit of improvement
                                and put new partition fences in their chicken yard, and it is a thing of beauty as well
                                as of use. The Trustee too caught the contagion of improvement and is putting a new roof
                                on the smoke-house and family wood shed. The shrill, loud whistle of the engine and
                                heavy thud and rumble of the drill rod tells the passer by that we are going to have a
                                new well at the Office barn. Last year we had one drilled at the Office, and got good

                                of travel has turned towards the World's Fair, carrying thousands to behold the
                                treasures of art, and the wonders of the world, we have stayed at home to provide for
                                returning wants, to tend the sick, and to lay up stores for the coming winter. Here, at
                                this season nature is lovely. Many brilliant colors enrich the landscape. The varied
                                hues of leaves and flowers, tinted with beauty, delight the eyes. Truly this is a
                                beautiful world in which we live! But soon the frosts will come. This might lead us to
                                moralize upon the growth and decay of all sublunary things. All that is bright must
                                fade. We live and grow, and pass away. The aged among us are passing away. But, to come
                                to business matters. It is a blessing to know that we are clear of debt, which is so
                                harrassing to the mind and chilling to the energies, and which causes many sleepless
                                nights. Many acres of wheat land have been sowed; with fertilizer put in; some sweet
                                potatoes dug. Owing to the many hot days of summer, the crop is good. We are cutting
                                corn for stock. New roofs are being put on some buildings, and many necessary repairs
                                taking place. We have the necessaries of life in abundance. Plenty of milk, honey and
                                butter, and we should be thankful. Let us be cheerful and hopeful, and enjoy the good
                                things of life in an innocent manner. The children were delighted with the usual autumn

The beautiful October clays have winged their way hither, and the many hued

                            spirit. One beautiful trait of her character was particular attention and kindness to any
                            one, young or old, whom sh'e thought likely to be slighted in any way, and her charity,
                            tenderness, and sympathy to all, not only in this Society, but outside of it, was unbounded.
                            During all these years of official duty, her life has been one of integrity and uprightness.
                            She was a dear friend and mother to every individual with whom she became acquainted. "None
                            knew her but to love her, Or named her but to praise/' She was able to be about till within
                            a very few days of her departure. We deeply deplore our loss and may we all meet her some
                            day in that "Sweet Bye and Bye." Her funeral was well attended by all in the Society and
                            also our neighbors, and many good and comforting admonitions were delivered by a number of
                            the Brethren and Sisters. Long will her memory linger in many hearts, in and outside our
                            quiet home, and her presence and sweet, gentle influence will be sadly missed by her people,
                            to whom she was attached by the most endearing ties of Christian love.

                            summer time she has heen garnered, We feel her loved presence to-day. Let us pause for a
                            moment, and dwell on this solemn occasion. Our hearts are filled with sorrow to part with
                            one after another of those we love; and also to see the numbers decreasing in our Zion home,
                            that help to sustain the glorious cause. Our Sister has spent her life with Believers, and
                            we trust her reward is to the faithful who possess an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ.
                            We shall miss her in our home circle, and the school-room where her labors were cheerfully
                            given to the young. They are passing away, our dearest friends, and their earthly sufferings
                            are over; we soon must follow, and the summons to that peaceful shore may be near. Are we
                            ready? Only the present moment has actual being. We all have the same privilege to right our
                            wrongs, and there is no victory without a conflict. If life had no crosses, nor trials, we
                            should never be willing to leave it; nor should we grow wiser and better by the polishing
                            process. Earthly things are not perpetual. We think much of this world, but how insecure are
                            its hopes and wishes and lofty ambitions. The surety of a thing, is the enjoyment of it. To
                            be firmly anchored on the true foundation, is the condition of happiness and peace, which
                            will abide forever. Forever. Ah! the word is full of meaning, and associated with an endless
                            future and also with a ceaseless flow of unalloyed delight, to those who are prepared for
                            the inheritance of the just and faithful while here in time. Shaker Station, Conn.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sorrow for sin..." TEIform="index"/>Sorrow for sin...

                            true to-day, as well as when it fell from the Teacher's lips, and his command "follow me,"
                            comes to each one as distinctly as if spoken at Galilee. And when he firmly insists that all
                            must be forsaken, it is simply from pure love to us and the most intense desire that we may
                            be saved from sin and its consequences. It is essential that those who follow him must make
                            it the one great aim and object of life to deny self, and shun all that would destroy the
                            union between Christ and the true disciple. "Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh
                            in the morning;" and its full significance is realized by every one that is born of God.
                            When joy and gladness come, let us accept them with thanksgiving; when sorrow is our
                            portion, bow meekly and trustingly and say, "Thy will, not mine." Let the joy of our lives
                            flow out into other lives. "Rejoice with those that do rejoice, and weep with those that
                            weep." It is the true Christian traveler that is entitled to heavenly joy and gladness ; all
                            who are at peace with God. "Time, time is calling, arise and be living for eternity."
                            Eternity! With what solemnity the word drops into the restless sea of human life. How it
                            broadens and deepens the meaning of all we do here. Oh the joy of living where time and
                            eternity are blended into one; where the life here is linked in an unbroken chain with the
                            life beyond. We rarely meet with a deeper or purer pleasure than that which we feel in
                            receiving the assurance that we are doing good; that our words and deeds are bearing fruit
                            of helpfulness and use. We 'should not forget Thanksgiving. Shaker Station, Ct.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="No permanent blessing..." TEIform="index"/>No permanent blessing...

THE MANIFESTO.
There are persons using
Dobbins' Electric Soap, who
commenced its use in 1869
Would this be the case, if it
were not the purest, best, and
most economical soap made ?
For 23 years it has been imitated by unscrupulous soap
makers. Why? Because it
is best of all, and has an immense sale. Poor articles
are not imitated. Is it probable that wha: a million women say, after a life time of
daily trial, is a mistake ? They
say that they know by actual
test that Dobbins' Electric
Soap is the most economical
soap made. They have had
23 years to try it. You try
