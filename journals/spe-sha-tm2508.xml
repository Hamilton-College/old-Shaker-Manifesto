tell exactly when it will start, for the tipping must vary with the quantity in the
pot. Sometimes it is hard to avoid getting too much and "pouring over;" sometimes it is hard to get enough. Is it not
delightful to be delivered from all this?

                            that He is, it is because their hearts are impure, or are devoted to secular affairs.
                            Without holiness, no man shall see the Lord. Holy means cleansed, conseciated, or set apart
                            for Divine service. The saints and holy ones, both mean the same. These form the kingdom of
                            the God of heaven, which is destined to consume and break in pieces all the kingdoms of this
                            world; and become a great mountain and fill the whole earth: for out of Zion shall go forth
                            the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And the kingdom and greatness of the
                            kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High
                            and they shall take and possess the kingdom forever. The Lord, bread-giver and Ruler of this
                            kingdom, is Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. He said "For their sake,"
                            meaning his disciples, "I sanctify myself." To sanctify, is to cleanse and make holy. He
                            that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all one. "Ye are clean through the word
                            which I have spoken unto you" said Jesus, to his disciples. It was his testimony against the
                            evils of the natural heart. From within, out of the heart of man, proceed evil thoughts,
                            adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, blasphemy,
                            pride, foolishness, false witness. Christ has a word of testimony against all these things,
                            which are part and parcel with the corrupt nature of the flesh ;Matt, xv., 18, also Mark,
                            vii., 21. We can be cleansed from these things only by the word of our testimony, given in
                            the power of God, and by the daily cross against the loves, desires and emotions of the
                            flesh. Mother's gospel teaches us to hate these and put them behind us. The AUGUST, <pb n="172" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 172 THE MANIFESTO. works of the flesh, are among the most deadening,
                            and soul darkening, that creatures can commit. It is the root of all other sins, and is the
                            nourislu r and support of all. Its affects are the most persistent of an}7, and its stains
                            most difficult to wash out. The shame and dishonor which cultivated people feel, in exposing
                            those deeds to the light, is the mark and seal of Divine displeasure thereat, and of their
                            utter condemnation in the judgment, and perpetual banishment from Divine Presence. Be ye
                            clean, be ye pure that bear the vessels of Jehovah. The line of separation betwixt clean and
                            unclean, is drawn in the heart of all true disciples. He that looketh on a woman to lust
                            after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. And this we say, No
                            adulterer, no unclean person can enter the kingdom of God. The New Jerusalem state is clear
                            as crystal and diaphanous, transmitting light in all directions, and the pure in heart shall
                            see that God and the Lamb is the light thereof. Mt. Lebanon, N.

TEIform="persName"/>By Aurelia G. Mace.</byline><p TEIform="p">IN the Arena for March, 1892, Charles Schrodes asks the question, "Where do we find the
                            Christian teachers of any sect, creed or denomination, who dare to preach and live, or even
                            accept this grand Sermon in its entirety?" If he should visit the Shaker Communities, he
                            would find a people who do accept the Sermon on the Mount, as their guide, whose aim is to
                            control their lives by its teachings in every respect. He would find in them some who are
                            true followers of Jesus the Christ, and who have in reality, entered "The Path" and are
                            walking the straight and narrow path that leads to life eternal. During the six hundred
                            years, from Buddha to Jesus, spiritual light was increasing, and Friend Schrodes is right in
                            ranking the teachings of Buddha second to those of Jesus. Both of these great teachers
                            opened to the people a l 'Path, which the vulture's eye hath not seen : The lion's whelps
                            have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it." "Enter the path," said Buddha to
                            those who would be his followers, (among these were some of his nearest relations,) when he
                            returned from the wilderness, enlightened, illumed and all animal passions subdued.
                            "Straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that
                            find it," said Jesus. In all the ages that are passed, how few there have been, who have
                            entered the straight and narrow way and turned neither to the right nor to the left, but
                            kept onward and upward until they have reached the heights for which they started. <pb n="173" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 173 Few, by the discipline brought to bear upon their
                            daily lives, have found their spirits purified, all selfishness eradicated and every evil
                            passion subdued, but that it can be done has been proved by loyal souls. If Friend Schrodes
                            will visit Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., East Canterbury, N. H., even our little home at Sabbathday
                            Lake, Me. or any of the Shaker Societies, he will find people who lift up their voices in
                            denunciation of war and all the evils of the day and also of the night. It is not because
                            their number is so small that they are not heard. The multitude have blinded their own eyes
                            and stopped their own ears. They will not see, they will not hear.

                            weak, and the muscular fibre incapable of sustaining labor and fatigue, then is the cause
                            apparentinsufficient nutrition. In order to ensure a perfect state of health, the digestive
                            organs must be in good condition, for the nourishment of the body is dependent on the
                            healthful action of the stomach. Thorough mastication greatly aids the gastric fluid in the
                            assimilation of the food, which after it passes into the intestines in a state of
                            chylification, is taken up by the lacteals and the thoracic duct, and conveyed in a fluid
                            state to the heart, thence to the lungs, where it becomes oxygenated, and chemically
                            changed, prepared as fit material for constructing the house we live in. The primary
                            elements contained in food, are oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen; the combination of
                            these in different apportionment, makes the variety in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. A
                            certain amount of each is necessary for structural purposes, but nitrogen is essentially one
                            of the flesh forming ingredients ; some carbon is needed for warmth, but an excess of
                            carbonaceous matter clogs the machinery of the human system, and superinduces disease, which
                            in its various manifestations, is the effect of the accumulation of foreign matter, and the
                            effort of nature to rid the body of it. Oxygen and hydrogen also act an important part in
                            carrying forward the great processes of physical construction. The result of chemical
                            analysis proves, that the common idea that animal food being more nutritious than vegetable
                            is false. "It is the stimulating property of meat which has led to the impression .that it
                            is more nourishing than a vegetable diet." There are no nutritive properties in fat; like
                            sugar, and other concentrated articles, it is purely carbonaceous. Persons who for many
                            years have been accustomed to a certain regime, find it difficult to change, especially if
                            they depend on the stimulus of a flesh diet, which they mistake for strength. Children
                            inherit the vitiated appetites of their parents for food as well as alcoholic drink, and
                            meat eating has much to do with the abnormal thirst for liquor. ;iOne of the strongest
                            proofs of the radical impropriety of man's feeding on flesh, must be that which is armed
                            with the fact, that the human body invariably withers and perishes most miserably when
                            constantly confined to it. It cannot be denied that a diet consisting exclusively of fruit
                            and farinaceous matters is favorable to the constitution." That flesh is unsuitable for
                            human food, has been insisted on by philosophers of all ages. Celsus affirms, "that much
                            animal food induces premature old agedecrepitude and disease." The ancient athletes who were
                            fed much on flesh, were said to be the most stupid of men; Diogenes said, when asked the
                            cause, "It is because they are wholly formed of the flesh of swine and oxen." Atilla, the
                            king of the Huns, a cruel and blood-thirsty monarch, devoured large quantities of meat. It
                            was said of him that he never knew the taste of bread, while Appolonius, the pure souled
                            humanitarian, lived on bread and <pb n="175" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. . 175 drank water
                            only. Who can judge how much the diet affected the extremely opposite character of each.
                            Nomadic races need more land to supply them with the fruits of the chase, than do the
                            peasantry of those civilized countries-who gain a livelihood by tilling the soil. Indeed,
                            perfect scientific agriculture would limit a man to a very small tract of land from which to
                            obtain needful food. The laboring classes of almost every nation are obliged to live simply,
                            and their very necessity is their physical salvation, and in them lies the hope of the
                            perpetuity of the race. Americans as a rule are a nation of dyspeptics; meat three times a
                            day, hot biscuit, lard-crusted pie and strong tea destroy the digestive apparatus and create
                            a host of nervous invalids. Helen Campbell, in her charming New England story, "Some
                            Passages in the Practice of Dr. Martha Scarborough," makes the doctor say some plain and
                            caustic things in reference to the health-destroying diet of the descendants of the Pilgrim
                            Fathers. Our ancestors knew something of privation and want, but in this age of reckless
                            extravagance, even among the poorer classes, perverted appetites are pampered, and "sugar,
                            starch and fat" enter largely into the regime of the masses. A highly wrought, nervous
                            temperament which predominates among the Americans, needs nutritive, but not stimulating
                            food, the former is found in fruits, grains and cereals,the best gifts of Mother Earth; yet
                            how sad to think that even these are turned into body and soul ruining beverages, and
                            thousands more of God's rich acres are wasted with the raising of the obnoxious tobacco
                            plant,the nerve shatterer and blood poisoner of the people in this so-called enlightened
                            age. God in his beneficence has made abundant provision for the feeding of all his children
                            without the slaying of animals. We are in the ascending scale of evolution, from grosser to
                            higher forms of life. The time cometh when "He that killeth an ox will be as he that slew a
                            man." The yet unwritten law of the New Earth, shall give to every man a heritage, "He shall
                            sit under his own vine and fig tree," eating the fruits thereof in peace, each living in
                            harmony with his neighbor, while the nucleus of the New Heavens will be formed of the more
                            progressed portions of humanity, who shall gather together in heavenly communism, obeying
                            the leadings of the divine in all things pertaining to physical and spiritual life. "Then
                            shall they not hurt nor destroy in all God's holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of
                            the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea." Isaiah, xi., 9. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                time almost immemorial. It is a very simple percept, a child can understand it, and yet
                                it is one of the most important, all-coinprehending precepts that was ever uttered. If
                                it had always been obeyed, no war would ever have been possible, no persecution for
                                religion's sake, or miv other sake, would ever have been perpetrated on the earth, no
                                moneyed aristocracy would ever have ground the faces of the poor, nor sent hundreds and
                                thousands of poverty-stricken wretches out of the world, through the ghastly portals of
                                suicide. Peace and plenty, comfort and health would have long since brooded in silence
                                over the world, and the voice of sorrow, contention and strife been hushed forever. The
                                good and righteous spirit of man, would have impressed the universal current of thought,
                                and the terrible cyclone and drouth, famine and plague would never have been. The
                                pinching economies of the poor by which they eke out a mere existence and which give no
                                opportunity for higher aims and satisfactions, would have never blasted the fate of the
                                masses. Slums, charities, infirmaries would never have been needed, and would never have
                                existed. No animal would ever have had to be sacrificed to the voluptuous gluttony of
                                man. Je-ilousy, revenge, cruelty and extortion would never have been hoard of. But alas
                                ! We have heard this little precept sounded in our ears, iterated and reiterated, almost
                                ever since man existed on the earth, and it is continually repeated day after day up to
                                ttr.s very moment, and yet how very lew hear it and how infinitely fewer, heed it. How
                                is it that we are so unmindful of it, when we see misery, squalor, sickness, and suicide
                                on every hand? It would seem we are almost insane, when we must know there is a safe and
                                salutary remedy, when we know that we might see smiling contentment on every side and
                                happiness among all creatures, those below, as well as on, and above our own plane. A
                                little serious inner thoughtfulness and meditation every morning, would place every
                                individual in a mood of mind which would enable him or her, to so regulate their conduct
                                as to obey that little precept, and if every one would avail himself of this facility
                                and be governed by the suggestions of conscience in the matter, the present status of
                                horror brooding over the earth, would be followed by the immediate advent of the long
                                looked for Millennium. O! that the whole earth would hearken to the voice of the "Son of
                                man" and come to judgment on the merits of this one little precept. The whole face of
                                nature and of grace would undergo a change so wonderful, that all pres- <pb n="177" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MAN (FES TO. 177 ent conditions of society would be instantly
                                metamorphosed and struck with joyful wonder and praise and thanksgiving to God. In view
                                of such magnificent and astounding results, you will of course want to know what can be
                                the form and character of this wonderful precept ? Here it is "Thou shalt love thy
                                neighbor as thyself." Is that hard to understand? is it unreasonable? is it impractical?
                                is it unjust? By no means. It is not so hard, or half so difficult as a contrary policy,
                                and yet how very slow we are in adopting it into our theory and translating the theory
                                into our practical life. O what a strange medley of contradictions man is! Do let us for
                                Heaven's sake, turn about and revolutionize this world of ours, why not make of it a

                                containing matters of vast importance to those of obscure vision. A medium of
                                unquestioned integrity who lives in our neighborhood, read Brother Reed's letter at my
                                solicitation, and although somewhat prejudiced against the Shakers, consented to try for
                                a view of the Florida enterprise with an eye single, so to speak, to the spiritual side
                                of the work. He passed down the east side of Florida for a distance, thence inland to
                                the place of the temporal operations of the colony in Osceola Co. His view of the
                                plantation was brief. Immediately a cloudy pillar, glistening and pure white was
                                presented to his view. Its base rested in the center of the colony's possessions. He was
                                impressed that it reached from earth to heaven. He says it was heavenly and beyond his
                                powers of true description. So far as I know no one has anything against the above
                                medium whose name is Henry Mason. He says this letter contains no false impressions so

                            MANIFESTO. The standard works define charity as love, liberality. Shakespeare charity is,
                            "Gently to hear, kindly to judge." The faithful teacher and minister of Christ's doctrine,
                            Paul, says, "Charity suffereth long and is kind." In no manner, we think could a truth be
                            placed more plainly and forcibly. "Charity suffereth,"not alone in enduring great trouble
                            and hardship, but by its power the unkind word, the frowning look, or despicable act, can be
                            divinely borne. All the "thousand littlenessess," which make up the sum total of existence,
                            it suffers, and suffers "long." "Charity suffereth long, and is kind." In the last three
                            words is found the key-note of charity; strike this and others will follow, to form a
                            beautiful harmony. For the frown it gives an answering smile, for unkind words a forgiving
                            reply, for those around us always a lenient spirit, being slow to judge evil, and quick to
                            throw its mantle over sin. Charity and love are one and inseparable. Where charity finds an
                            abode, love will soon follow. How can we repeat the Savior's divinely given prayer, "Forgive
                            us our debts, as we forgive our debtors," and harbor unforgiving thoughts for those around
                            us. We would not wish to judge unkindly were our own to hi weighed by the same measure, yet
                            the rule is applicable. Many miracles have been performed, and martyrs bravely met death.,
                            by the strong power of faith. By hope, others have borne privations and afflictions, to the
                            laying down of their lives, cheerfully. But we are told, that great r than faith and hope,
                            is charity, for by it we may suffer and forgive. Let us then, diligently search for this
                            priceless jewelcharity, remembering that without it we are nothing, and our faith, void ;
                            but with it we are everything well armored to fight for the Lord.

TEIform="persName"/>By Lucy S. Bowers.</byline><p TEIform="p">ILL temper is one of the worst passions of the human mind even in its mildest form, and when
                            fully and freely exercised becomes disgraceful and despicable in the extreme. In this
                            breathing and beautiful world, filled as it were, with the presence of the Deity, and
                            fragrant with incense from unnumbered altars of praise, it is almost impossible to conceive
                            how an element so painful and base as this, could find a place even for a moment of time. To
                            be angry in any degree is to sin. The command is, "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath."
                            Following are a few quotations from authors of past and present time, who have denounced in
                            meaning terms the evils of ill temper. If any of them were guilty subjects, their fault
                            condemned and confessed became at least says, <pb n="179" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFES TO. 179
                            half redressed. We can all agree in the truth of their sayings, learn the lessons which they
                            present, and exercise them practically upon our own lives. It was Cumberland who, comparing
                            ill temper, put it in the superlative degree, he said, "Of all bad things by which mankind
                            are curst." Their own bad tempers surely are the worst." Webster felt likewise, when he
                            wrote, "There is not in nature A thing that makes man so deformed, so beastly As doth
                            intemperate anger." Dean Swift said,"-Our passions are like convulsion fits, which make us
                            stronger for the time, but leave us weaker forever afterward." Marcus Antonius expressed the
                            same sentiment long ago in the following,"Consider how much more you often suffer from your
                            anger and grief than from those very things for which you are angry and grieved." "If anger
                            proceeds from a great cause," said Jeremy Taylor, "it turns to fury; if from a small cause,
                            it is peevishness, and so is either terrible or ridiculous." Clarendon likens angry and
                            choleric persons to thunder and lightning, ungrateful and unsociable, being in themselves
                            all storm and tempest ; but quiet and easy natures are like fair weather, welcome to all.
                            Still another condemnation appears in the words of Johnson who said, "The round of a
                            passionate man's life is in contracting debts in his passion which his virtues oblige him to
                            pay. He spends his time in outrage and acknowledgment, injury and reparation." "An angry man
                            is again angry with himself when he returns to reason," says Publius Syrus. This is true
                            with all who care for reputation, morals or character; who care for the angelic development
                            of their souls ; it is the spirit of conviction and repentance that is able to correct all
                            the wrongs of human life. Anger blinds the moral vision, numbs every sense of propriety, and
                            disgraces the individual over whom it gains control. It is as desperate as a furious and
                            frightened horse which, when under way, still plunges along till its force is spent and pain
                            and suffering become a consequence. Cotton likened it to "intoxication, which like that of
                            grape, shows us to others, but hides us from ourselves, and we injure our own cause in the
                            opinion of others, when we too passionately and eagerly defend it." It is impossible that
                            any of enlightened mind or conscientious principle should willfully or willingly allow
                            themselves indulgence in such wanton ways, or at any time so far to forget themselves as to
                            be easily ignited into a flame of feeling by offences or circumstances be they ever so
                            annoying ; or in any way to approve it; for it is a terrible enemy to gentle peace and
                            happiness. Neither power, place nor condition fortify the soul against the upheavals of the
                            lower animal nature; the superior faculties in man, divinely <pb n="180" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 180 THE
                            MANIFESTO. inspired, must dominate and overcome in every state and stage of his existence,
                            otherwise there is no salvation. The great and the wise; artists, poets and even musicians
                            whose souls it would seem must live in the realm of ceaseless harmony have given themselves
                            up to these abnormal feelings, and many becoming victims to their deadly discharges have
                            fallen to rise no more. It is dreadful to contemplate but it is true that on the throne and
                            in high places it has burned like the fiercest fire, and found the most fuel. It has opened
                            many a gloomy pit with its murderous hand when in a moment of frenzied passion thousands
                            have been condemned to die, often guiltless and without trial. It is the despoiler of home
                            loves, the destroyer of friendships, and is often a fatal injury to the health of those who
                            yield to its influence. Whoever finds ill temper among his spiritual foes, should seek
                            earnestly and sincerely to be filled with the power of God's love, which is the germ of
                            moral excellence; the fullness and completeness of all the excellence of God, and is able to
                            help us to rise above the imperfections to which we are all more or less subject. Our
                            greatest heroic aim should be to control and conquer, not nations and tribes and persons,
                            but ourselves. Said the ancient Dhamiuapoda, "If one man conquer in battl a thousand tim &gt;s
                            a thousand men, and if another conquer himself ; he is the greatest conqueror." Conquer
                            thyself! till thou hast done that, thou art a slave in bondage more than that realized under
                            unjust despotic law. It is wise to be moderate. "Moderation is the silken string running
                            through the pearl chain of all virtues." It is virtuous to be forgiving, "Never does a human

                            Christian to be patient. "How poor are they who have not patience," who hath it not is out
                            of possession of his soul. All the words of Jesus teach self-denial, and the lives of all
                            good men and women testify to the virtue of an humble spirit and a well governed mind. Mt.

                            unhappiness, unrest and dissatisfaction than envy. Like a rank weed, which springs up and
                            destroys the growth of valuable plants, so is this evil, if left to become deeply rooted in
                            the heart; it saps the life of those noble virtues that should adorn the Christian
                            character. Envy is an outgrowth of selfishness, and springs from the love destroying
                            elements of pride, deceit and covetousness. Where one of these evils <pb n="181" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>

                            perceptions of the soul to such an extent, that it observes the good and true in others,
                            only to repine, and sorrows at their prosperity and success. One wisely said, "Base envy
                            withers at another's joy, and hates the excellence it cannot reach." What a true expression
                            this is of the condition of a selfish, envious heart. The proud and arrogant man sees
                            another who possesses a stronger intellect, greater abilities in art, science and
                            literature, or is the owner of larger wealth, or who has more advantages in many ways than
                            himself, the fires of envy are kindled, and burn with an almost quenchless flame, consuming
                            divine qualities of love and generosity that belong to a brotherhood of peace and good-will.
                            All have not equal capacities; all could not reach the perfection of the skilled architect,
                            sculptor, artist or musician, yet each one fills a niche in the structure of life; each one
                            is important in the duties that he should fulfill; therefore we should be content with the
                            small gift that is ours, nor let the arrows of envy wound the hearts of those who do better
                            and greater things than we are capable of doing. We have but to read history, to know that
                            this loathsome evil has, in ages gone by, ruled the hearts of mankind, and caused largely
                            the strife, dissension and confusion among them. Ruler against ruler, and nation against
                            nation, have been impelled by this inward foe to war with one another, causing desolation
                            and destruction where beauty and abundance once reigned. Are not these lessons applicable to
                            the present time ? Was it not envy that prompted Joseph's brethren to cast him into a pit in
                            the wilderness, and then sell him to the Egyptians, that they might see no more of him ? It
                            was the same evil motive that controlled the hearts of the Jews and stirred them to hatred
                            against Jesus because of his goodness and humility, and envy that was consummated in his
                            crucifixion. Many promulgators of the truth, philosophers and scientists have been condemned
                            to torture and death, by those who were actuated by this vice. The generous, noble,
                            unselfish heart untainted by envy and its accompanying evils, is ever rejoicing in the
                            attainments and excellencies of others, is happier when a friend wins than when he fails,
                            and is always content with his position though humble. That spiritual man Prof. Henry
                            Drummond, once wrote : "Only one thing, truly, need the Christian envy,the large, rich,
                            generous soul which envieth not." One seeking to buildup rather than pull down the good
                            character of others, for the spirit that undermines, is the most treacherous form of this
                            despicable evil. How much better and happier mortals would be, if they would work by the
                            rule of love which "envieth not," which thinketh no evil, and lives and toils for the good
                            of all. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><pb n="182" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="editorial" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Be not deceived" TEIform="index"/>BE NOT DECEIVED. </head><p TEIform="p">IT is highly necessary for every one who wishes to accomplish any kind of work, either mental
                            or fysical, to be thuroly assured that they hav not been deceivd by false representations or
                            by the following of a shadow to their own ruin. When the Apostl Peter admonisht his brethren
                            to "be ready always to giv an answer to every man that asketh a reason of the hope that is
                            in you," he evidently was quite wel assured of their ability to meet the demand. That he had
                            no hesitancy in giving this advice is evident from his own testimony. "Blessed be God who
                            hath begotten us unto a lively hope, to an inheritance incorruptibl and that fadeth not
                            away." Such an assurance was no matter of guess work, but wel understood. Very few bodies of
                            pepl would be likely to form thernselvs into societies without being certain to sum extent
                            that the combination would prove to be advantageous to the individual as wel as to the body
                            as a whole. In the acceptance of these religious dogmas, with the vared theological views
                            that ar to form the basis of this new eommonvvelth or society, a careful analysis is made of
                            sum Scripture texts, which no dout, appear reasonabl as wel as Scriptural, and upon which
                            they must act in order to obtain the anticipated results. That there ar a large number of
                            religious sects, is very natural, as there ar a large number of pepl from whom to form these
                            religious bodies. If the forms and ceremonies, or the general belief of one party ar
                            especially singular or even peculiar, it is no argument against them, and the next in order
                            may stand in a corresponding position so soon as they becum actors, and the first party
                            becum the ones to criticize. The Apostl was not slow to lern this fact, when he went among
                            either the Jews or the Greeks. Their religious belief was old and the Christian order became
                            to the Jews a sad stumbling block, which belief they would not accept. God had calld them
                            his sons and for hundreds of years had manifested himself to them, and it was not strange
                            that they should stumbl on the appearance of the Galilean whose very simplicity of dress and
                            preaching they were ready to condemn. When the intellectual and worldly-wise Greeks were
                            confronted by the Christians, they at once turnd as from a system of foolishness and gave an
                            off hand dismissal to the whole affair. By the mass of mankind the utterance of disbelief or
                            condemnation may be an easy matter as it requires neither education nor even common sense,

                            no beneficial quality to the self-constituted judges, and has no force to harm those who ar
                            accused. There ar men in the world who ar calld the one idea men. Their church is the only
                            church, and without its pale is everlasting death. Their God is the only true God, and they
                            worship him on the murderous field of battle; in the accumulation of mammon for individual
                            selfishness and in the mazes of sensuality. They hav accepted a passage of Scripture which
                            confirms them that it has redeeming features. Any light thrown upon this passage except from
                            their own tallow candle, is at once severely ignored. Fortunately the privileges of a free
                            cuntry ar open to all and we ar at liberty to accept or reject any plan that may be
                            presented to us. In our own case we think we ar consistent followers of our accepted guide,
                            the Lord, Jesus Christ. His mission was in the interest of a spiritual relation, and his
                            discipls were to deny themselvs of all ungodliness and every worldly lust. All the selfish
                            relations of the worldly order were held in their legitimate place, while the exam pi and
                            the testimony of Jesus and his discipls carried them into a higher sphere and into a
                            spiritual element. It is a pseudo Christianity that has thru sofistry and selfishness most
                            thuroly amalgamated the gospel truth with pagan filosofy, and sown it broadcast thru the
                            world. Religious communism has its activ, life principl in the advent of the carpenter's
                            son, the man of Galilee, the divine Teacher, the son of God. Direct from him we hav this
                            remark, "The son of man hath not where to lay his head." He had no selfish home and no
                            private interest in any property, and yet no one for a moment would suppose that he was
                            deprivd of his food, or a suitable place for rest at night. Jesus and the twelve discipls
                            formd the first Christian community in which their lives and all that they possest was
                            consecrated to God. The mine and thine system of selfishness has arisen at a later date, and
                            largely obscured the light and truth of the testimony of Jesus. Peter's declaration that was
                            evidently spoken under the full responsibility of the cross of Christ opens to us the order
                            which had been establisht for the evangelizing work,"Behold, we hav forsaken all to follow
                            thee." It was not a special matter of faith, but an active work ; not a fractional surrender
                            of a few things, but it was to forsake all. Peter was a married man, and the narrator is so
                            explicit as to state that Peter's wife's mother was sick, and this relation warrants the
                            Christian in saying that the Apostls were married men, and that it was a feature of the <pb n="184" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 184 THE MANIFESTO. Christian church. However, Peter's inventory of
                            earthly treasures may possibly have been as follows ;A faithful, loving wife ; A cmfort;ibl
                            huuse by the sea shore ; Two wel furnisht boats on the sea of Galilee ; some excellent
                            fishing nets and a good stock of provisions. Now the question arises,Did Peter mean what he
                            said or was he tinctured with the spirit of Ananias ? Matthew tells us that Peter left his
                            nets to follow Jesus, and that would imply that he also left his boats ; but Peter more to
                            the point, has said, "Behold, we have forsaken all. What does Peter's inventory of all that
                            he possest include? That he forsook the whole is agieeabl to his statement. Jesus had at an
                            earlier date informd his discipls that if they would follow him in the regeneration, they
                            must forsake all the relations of the old Adamic order and count only those as Brethren and
                            Sisters who gave their lives "to do the wil of God," and Paul emphasizes this by ading, "Put
                            ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts
                            thereof." It must be a very unobservant mind that can project a statement so at variance
                            with fact as the following;"The Shakers can find no authority for their system of Community
                            life." Henry Ward Beecher once remarked, that a person would see things corresponding to the
                            color of his glasses, and certainly sum glasses must be very defective when everything
                            becums so sadly distorted as to confuse all history, all Biblical authority and all common
                            sense. As witnesses for the truth it wil be wel for us as Believers, to live in such a
                            manner that every one may "show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the
                            Lord."</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.

                                night shall not cease." This promise given so long ago, still remains fulfilled in the
                                beautiful variety of our temperate zone, for which we are ever grateful. The strawberry
                                season with its abundant and delicious harvest has passed too quickly; but the heavily
                                laden currant bushes, the dlasters of ripening raspberries and well grown blackberries
                                and dew-beiries, show the regular progression of summer. Cherries are plentiful and of
                                such a variety that the season lasts about six weeks. It is said "He who plants a tree
                                plants a hope." This being so we can readily see the hopes which have actuated the
                                inmates of our home to provide so bountifully for their posterity; these hopes never
                                wane, for we were delighted in walking about in the fruit orchards to find no vacant
                                places. Noticing in particular so many young and thrifty peach trees, we learned that
                                Br. James Glass had set out one hundred and twenty from pits planted last Autumn. Our

                                education gives us who are young, advantages for which we are deeply grateful. On the
                                20th of June a company of twenty,including horses and carriagesenjoyed a pleasant day at
                                Lake Queechy. Selecting one of the longest days with "not a ripple on the wave nor a

                                The rains are proving beneficial to fruit and vegetables and with a combination of

                                friends at Watervliet, N. Y. From them we learn that there is a growing interest among
                                young people at that place, in the maintenance of gospel life and principles. Public
                                services have been open for several weeks. Although there seems to be a spiritual
                                dearth, inside as well as outside of our Order, yet we feel assured tha^ the spirit is
                                working among us to awaken and redeem; there is a silent, but powerful concentration of
                                forces, a baptism that will soon come down upon us and prepare us for the great work of
                                the coming time. We must live in the spirit if we would be fruitful in righteousness,
                                and keep our hearts ever open to receive that divine inspiration, which always comes to
                                those who are aspiring for higher and better conditions of life. We have bright hopes
                                for the future, and are working patiently and fearlessly in the cause of virgin purity,
                                not for the few, but for the many whom the spirit will in due time prepare for the great

                                self-denial must have had a tendency to enrich our minds with a goodly development of
                                solidity and intelligence of a Christ-like type, and it is our duty to utilize these
                                powers for the best good of humanity. It would seem to be a senseless assertion to
                                declare that certain cherished ideas were absolute and unchangeable, for nothing is so
                                except truth, substantiated by personal experience and the evolutions oi' nature.
                                Turning the reflector of memory backward, we see that by the removal of old
                                conventionalities and useless ceremonies, there has been wrought out larger human
                                qualities that enrich and brighten Christian life. In every progressive movement are
                                experiences both bitter and sweet, teaching lessons of truth which blossom into deeds of
                                righteousness inasmuch as the aim is to benefit mankind. We are pleased to add to the
                                record of our Society history, the pleasant visit we have enjoyed with Sisters Maria

The Apostle says, "Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, and be ye

                                almost superfluous to say we have an abundance of the fruits of the earth. 'Our peace is
                                like a river, and our fountain of blessing full and runningover;'' individual happiness

                                I had taken as much pains in writing my last home notes as in this, the type would not
                                have made me say, "snug days and wintry ways," instead of "sunny days and windy ways,"
                                as the manuscript was intended to read. But "the most uukindest cut of all," is the
                                "t'orceful dreams," whatever they are; even the critics declare they can not imagine.
                                But "fearful dreams" anybody can uuderstand, having had them when living a sinful life;
                                but a "forceful dream "is surely a new invtntion.

                            always denote the noble man or woman. True courtesy should not be used by us merely as a
                            surface-wash to be put on when entertaining special friends, but it should be universally
                            given; as the manners of persons are the criterion by which the moral and religious life may

                            so enrich life and beautify the Christian man or woman. A violation of the law of kindness

                            Association, and our hearts went out in sympathy and blessing to all workers in the Cause,
                            therefore it was a pleasing and interesting occurrence when at our doors appeared a modest
                            and intelligent young woman bearing a book for petitions, in which she solicited the names
                            of all who were interested in the movement, and of suitable age to register in favor of
                            Woman's Suffrage. She had been commissioned to this work by the Rev. Theodore Harris, Pastor
                            of the Congregational Church of New Lebanon, who in visiting our homes became much
                            interested in our religious views and practical reforms, especially in vegetarianism to
                            which he became a convert, and very deeply was he impressed with our system of social and
                            industrial economy, based <pb n="193" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 193 upon the recognition of
                            the equality of the sexes, and resulting in the practical solution of many of the knotty
                            problems of the day. He therefore rightly believed that although our Societies would on no
                            account give votes for, or become connected with any political party, we would gladly avail
                            ourselves of the Right of Petition in giving support to any cause for the furtherance of
                            liberty, justice and truth. Therefore, although it was the busy season of house cleaning and
                            seed sowing, appreciating the worth in possession among ourselves as an Order of that which
                            this movement would eventually secure for humanity at large, both Brethren and Sisters
                            gladly enrolled their names among the petitioners, believing that when attained, Woman's
                            Suffrage will be a prime factor in securing her freedom from all man made restrictions,
                            giving her an equal voice with him concerning all the laws by which she is governed. Every
                            true and intelligent woman will give her strength in this direction as a means to an endthat
                            end the uplifting not only of woman, but of man. Together they have been degraded, together
                            they must rise. Of little moment is civil liberty compared to that love of chastity which
                            inheres in the nature of every true woman. To those who realize the debasement and thraldom
                            to sensual passions to which man and woman alike are bound, no boon will be so highly prized
                            as that which will be granted to woman through correct civil laws; rights of her being, body
                            and soul! Thus will she be freed from that galling slavery which more than anything else
                            retards the progress of the race. When the ballot is hers, woman will be swift to legislate
                            to the effect that man shall be obliged to conform to the same moral standard as herself.
                            Purification of the social life of the sexes is of the greatest importance for two reason:
                            first, that their present corrupt state is the primal cause of all sin and misery, for thus
                            the very fountains of existence are poisoned, entailing diseased conditions of body and mind
                            upon future generations. Second, that in this perversion lies not only the cause of every
                            other evilby the creation of false appetites and unjust systems in other departments of
                            life, but the dissipation of those vital forces which give energy, strength of will, and the
                            power of self-denial, without which no reform can be accomplished in the individual or the
                            community. As a matter of science and physiology it is well understood that by the
                            conservation of these life forces, those higher faculties of mind and soul are developed
                            through which the divine spirit of truth can operate for the redemption of the race. Mt.
