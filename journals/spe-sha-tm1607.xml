                            Blinn. Ebenezer Cooley saw in vision, a woman whose -appearance was glorious and her face
                            shone as bright as the sun. In the beginning of the year 1781, he visited the Church at
                            Watervliet, N. Y. and when he saw Mother Ann, he knew her to be the same woman whom he had
                            seen in a ywsion. Mother Ann spoke to him and said " I have seen you in vision. You must go
                            forth and preach the gospel. You ought to have been prepared before this time. " This
                            strengthened his faith, and after having confessed his sins, and been instructed what to do
                            to be saved, he was filled with the h�ly spirit, and became a powerful^ preacher of the
                            gospel of Christ. Under his ministration many were converted to the faith. Ebenezer Cooley
                            and Israel Chauncey were the first missionaries from the Society of New Lebanon that
                            preached the gospel in the state of New Hampshire. Their first visit was in Sept. 1782, and
                            their first meeting was held in the Free Baptist Church, at Loudon Center, N. H. Ebenezer
                            became a member of the Society at New Lebanon ^and for several years officiated as tke
                            senior Elder in the novitiate order. Hezekiah Hammond, of New Lebanon was much opposed to
                            the testimony of the gospel and was not willing that<pb n="146" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> any of his family
                            should go and see the Believers. Subsequently inspired by a visionary dream he resolved to
                            go and see Mother Ann and the Elders for himself. In June, 1780, he went to Watervliet, N.
                            Y. and remained over the Sabbath. On Monday he sent tor his horse, and made arrangements to
                            return to his home. Father William Lee, spoke to Hezekiah about the sin of unbeliel, but
                            without effect. Mother Ann then spoke to him about his receiving the word of God, and that
                            he should give it his attention. Hezekiah stood in silence for a short time and then said,
                            "The hand of the Lord is upon me. I cannot go home, at present. Accepting the faith he made
                            an honest confession of his sins to God, and then returned to his home to consummate the
                            work which God had placed in his soul. Becoming established in the faith, he gathered his
                            whole family to the gospel, and remained faithful unto death. Hezekiah was a preacher of the
                            word of God and on this account was dreaded by the enemies of the cross of Christ. He was
                            brought before the commissioners in Albany, in 1780, and being found a fearless preacher of
                            the Divine Spirit, he was charged with being an enemy to the country, and with others
                            committed to prison. In Aug. 1783, Mother Ann and the Elders called at the home of Hezekiah,
                            in the town of New Lebanon, N. Y., and made a visit of a few hours. Israel Chauncy, of New
                            Lebanon, visited Mother Ann and the Elders at Watervliet, N. Y. in June 1780. While he was
                            absent, his wife, Elizabeth, had a remarkable vision, during which she saw Mother Ann and
                            the Elders at Watervliet, and Israel was with them in the worship of God. Israel appeared to
                            be in great tribulation, and putting up his hands, she heard him say, " Pray for me. Forgive
                            me, for thou knowest all the sins that I have committed from my youth up to this day. " She
                            then heard, in vision, Mother and the Elders say,�'* Thy sins are gone, open beforehand to
                            judgment. " Mother Ann then took Elizabeth by the hand and immediately the vision ceased,
                            and she found herself in her own house. When Israel returned, the vision was related to him.
                            "It is a true vision of God, " said he. "and these things were shown to you as plainly as
                            though you had been there, in person." On hearing his report the whole family were tilled
                            with the spirit of God. and with great joy. A few days after this, Israel and Elizabeth made
                            a visit to the Church, and Mother Ann met them at the door. Elizabeth knew her to be the
                            same woman that she had seen in vision. On the second night, after their arrival they
                            enjoyed a beautiful meeting. Israel and Elizabeth embraced the faith and entered the gospel
                            work by a full confession of all sin. At the time of their departure, Mother Ann said to
                            them. "Now you must go home and set your house in order, for there will be great numbers of
                            people who will soon come to visit you. You have begun to bear for other souls, and you must
                            never fail." Israel gave himself wholly to the work of God and was a faithful minister of
                            the gospel of glad tidings.<pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>Nathan and Hannah Goodrich, made a visit to
                            Watervliet, in June, 1780, to see Mother Ann and the Elders. They arrived at the place while
                            the family were engaged in their religious service. Some one was delivering an exhortation
                            and urging the necessity of a living, practical righteousness. The first words that they
                            heard, were,� "Strip off your pride and shake off the abominations of your heart. " Nathan
                            and Hannah entered the meeting and were convinced with what they saw and heard that it was
                            God's work, and that these people were his living witnesses. Before the close of their
                            visit, both accepted the faith and lived to become earnest .and able advocates of the cross
                            of Christ. Esther Brackett visited Mother Ann and the Elders while they were imprisoned at
                            Albany. While engaged in conversation, Mother Ann said to her,�" You must be born again or
                            you cannot be saved from sin. He that is born of God cannot commit sin. You must become as a
                            little child. ' " The signs spoken of by Christ, follow them that believe. They shall speak
                            with new tongues ; the sick are healed, and the spirit of God is made known by divers
                            operations. Search ihe Scriptures, and labor to get an understanding of them. God is
                            merciful and will give to them that ask. I have suffered many things for my faith, and you
                            must do the same, if you would be saved." John Demming of Hancock, Mass. visited the Church
                            at Watervliet in June, 1780. He accepted the faith and promised to obey the gospel
                            testimony. He then informed Mother Ann that he was poor and in debt, and knew of no way to
                            pay his creditors. Some of his family had been sick and the physician's bill was quite
                            large. Mother Ann said to him. ''If you are faithful to obey the gospel, God will bless you
                            and make you prosperous. Returu to your home, put your hands at work and your heart to God.
                            Learn your family to be industrious and you will be able to pay your debts, and none of your
                            creditors will trouble you. " '� Instead of applying to physicians, take faith in the power
                            of God, and your family will be healed." Among many other things Mother gave him this
                            advice,�You must never cut your nails, nor trim your beard, nor scour your buckles, nor do
                            any such thing on the Sabbath, unless in case of great necessity. " John accepted the
                            admonition and went home in obedience, and found all the promises fulfilled in a remarkable
                            manner. In a short time he was able to pay all his debts : his physician's bills grew less
                            and a general prosperity attended him. Hannah Siiapley, of New Lebanon, visited Mother Ann
                            and the Elders, in June, 1780. Hannah was convicted of sin and received faith in the
                            testimony She confessed to Mother Ann that she had not lived to the light that she had
                            received. Mother then said to her. "You must begin at the top twigs and crop them off, and
                            continue the work until you come to the root, and then you must dig that up, that there may
                            never be a future growth. " Hannah carefully and faithfully regarded the word of God that
                            was spoken to her. She accepted the faith, and the cross of Christ.<pb n="148" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> Asa
                            Allen made a visit to see Mother Ann and the Elders while they were at Stafford, in Oct,
                            1782. He had heard many strange reports about the people and concluded to see and heai and
                            judge for himself. After a short visit he returned home. The next day he went again. As the
                            door was open he saw the Believers rise from the table and then kneel in thankfulness to God
                            for his mercies. Soon after this, Mother spoke to Asa. "We are of that Community that
                            worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Jesus Christ,Jand have no confidence in the flesh."
                            �'We can testify to all souls that God has laid a sure foundation of an everlasting Kingdom
                            of righteousness and peace, which can never be moved nor shaken. He thatiis to rule therein
                            is Christ, and of the increase of his government and kingdom there shall be no end." Asa
                            became convinced that he had heard the word of God, and was desirous to find a relation to
                            the Kingdom of Christ. The Eldersjthen answered him #in these words. " The first offering
                            that God accepts is a true confession of all sin, and then they must be forsaken forever. "
                            Asa accepted the^gift^and set out to obey the gospel. Mother Ann then said to him. '' Those
                            who through faith and obedience find a just relation to Christ, thus revealed, will of all
                            souls, be the most blessed. I see it. ;teT know it. God will pour his blessing upoa them."
                            Samuel Fitch was one of the first persons that visited Mother Ann and the Elders at
                            Watervliet, N. Y. He arrived at evening and tarried over night. Mother Ann related to him
                            the^manner in which the spirit of God wrought upon her, in the first of her faith, and of
                            the remarkable dealings and manifestations of God to her, from time to time. " I saw by
                            revelation the loss of all mankind, not only the present generation, but those of past ages.
                            I saw them clothed in blackness and darkness. I have seen souls in the regions of darkness,
                            in agony and distress. I have seen the dead rise and come to judgment, and receive the
                            gospel, and travel in the regeneration." Samuel was convinced that Mother and the Elders had
                            the power and the revelation of- God. He confessed his sins and became an active and zealous
                            laborer in the vineyard of Christ. He visited Mother Ann at the time she was imprisoned at
                            Poughkeepsie, and manifested great solicitude for the safety and protection of Believers.
                            While on their extended missionary tour to the Eastern states in 1783, Mother Ann and the
                            Elders visited Samuel at his own home in Richmond, Mass, on the twenty-fourth of July and
                            remained there several days; A great many people called to see the Believers at this place,
                            and fortunately nothing serious occurred to disturb them. A ?ew days after this, however,
                            .while the Elders were present, a furious mob threatened to break into the house, but were
                            prevented by Samuel and other Brethren. A warrant was obtained and Samuel with others of the
                            Believers were appreicnded and committed to Barrington ail to be tried by the County Court.
                            The result of this s&amp;cond trial has not jeen left on record, but we may well suppose
                            that like many others of a simiar kind, it ended in a farce.

                            name, and it shall be given you." Christ. Hereby we are taught the proper condition in which
                            to be, in order to receive the answer to our prayers, (viz.) To abide in Christ! However,
                            the first requisite is to come into Christ; as no soul can abide where it hath not arrived.
                            "If any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature." Thus it ia those who have become new
                            creatures in Christ, who may look for the answer of their prayers ! The apostle James,
                            instructing those who were doubtless complaining of a lack in answer to prayers said "Ye ask
                            and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts''�unholy
                            desires ! To become a new creature in Christ, is to die to all the elements of that life
                            which is sinful, that which constitutes the old creature ! It is accomplished by confessing
                            to God, in the presence o{ living witnesses, who are also purified by confession, all sins
                            against the laws of God, manifest to the soul.; then, to forsake sin by bearing a full cross
                            against all worldly loves, lusts, and affections, live a clean, pure, virgin life, separate
                            from the world and all its sinful pleasures. Souls who thus live are harmoniously united to
                            the fountain of blessings from which they would draw by prayer ; their consecrated lives of
                            time, talents, services, treasure and strength to a godly use, are the treasures that
                            purchase heavenly blessings. Such souls desire pot anything of their own wills, but the will
                            of our heavenly Father and Mother,�God, consequently, their prayers are for the
                            accomplishment of God's purposes. When souls pray to God they should consider whether the
                            answer to their prayers is to accomplish some selfish purpose, or to do God's will, for the
                            good of humanity ; if the latter they are in the line of blessings for the answer of prayer.
                            In all ages of human experience., God has had some instrumentalities of the human family as
                            witnesses of His goodness and love to man, and examples of the answers to prayer, and as
                            revealers of His will and purposes. These have invariably been a class of self-denying,
                            consecrated souls, who, by the inspirations of the angelic hosts, have been ministered unto
                            as the fruit of their prayers ; and who have been teachable enough to obey this instruction
                            ; they have been, through their earthly pilgrimage, generally much secluded from the
                            commotions of worldly life! The Day�Dispensation of Christ's second appearing, is the "last
                            day"� dispensation of God's grace to man ! It is the period so often mentioned in Scripture
                            as "The last days" by prophetic declaration ; it includes, and conserves the baptismal
                            wisdom and power for development, salvation and ransom for man from all the errors and sins
                            of humanity that have been revealed in former dispensations, and ultimating in a full
                            present salvation and final redemption from sinful nature and its desires. It doth not
                            confine its labors to the threshold of time, but extends through eternal ages, in an
                            increasing travel of soul from grace to grace, and glory to<pb n="150" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>glory, until
                            the character of redeemed man is formed an entire new creature in the image of God. In these
                            stages of progress, being a woik of trial, purification, judgment, pra\ er is the normal
                            expression of the soul, and, if true to this soul searching, soul quickening, purifying
                            work, it will be heard and answered ! At the present time we are living in an eventful
                            epoch, a period when humanity's great soul, through multitudinous avenues, is praying,
                            crying unto God for soul food ! It is inquiring into the purpose of human existence ; what
                            the means of obtaining true and lasting happiness? The baptismal power and gifts committed
                            to the faithful laborers in the hat vest field of humanity,�in the work of Christ's second
                            appearing, answers these prayers to Go.1 ! The inhabitants of the gospel day of the second
                            appearing of Christ are called to be those " saviors" of men whom the prophet declared
                            should come upon Mount Zion, to "judge the Mount of Esau." (See Obadiah 21st.) This metaphor
                            represents that body of souls whose life is in the flesh ! Esau sold his birthright blessing
                            for flesh ; hence the metaphor. The vitalizing power of all the great instrumental
                            mediators,�revelators of God's will and way to man, in all ages, has struck heavy blows
                            against the lusts of the flesh, for these lusts are the sword weapons of death to both soul
                            and body ! .Not only thus, but even the life of the generative nature in its normal
                            exercise, must be sacrificed by souls who would be harvested into the spiritual heavenly
                            kingdom of God ; for '�They that are in the flesh cannot please God." Rom. viii, . "If ye
                            live after the flesh, ye shall die." Iiom. viii, 13. "With the mind, I, myself, serve the
                            law of God, but, with the flesh, the law of sin. Rom. vii, 25. "For he that soweth to the
                            flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but, he that soweth to the spirit, shall, of the
                            spirit reap life everlasting." Gal. vi, 8. It is instructive to see how this idea of the
                            necessity of crucifying the flesh in order to obtain the fruits of the spirit has pervaded
                            the human mind in all past ages of human history. We find that the revelation of the wisdom
                            of God to the Brahmins, as expressed, in their Bible, the sacred books called the "Vedas"
                            written two thousand four hundred years before the Christian era, manifests a testimony
                            against the flesh, in order to approach God in prayer. Thus, " Through strict veracity
                            universal control of the mind and senses, abstinence from sexual indulgence, * * man should
                            approach God, to whom only votaries freed from passion and desire, can approximate." Buddha
                            said, "A man who cherishes lust and desire, and does not aim after (pray for) Supreme
                            knowledge, is like a vase of dirty water, in which all sorts of beautiful objects are
                            placed1, the water being shaken up, men can see nothing of the beautiful objec's thereia
                            placed. So lust and desire, causingconfusion and disorder in the heart, arelike the mud in
                            the witter, they prevent our seeing the beauty of Supreme reason," (true religion.) "But, if
                            a man by the gradual process of confession and repentance, comes to the knowledge of God,
                            then, the mud in the water being removed, all is pure and clear, and man immediately comes
                            fo.rtk in the substantial form."<pb n="151" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> "Menu" a Brahmimcal priest, said, '"To
                            a man contaminated with sensuality, neither the Vedas, nor liberality, nor sacrifices, nor
                            strict observances, nor pious austerities will produce feliciity,�true happiness, though he
                            pray for it." Zion dwellers have no time to be idle in spiritual servitude, since the
                            righteousness of their lives is called to be so great as to be a tribunal of judgment, for
                            souls in the worldly life ! Jesus declared, "The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the
                            judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of
                            Jonah, and behold, a greater than Jonah is here." Thus, we are taught that a righteous life
                            exercises the authority of a juror, relative to the judgment of mankind. The maelstrom of
                            creedal religious profession, of Agnosticism, of bogus spiritualism, and of infidelity to
                            God and true religion, is dashing its turbulent waves upon the mind of man ; the light of
                            truth, by revelation, science, and enlightened reason, manifested in a public life of
                            consecration to th,e works of righteousness, as judged by the Christ standard, is sitting in
                            judgment in the citadel of the soul, to pass sentence upon the combatants; and, as ever the
                            truth must come uppermost, and ever must justice be done, so must that system, power and
                            authority, which, obeyed, produces the most righteous life, when judged by the divine
                            standard of law, prevail, and obtain supremacy. Thus, every soul in Zion who has received a
                            living faith in the testimony of Christ, in dual form revealed, and in his and her coming,
                            which has now commenced on earth, is called so to live as to be a judgment tribunal to all
                            souls groveling in sin's dark abodes, and to grow, prepare, and administer soul food to
                            those hungering millions whose souls pray to God for releasemeut from the thoDgs of sin and
                            death, and to find an open door to that kingdom which spreads heaven as a panorama of
                            blessings. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            and successors in the ministry, returned to her disciples in the body in a special and
                            continuous ministration of four years duration, not only to bless, encourage and comfort
                            them for sacrifices made, and for steadfast integrity in obedience to faith, but to baptize
                            the younger class raised among them, with a like faith and spiritual understanding of the
                            work of God in this day. This work, which was marvelous and strange, the like of which we
                            had never heard before, a soul refining, rectifying work, in which the most holy purified
                            themselves still more, they fully accomplished iu all the* branches of our communion, as
                            mamliving witnesses can testify. This was followed in 1843 and 4, by an extra^dinary
                            visitation and manifestation through the living bodies of the Brethren and Sisters, of
                            spirits of the departed of all nations, of every rank and description, comprising the
                            learned and unlearned, celebrated and obscure, civilized and barbarian, rulers and ruled,
                            the just and unjust, no partiality being shown. It seemed for a time as though Hades was
                            breaking up and<pb n="152" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>pouring its dead back into this world to be quickened
                            into the resurrection of the judgment. For we were told from a high spiritual source, that
                            those spirits were sent to us, to be taught the gospel�the " everlasting gospel of the hour
                            of Judgment, which we proclaim." JRev. xiv., C, 7. Many were faithful to do this, for �which
                            spirits manifested their gratitude in succeeding visits. In 1848, one speaking in the name
                            of Mother Ann in a meeting of the first family at Mount Lebanon, said that her work at that
                            time, called her to leave us, and she was going to prepare the way, that souls may be in
                            preparation to receive the gospel when the Lord's time shall come to gather His harvest.
                            Again, after bestowing her blessing upon all, she said "I must leave you and I know not when
                            I shall return * * * I must leave those who love me and go where I am not wanted, an^. stay
                            with those who do not own nor love me. When I am gone you must remember and pray to God for
                            me, and I will pray for you. " We have no desire in this matter to -exalt a personality, but
                            to invite attention to the movement of which that personality was the center, and to ask the
                            wise and thoughtful to consider whether it be not the same power and intelligence which
                            raised up and supported Aon Lee and her disciples, as instruments of good to mankind for a
                            century past, that is now directing and controlling the phenomena of spiritualism. Both
                            movements are despised and feared by the world, which shows that they are not of the world,
                            for doth not the world love its own ? Both are in their infancy though one has somewhat the
                            start of the other,' and it can be no more intended for them to remain so, than that a child
                            should always remain a child. Of all professedly religious bodies, the writer believes that
                            the disciples of Ann, "the remnant of the woman's seed who keep the commandments of God and
                            have the testimony of Jesus Christ, are the only ones that have from the beginning extended
                            a fraternal sympathy to spiritualists, and the only body also whose doctrinal teachings of
                            man's relation to God, to the spirit world, and of progressive spiritual unfoldment, do not
                            conflict with the facts and fundamental principles made known to the common mind by
                            spiritualism. The Order of the United Believers in Christ's second appearing, is itself a
                            revelation of the Order of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, and its members are built up and
                            nourished in continual growth by spiritual gifts. That part of Ann's testimony relating to
                            her intercourse with spiritual beings, and knowledge of conditions in the spirit world, was
                            less verifiable and less likely to gain credit with unbelievers fifty years ago, than her
                            teachings of morality, and the practical duties of life. Because there was at that time such
                            dense ignorance on this subject, and so little phenomena of the kind currently believed in,
                            with which it could be compared, or to which it bore analogy, that such as partook of that
                            character was judged to be so much the effect of phantasy and superstition, that only
                            feeble, diseased, or untaught minds were supposed to accept them. To witness the immense
                            revolution in public opinion on this subject, which has taken place within four decades, and
                            the vast increase of lijjht shed abroad<pb n="153" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> by "ministering spirits, sent
                            forth to minister to them that shall be heirs of salvation," brings cheering reflections
                            upon the progress of spiritual knowledge and understanding. It also opens an expanding view
                            of the power and resource of the Almighty Parentage for accomplishing that strange work
                            which the spirit promised to perform in the latter days, and which those who draw nigh to
                            God with their lips while their hearts are far from Him, will in no wise believe, though it
                            be told them. Isa. xxix., 14. We see the wide gulf that formerly existed between us and the
                            world in the matter of doctrinal belief, continually narrowing by the operation of a power
                            above and beyond us, without change on our part, except that of normal growth, and increase
                            of understanding on the same foundation, reminding us of a vision related by Ann, wherein
                            she saw a great gulf fixed between God and the world of mankind, and she had two great wings
                            given her, and her work was to go up that gulf and fan it away. The word lost, may be
                            objected to in this connection. But an appeal is made to the personal experiences of
                            readers, if a large majority of you were not lost, so far as knowing where the true light of
                            man's spiritual destiny shined, or where to look for it, until you found spiritualism. And
                            how did you find it; by delving, or was it brought to you ? So far as one is lost from the
                            knowledge and practice of their highest and eternal interest, he is lost from God, though he
                            may not be beyond the reach and cognizance of God, nor of His messengers. The great gulf of
                            ignorance which divides man from his future inheritance with saints in light, can be bridged
                            by knowledge. But the far wider, deeper, darker gulf caused by sin and transgression, can
                            only be removed by works of faith and repentance, aided by these messengers of God, who
                            having conquered sin in the flesh while clothed with earthly tabernacles, and overcome all
                            inward antagonisms, have risen to that state of power and life which no fires can burn, no
                            waters quench nor drown, nor bottomless gulfs defeat nor swallow down. This mission belongs
                            as much to woman as to man. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            who, through the mercy and goodness of God, have been enabled to keep it and bear testimony
                            in its favor to this day ; and feeling sensible of the many blessings I have enjoyed, and
                            still do enjoy in it, J consider it my duty to give a short statement of what I have found,
                            experienced and felt in my own soul, through the power and influence of this blessed gospel.
                            If my testimony can be of any benefit to the candid part of mankind, or direct any who are
                            laboring under the burden of a wounded conscience, where to find the true physician, who is
                            able to probe the wound, and apply the healing balm, I shall feel satisfied that I have not
                            written in vain. I was born in Sharon, Conn., March 14, 1757. When I was a child, I was much
                            affected with my mother's dis: courses concerning a life of godliness, and especially about
                            Jesus Christ, and of his being crucified by the wicked. These discourses excited in my mind
                            many serious thoughts about religion. As 1 grew older, I often felt deeply exercised in
                            mind, and had many serious reflections concerning the life that Christ's followers were
                            taught by his precepts) and example to live. When I was eleven years old, my father moved
                            into New Lebanon, N. Y. From this time revivals of religion were often breaking out among
                            the people, and many were awakened to seek after religion and join the churches of the
                            different denominations. But these revivals would soon die away again, and the people become
                            as lifeless as beEbre ; so that I could see no difference between the professors and the
                            profane, which often filled my mind with serious trouble. I felt a great desire to find
                            something that would save me from sin, and cried to God in the best manner 1 could ; but I
                            could not obtain my desire. I have often "prayed, even when going into company, that I might
                            be kept from sin ; but my youthful mind was so easily led astray, that my prayers availed
                            but little. I was married in the spring of 1779 ; but this by no means released me from a
                            wounded conscience, which I felt almost continually, from the age of eleven to twentythree,
                            when T was taught the way out of sin. In June 177!), a remarkable revival broke out in New
                            Lebanon. Many of the people were filled with great power of God and saw wonderful visions ;
                            and many prophesied that the millennium was nigh, even at the door. The work was very
                            powerful through the summer.�1 had great faith in it, and received a measure of light, and
                            fully believed that Christ was about to make his second appearance ; but I feared we should
                            not know him. . Elder Joseph Meach'-xm, our principle leader in the revival, said that he
                            feared he should not know Christ when he came ; for he would come like a thief in the night.
                            Many believed this to be a preparatory work, and were confident that a greater work wras
                            about to take place. In the fall, the spirit, life and power of the revival was withdrawn,
                            and "marrying and giving in marriage" increased abundantly. But many retained their
                            confidence and waiting in hope; but they could not help anyone, as they could not help
                                themselves.<pb n="155" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> After the spirit of the revival was withdrawn, the
                            exercises of my mind were distressing beyond expression. I believed I had committed the
                            unpardonable sin ; for I thought I had sinned against so great a light that I could not be
                            reclaimed. In the spring of 1780, we received intelligence of a strange people who lived in
                            the wilderness, about seven miles northwest of Albany, and who, it was said possessed the
                            spirit of discernment, and the gift of working miracles, and other apostolic gifts. Many
                            people visited them from the country round. Some believed they were of God, and were under
                            the influence of divine power ; while others imputed their extraordinary gifts to the spirit
                            of witchcraft. When I heard of these things, I fully believed it to be the very work which
                            had been prophesied of in the time of the revival, and was determined to visit them.
                            Accordingly I set out on foot, in company with Justus Webster, an acquaintance of mine. The
                            weather was very rainy and the roads muddy, and being unacquainted with the way, our journey
                            was very tedious ; but I was determined to go on at all hazards ; for I believed my case
                            would there be decided. It was late in the evening before we arrived, aud as we drew near to
                            the house we heard them singing, which struck my mind with a feeling I cannot describe. We
                            were kindly received, aud seated by a fire to dry our clothes : for we were very wet and
                            muddy. Mother Ann said "James, bring some watei and wash these men's feet. " These were the
                            first words I heard from her. The man soon came with a large, clean pewter basin of water. I
                            began to obect against being thus waited upon ; 3ut lie replied, "make no words." He ben
                            washed our feet and dried our stockings. After this I seated myself m another part of the
                            room, observing every motion, and expecting soon to lear my final doom. They seemed to
                            lotice my companion more than they did me, which seemed to me an evidence of my reprobation
                            ; though I had not made known my feelings to any one. At length John Partington came to me,
                            and with his finger made the sign of a cross upon my breast, laying, "Thou art neither cold
                            nor hot: J would thou wert cold or hot. So because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor
                            hot, I will .-.pew thee out of my mouth. " There, thought I, that is just what I expected ;
                            and immediately I fainted and fell on the floor.�When I came to myself, I heard Mother say.
                            Come James, le: us go in ; for that man prays. " She,came into the room, and looking upon
                            me, said to Elder William, "Take this man and hear him open his mind.'; I went with him and
                            opened the state of my mind, and told him I believed I hud sinned against the Holy Ghost.
                            "Nay child, said he, you cannot do that until you have received the Holy Ghost. " These
                            words were to me the most comforting sound that had ever reached my ears. He told me I might
                            confess my sins. This I was thankful to do, and did it faithfully ; and truly I felt the
                            greatest satisfaction in exposing the worst sins I had committed. I remained there a number
                            of days, and received many precious gifts of God. 1 was instructed how to forsake sin, .and
                            my soul was filled with the power of God. At length Mother told<pb n="156" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> me I
                            must return home and right all my wrongs ; and where I had injured or defrauded any one, in
                            any way, I must make restitution, and take up my cross against all sin, and especially
                            against the works of the flesh. She said if I would do this faithfully, the power of God
                            would never leave me, but would give me power and victory over every sin. I returned home
                            and did as I was taught. When I came to confess to the wicked wherein I had wronged them,
                            and offered to make restitution, they were offended to hear me mention and offer restitution
                            for such small trifles, as they considered them. But I was faithful in my duty, and I found
                            the promise of Mother completely fulfilled to me. Although I considered myself but a babe in
                            Christ, I felt, according to my little measure, the baptism of his spirit. Whenever evil
                            presented itself to me in temptation or thought, I instantly felt the power of God run
                            through my soul, and the evil was in a moment banished from me, so that I felt entirely
                            released from it.

                            Supplement, " of February 27, 1886, calling my attention to, an article headed " Shakerism "
                            (marked.) Some things in it are true and some are false; but the spirit and tone of the
                            whole article is calculated to mis" lead the public mind and to misrepresent the moral
                            character of the Shakers generally, and its first founder. It begins with the following
                            :�"It is said, that Elder Frederic Evans, one of the most prominent leaders of Shakerism,
                            deplores the decrease in numbers of that sect. " This is true, and somewhat complimentary;
                            but he is not alone. There are others among the Shakers who admit the decrease in their
                            numbers in every community of theirs in the IT. S., and deplore their loss, and have for
                            years. They look upon it as a "calamity," of which they have been forewarned; brought about
                            by causes over which they had no control, nor could have. Again we quote from the Journal.
                            "They are no longer a by-word for honesty and fair dealing." This is not true, and what is
                            not true is false. We do not know exactly, but we will venture to say, there are more than
                            five, yea more than ten, (a sufficient number if they had all been righteous, to have saved
                            an ancient city from destruction,) Shakers can be found in every community of ours in the U.
                            S. who are men and women, distinguished for "honesty and fair dealing, " as much as they
                            were in the days of their greatest prosperity. ' They still hold on to the original faith of
                            Shakerism in all its essentials, especially in living lives of virgin celibacy; -when they
                            cease to do this, they cease to be Shakers. As long as there are ten souls left in every
                            Society, who are carrying out practically, original Shakerism, in their daily walk and
                            conversation, their reputation is established throughout the whole civilized world, as far
                            as they are known. It is understood, to be a true Shaker, is to become an honest man, and an
                            honest woman, or in other words to be a true Christian, a follower of the meek and lowly
                            Jesus, they are synonymous terms, and the reason why some try to be Shakers and fail, is
                            because they are not honest to confess every known sin which they are guilty of, to God, and
                            before one or more of his chosen witnesses ; they then try to palm the blame, or cause of
                            their failure, off, on the Shakers ; but nothing but strict honesty before God, and his holy
                            angels, will ever stand the test. The reputation of the Shakers is established, and cannot
                            be overthrown by any such garbling writer as#is found in the "Boston Journal Supplement" of
                            February 27 1886. Let us see what more he has to say against the Shakers. "You must accept
                            as inspiration their peculiar views and faith in the second coining of Christ, in the person
                            of an uneducated<pb n="158" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> and uncultured woman, taken from the lower ranks of
                            society in the factory districts of England, and whose standard of morals was not very pure
                            nor elevated, as* was well known in those days. " It was well known too in those days that
                            "Ann Lee," to whom this writer alludes, was not a person of doubtful reputation, but
                            sustained a good moral character from her youth up, being born of poor but respectable
                            parents, and was uneducated. Having lost a devout mother when young, she associated and
                            affiliated with a small society of Friends, called " Quakers " whose standard of morals was
                            equal, if not superior to any church in England. On account of her extraordinary gifts of
                            visions and revelations, she was recognized as a leader among them, and by whom she received
                            the endearing appellation of "Mother Ar.n, " and was ever afterwards called so, and well did
                            she sustain that character while in the body. It was well known in those days which were
                            more than one hundred years ago, that "Mother Ann" had friends, who were personally
                            acquainted with her, and knew more about her than her enemies, who knew nothjng but by false
                            reports and malignant slanderers and in whose sight, to be uneducated was a crime ; this was
                            her crime. But her friends who stood by her in every emergency tell another story. When it
                            was publicly known that she was endowed with the gift of tongues, and other apostolic gifts,
                            some of the nobility and clergymen, had a curiosity to hear her speak for themselves. She
                            consented to be interviewed and criticized by them. When arraigned before them, they said to
                            her, "We have heard that you speak in unknown tongues, and dialects of different
                            nationalities. We understand the languages, and would like to hear you for ourselves. " She_
                            modestly replied,�" Of myself I can do nothing! but, if I have the gift, I can speak what is
                            given me. " Suddenly the gift came upon her, and she spoke* in several different languages
                            and dialects. Her interviewers were satisfied, astonished, and confounded. She went so far
                            beyond anything they ever knew, that they counselled her enemies and persecutors to refrain,
                            and to beware what they do as touching the moral character of that woman, tor we have now
                            heard her for ourselves, and find no fault in her; but much that is praiseworthy. She is
                            controlled by a superior power, above that which is human. Of herself, she knows no language
                            but the English. "Again, we say, refrain from that woman and let her alone. " This shows
                            conclusively that Mother Ann w-as educated in a higher school than the arts and sciences of
                            worldlyr literature, although good in their place; but they are all on the intellectual
                            plane, and can never be substituted for the development of the moral and spiritual
                            faculties, on the higher plane. Thousands have progressed on to the intellectual plane in
                            this day, and there stop. They have never entered the Christ sphere; neither in the body nor
                            out, consequently they are not saved. This is the reason why they know so little about
                            Christ, and some deny him altogether, both in the body and out; not because they are
                            intellectual, but because they are carnal, sensual, earthly, devilish, and unholy. But
                            Mother Ann fully entered the Christ sphere while in the body, and was thoroughly educated in
                            the school of Christ, by which she was enabled to cope with the most profound scholars in
                            England. By the law of analogy and reason, I am constrained to say, that what the Jewish
                            nation was nearly two thousand years ago, the English nation is to the surrounding nations
                            of Europe today, because evidently both nations were chosen and ordained of God, to usher in
                            the gospel of Christ's first and second appearing; two of the greatest events ever recorded
                            in history, and may yet prove to be so in the end. Jesus was born a Jew, and lived a Jew,
                            and kept the law of the Jews, and fulfilled its requirements by abstaining from its
                            violations and living a pure life, such as God did own and bless, inviting us to follow his
                            example and the whole human race likewise to do the same or suffer the " penalties " annexed
                            for living in violation of that law. What are the penalties annexed? They are the awful
                            calamities which are visited upon the nations of the earth, by sea and by land all over the
                            world; too awful to relate, and too common and too heart-rending to need a recapitulation,
                            and growing worse and worse every year. The<pb n="159" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>Nor have we any evidence
                            that these calamities will cease until "they have accomplished the work where unto they are
                            sent, " which is to put an end to sin, and to bring in an everlasting righteousness, which
                            is unto all, and upon all them that believe and obey " Christ" not Adam. Nearly two thousand
                            years ago Jesus of Nazareth was crucified on Mount Calvary, between two theives, as an
                            impostor; but now is proclaimed the only Savior of the world throughout Christendom, and is
                            believed on in the world by millions of the human race; is made the second person in the
                            adorable Trinity of three infinite Gods, all in the masculine gender begetting an offspring.
                            Surely! "Tall oaks from little acorns grow. " I used to think that one infinite God was
                            enough and covered the whole ground. Where is the Bible? Let us have it "revised" and make
                            it mean something else! This doctrine is too absurd to be swallowed in the nineteenth
                            century. I would advise our opponent in the " Boston Journal" who complains of the Shakers
                            who ignore the married life and require the separation of families with entire
                            self-abnegation from relatives and friends together with a rigid compliance with the rules
                            and discipline of the order, to go and join the "Moral Keform Society" in America. North

                            Shakerism," did not seem to us as worthy of a reply, as the writer is quite well known to
                            the Shakers of New Hampshire. He has been a member of one of onv families, some half a dozen
                            times and as many times dismissed from the Society. In another article this writer might
                            interest the readers of the Journal, if he would relate his own personal experiences among

In revivals of lively, living faith and a whole soul full of
                                good works. In the manifestation of the spirit of God which gives men and women voices
                                to speak, and to sing, and to pray for a steadfastness in righteousness. In revivals to
                                pray without ceasing, and to renew all promises and pledges that our lives shall be in
                                the light. Revivals that shall develop a righteousness to walk humbly, love mercy and to
                                make the possessor a better man, and the whole world better for his presence in it.
                                Revivals for the Christian are as essential for his spiritual growth as is food for the
                                body. He arises refreshed and covenants anew to walk more closely with God. Revivals are
                                angels of mercy. Their mission is to do good, and whether they stimulate new life for
                                better and xnore consistent care for the health and protection of the body, or awaken
                                new thoughts of heaven and heavenly things, they should always be welcome messengers.
                                They may come as the angels of God come. Come to us when we are in the house of worship,
                                when we are in great joy, or when we are in deep sorrow. They may come when we are in
                                the active duties of life, or when we sit in meditation. Everything from which we may
                                draw our lessons tells us in the plainest language that the manifestation of a new life
                                is our sign of spiritual success. The church of Laodicea was severely ad^ monished
                                because it rested so securely on its then present attainments. It had grown careless of
                                its gospel mission, and the spirit of indifference was in the ascendency. It was neither
                                dead nor alive ! How sad was the state of that church, and how sad is the state of any
                                church that falls into the same channel and drifts on toward the world. Christian men
                                and women are expected to put on Christ and then to abide in his doctrine ; and the
                                promise of eternal life is only to that class who wear the yoke and bear the cross of
                                daily selfdenial. Whatever this may mean to those who are baptized into the spirit of
                                righteousness, and have made their garments pure and white in the life of the Son of God
                                ; it is susceptible of abundant variations in those who are traveling from the low and
                                degraded conditions in which man is sometimes found. None are so low but that they may
                                be reached and become the recipients of 2;ood gifts, and none are so well grounded in
                                the faith and in the life of Christ, that they may not be made better by a '' refreshing
                                from the presence of the Lord." JULY, 1886.<pb n="161" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> In every effort that
                                is made for the growth of the mind in manners, morals or religion we can recognize the
                                manifestation of God's loving kindness. The revivalist who engages in this work may be
                                but a little in advance of his hearers, and make sorry work of calling the unregenerate
                                to repentance, as he has such a crude idea of the power of the words which he employes.
                                In this class we sometimes find those whose illustrations of a Christian life are coarse
                                and strangely in harmony with a correct use of the English language. One ray of light,
                                howrever, is better than none, and the acceptance of so small an amount may possibly
                                turn the hearer from some physical or spiritual sin, and through this lead him to begin
                                the journey of eternal life. This ministration of God's universal love comes when we are
                                ready to accept it. "Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find. Knock and it
                                shall be opened unto you." To obtain the kingdom of heaven, is in the spirit of the
                                parable, like seeking for the treasure that was hid ia the field. Briers and thorns may
                                encumber the ground and the work of examination prove anything but pleasant. Iu this
                                anxiety for good, hope keeps the heart alive! Toil on, toil on till the good treasure of
                                God's love is found. Faithful and zealous|servants who are working for the elevation of
                                man, by making him think of better things, by the publication of good books, and by the
                                awakening of an enquiring mind, may be found in every nation and in every class of
                                intelligence. Those who are privileged to occupy an elevated position and can see the
                                great necessity for information should welcome every messenger that brings the gospel to
                                the poor, or brings the spirit of peace down to suffering humanity. God works by whom he
                                will, for his "tender mercies and loving kindness are over all."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To the young men and women..."

                            outside friend and well-wisher.] DtARLY Beloved ;�Your good home counselors rre much better
                            qualified to instruct you and to guard and restrain you from evil influences than any one
                            else on earth possibly can be ; yet I am [impressed that a voice from without�a voice from
                            one who has had wide and varied experiences in the outer world might possibly engage your
                            attention for the time and be of some service, and if so I shall have performed a pleasant
                            duty which I feel to owe the cause for much kindness extended to me. Not that I thus expect
                            to cancel the debt of gratitude and love I owe, since my life's best service can scarcely do
                            so much, but through love promptings of the Holy Spirit as I humbly trust and believe I feel
                            a lively interest in your temporal and spiritual welfare ; whereiore, if there be any among
                            you, of either sex, who like the Children of Israel (historical and allegorical) are
                            hungering after the " flesh pots of Egypt, " to you, and for your, kindly admonition is this
                            my simple epistle written. I know from experience (I am forty two years of age) that the
                            ever momentous and eventful question, "If not to enjoy the pleasures of this life why was I
                            created upon the earth?" very often presents itself to young persons. Questions of similar
                            import seem to have presented themselves to the man Jesus of Nazareth. Perhaps I might more
                            clearly illustrate my meaning with the familiar fable of a foolish lamb. Through the
                            watchful care of the shepherd the flock were nightly secured against the ravages of wolves ;
                            but this foolish lamb, like many a youth, longed for a "free" (?) gambol alone on the
                            pleasant green by moonlight, and, so, strolling care-<pb n="162" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/>lessly away from
                            the herd quietly retired to a secluded spot until the gates were closed when it sallied
                            forth for a free gambol "by moonlight alone;" but its short lived pleasures proved the folly
                            of its sportive whim, for a hungry wolf hovering near the fold found it an easy prey to his
                            insatiate lust for joung and tender flesh. Tis thus the tempter seeks the gentlest of God's
                            creatures as easiest to decoy. You ask, what are we created for if not to enjoy the
                            pleasures of life? I would answer, assuredly, that is what we are created for, and not only
                            to enjoy the pleasures of this life but to pi epare us for the enjoyment of continued
                            pleasures through a life of eternal pleasures, far transcending the highest pleasures we can
                            conceive of on the bound less shores of eternity. How common the expression, " O! I want to
                            move in good society ! " Ah yes ! so do I. But we have some preparation to make before we
                            can be accepted. We must have suitable apparel with which our deportment must be consistent.
                            We must be "polite," we must, in manners, wear the "polish" of " refinement" and this
                            requires " culture." For better particulars and further explanation see commands of Jesus
                            and Mother Ann as well as admonitions of Paul, etc Yes, my dear young friends, we are
                            pleasure seekers in this mundane sphere and to reach the goal we must adapt means to an end.
                            I shall take the position in this connection that man�the human family, as a subject of
                            God's creation�for a purpose�is, first, a material elementary structure formed of the dust
                            of the ground. That as God, the creator, is immortal, the inbreathing of His life principle
                            into the subject of formation renders that subject immortal also. Thus we have an
                            individualized material structure invested with the principle of life-immortality. This
                            being, in the state of purity as originally designed by the creator, is Godman, or
                            God-in-the-human. And, did death come to an individual thus formed and invested there would
                            follow a state of annihilation or extinction of the individual, while life�the immortal�the
                            investure would return to its author in or through absorption and be lost to identity. Hence
                            the need of a mediator-. Adam the first is of the earth, earthy. The second Adam is
                            spirit;�of the spirit, spiritual. Now, if we " put on Christ" we have the spirit in its most
                            sublime purity and are redeemed. Put on? Yes, put on Christ! Not to pit passively by the way
                            in waiting for the spiritual or Christ to be put on, the work of preparation is for you I
                            "Ask, seek and knock. " Yes, we are seeking to attend a grand entertainment, given by
                            angelic hosts, and we want to be decently clad. Could you " ask " any grander array than to
                            be " clothed upon with the spirit? " Paul tells us in 1 Cor. xv., chapter that there is a
                            natural body and there is a spiritual body and our spirit friends assure us. Paul also tells
                            us in same chapter that when the natural�i. e. physical�body dies it remains in the
                            earth�earthy, while the soulimmortal life thus disembodied comes forth embodied,
                            spiritually, and so retains its individual identity for good or evil as its individual
                            status warrants or demands in final judgment. In this life we are probationers and our
                            needs, both for time and eternity, demand action.�No drones in the heavenly mansions�No
                            drones here if we would weave and prepare that pure and spotless garment (spiritual) which
                            alone can secure our heavenly passport. No time to devote to idle and useless pastime which
                            can bring us no solid comfort here or pleasure hereafter; yet, with a positive knowledge of
                            these facts before us, we would, sometimes, allow the tempter�the world�to pursuade us.
                            Jesus was led of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted. What true believer has not
                            had such an experience? In the wilderness! When a "seeker" yet undetermined upon a future
                            course of life finds him or her-self standing for the time, disassociated from all human
                            connection, undecided as to what step to take they are in that wilderness state of unguarded
                            loneliness in which the tempter delights to find them. Though not beyond the Shepherd's
                            call, they may fail to recognize the faithful voice of<pb n="163" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> friendly
                            admonition as so distinct from the wily flatterer whose words are words of deceit. In this
                            condition we are shown the gorgeous splendors of the even plane of earth life ; we may he
                            set upon a pinnacle of the temple who e we are offered a pastorate or, perhaps a bishopric
                            in some popular church organization, or we may be taken to the summit of a high mountain
                            from whence we may anticipate the honor of worldly distinction as ruler of nations, and now,
                            to complete the temptation we become "hungry" having all this while "fasted, " for, although
                            we cannot live by " bread alone " yet are we forced to concede the necessity of material
                            aliment. Must we, therefore, seek to obtain this by virtue of our authority to command?
                            Choose ye as chose Jesus and obtain the reward of that better part which the world can
                            neither give nor take away. Be assured, by one who would never deceive you, that the
                            so-called pleasures of earth founded in lust are ever found transient and fleeting as are
                            the moments of time they engage, while their fruition brings satiety as distasteful and
                            revolting as their momentary excitation was, before, intoxicating. Mount to the summit or
                            drink to the dregs of worldly pleasures (?) and, still, there are unsatisfied desires
                            demanding more and broader adventure until the restless mind catching wildly at every
                            chymerical phantasy is allured from one extreme of passion�of worldly sensual lust�to
                            another until hope, the day star of destiny, is drowned in a sea of dissipation and the
                            victim is hurled beyond the reach of recovery. "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon." His
                            servants ye are to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey. With the lights as you have
                            presented by the? best of friends your lives will be just what you, yourselves, elect; and
                            with whatever "clothing" you leave this world the same will you begin life in the spirit
                            world with. Wherefore, if you would commence life over there upon a plane of calm
                            contemplative energy able to realize and enjoy the peaceful pleasures of the pure and
                            spotless children of the redemption choose now the even, conscientious course of those who,
                            having consecrated life, time and talents to the kingdom ol leaven, stand firm and
                            unflinching in their daily devotions to the sacrificial altar of all animal affections as
                            preparatory to that virgin state of heavenly purity which, alone, can yield true and lasting
                            pleasure such as shall continue to expand and intensify in. righteousness, in holiness, in
                            love when age on age shall have passed and gone. Worldly society is heterogeneous�made up of
                            all sorts�full of deceit and hypocrisy. Indeed it is absolutely impossible to mingle with
                            worldly society and, at the same time, maintain a true Christian deportment. A congenial
                            element must be maintained even, among thieves. Physical aura is an uncompromising
                            tell-tale�" Murder will out " is an. old saw but a very true one. You cannot serve two
                            masters. If you determine to " divide time " with the world you are gone over. Christ is not
                            divided, Christ is not divisible. Oh! that I could approach you with tongue instead of pen
                            to tell you of the cunning duplicity of the children of the world. Think of the lords of
                            creation revelling in the abundance which labor unrequited is daily heaping up to be thus
                            consecrated to wanton licentiousness! Do these merciless tyrants live without labor? Ah! no,
                            this is impossible. Hence to live without one's own labor is to steal or take perforce the
                            fruits of another'.* labor. How much worse is the highwayman who, without any sanctimonious
                            pretensions, or shield of law boldly takes from them what they grind out of the poor? And
                            you would cast your lot among these? Oh! never! Surely reason would restrain, you though you
                            should spurn the gentle warnings of the spirit Nay my dear young brothers and sisters. Yield
                            not to the tempter. Sell not your birthright for that which can only prove your eternal
                            ruin. Stand by your home counselors and thank God that He has graciously cast your lot among
                            friends�loving guardians, brothers and sisters who can never deceive you. Perfect
                            contentment is never found on earth which yearning of the spirit assures us of .a glorious
                            immortality. " Learn to labor and to wait. " Ever your friend in tender solicitude. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Beauchamp, W. A. J." TEIform="persName"/>W.

                                    Smyth of the Swedeuborgian Church, Roxbury, preached a sermon of impressive interest
                                    at the Young Men's Christian Union. The subject of the discourse was, "The Shepherd
                                    Boy Made King," 1 Samuel, xvi, 12. The anointing of David, said the speaker, in
                                    preference to his brethren who were only outwardly beautiful, represents the
                                    selection of a ruling principle of life which is spiritual. There comes a time when,
                                    having seen as it were our bodily nature fairly established and in the exercise of
                                    its powers, we must select a new king or ruling principle of life. It is a crisis in
                                    every man's history. It is the period when the Lord seems to say, "You must be born
                                    again, " that is from above. You have your education, you are fairly launched upon
                                    some occupation or business, and now7 if you are to be a true Christian man you must
                                    come wader the rule of some higher principle than you have followed before. You must
                                    struggle for something truer and grander than you have struggled for yet. We all
                                    know the tendency to shun this crisis, to go on in the old way as long as possible,
                                    to complain with Nicodemus that this new birth is impossible. And what we have to.
                                    complain of ourselves most of all is incompleteness�never hearing the cry which
                                    issues from angel's lips through every rift in heaven, "come up hither." Young
                                    people, this lesson belongs to us. It appeals especially to us. We have all lived
                                    under Saul's dominion. We inow what it is to come under the control of the world and
                                    of the body. We have tasted, no doubt, something of the sweetness and the bitterness
                                    of this world's life. And now are wre not ready for something better? Have we not
                                    reached the point where we can take a distinctly higher view of life? Can we not
                                    work from a'higher motive than we have ever had before? Can we not deny ourselves
                                    for a higher purpose than ever before? Can we not bear temptation, and suffer, if
                                    need be, with a higher strength than ever before? If you believe that each day has
                                    its influence upon our life, then each day lived selfishly, each day lived
                                    carelessly, each day lived sinfully, is throwing us back in this tremendous race,
                                    and making the future full, full of difficulties. And if these days of ours which
                                    come and go so quickly have such a serious bearing upon our after life, is it not
                                    time we set before ourselves one holy aim and nerve ourselves to be true to it ? As
                                    the surest guide to all life's questions and as the truest inspiration to all
                                    willing hearts, I ask you to ponder the example of Him who deigned to enter into the
                                    perplexities of our youth. W hat was it broke from his lips when, at twelve years,
                                    Joseph and Mary found Him in the temple? "Wist ye not that I must be about my
                                    father's business?" The divine purposes of His sinless life were already shining

                                    is our highest glory to follow. And all through the after years this same devotion
                                    to one great end is always visible. In the example of our Savior, not less than in

By him
                                the Lord had given deliverance to Syria Itrat with all this greatness he was a leper.
                                Nothing would have pleased him more than to be cured of his leprosy. A little captive
                                maiden who had been taken from Israel, not long afterward told her mistress of a prophet
                                in Samaria that would cure Naaman of the leprosy. One of the servants informed the King
                                who then sent Naaman with a letter to the King of Israel. He took with him ten talents
                                of silver and six thousand pieces of gold; also ten changes of raiment. The King read
                                the letter and rent his clothes. He was astonished that the King of Syria should think
                                he possessed power to cure the leprosy, but concluded this to be the means of commencing
                                a quarrel between them which might result in a war. When Elisha heard of the distress of
                                the King he requested him to send Naaman that he might prove that there was one prophet
                                who possessed this power in Israel. The chariot of Naaman came to the door of Elisha's
                                house, and a messenger said to him, " Go wash in Jordan seven times and thou shalt be
                                clean. " This was not the reception Naaman had expected. He thought the prophet would
                                come to him and lay his hands upon him and call upon the name of the Lord that he might
                                be healed. To have the errand given by a messenger was not like meeting the prophet, and
                                to be obliged to wash in Jordan was very unpleasant, as the water of this river was
                                muddy while the rivers of Damascus were clear and sparkling. Naaman was very angry at
                                this and sent this complaint to Elisha, "May I not wash in the rivers of my own country
                                and be clean?" But the servant said : If the prophet had bid thee do some great thing
                                wouldst thou not have done it. How much rather when he said, " Wash and be clean?" After
                                some consideration Naaman went down and bathed in Jordan s ;ven times and was healed.
                                When he returned to Elisha he exclaimed, "Now I know there is no God in all the earth
                                but in Israel, henceforth I will offer neither burnt offerings nor sacrifice unto any
                                other God but unto the Lord. " We suppose from this that he had previously worshiped
                                idols bu.t through his miraculous cure became converted to the worship of the true God.
                                From this story we learn a lesson which can be easily applied, that we, through
                                obedience may be cleansed from a moral leprosy which just as readily affects those with
                                whom we associate as wrould a physical trouble. If we disdain the injunction, "Wash and
                                be clean," we shall lose the blessing of a pure heart promised only to the humble in
                                spirit. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilson, Josephine E." TEIform="persName"/>Josephine E. Wilson. Canterbury, N.

                                same as we eat and drink. The trees have very long roots which could not be dug up
                                without being broken. In the Winter the leaves die and fall off the trees and leave the
                                trees bare. The trees look as though they were dead but they are not. In the Spring they
                                have new leaves and they look as bright as can be; then the buds come and then the
                                blossoms come and after some weeks the fruit comes. Then when it is ripe it is picked
                                and fixed for market or put in cellars to keep through the Winter for family use. The

The habits we now form will be ours

                                impolite to our discredit. Thus it is of importance that we strive to cultivate
                                ourselves and have our manners such that we can always practice them whether at home or
                                abroad. It is doubtless the case that most persons habitually practice some forms of
                                manners at home that they would not abroad, but I think it should not be so. We can
                                reflect and see what our impressions are of those who are coarse, rough and awkward in
                                their manners and address. I do not believe in an affected way of politeness, but
                                graceful and lovely ways without affectation. I consider politeness nothing more or less
                                than good manners. Let us all therefore study to know what true politeness is, and
