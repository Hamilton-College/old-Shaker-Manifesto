                            which is spiritual," says the Apostle. We can but marvel at the beauties of the natural
                            world. At this season, particularly, there is much to interest the observant eye and
                            reflective mind. The frigid earth warms under the mild sunshine, the tiny shoots spring up
                            like trumpets to herald the approach of blossom with promise of fruit, the buds swell into
                            bursting life upon the tender branch, the brooks laugh at their happy releasement and "the
                            time of the singing of birds is come." How profound is the economy of Mother Earth ! Not one
                            atom too much, not one particle idle, the law of change, ceaseless change, is written uj on
                            her broad surface. Nature is, indeed, a mysterious volume, into whose hidden wealth,
                            according to their own affirmation, our most noted scientists even have but glanced. The
                            celebrated Sir Isaac Newton said of his noble researches and those of his compeers and
                            predecessors, We are but as children upon the seashore, playing with pebbles, while the
                            eternal ocean of God's wonders lies undiscovered and unexplored before us. So the world,
                            doubtless, will go on changing and interchangingaffording countless themes for the
                            philosopher, abstruse problems for the mathematician, charms for the naturalist and
                            geologist, and beauties for all. Our Savior illustrated many of his spiritual teachings by
                            object lessons from nature. "Consider the lilies how they grow" opened the way for the
                            deeper call to implicit faith in God. The lovely figure of the sowing of seed <pb n="66" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 66 THE MANIFESTO. was employed to show God's work in the minds of men. One of
                            the deepest spiritual parables on record expanded itself from the simple words : "I am the
                            Vine, ye are the branches." The life of nature is response to natural law, the life of the
                            spirit is response to spiritual law. We see no confusion in the mineral or the vegetable
                            world. Rising higher in the scale, animal transcends vegetable ; of the former, however,
                            mankind was "made a little lower than the angels," it is said; yet, as we contemplate the
                            conditions which exist in the human family, we can but exclaim with the Psalmist, "What is
                            man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? " The divine
                            Hand that moulded the lily cup and assigned its modest sphere, gave to manhis last
                            creationmuch in common with the beasts that perish ; but God said, "Let us make man in our
                            image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over * * * all the earth." From time
                            immemorial, the fruits of human life have been upon the earth. Splendid specimens of .
                            physical vigor, of moral excellence, and of intellectual culture have enriched generation
                            after generation; and history will, doubtless, repeat itself. But the physical is not the
                            real, the seen is not the ultimate. Morality has often proved but a veneering when the true
                            is sought. Etiquette may give the hypocrite a placid face and suavity of manner for the
                            moment; but deceit can not always deceive, "God is not mocked," reaping follows sowing, and
                            the seed brings forth after its kind. Longfellow beautifully affirms, "It is the heart and
                            not the brain That to the highest doth attain." The physical has its limitations ; the soul,
                            like its Author, is "from everlasting to everlasting." The physical dies, the spirit may
                            expand from one degree of life to another. The Apostle Paul says of the seekers after
                            earthly pleasure that they are dead while they live. The young man turned away sorrowful
                            when the Christ opened to him the conditions under which he might be born unto the perfect,
                            the true life. He had already nobly fulfilled the obligations pertaining to the earth life,
                            and St. Mark says that "Jesus beholding him loved him" for his faithfulnessloved him as one
                            well fitted to embrace the "one thing" lacking, viz. the opportunity to enter the perfect
                            life. But, alas, the richer the prize, the higher the price; and when the whole is not
                            given, God's inexorable justice holds the treasure, and mercy pleads in vain. Is not this
                            why only a minority among so-called Christians are conscious that the true life has dawned
                            to them ? The conditions of spiritual birth are not fulfilled, the narrow way that "leadeth
                            unto life" is shunned, and the weary enquirer after true happiness turns from the very
                            elements which alone ensure,rest and satisfaction to the soul, to mingle again with the
                            maddening crowd that hasten after that which can never come to the carnally-minded. When the
                            lawyer, tempting Jesus by his enquiry into the higher life, put the question: "And who is my
                            neighbor?" the beautiful lesson of the Good <pb n="67" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> TKE MANIFESTO. 67 Samaritan
                            was given by the divine Teacher, who closed with these significant words; kkThis do and thou
                            bhalt live." Had not the man lived before? Not according to the Savior's acceptance of the
                            term. He referred to the full life, to the generous, universal divine love which he had
                            represented to the world as the commission from Godthe true life which dawns only when the
                            sun sets upon all selfish preferences, and when the personal will is c msecrated to divine
                            service. "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold,
                            all things are become new." What we need to-day is practical righteousness, not theory
                            alone; personal consecration, not creed lore. A perfect Christian is the only man who really
                            lives. Christ said distinctly of himself: "I am the way, the truth, and the life." The old
                            life of pleasure-seeking, with its attendant unrest and soul hunger, has failed to satisfy ;
                            earth has never yet given solace to a troubled conscienceher fruits afford no spiritual
                            sustenance. The true life, the Christlike life, on the contrary, has never disappointed any
                            soul. The heart that embraces it has a comfort through tribulation, a feast amid famine, a
                            covert from every storm of earth! East Canterbury, N.

                            N. H.</head><p TEIform="p">AS I have never had occasion to regret my early choice to live tlie true Christian life, I do
                            not hesitate to advocate the truths which have made my soul free from the bondage of sin. If
                            I did, I should justly merit the appellation of a moral coward; if I did, I could not hope
                            to meet justifiably, the loyal Pioneers and faithful companions, who have past beyond mortal
                            vision in whose presence I have so often pledged myself to be loyal to the principles of
                            this Church. These sacred vows of consecration loom up before me at this hour with added
                            responsibility, reminding me that "One more testimony to the many given; one more proof that
                            I am still bound for heaven" is in order, and may be a ray of light to brighten the pathway
                            of some toiling fellow-traveler. I recall those earlier days of my experience, when our
                            seasons for worship were largely devoted to the "breaking away" from forms and ceremonies
                            which only tend to check the circulation of the genuine freedom which the gospel gives, and
                            substitute in its stead, a lifeless condition; or an opposition, which would seal the life,
                            and silence the voice which would presume to proclaim that testimony which is like a
                            consuming fire to every worldly lust and selfish ambition. The question arises, Where should
                            the testimony of <pb n="68" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 68 THE MANIFESTO. truth abound, and whose lips should
                            utter it, if not those who professedly are living the virgin life, as preacht by the
                            founders of this Church? I fear sometimes we do not make a proper distinction between the
                            real principles of Shakerism, and the peculiar characteristics of individuals hence the
                            remark, that "If such an individual having been in the Shaker Church a long term of years,
                            is a specimen of the teachings of the Shaker doctrine, then I prefer to spend my life
                            elsewhere." But is this an intelligent conclusion, when we reflect that it is not the name,
                            the profession, or the position of individuals of this Society, or any other that
                            constitutes the true Christian character. It is far better for us to face these facts in the
                            light of common sense and leason, and govern our life accordingly, than to excuse ourselves
                            from doing right, because some other one is doing wrong. Individual errors, mistakes and
                            persistency in individual peculiarities is not what Shakerism has done, but what it has
                            failed to do in the moulding of life and character of the individual, and the idea of
                            putting any other construction upon it is belittling and degrading to every progressive
                            mind. I am aware that I voice the true sentiment of every loyal member of our Church, when I
                            affirm that we can not evade our responsibility of keeping alive the testimony of truth and
                            purity under the false impression, that there are those appointed to care for the spiritual
                            interest and welfare of the young and inexperienced members of our Church, and we have
                            nothing to do but stand idly by ; or work in the vineyard where we are appointed; we shall
                            have them for our associates in future years and they will be the representatives of .our
                            Order, with all their crudeness and ignorance, undisciplined in those essential qualities
                            which mark the character of the genuine Christian man or woman, and if they leave our
                            Society, upon us falls the disgrace of sending such material into the world as the result of
                            the training and education of our Church. Again I say this responsibility can not rest upon
                            two or three individuals, but upon every member who has placed his name to the Church
                            Covenant, and is devoting his time and talents for the interests of our home, which has long
                            been known as a place consecrated to God, and designed to be a refuge and protection from
                            the snares and temptations of a worldly life. I am deeply interested in its growth, its
                            honor, and its prosperity. When I become lost to its interests, I am lost unto the mission
                            appointed me and to the salvation of my soul. Enfield, N.

                            life. In it we find the long sad notes of sorrow, the shrill notes of trial and anguish, the
                            bitter strains of disappointment, perhaps; but there also are the light bright notes of joy,
                            the soft sweet cadences of love, the firm measures of courage and truth as they mark the
                            time of our march. All the parts which united will form a perfect harmony are placed before
                            us. How careful we should be in the reading; how watchful in the performing, striving to
                            place upon it our best efforts thrill it with life, enthuse it with a power beyond the mere
                            harmony of tone! A beautiful piece may be so rendered as to become even disagreeable to the
                            ear, its tones inharmonious, entirely devoid of music. But place the same piece before one
                            who is capable of bringing out its best tones, of softening its sweet measures, of thrilling
                            its joyful ones, of throwing power into its grand strains, of gliding from its changes with
                            ease and grace, and the music is transformed. What before was discordant sound, now becomes
                            a living breath filling our whole being with its power, carrying our thoughts from the
                            present with its care, to the future, where it is changed to glory. So our lives by true
                            living may become living powers of good. The sorrows if rightly borne will make the sweetest
                            strains ; the trials and disappointmentsthe chords of strength, like the minor keys change
                            to most sacred blessings; th? thwarted hopes and ambitious are tuned to notes of praise and
                            thanksgiving, while the passages of joy, peace and love resound with rapture at the mercy
                            and power of our Heavenly Father. Often we omit the notes of praise, or hardly touch the
                            chords of thanksgiving, while if we but accentuated them, often voluntarily adding trills of
                            love, and "grace notes" of joy, our music would be richer and sweeter. We each have our
                            especial part given us to perform. If we fail to render each measure correctly the mistake
                            will be readily detected. God requires of each the best music, the whole of our being the
                            entire surrender of self that it may be used for the maintenance and glory of the right. Our
                            lives must be so attuned that each action and thought may become a part of this living song.
                            Let us take this life as given us, with its modulations, its opportunities of awakening high
                            aspirations, its power of drawing down heavenly inspiration; take its portions of joy or
                            pain, its sorrows and care, from the hand of a wise Father and Teacher; take it and cause it
                            to be a power for good, a song of "glory to God." But how, we ask, can this be done? How can
                            we produce the perfect music. It is only by daily practice; by close study of the outline,
                            by faithful following of rules and measures that perfect rendering can be attained ; it is
                            only by daily acts and thoughts rightly centered, the eager search for the knowledge of the
                            truth and closely following of it that the life may be brought into harmony with the Author
                            and Finisher of our faith. As a student vainly trying to imitate the master asks,"Why does
                            not the music <pb n="70" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 70 TEE MANIFESTO. possess the power which it does under

                            yet the p.rfect music is not there, the rich, living notes will not sound to my touch." "You
                            must yourself feel the music if you would interpret the soul of the Composer," is the reply.
                            Air! that is it. We can not give to our lives the full power, the richest, grandest music,
                            unless the spirit of Christ dwells in us, unless we feel the life, the truth pulsating our
                            whole beiag, entering our life, encircling, ennobling and uplifting every desire. Let us by
                            drawing constantly from the everlasting Strength ; by honest, earnest endeavor fill each
                            measure of life to completeness, making it a rich, grand harmony. Then shall we be prepared
                            to join the chorus of angels, the 11 'hundred four and forty thousand" of the redeemed,
                            singing of the love, inercy and goodness, that have crowned our days. We shall then see that
                            all these long years of practice were needed to train our voices and fit our hearts for our
                            Master's use.

TEIform="persName"/>By Oliver C. Hampton.</byline><p TEIform="p">THERE is a center of Being, a divine solitude, a sublime refuge in each of us, our Savior
                            called the Kingdom of Heaven within us. If we will accustom ourselves to retire, at certain
                            periods to a solitary place, and conrcentate our entire thought upon this point, we shall be
                            able to reach this inmost center of our being, and enjoy great peace therein. This Center,
                            is pure SPIRIT. It is an emanation direct from the Father and Mother of us all. It is what
                            the Quakers call the Christ within. It is that Word which in the beginning was with God and
                            was God. In this Kingdom, a heavenly communion of those Beatitudes named by our Savior in
                            his sercnon on the Mount, rest in perfection. They are not vitiated by any taint of
                            sensualism or rudirnental imperfection. They shine in the glory and beauty of Christ
                            himself. No jealousy, no hatred nor unforgiveness, no anger nor impatience ever intrude in
                            that retreat of Peace and rest. Here Conscience quietly rules and directs everything. No
                            rebellion against the .Lord's visible Order and government, here on the Earth in his true
                            Church can ever arise to disturb her peace and quiet. All is righteousness and joy in the
                            holy spirit. The more frequently we visit, and the longer we remain in this holy Center of
                            our being the more obedient and satisfied we become. No joy is equal to that of this divine
                            Inmost. We have all experienced it at times and therefore know it. We have past through many
                            scenes of tribulation, disappointment and sorrow in search of this place of rest. <pb n="71" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 71 "We have met many scenes of trial and self-abnegation, and
                            at times, conditions which seemed almost to savor of injustice on the part of the Divine
                            Disposer of events; but have been able by the goodness of God to reconcile all vicissitudes,
                            with the Divine Wisdom, and to fully justify the ways of God to man. We have more than once
                            experienced the unutterable abandonment to despair, which seemingly caused our blessed
                            Savior to utter the exclamation, "Eloi Eloi lama Sabacthani." But now we see that even these
                            devious ways were necessary to our soul growth. This rudimental life has none too much
                            felicity in it at best and it is good and wise to select all that shall contribute to a
                            permanent good and reject all that will not. Whether we suffer or rejoice it is good to have
                            faith in the overruling hand of a Divine Providence which will surely conduct all his plans
                            to a happy culmination. When this faith is once thoroughly fixt we shall find it much easier
                            to meet and become reconciled with every mutation of life, and especially to patiently
                            endure in the hour of adversity. Under the afflatus of this subduing faith, many things will
                            appear to be good which otherwise would be set down to the account of evil. In this holy
                            faith and accompanying discipline one finally learns that "God's Providence is over all this
                            boundless Universe And even the wormwood and the gall, the blighting and the curse Are but
                            the blessing in disguise, the turning of his hand, From which salvation will arise at His
                            Divine command."

                                    1898, and discuss the question of the true way of salvation according to the
                                    teachings of wise men of every race. The call emanates from a Hindee of illustrious
                                    descent, bearing the title of Maulana Syed Nusrat Ali Saheb, son of Imam-i-Manazira
                                    Sayad Nasir-ud-din Mohommed Abul Mansur. Nusrat Ali is the editor and proprietor of
                                    the Moslem Chronicle, (The Nusrat) a Delhi paper that is printed in both native and
                                    foreign languages and has a wide circulation in India. The call for the great
                                    Religious Congress has been printed in various languages and scattered broadcast
                                    over the face of the earth. It has gone to the innermost recesses of China in those
                                    mysterious characters that only the Chinese understand, and disciples of Confucius
                                    are invited by it to come and explain on what ground they base their belief that the
                                    way to heaven is through the worship of the gods of the Celestial empire. In Persian
                                    characters the theologians of the land of the Shah are called to come and speak for
                                    their prophet, and the Sultan's most learned expositors have been invited, in
                                    Turkish, to do likewise. The Egyptians have been summoned from the shadow of the
                                    pyramids to defend their beliefs against the attacks of the pious people of England
                                    and elsewhere who preach that salvation can only be found by way of the cross, and
                                    that Mohammed is a false prophet. In the purest Hebrew, the Jews have been invited
                                    to present the claims of a religion that denies the divinity of Chiist, admonishing
                                    them to come and tell the anxious seekers from every clime the one true path to
                                    heaven according to their creed. Nor have the distant heathen been forgotten. The

                                    in their native language setting forth the object of the Congress, and telling them
                                    that even the worshiper of idols will be welcomed to the great gathering and his
                                    views listened to with respect. Hawaiians, both Christian and Heathen, will be
                                    there; Salvationists, filled with the deepest religious enthusiasm, will rub elbows
                                    with the medicine man from Africa who carries his god beneath his robe" and believes
                                    he can influence the very elements by its aid. Imams from the mosque will compare
                                    notes with Methodists from missionary stations in the jungle. Enthusiasts from
                                    Hindoo temples will reveal the mysteries of their teachings to the sympathetic
                                    Theosophist. All will be upon one common level, and the Congress will be inspired by
                                    one thought,a fervent seeking after the knowledge that will aid men to find their
                                    way to the gates of heaven. No pei-sonal criticism will be allowed. Everything is to
                                    be done with a view to separating from religion the hopelessly entangled part which
                                    consists only of dark tradition or observances beyond human solution and carrying to
                                    the outside world1 the more fundamental doctrine that will be the marrow of all
                                    sensible religious teachings. It will surely be a great gathering and will do much
                                    toward harmonizing the discords of the religious world and bringing all races to
                                    recognize one common creed based on spiritual facts, with all fictions eliminated.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Dallas Morning  News" TEIform="index"/>The Dallas Morning News.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Who walks in a garden of roses..."

                                for the usual characteristics of the old storm month. In reflecting on the mild

                                vision, thus; March again has past away; March has blest us many a day, March has
                                cleared the fiells of snow, March has made the rivers flow. March has drawn the frost
                                from earth, March gives spring a renewed birth, March has filled the month with cheer,
                                March has graced the present year. March of eighteen ninety-eight! March! We pft shall
                                quote this date; Marches are but seldom found, March the centuries up and down, March
                                will seldom grace a year With such welcome pleasant cheer. Home life and incidents move
                                in such a usual round; there is but little occurring of historical importance that would

                                an ancient industry. They went to the old sap bush and drew from the sturdy maples the
                                saccharine juice which the Sisters reduced to syrup, and spread on pancakes. This gave
                                them a dainty morsel for the stomach. The month of March favored us to get our wood
                                sawed and sheltered. It gives exquisite pleasure to learn that the Editor of The

                                intimating that the Union Village Community had purchast forty-six square miles of land
                                in Georgia. I made the estimate on thirty thousand acres which I was told they had
                                bought. Now it is said it is eight thousand acres, which brings it to twelve and one
                                half square miles. This they took in exchange for a vineyard at Cleveland, Ohio. <pb n="75" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 7o "Lay not up for yourselves treasures up- I on

                                hand and heart. The supply of wood, to counteract the effect of next winter's bleak
                                winds, has been sawed into convenient lengths, and awaits storage in well rooft sheds.
                                The fanners have opened their spring campaign, and like the celebrated sower of old,
                                "went forth to sow" a few days ago. Eighteen rows of green peas are planted and rhubarb
                                stood two inches high on the 8th, but the latter soon shrank away from the frosty air
                                that breathed upon it, and we look for a more permanent attempt byand-by. As the seed is

On our first coming to Florida, the old Settlers or Crackers as they are
                                called, had a very meager system of farming, especially in preparing the land for crops.
                                It was the old Egyptian method of shallow or surface plowing. It was claimed that from
                                two to three inches deep was sufficient for any crop; and so it was for the crops that
                                were raised; from ten to fifteen bushels of corn to the acre was the average through the
                                state and a poor quality at that. Other crops were at the same ratio. But since the
                                northern element has so flooded Florida within the <pb n="77" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO.
                                last three years it has given a new system to agriculture as well as everything else.
                                They have come into the state bringing their own ideas of farming and one among the most
                                essential is deep plowing, holding to their same old belief that plowing year after year
                                to a depth of a few inches leaves a hardpan which is rendered harder than it was in a
                                state of nature by the tramping of the team and pressure of the plow, and the roots of
                                plants can not penetrate this hardpan and the deep waters of the earth can not rise up
                                through. Hence eventually comes exhaustion of soil through this skimming process, and
                                the lack of water which is the universal solvent, and the feeding medium for plants. The
                                argument in a nutshell is that deep plowing renders the under strata of soil like a
                                sponge capable of holding water and permitting it to ascend to the roots when needed
                                whereas hardpan sheds the watetf and retains no reserve in time of need. So to-day we
                                hear and read of the farmer raising from twenty-five to forty bushels of good corn to
                                the acre, and the drouths are not half so troublesome. Now what has made this change but
                                good common sense farming ideas? Florida has greater advantages than any state north of
                                Mason and Dixon's line as to raising farm and garden crops, and when it gets filled
                                enough with the right material to crush out old staid ideas and systems inaugurated by
                                slavery it will be one of the gardens of the world. We have planted about one and a half
                                acres of corn. Part of it sweet for home consumption and part for cattle feeding. This
                                we have given the best of northern treatment as to plowing and fertilizing; the result
                                we will know later on. We have over an acre of velvet beans which it is said will give
                                more green fertilizer to the land than any other crop, also an acre of rice and two
                                acres of sweet potatoes, with an intersperse of garden vegetables sufficient, I hope, to
                                make the little family comfortable. We have three additional members to the
                                household,good, bright, intelligent people, so the good work has commenced in Florida.

                                white clouds tipping their wings. There is life, there is hope, there is glory in the
                                afterward. The present is but the corridor, leading to the palace. Our voluntary choice
                                is to follow the life of Christ, tho it bring us to the cross, the deepest testings of
                                faith, the most bitter suffering. After the cross cometh the crown, after the testing,
                                strength and purity, and only by crucifying self-life do we obtain the Christ life,
                                becoming "heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ." Spring work with us is commencing

                                        the most skilled physician is often greatly puzzled in trying to decide when one
                                        is ill whether the brain or stomach is really to blame. Nothing is more common

                                        were themselves fully convinced that cancer at least, was the cause of their

                                        too much and exercising too little. In the majority of cases its cause lies in
                                        the fact that the food last taken is so rich in Quality or so excessive in
                                        quantity that the stomach can not digest it. A simple diet of grains and ripe
