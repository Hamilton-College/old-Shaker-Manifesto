Published in Albany, N. Y. in 180S. No. 2. The New Testament appeared
                            to be the proper fruit and product of the church of Christ, and manifested by its purity
                            that it was a pure church out of which it sprung. Taking the church as the tree, and the
                            Scripture as the fruit, both seemed to be good. But the fruit, which had been for many
                            generations produced by those churches which bore the same name, was very different. The
                            writings of these churches instead of uniting the people in ^righteousness and peace, had
                            kindled endless controversies and angry disputes; and from the manifest difference in the
                            fruits, it appeared that modern professors could not be the same kind of people with those
                            that had formerly been called Christian. According to the Scriptures, Christians were
                            united, all of one heart and one soul. They laid aside all anger, wrath, clamor, envy and
                            evil speaking ; were kindly affectioned one toward another, and loved one another with a
                            pure heart fervently. Daily observation proved that those who now assumed the same name,
                            were full of envy and strife, railing and backbiting, hateful and hating one another; and in
                            every sense different from those holy men of God, who were formerly called by the name of
                            Christ. This distinction was observed not only in common professors, but even in the
                            ministers. While the New Testament represented the ministers of Christ, as meek, humble,
                            honest men, examples to the flock, in charity, faith and purity ; those who were called the
                            ministers of Christ in the present day, appeared to be proud, aspiring, contentious men,
                            striving who should be the greatest, overlooking common people as an inferior rank of
                            beings; deeply immersed in the cares of the world, eager after salaries, or posts of profit
                            in civil government, and some even holding their fellow-creatures in perpetual slavery, or
                            selling them for money. These appeared not to be the same kind of men as those whom Christ
                            ordained, nor did it appear that they had the same Holy Ghost dwelling in<pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> them, or could be as safely believed or followed, as the ministers who wrote the
                            Scriptures. They admitted the conviction that they were far sunk from the power and purity
                            of the Apostles of Christ, and were preaching about a salvation which they had not in
                            possession. Another important train of ideas arose from searching the Scriptures. There was
                            a falling away spoken of by Christ and his Apostles, and an antichrist to rise, which
                            appeared, according to history, to have taken place a great while ago. And it appeared by
                            many promises, that after the reign of this antichrist was out, there would be glorious
                            times upon earth, and Christ would appear again and set up his kingdom and gather the
                            nations into it. Here many enquiries were raised, concerning the reign of this antichrist:
                            when it began and when it would end, and when Christ would appear and set up his true
                            kingdom. And many began to apprehend that this period was not far off ; and concluded it was
                            time to leave off their vain disputes and unite in prayer for Christ to come and pour out
                            his spirit, gather his people into one, make an end of sin, and fill the earth with his
                            glory. For several years there were praying societies kept up in different parts, composed
                            of persons who were distinguished in some things from all the denominations, though blended
                            with them in their outward communion. These professed to be in search of the truth and power
                            of religion, and ready to embrace it whenever it should appear, but did not believe it to be
                            among any of the denominations, in purity. They believed there were errors in all their
                            systems of doctrine, which kept them dead and lifeless, without the spirit of God. The
                            social exercises which sprung from this faith, were reading the Scriptures without any
                            comment, praying for the divine spirit to open them, confessing and lamenting the deplorable
                            state of mankind in general, and that of cold, lifeless and corrupt professors of
                            Christianity in particular ; and pleading for the accomplishment of those blessed promises
                            which respected the coming of Christ and the glory of the latter days. Examining themselves
                            by the evidences and marks of grace laid down in the Scriptures, lamenting a lack of those
                            evidences, confessing their short-comings in duty, and resolving to correct past errors, and
                            be more watchful over a deceitful and desperately wicked heart, opening their trials to one
                            another, and encouraging each other to persevere until they found Christ in very deed. When
                            any one prays for a thing, it is a sure and certain evidence that he has not that thing in
                            possession : and hence the united prayers of hundreds of the warmest professors, entreating
                            Christ to come and visit the churches, loudly proclaimed that he was not already there.'
                            While he was contemplated at a distance through the promise, the following lines well suited
                            the day, and proved his absence from the soul: "When I turn my eyes within; All is dark, and
                            vain, and wild: Full of unbelief and sin; Can I deem myself a child?"<pb n="27" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>
                            The following extracts of letters from persons of no small note in the churches, will show
                            more particularly the state of religion at that period. Dear Sir :�I received your kind
                            letter, and I now undertake to answer it. ***** The dead state of religion is truly
                            discouraging" here, as well as elsewhere. It appears a wonder of mercy, that God is so kind
                            to this Sardis, as to afford her the means of grace ; without this she would certainly run
                            into total infidelity. When I look into my wretched heart, and consider how much I have
                            dishonored God, by a dead and careless life ; I have reason to cover my head in the dust. *
                            * If some are spotted with sin ; I am spot all over. * * J. T. Lexington, Sept. 1796. Dear
                            Brother :�It is not likely I can say anything to entertain or refresh you. I sometimes think
                            I would be willing to travel with you to heaven ; but I feel very unlike an inhabitant of
                            that place, I would be glad to be at the truth, and the substance., But I commonly feel so
                            much more like a devil than a Christian, that it makes me often forebode the displeasure of
                            God, the holy and the just. I sometimes think I am coming towards the birth, but can seldom
                            think I am born. O how long ! how long ! And what am I ? I would strip off everything but
                            Christ and his holy spirit, to enter the narrow gate * * I can tell you but little about my
                            poor congregations. I see but little prospect of encouragement. I dare not say none. * * * I
                            sometimes hope to see Jesus King in Zion. J. D. Now let any one judge from the foregoing
                            evidences, wiiat kind of work was necessary to take place among such a people, in order to
                            their recovery; a people confessedly, vain, and dark, and wild; full of unbelief and sin,
                            dead and careless, spot all over; and more like devils than Christians. The generality,
                            however, unaffected with their sad case, were still going on, crying out against infidelity,
                            lampooning the Deist, treating his cavils with contempt and laboring each one to augment his
                            party: while a distressed few were watching, like the guards of the night and ready to meet
                            the first dawn of the approaching day. A sense of the total depravity of human nature, and
                            the entire separation of the soul from God, is the first thing necessary to prepare the way
                            for the entrance of spiritual life. Therefore, such as honestly confessed their lost and
                            deplorable state, and intensely groaned for deliverance from it, were not in so dangerous a
                            condition as those who made a high-sounding profession, and gloried in some plan of
                            salvation that still left them in bondage to corruption. But a conviction of being lost
                            never saved any one, though many have made conviction a great evidence of their election,
                            and vainly rested upon that light which searches out the evil and wickedness of the heart,
                            without going any further. But such as were honest before God, could not stop here : they
                            must be at the truth and the substance. Therefore, it was necessary that the channel through
                            which the quickening power of God has access to the soul,<pb n="28" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> should be
                            opened: namely�,the everlasting covenant of redemption. As this is the only channel through
                            which' souls can receive any special favor from God, it will be proper here, to make a few
                            observations concerning it. When one makes a promise to another, and that promise is
                            accepted, this constitutes a covenant or agreement. Thus the promise of eternal life was
                            made to Christ and accepted by him in behalf of all ^tho accept him. In this promise, or
                            covenant of life, the Father and Son are perfectly united. It is an everlasting and
                            unchangeable covenant. The covenant itself, is absolute, unconditional and inviolable. But
                            in order to its being fulfilled and finally settled, there is a work given the Son to do,
                            which, in the nature of things, is necessary to be done, and that is, to overcome death, and
                            him that has the power of it. Until this is actually done, the heir is in bondage. It is
                            true, eternal life is secured in the covenant, to all the faithful, though they be not in
                            actual possessioit of it. But while death reigns, the blessings of the covenant can only be
                            administered by way of promise, and the party to whom the promise shall be fulfilled,
                            designated in the Father's revealed will. This everlasting covenant has ever been a mystery
                            to man, nor could anything certain ever be known respecting it but by a living revelation
                            from God, an express manifestation of the divine will, attested by living witnesses. Where
                            this orderly administration has been wanting, the more that has been said about it, the
                            greater confusion and controversy has been stirred up. It is true, the Scriptures contain a
                            copy of the divine will, concerning the redemption of souls ; all the promises of God are
                            there recorded. But of what use is a bare copy of a will without witnesses ? These great and
                            precious promises could effect nothing real; the inheritance itself was not in them ; and
                            although thousands have undertaken to administer upon the authority of the Scriptures, as
                            though it was the very original itself, sealed and confirmed by unalterable seals, and have
                            pretended to be the true witnesses of God: yet their folly is made manifest to all men. They
                            have not agreed in their witness but have filled the world with endless debates, concerning
                            the sense and meaning of what they call the icill.. If the witnesses were all divided, and
                            could not even agree in their testimony who were the proper heirs, how could anything ever
                            be decided in such a court? However much these presumers have altered, amended, expounded
                            and paraphrased upon the copy ; yet the original has remained unsullied. God is of one mind,
                            and his promises in Christ, are Yea and Amen. When God revealed his covenant to Abraham, it
                            was only by promise. "In thee and in thy seed, shall all the nations of the earth be
                            blessed." The blessing promised, was not to Abraham and his seed ; but to all the nations of
                            the earth. It was not, Thou and thy seed shall be blessed with irresistible grace, but uIn
                            thee and in thy seed [which is Christ] all the nations of the earth shall be blessed." All
                            were tinder the curse, and stood<pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> in equal need of the blessing. Sin and
                            death had their dominions equally over all. But a better dominion was promised; a kingdom of
                            righteousness ; a dominion of life ; in which all the nations of the earth should be
                            blessed. Although death reigned from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to Christ; yet the
                            promise of God to Abraham, was sure to all the seed ; death could not destroy it; the law
                            could not supplant it, or make it void ; the threatenings and curses from Mt. Sinai, were
                            not against the promise made. Tne promise was established and confirmed by unalterable
                            seals, illustrated by types and figures, and attested by a long succession of living
                            Prophets, until Christ the proper heir made his appearance ; �finished the work that was
                            given him to do, received the substance that was promised by the Father, and took possession
                            of the inheritance. Until this took place, souls were in bondage under the rudiments of the
                            world. They could find no resurrection into eternal life, until the son of God, in the
                            fulness of time, was made of a woman ; made flesh ; placed under the same rudiments by which
                            they were held in bondage; and from thence ascended step by step, until he entered the
                            promised possession. Then, and not till then, the way was open for the substance to be
                            ministered ; then the first-born could give gifts unto his brethren, substantial, real
                            gifts. What he received of the Father, he gave to those who were joint heirs with him to the
                            promised possession, and sent them into the world as he had been sent, to minister to others
                            as he ministered to them. Moreover, he did not send them to some particular persons, but to
                            every creature that was under heaven ; and commissioned them to proclaim liberty to the
                            captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ; one as much as another. No
                            nation or individual was excluded, but the promise was to all, and upon all, and should
                            finally be fulfilled to all them that believe and obey. While the everlasting covenant was
                            thus ministered in truth by the Apostles and true witnesses of Christ, it was confirmed by
                            the most convincing signs, wonders, miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit. They healed the
                            sick, raised the dead, cast out malignant spirits, spake with unknown tongues, held converse
                            with angels and departed spirits, saw visions, fell into trances, and had gifts of
                            prophesying. These, and such like, were seals to their ministry. But above all, the salutary
                            change produced in the lives and manners of those who believed, confirmed the doctrine to be
                            of God ; and served as a test to those who should come after, whereby to distinguish the
                            true covenant of God, from all the counterfeit doctrines of men. When the true
                            administration of the covenant ceased, the signs and seals of confirmation ceased with it.
                            God would not affix his seal to the canons, decrees and covenants of wicked men, who rose up
                            to supplant the true work of redemption. For many ages, what has been called the Christian
                            doctrine, has been void of authority, except what arises from superstition, vain philosophy,
                            the power of human eloquence, or the civil sword. But when<pb n="30" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> God, in
                            infinite kindness, began to revive the everlasting truth in these latter days, the living
                            seals of the covenant were annexed. Such seals and evidences of a supernatural and divine
                            power, have excited as great astonishment in the minds of mankind, as those of antiquity.

                            being utilized in the service of man; and when we contrast our time with even the middle of
                            the present century, in the marvelous labor-saving machinery,�in the means and speed of
                            conveyance by sea and land, and in the communication of thought, silent and verbal, we stand
                            with bated breath and ask� what of the soul? Is not man's religious nature progressive?
                            While the intellect expands, shall the spiritual faculties remain dwarfed ? Shall that
                            inspiration and revelation which was sufficient in olden time, answer the soul's needs
                            to-day ? Not so ; through his interior nature man holds communion with a higher world, and
                            is susceptible of a continual influx of Deific influences, and humanity to-day is vibrating
                            under the pressure of silent, yet powerful spiritual forces ; the sun of divine revelation
                            rises higher and higher, enlarging the circle of the moral and spiritual horizon,
                            illuminating new regions of thought, and answering to the earnest hopes and lofty
                            aspirations of souls who have cast off as an old and outgrown garment, the narrowing creeds
                            and blinding superstitions of the past. New phases, of spiritualism are opening, and media,
                            in different parts of the world, are acted upon by intelligences of the Resurrection Order
                            to spread the truths of the Virgin Church. The vital breath of religion is being infused
                            into the philosophy of spiritualism, without which it is cold and lifeless. A new wave from
                            spirit spheres has rolled upon the shores of earth. Never was the world of mind in such a
                            general state of agitation. All thinking classes are in anxious expectancy of some marked
                            changes which they are sure the near future will bring, and many are inspired to utter
                            prophecies relative thereto. The law of cycles is being taught; educational systems,
                            physical reforms, and other living issues are attracting ranch attention, which, when
                            regulated and established under the rational ideas of the present day, will form a
                            substantial basis for the manifestation of those diviner qualities in human nature, which
                            have hitherto been stifled and checked in a large degree. While the spirit world is thus
                            pressing, is the time for humanity to earnestly co-operate therewith, and by concentrated
                            action push forward the wheels of progress. Invisible intelligences can only do a given
                            part. Mortals must keep unclosed the receptive faculties of the mind. The light that shines
                            must be absorbed in truthloving souls, and then refracted to others through the example of
                            devoted lives guided by its revelations ; and,<pb n="31" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> for the inflowing tides
                            of spiritual power, must be prepared safe and welldirected channels, else they will roll

                            for thought. His life illustrates the fact that there is in man an aspiration for something
                            higher than the earth life can satisfy. In early life he was the subject of religious
                            impressions, which, fading for a time on account of cares and the deceitfulness of riches,
                            again returned with renewed force in riper years. These impressions, acting on a character
                            naturally simple and forcible, led him under the influence of the Christian socialist
                            movement which so powerfully moved society half a century ago. He longed and sought for
                            something which could satisfy his aspirations after good. He felt and recognized that the
                            true life of Christ could be found only by forsaking all the selfish, partial ties of
                            natural relationship, and by finding sympathies that should admit of universal application.
                            He eschewed the tie of marriage as admitting, in its very best aspect, of only a contracted
                            relationship, and endeavored to find in the communities then forming on the natural plane,
                            that realization of good for which his soul so ardently longed. To make this attempt he
                            sacrificed good worldly prospects and incurred the enmity of his former friends. In the
                            several institutions that he entered he never spared himself. He devoted himself unselfishly
                            to the good of the socialist cause, though he saw others striving to use them for their own
                            ease. But after several efforts in this direction he became convinced that there was no hope
                            for communities to succeed on the natural plane. His soul was filled with ardor to realize
                            his highest conception of a life pleasing to God. But every attempt seemed to fail in spite
                            of his conscientious efforts. He saw his old associates leavening back to the old order of
                            things. After making a few feeble efforts they were now seeking for wealth and the ease of a
                            worldly life, and striving to find satisfaction in the narrow relationships of the natural
                            family life. But our dear father was not made of this kind of material. He was ready to make
                            any sacrifice and to search the earth if he could find a true order where he might find
                            strength and support to live as he believed a true Christian should. In this state of mind
                            he left his country and relations forty-five years ago to visit the Believers in Christ's
                            second appearing. It has always been his testimony that in his first visit to the Believers
                            he was convinced that God had placed his name in Zion for the salvation of man. Through many
                            trials relating to his. aspiration after the highest he remained true to his faith. He
                            believed that salvation was to be gained by self-denial only, and he saw that man needs the
                            ministration of the mother spirit in order to become born<pb n="32" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> and perfected
                            in the Christ life ; a life not of ease and self-indulgence, but of conscientious labor in
                            cross-bearing. That he had gained much, not in selfrighteousness, but by dependence on
                            obedience in divine order ; he testified himself, and all his associates felt the evidence,
                            that his only concern was to build up and support every one in good. In this spirit he could
                            not fail to become a father to all who wanted to walk uprightly in the order of God. We all
                            know that he loved every such soul and that such were his only treasure. He was ready to
                            spend his every effort to build up one ray of good in any soul. If there was anything of
                            severity. in his character he was as ready to apply that test to himself as to any other.

                                your homeward journey. We hope you arrived all right and safe into your family, as they
                                would all feel very happy to see you again among them. You will, evidently, be engaged
                                in your daily duties before this reaches you. Dear friend, allow me to use the term, I
                                am writing in the name of the whole family. We cannot assign the reason for it, but your
                                meekness and modesty and simplicity of manners left an impression on our memories that
                                is growing in our household every day. Not a day passes but that you are spoken of with
                                expressions like these. "I wonder what uncle Kobert will be doing now?" "We would have
                                kept him, father, if he would have stayed with us." Your name, sir, has become a
                                household word; and as the weeks pass along it seems to become more and more permanant
                                in the mind. Your sojourn among us, although very short, yet in that short time you left
                                your wise counsel and your blessing, and with these you have left your impression upon
                                our memories which time will serve to strengthen. Kate and Mary speak of you with the
                                deepest reverence and kind care. So, dear friend, although your body is in America, we
                                have a part of you here, in spirit. I must confess that for a few days after you left
                                us, I felt a blank, as the conversation we enjoyed was very pleasant to the ear and did
                                good to the heart. Your graphic sketch of your life-work may have an influence on some
                                of the rising generation, in the making up of their future destiny. It shows plainly
                                that no one need try to shape their own future to their own mind or will, as in trying
                                to do this without the aid and guidance of the All-seeing Eye, it would only result in
                                failure. The power is in God's hand. Hoping this will find you enjoying the blessing of
                                health is the wish of us all.

                                send you the assessment for Harvard and Shirley for 1891. The loss we all must feel in
                                the death of our dearly beloved Leader, Elder Giles B. Avery, is inexpressible, if we
                                should not say irreparable. My intimate acquaintance has tended to deepen my love and
                                affection for him. Zion is passing through the fiery furnace, and who shall be able to
                                stand? And the answer comes, the pure and upright. You may have heard of the death of my
                                companion to England and Scotland�Elder Robert Aitken. An experience with him has
                                increased a sincere love and affection for him, as a Believer, and a zealous advocate of
                                all that tends to the true resurrection life.

                                received. It came just in time to enhance the pleasure of social and spiritual union
                                which we all have a privilege to enjoy on Thanksgiving Day. Thank you for the timely
                                gift. As it lay before me I thought I would like to reply in a communication of the
                                thoughts that were then occvipying my mind, but time did not permit, however, I can do
                                so now hoping I shall not intrude upon your busy moments. The main point in view is
                                concerning this very day, (Thanksgiving Day) the inauguration of which was prompted by a
                                worthy and religious sentiment but which appointment was dictated and controlled by
                                civil power from the beginning. It was a God-in-the-Constitution power that was
                                exercised; the same element from which so many in the early days sought to escape when
                                they fled from their native countries, but which they unconsciously brought with them
                                and planted in a new land. As you well know, Thanksgiving Day is chiefly an American
                                institution. After the first harvest of the New England colonists in the year 1621,
                                Governor Bradford made provision for their rejoicing specially together with praise and
                                prayer. In 1623 a day of fasting and prayer in the midst of drought was changed into
                                thanksgiving by the coming of rain during the prayers; gradually the custom prevailed of
                                appointing such a day annually after harvest by proclamation of the governors of the
                                several New England states, which though a good thing savored of usurpation. During the
                                Revolution a day of national thanksgiving was annually recommended by Congress, the
                                question is, to whom did their offerings ascend? Was it to the Jewish God of war? or Was
                                it to the Christian God of love and peace? Surely, the true God of those noble men who
                                made us sons and daughters of liberty, could not approve of battle and bloodshed, though
                                He may have judged well of the intents of their hearts. Washington recommended such a
                                day after the adoption of the constitution, an act of direct disobedience in the face of
                                the great American charter Avhich in every point was intended to- enfranchise the
                                conscience as well as the state of a new and prospering people. He did well in his day
                                and time, but, as a civil officer had no right to dictate in religious affairs and on
                                that account we do not feel to cast the least shadow upon his memory, for to him and his
                                infidel cotemporaries do we owe our existence as Shaker Communities. I have never known
                                that there were any penalties or punishments put upon those who did not comply, and all
                                have had the freedom of assembling in their various places of worship as the different
                                sects were wont to do. Some x'eople excuse and license the matter by saying that it is
                                only a recommendation, but when it goes forth from the executive mansion phrased in the
                                following manner: "By the power invested in me, I do hereby appoint or designate
                                Thursday" etc., it sounds very much like a command. Only since Lincoln's time has it
                                become a fixed custom all over the country. Modern thought and agitation might correct
                                the matter only for the predominence of Ro-<pb n="35" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> man Catholic power
                                which seeks to rule; lnxt they to whom the nature of such evils has| been revealed, work
                                ardently if by any means the right may finally prevail. Another point in relation to
                                this subject is this: instead of its being a day of praise, thanksgiving and beneficence
                                as was at first intended, it has been turned into a day of physical feasting; and for
                                some time previous there are preparations made, not for devotion to the Giver of all our
                                blessings, but for gluttonous and riotous living, and instead of giving to the poor,
                                much substance is wasted in the payment of doctor's bills consequent upon indiscretion
                                in this direction; very much like Christmas celebrations which in their extravagance and
                                alimentive gratification, teach very little of the birth and life of Jesus which they
                                intend to commemorate, and impress the mind very little with the spirit and baptism of
                                Christ. Whatever the church may do, it does not balance or hold in control the animal
                                appetite. Festival enjoyments have become a custom of the ages, but to eat and drink to
                                excess is a very crude expression of a moral sentiment. You refer to the gauzy mantle of
                                snow barely covering the ground, that same Sabbath in this place it was solid drapery,
                                eight inches thick, and beautiful beyond description. We had a little girl here at one
                                time, four years of age, who went to the window soon after a gentle and delightful
                                snow-storm and observing a lilac shrub, she turned to me and exclaimed: "A splendid
                                raisin pudding! don't you know?" It was a perfect and pretty comparison. I remember when
                                I was a little girl and wondered where the snow came from, how they told me it was the
                                old woman shaking her feather beds. I did not believe it because I thought they could
                                not afford such a waste of feathers, even in heaven. It always seemed to me to be more
                                proper to teach a child the simple truth as far as wisdom approved, and the child was
                                capable of understanding it; thus save time and expense of eradicating false ideas in
                                after years, no matter how poetical or pleasing they may have been to the childish
                                fancy. I thank you for the cold proof love you sent me. I suppose it has in its formula
                                the same combinations that the "preventive ounce" has. I have faith in it and believe it
                                will far surpass in effect all the pounds of cure that were ever weighed or measured. I
                                believe in mind over matter, and in rising above physical ailments, but I find, too
                                often, that in the contest between the two, mind becomes subservient to matter. The
                                following is what we find in an exchange attributed to Dr. Lyman Abbott of Brooklyn
                                concerning "Faith Cure:" "When I get sick I will show my faith in God by securing the
                                best doctor I can find, getting the best human skill, and following the directions given
                                me by a good physician. Faith does not consist in refusing to take medicine, but it is
                                the using of all the means of cure which is given us to use, and medicine has been shown
                                to be one of those means." I positively disagree with him, I have little or no
                                confidence in any of the medical systems, save Hygiene, plenty of water, bathing, pure
                                air and simple diet. This is the right plan for preserving health or curing disease.
                                Faith joined to good works and good sense will prove the greatest benefit. Yea, my
                                loving companion, let us pray together and in each other's behalf, that we may form two
                                bright links in the golden chain that will connect us with the heavens. Let us be true
                                and keep the faith once delivered to the saints. Please accept the love of the Sisters
                                for yourself and family, and many wishes for a Happy New Year. Your Sister,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bowers, Lucy S." TEIform="persName"/>Lucy S.

                                Since the publication of our last number of the Manifesto...
                            </head><p TEIform="p">Since the publication of our last number of the Manifesto, the voice of mourning has been
                                heard, more than usual, in our Community. To be overtaken by sudden disappointment in
                                the loss of some choice treasure, may in turn, be the result of deep sorrow, and far
                                deeper than this, is that loss which deprives us of the earthly presence of one whom we
                                have known for many years as a faithful, unwearied spiritual guide and protector. This
                                sudden transfer, even to spirit home, awakens our sympathy and we mourn the loss to a
                                part or to our whole Zion. The soul's journey of exploration is a subject over which
                                there has been endless speculations. To dwell upon these would be as time thrown away,
                                and the" satisfaction to be derived, would, at the best, be ephemeral. Our pleasure, our
                                interest and our spiritual compensation is largely centered in that which surrounds us
                                in our gospel home, while dwelling upon the earth. This is the beginning of our
                                eternity, our heavenly manifestation in which is to be found the hope of the
                                resurrection in Christ. It is our peaceful prosperity as men and women while fulfilling
                                our mission in the duties of life. To disturb this soul communion agitates our whole
                                being and changes, essentially, the current of our earthly and heavenly anticipations.
                                Our recession from the body through that God-given transition which some call death,
                                into another and more exalted sphere of existence, although it may be only as the
                                passing from one room into another, is liable to so affect us, as mourners, that we
                                quite forget the position we had previously accepted. The soul that is made alive in
                                Christ can never die, and to pass from the activities of this realm, and to escape from
                                mortality, is that these same activities may be resumed in the City of our God. To be
                                thus suddenly transferred to the heavenly kingdom, awakens our sympathy for those who
                                suffer directly as well as for those througha<pb n="37" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> out our whole Zion
                                home, even though we readily admit that there is great rejoicing in the accession to the
                                invisible throng. It would seem that the cry of� "Come over and help us" is the voice to
                                be heard in both worlds. We know that it has ever been the urgent petition of the Sons
                                and Daughters of God and can never be laid aside so long as there are souls that need
                                instruction in the testimony of our Lord, Jesus Christ. In this is embodied the wisdom
                                that comes from above, which is first pure and then peaceable, which spiritually, is to
                                become as a little child, trusting, obedient and teachable ; an operation in the
                                moulding of minds that requires a prayerful spirit, and a strong faith in the efficacy
                                of the gospel work to accomplish the desired result. Although the mind of a selfish,
                                animal man may be prone to evil, and may be the offspring of those who have for
                                generations pursued the same low standard of morality, yet as we see through faith, the
                                "silver lining" to every cloud, we may in the same manner see a germ of growing humanity
                                which may by constant care, develop into an image of the Son or Daughter of God. It may
                                not be possible to count the number of years that have already passed over this world,
                                and the evolutions and revolutions that have been made in order to accomplish the
                                development which we find in mankind, and yet there are seers who are penetrating the
                                long avenues of eternal progress and find man far in advance of any who are upon the
                                earth at the present time. Is it a wonder that "those who have tasted of the good word
                                of God and the powers of the world to come,'* that those who can make even a faint
                                estimate of the progress already made in the mind, should be anxious to assist others in
                                the same good work ? To make on earth what we all believe God intended from the
                                beginning ;�a Paradise of Peace ! Whether in the body or in the land of souls, it must
                                be the same progressive work of God, and it is quite essential that the soul work be
                                well done on earth and ready for its increase in the celestial kinodom.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">On account of the many articles received, having reference to the life work of our beloved

                                got fairly started in the New Year. The Old, passed out in grief, the New came in with
                                affliction and mourning. Still, we have very much to comfort us, and a great deal to be
                                thankful for. It was my privilege to attend the funeral of Beloved Elder Giles, at
                                Watervliet; what a contrast between the condition there one hundred and six years ago,
                                and now. Then they had little room in their houses but an abundance in their hearts.
                                They now lack neither in hearts nor houses : but something is wanting, not only at
                                Watervliet, but throughout Zion. May the Lord who knoweth our needs, hasten the time
                                when they can all be supplied. There is a great difference between the practices of a
                                people and the vital principles that sustain the spiritual life in the body. Sometimes
                                it would almost seem that the habits and practices of the early Believers were looked
                                upon as vital principles on which the life and permanency of our gospel institution
                                depended. There ought to be wisdom in our enlightened day, to discern between practice
                                and principle; and whether our prac tices are in accord with, or in violation o: gospel
                                principles. If we come to a knowledge tliat our practice violates principle's essential
                                to our salvation, either spiritual or physical, we ought to possess enough of the power
                                of self-denial to cease such practices, and not go blundering along, stumbling at the
                                cross. The older Believers were all in the practice of shaving, and for many years no
                                one could find a union to the body of Believers unless they conformed to this habit. Any
                                one allowing his beard to grow, was as effectually shut out of union, as if he would not
                                confess his sins. Shaving was looked upon practically as being essential to salvation:
                                the wearing of the beard, as a violation of gospel principle. Shaving was the universal
                                practice in all England and America a century ago, and I can remember that only forty
                                years ago any one wearing his beard was accounted as crazy. All Believers conformed to
                                this practice of the world: and in that particular, took no heed to Rom. xii., 2.
                                Salvation and protection from the power of sin and self-indulgence that leads to
                                sickness, disease and death, physically or spiritually, should be our constant aim. The
                                human race to-day need physical salvation; they need bodily health and strength as a
                                basis upon which to build the kingdom of heaven upon earth. Jesus in all his
                                ministration recognized this, for he spent a large part of his time in healing the sick.
                                Some very good people and professing Christians have thought and taught that the gospel
                                had little or nothing to do with the life that now is, it was only to prepare people for
                                the life that was to come. "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, (in our bodies)
                                as it is done in heaven:" in purified spirits. This is the great day of judgment and no
                                soul in Zion should rest till he feels the judgment work going on in his soul. Search
                                out the causes that produce evil effects and good effects. By the cross and self-denial
                                put away the evil, and by strict obedience to faith, in the spirit of prayer, cultivate
                                the good. We have had a fine spell of winter weather and have improved it. Now it is<pb n="39" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> raining, and the sleighing is fast running away. A good time to
                                look after tools and machines and have them ready for use when spring opens. Let us all
                                be found faithful; be up and alive, prepared for each season as it rolls round. We shall
                                then have more time to cultivate brotherly and sisterly love. D. Offord.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hancock, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Hancock, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p">Dear Editor: In our locality we are realizing the benefits of a good old fashioned
                                winter. The earth is slumbering under a heavy covering of snow, and the ponds and
                                reservoirs wear a coat of ice some eighteen inches in thickness, of which our Brethren
                                have secured a good supply for future needs. We think the Knickerbocker Co. will not be
                                necessitated to come to Berkshire for ice this season. In contemplating the changing
                                events of time, these poetical lines occur to mind. "As time rolls on new things we see
                                Which seldom with us do agree; Its now and then a pleasant day 'Tis long a coming, soon
                                away." We find, however, exceptions to this, for we enjoyed a very pleasant Christmas
                                and in our morning service realized that fulness of blessing, which Christ is ready to
                                impart to the sincere seeker after righteousness. The New Year came to us with a beaming
                                face, but our hearts had been made sad by the unexpected announcement of the death of a
                                loved Father in Israel, Elder Giles. Who can estimate his worth or fill his vacant
                                place? We mourn with those who mourn, and mingle our tears with those who weep. On the
                                8th. inst. a company of us were privileged to accept a kind invitation that had been
                                tendered us by our Mount Lebanon friends of the First Order, to make them a visit. The day
                                was beautiful, but cold and the cordial welcome we received, the hospitality, kindness
                                and attention shown us by all,' was duly appreciated, and will ever be gratefully
                                remembered. J. L.

                                we did not constantly exert ourselves to rise; it is only the faint-hearted who are kept
                                down. Truly noble minds overcome all things, but it requires effort. Perseverance is
                                essential to success. "Joys and sorrows alike are sent To give the soul fit
                                nourishment." Let the winds blow cold and chill as they may, we can still cherish the
                                warm sunshine of God's eternal love in our hearts, and bend willingly to the duties that
                                lie in our pathway. We should be social and spiritual beings, and we must benefit others
                                all we can, for we shall be sure to receive as much good as we give. Poultry is a
                                subject which will never be exhausted by those who like the business, but how to make it
                                pay is a question that everyone is not able to answer. Economy is one of the foundation
                                stones on which to build success. There must be a close attention to details, a constant
                                looking after the little things which seem at first almost too insignificant to notice,
                                if one would be successful in poultry raising. A little neglect here and there, too much
                                food to-day, and not enough to-morrow, count for a good deal in the long run, and always
                                on the wrong side of the balance sheet. Warmth and cleanliness are as essential as food.
                                Success in poultry means hard work and plenty of it, with a good deal of judgment. D.

Dear Editor:�-Christmas has come and gone, and with it we have had some
                                sorrow mixed with our joy. The sad intelligence of the death of our beloved Elder Giles,
                                swept over us like a thick fog, almost paralyzing the body as well as the spirit. An
                                acquaintance of thirty-two years, while residing in the same family at Mount Lebanon,
                                taught us to love him as one of the dearest of gospel fathers. Our Christmas was made
                                pleasant by a beautiful meeting, and many of our loved ones from beyond the river came
                                to greet us with messages of love.<pb n="40" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> Santa Claus did not forget to
                                make us a short call, and the family were interested to see what he had brought. The
                                story was told at about 2. P. M. when many were made glad. We are just finishing the
                                cutting of 100, 000 ft. of lumber. Our stock of fine wood for 1891 is nearly all hauled,
                                preparatory to sawing. This evening we had quite a surprise. After a gentle tap on the
                                door, in walked our school teacher, Frances Dempsey, with a beautiful banner awarded the
                                school for the besi attendance of any school in the town of Harvard. This has been the
                                talk of the little ones ever since it was presented. On the 3rd. inst. a large company
                                went from Harvard to attend the funeral of Br. Lorenzo Prouty, in Shirley. Our Sisters

                                only century we have personal experience with, and we wonder just now what the last ten
                                of the coming one hundred years will bring to life and prove to man. Vast truths will be
                                unfolded in the spiritual, physical, scientific and political worlds truths unseen and
                                unheard-of by earth'i inhabitants of yesterday. The wonderful to-morrows! how
                                fathomless, without center or circumference. The yesterdays were mighty, the to-days
                                still mightier, the to-morrows will be the mightiest of all. Sunday, the 4th. inst.,
                                "Memorial Services" were observed by the Society in honor of our departed Minister,
                                Elder Giles B. Avery, whose beautiful life was feelingly recalled through the hymns and
                                speaking, all expressive and in harmony with the occasion. We have read with interest
                                the leading article in the recent Manifesto "Woman's Mission," by Eldress Anna White,
                                and we wish every reader on this broad planet would read and study it with eyes and ears

                                while we were reading the spirit side of said article we earnestly wished that the
                                venerable prophet Elder Frederick W. Evans would catch an inspiration to take the first
                                train bound for Western New York, locating his headquarters at Sonyea, Livingston Co.,
                                N. Y. We are fully persuaded that great benefits might be derived in this town and
                                surrounding country by a few lectures from the inspired evangelist, orator and preacher.

Deak Manifesto ;�We are now having a Southern Ohio winter. Christmas was a
                                joyful pleasant time all day. We had a very good meeting and the singing was more than
                                usually inspiring. Little gifts were changing hands and the sentiment in their
                                presentation was, "Peace on earth and good-will to men." [See angel's song in the fields
                                near Bethlehem; Luke ii., 8-14.] I read ten chapters in St. Luke on Christmas morning.
                                In the evening we had a pleasant Christmas social. Eeadings, Recitations and Dialogues;
                                the best singing I have heard for a good while. Recess. Candy, cakes, lemonade, popcorn,
                                peanuts, etc., etc. Everybody pleased and satisfied. We had a good dinner on Christmas,
                                but O this thing of slaughtering the poor turkeys to satisfy the appetites of the larger
                                animal man.<pb n="41" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> Bad business this. It will not always do for Shakers,
                                eh? [Guess not. Ed.] However, we did not mean any harm if we did make graveyards of our
                                stomachs. So "Eise Peter, kill and eat and call not thou unclean, that which God hath
                                cleansed." [Peter did not have any turkeys. Ed.] Still after Peter's 1800 years
                                experience I am sure he would preach a vegetable diet, both for health and purity's
                                sake, if he was now on earth. We held Sister Malinda's funeral on the 26th at 2-30 P. M.
                                Nine or ten persons spoke and all very feelingly. I never attended a more edifying or
                                spiritual funeral. We have made nearly four miles of good fence this year and have
                                thoroughly repaired our Laundry. Twelve hundred fruit trees which we set out this year
                                are nearly all nourishing. Elder Joseph stands this climate a great deal better than the
                                piercing winds of New England. School closes to tide over the Christmas holidays and to
                                break up a monotony in the pupils. Begin again on Monday after New Year's day. Are

Cold weather is a constant visitor here. The Mercury has been 10 degrees
                                below zero. We harvested 122 tons of ice in four and one fourth days. This supplies our
                                family and also two of our neighbors who carry on dairy farms. The ice was eighteen
                                inches thick. Our aged brother Thomas Noyes who has reached the age of 11 years, is now
                                very sick with a severe cold, threatened with fever, and all are anxiously praying for
                                his recovery. What could we do without our brother Thomas! He came into this Society
                                about thirty years ago, and has always been faithful and consecrated. He is much loved
                                by every one, for a more pleasant, genial person it would be hard to find. For years he
                                has tended our grist mill, prepared and brought in the wood for the family dwelling and
                                cooking departments, also built the first fires in the morning half of the time. Our
                                venerable brother Samuel Kendrick says: he has not been so well since his trip to the
                                Granite State but his cheerful appearance bespeaks the contrary. We are drinking the
                                bitter cup with our Brethren and Sisters in other Societies, that our good Elder Giles
                                has passed away. He has gone, like Jesus, to prepare a place for us. A. S.

                                that we have purchased a new laundry engine at our family, the old one being played out.
                                We have been drawing wood for fuel. It requires about 50 cords of wood for our family
                                one year. We put a new floor in our horse barn and it is improved by it. We had a very

                                the Center families went to Union Village on the 9th of December to purchase two
                                holstein cattle. We are having about 500 rails made and about 60 cords of wood put up

                                death of our beloved Father and friend Elder Giles. Words fail to express our sorrow and
                                anguish, for his death is a great bereavement to us all. We especially sympathize with
                                our beloved and venerable parents of the Order, and pray that a host of angels may
                                continually minister unto them. Dear Sister,<pb n="42" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> we gladly re-echo the

                                in reality. In our earnest endeavor to succeed, we will "Take Faith and Hope and Love on

                                "Angels in the way" we shall find plenty to fill our measure of happiness. Christmas

                                Walking was quite dangerous. Amid the great havoc, we also found the beautiful; every
                                little plant was encased in its icy home. Looking from our window we have a beautiful
                                view. No grander sight, ever met the eye, especially at sunrise and sunset. New Year's
                                eve, 7 P. M. our youth and children gave a pleasant and successful entertainment;
                                duration three hours. The serious and laughable were so interblended as to please all.
                                Great credit is due Br. Eobert Kendrick, Sisters, Jane Sutton and Mary E. Settles as

                                Joseph Slingerland and Elder O. C. Hampton. We regret that they could not remain longer,

                            Cor. iv., 18. To cultivate the intellectual faculties, to aspire after moral excellence, to
                            devote the active powers to the glory of the Creator and the benefit of mankind, to live as
                            strangers and pilgrims upon this transitory scene, to keep the eye constantly fixed on the
                            realities of an immortal life, is characteristic of a small part of humanity, although it
                            may be admitted of the highest importance and wisdom to make the temporal subservient to the
                            spiritual. With the vast majority of those who throng the great thoroughfare of life,
                            present enjoyment seems the ultimate end of their efforts. Some have set their<pb n="43" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> hearts upon the acquisition of wealth, their minds are continually racked by
                            new schemes, their bodies wearied with the effort required for the realization of their
                            golden dreams. No sacrifice is thought too much. They will forego comfort and convenience
                            and occasionally refuse the claims of friendship. To build and increase is their motto,
                            despite the storms and winds and tempests, which now so often sweep away the palaces and
                            treasures that are resting on sandy foundations, leaving scarcely a trace of their
                            existence. Of what account is it to have the name engraved a little higher than some other.
                            The tablet which bears the name of earth's honored ones is perishable. Better to have that
                            "new name" written which shall stand forever. A well known cardinal once sought distinction
                            at the court of his king. He found it; but the sad words that appear at the close of his
                            eventful history. "Had I been as diligent to serve my God as I have to please my king, He
                            would not have forsaken me now in my old age." How important that there be something to show
                            a fidelity in the gospel work, that we may claim the reward. We are living for eternity.

Wickersham.) He who does the best he can is always
                                    improving. His best of yesterday is outdone to-day, and his best of to-day will be
                                    outdone to-morrow. It is this steady progress, no matter from what point it starts
                                    that forms the chief element of all greatness and goodness. Without love life is
                                    scarcely worth living; with it, the worst blows of fortune fall comparatively
                                    muffled and harmless. So long as we love and are beloved, we can bear the whips and
                                    stings with stoical equanimity. When love fails us, or the beloved is taken from us,
                                    then is our armor of pride, our defense and our safeguard gone. The exercise of
                                    every faculty is necessary to its development, and therefore to its life. Inaction,
                                    fully carried out, means stagnation and death. On the other hand over-exercise of
                                    any part tends to exhaustion, and, if the period of rest necessary to restore its
                                    vigor be denied, it will wear itself out. Health and happiness require that these
                                    laws be recognized and obeyed. Every man has his faults, his failings,
                                    peculiarities, eccentricities, and every one of us finds himself crossed by such
                                    failings of others from hour to hour and if he were to resent them all, life would
                                    be intolerable. If for every outburst of hasty temper and for every rudeness that
                                    wounds us in our daily path we were to demand an apology, require an explanation, or
                                    resent it by retaliation, daily intercourse would be impossible. The very science of
                                    social life consists in that gliding tact which avoids contact with the sharp
                                    angularities of character, which does not argue about such things, does not seek to
                                    adjust or cure them all, but covers them as if it did not see. There is but one
                                    thing which can make the sight of the past really pleasant to us and that is
                                    diligent use of the present; the past will take care of itself, but if we fritter
                                    away precious time, lose opportunities and are unfaithful to ourselves and to
                                    others, memory must be forever embittered. Chances once lost are lost forever. Much
                                    may be done in later life to make up for the loss of early opportunities, but never
                                    can we make it untrue that the early opportunity which was lost can come no more
                                    back. If a man should learn his alphabet at fifty, it would still be true that he
                                    had lost for fifty years the pleasure and benefits of reading. The early years
                                    cannot be frittered awTay without making us weaker men to the end of our lives than
                                    we might have been. The important opportunities which are gone are gone beyond
                                    recall. We can never make up for the loss of them. All growth in knowledge and
                                    character is attained through the individual joys and acts of life. This growth

Psa. cxix.,
                            104. This saying emanated, no doubt, from the spirit of Christ, the psalmist David being the
                            inspired medium through whom it was revealed. The spirit of Christ is opposed to every kind
                            of falsity. "T am the way," said Jesus, "the truth and the life." His people being filled
                            with his spirit, speak words of truth and soberness and are pained to witness the depravity,
                            the deceit and misrepresentation so prevalent among mankind, as evidenced in the matter of
                            buying and selling. "It is nought, it is nought," saith the buyer, but when he has gone his
                            way, then he boasteth, and the vender is equally unscrupulous as I have sometimes found to
                            my sorrow and disappointment. Let us be mindful at all times that "A false balance is an
                            abomination to the Lord ; but a just weight is his delight." Prov. xi., 1. "All things
                            whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law"
                            and justice seems to require it. The requirements of the gospel are plain, simple and easy
                            to understand. There is no need of any professing ignorance as to their duty. Just let them
                            consent to do God's will and they will soon know of the doctrine and become wise unto
                            salvation.

                                    other day: A large share of the men and boys who are incarcerated in our state
                                    prisons and penetentiaries are there because they did not have proper discipline in
                                    the family, and were allowed by over indulgence to play truant instead of attending
                                    school, and therefore received n&gt; school discipline. Often when I have been asked
                                    what- are the causes of particular crimes that send most of our men to prison I have
                                    of late years invariably answered: "The want of family discipline." The indulgence
                                    of the father and mother, who allow the child to grow up without any discipline to
                                    form character, leads almost inevitably to evil ways and consequently to prison. The
                                    child even of tender years who is indulged in its natural waywardness and who is
                                    allowed to say to its father and mother "I Avill" or '-I won't" is in a fair way to
                                    become an inmate of our penal institutions. The intelligent child when deceived by
                                    its parents in small things is likely to form evil habits which in its future life
                                    will not be easily eradicated.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="R. P. journal" TEIform="index"/>R. P.

                            us that the night is past. Like a flood of inspirational life and power it comes to the
                            weary and worn toiler in the valley. Courage and strength is renewed. Ministering angels are
                            ascending and descending the shining way, telling the indwellers of ea-th that a new day is
                            dawning. The false systems that have become fossilized and mummified, offer no inducements
                            to the awakening thought of the age. Give us light that we may clearly see the way and the
                            duty we owe to the cause and to our fellow men; and courage to follow that light is the
                            Macedonian cry given in tones that indicate earnestness of purpose. The spirit of the
                            iconoclast is abroad. In the words of the poet Whittier� "All grim with toil and brown with
                            tan, I saw a strong one in his wrath; Smiting the (iodless shrines of man Along his path."
                            Bgfore this grand superstructure, revealed by the light of the coming day, can be dedicated
                            to the cause of the spiritual unfoldment of man, the rubbish of ages must be removed. The
                            demolishers cannot at all times be the builders ; but their mission is a necessary one for
                            human unfoldment. We cannot accept the Agnosticism of the Ingersoll school of thinkers. It
                            is as twilight as compared to the noonday sun. But the terrific onslaughts they are making
                            on the citadel of antichristian creeds and dogmas is beginning to be felt in their weakening
                            power and hold upon mankind. The pendulum's swing is at present in the direction of a
                            materialistic train of thought. Charity and forbearance should be extended to those honest
                            souls, who, reared in the school of dogmatic theology, are at present on the sea of doubt,
                            by those who have been spiritually illuminated. From an editorial in "Christian Science
                            Thought" for June 1890 we quote the following prophetic words. i;On every hand are the signs
                            of the new dispensation which is shortly to assert its sway on earth. Celestial societies
                            whose song is peace on earth and good will to men, are now organizing their earthly choirs,
                            and we shall soon hear that divine song sung by pure unselfish bands of faithful followers
                            of the good in every clime." The beginning of a new reformation is at hand in the religious,
                            social, political and industrial world. As much as the nineteenth century is in advance of
                            the sixteenth in the material comforts for the masses, so will the new reformation eclipse
                            the old in its deeper spiritual enlightenment and the possibilities that are unfolding to
                            the soul of man of a higher and more exalted destiny than at present has been revealed to
                            him. The immutable law of growth or decay is stamped upon all human institutions. "Upward
                            the star of empire takes its way." In the ever unfolding cycle of advance thought, all dead
                            and decaying matter must be cast away. Wrong will die of its own inherent weakness. "Truth
                            crushed to earth will rise again, The eternal years of God are hers; While error wounded,
                            writhes with pain And dies among her worshipers." Groveland, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our largest bell" TEIform="index"/> Our Largest Bell.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">The largest bell in America is that of Notre Dame Cathedral, Montreal, which

                                of the CHTUSRCH. The mission chapel has become a kitchen where the church does its
                                sloppy work. Hundreds and thousands of churches in tins country�gorgeously built and
                                supported�that even on bright and sunshiny days are half full of worshipers, and yet
                                they are building mission cha,pels, because by some expressed or implied regulation the
                                great masses of the people are kept out of the main audience room. Now, I say that any
                                place of worship which is appropriate for one class is appropriate for all classes. Let
                                the rich and the poor meet together the Lord, the Maker of them all. Mind you, I say
                                that mission chapels are a necessity, the way churches are now conducted; but may God
                                speed the time when they shall cease to be a necessity. God will rise up and break down
                                the gates of the churches that have kept back the masses. And woe be to those who stand
                                in the way! They will be trampled under foot by the vast populations making a stampede

Dobbins' Electric Soap.
THE   BEST    FAMILY   SOAP
���IN    THE WORLD.�- - - - - - - - -II is Strictly Pure, Uniform in Quality,
THE original formula for which we paid $50,000
twenty years ago has never been modified or
changed in the, slightest. This soap is
identical in quality to-day with that
in ado years ago.
T T contains nothing- that can injure
JL the finest fabric.   It brightens colors
and bleaches whites.
IT washes flannels and blankets  as  no  other
soap in the world does�without  shrinking�
leaving them soft and white and like new.
READ THIS TWICE.
THERE is a g'reat oaring' of time, of labor,
of soap, of fuel, and of the fabric, where
Dobbins' Electric Soap is used according- to directions.
AICE trial will demonstrate its great merit.
U It will pay you to make that trial.
LIKE all west thing's, it is extensively imitated and counterfeited.
Beware^of^Imitations.
INSIST upon Sobbing' Electric.   Don't take
Magnetic, Electro-Magic, Philadelphia Electric,
or any other fraud, simply because it is cheap.   They
will ruin clothes, and are dear at any price.   Ask for
?X>oOcxx DOBBINS'     ELECTRIC. XXXX^Oofc
and take no other.   Nearly every grocer from Maine
to Mexico keeps it in stock.   If yours hasn't it, he
will order from his nearest wholesale grocer.
READ carefully the inside wrapper around each
bar, and be careful to follow directions
on each outside wrapper.   You cannot afford
to wait longer before trying for yourself this old, reliable, and truly wonderful
ins' # Electric * Soap.
