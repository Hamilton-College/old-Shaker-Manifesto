"ELTA" AND CHARLES LAMB.
A unique genius, that of Charles Lamb. Just
like nothing that ever appeared before them, or has
since appeared, are the quaint and delightful " Essays of Biia," a new edition of which lias recently
been issued by Alden, "The Literary Revolution"
publisher of New York. Turn to any of your cyclopedias .and they will tell you that Charles Lamb was
one of the most charming essayists that the English
language has ever known, and also that his " Essays
of Elia" are the choicest of his works. They are
not merely the first work of their class, but, like
" Pilgrim's Progress " and ".Robinson Crusoe," they
constitute a class by themselves. The volume is
certainly one of the most delightful of the books
described in Mr. Alden's 148 page illustrated catalogue, which he offers to send for 4 cents, or the
16-page catalogue which is sent free. Address,

                            Blinri. More than a century has already passed since the witnesses of this gospel testimony
                            received the revelation of the word of God. It became an inspirational fire in their souls,
                            and carried them into an element so far above that which was earthly and sensual that they
                            freely consecrated their lives to the gospel cause. In this, they were able, more
                            effectually to become the servants of the living God. It was not a new order of life to be a
                            witness of the truth; the world has been favored with this class from the days of "
                            righteous Abel," and the spirit that leads men to recognize the humaDity of man, has
                            gradually won a permanent place in the race. Judges, prophets and apostles have all been
                            active workers to establish the religious element among men and to make their lives one of
                            practical righteousness. It was a work that came as gradually as the rising of the morning
                            sun,1 and like that beautiful gift from the hand of God, its light and warmth gave hope and
                            courage to those who were watching and praying for a full deliverance from the entanglements
                            of a worldly life. Many have desired to see the day that would bring to them the gift of
                            salvation, and the power of the holy Spirit, which would enable them to walk in the
                            testimony of Christ Jesus. The publishing of God's word, from<pb n="74" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> the first
                            message, has awakened the spirit of persecution, and these witnesses of this last great work
                            were destined, as those before them, to walk in the midst of deep sorrow. Jesus was a
                            witness of God, in advance of either Moses or John the Baptist and taught a more beautiful
                            ideal of Deity; and a far more consistent form of duty for man to exercise toward man. The
                            inspiration of th's wonderful gift of God that had illumined the mind of Jesus was signally
                            revived in the life of Ann Lee, and by her it was denominated a revelation from our Heavenly
                            Father. Like every religious dispensation that had been revealed, it had to encounter much
                            cruel opposition. The self-denial which was demanded of the order, separated them from the
                            world and the legitimate result of this act was, as has been testified by Jesus,�"Ye are not
                            of the world, therefore the world hateth you." Ann Lee and the Elders experienced this fact,
                            as the record of their gospel travel so vividly represents. Ann Lee was born in Manchester,
                            England, Feb. 29, 1736.f In 1758 she accepted the testimony of James and Jane Wardley, who
                            wrere the leaders of a small society, and preached an honest confession of their sins, and
                            bore a full cross against all that they knew to be wrong. In 1770 Ann Lee was cast into
                            prison by the dominant English church members with the hope of suppressing the testimony
                            which she held before the world. In this prison she received a deeper revelation of the
                            divine Presence, fThe incidents of her early life may be found in a work entitled, " The
                            Millennial Church." Price 00 cts., or in the " Life of Ann Lee." Price 10 cts. and on
                            returning to her Society, she made known to them the revelation she had received, and was
                            accepted as their spiritual leader, and Mother in Christ; and from this time she was known
                            to them as Mother Ann Lee. On the 19th. of May, 1774, Mother Ann with eight others of
                            correspondingfaith, left England, and after a stormy and dangerous passage of two months and
                            seventeen days, reached the city of New York. In 177G this little company moved into the
                            wilderness of Watervliet, seven miles from the city of Albany, and formed a settlement. They
                            toiled diligently, in this new home, making improvements in their dwellings and lands, and
                            in providing a comfortable subsistence for themselves and their friends. In this work they
                            received encouragement from Mother Ann, that, "God is about to raise up a people, here, in
                            America, who will serve Him and honor the gospel." The new converts expected from day to
                            day, to see the fulfillment of this prophecy, but as it delayed its coming from month to
                            month, they grew weary of waiting and became more or less discouraged. Mother Ann, above all
                            others, maintained her confidence in the promises of God, and spoke words of patience and
                            courage to the little family, for, said she, "The appointed time will come, and that time
                            draws nigh. God has not sent us into this land, in vain. Our mission is to preach the gospel
                            of Christ." Mother Ann now recommended the Brethren to add largely to their store of
                            provisions, which called forth this enquiry, " What is to be done with all<pb n="75" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> this, seeing we are so retired from the world, and have so small prospect of any company
                            to consume it?" This manifestation of a reasonable doubt was soon expelled by Mother Ann,
                            who replied, " We shall have a great deal of company, before the close of another year. I
                            see large numbers of people coming, and they will accept and obey the gospel. " The summer
                            passed on without any special change in the family of Believers. Visions and revelations
                            were the only comforting assurances that they now received of the promised revival. The
                            severity of a northern winter settled down upon them and they could not expect, at this
                            inclement season of the year to be able to do much moi-e than to provide themselves with
                            security against the pitiless storms that were sure to visit them. From time to time they
                            were encouraged to wait with patience, as Mother Ann said to them,�" I certainly know the
                            time of gathering will come, and it is near at hand. " This anxiety manifested by the
                            Believers, was by no means, peculiar to them. Many of those who watch and pray are liable to
                            faint if hope is long deferred. This same anxiety filled the minds of the disciples as Jesus
                            spoke to them of the wonderful things that would take place in the city of Jerusalem. "Tell
                            us," said they, "when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign of their coming, and
                            of the end of the world ? " In one of the hours of anxiety and suffering which Mother Ann
                            seemed destined to share, she cried out in her anguish as she stood by the creek, that ran
                            by the side of their dwelling. " O that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air and
                            all things that have life and breath, yea all the trees of the forest and grass of the
                            fields would pray to God for me. " These words were accompanied with tears and heart felt
                            agony, and all who were present shared in the same gift. Those who came to America with
                            Mother Ann, expected that the gospel testimony would soon be preached and then accepted by
                            the people of this country. But after waiting several years, without the addition of one
                            individual to the faith, they were brought under trials and doubts. Mother Ann's confidence
                            in God, was unshaken and she would often encourage the others to be patient, and wait till
                            the appointed time. She would say, " O my dear children ! hold fast and be not discouraged.
                            God has not sent us to this land in vain, but he has sent us to bring the gospel of Christ
                            to this nation, and many will embrace it, for the time draws nigh. " The winter of 1779,
                            however, passed away, with only a very faint ray of hope but with the coming of Spring, came
                            new life. They soon learned that the spirit of a religious revival had accomplished a
                            wonderful work in several or the towns near the Believers, and the people now began to come
                            in large companies to visit the little family in the woods of Watervliet, to hear the gospel
                            preached and to learn what they should do to be saved.

TEIform="persName"/>HENRY B. BEAR.</byline><p TEIform="p"> What is the gospel ? It is written ; "The gospel of Christ is the power of God unto
                            salvation to every one that believeth." Horn, i., 16. I would add, believeth the gospel
                            correctly, and obeyeth it conscientiously. We might also inquire,�What is salvation ? To be
                            saved from sin and condemnation. In other words, to be raised to a state of happiness. If we
                            are brought down to a state of unhappiness by whomsoever, or by whatever means, then the
                            gospel has not saved us. Full salvation must guarantee constant happiness. It must not
                            depend upon the actions of other persons, or on circumstances not of our own creating. If
                            the actions of others changes our happiness to a state of unhappiness, then, certainly, we
                            are under the power of those that can change our condition. We are not yet made free by the
                            power of the gospel. We cannot, by the power of the gospel, change the disposition of
                            another to harass and afflict us. If not, where is our remedy to become free from that power
                            which we cannot control, and which robs us of our crown of happiness? It must, nevertheless,
                            be in the gospel. The only way to become free, is to get a correct knowledge of the gospel,
                            and render a strict obedience to its requirements and teachings, and so learn to take no
                            offence from any one, nor unhappiness from any circumstance whatever. Be reconciled to all
                            conditions ; believing that all things will work together for good to them that love God.
                            This seems to be a gospel saving and a happy foundation on which there can be no
                            disappointment, and which secures*1 our uninterrupted happiness. I cannot see how we can
                            retain an independent gospel power upon any other foundation, to save us from unhappy
                            conditions. Are we asked to do a favor? What is our duty in that case? We would agree that
                            the gospel demands it as a duty, to do the favor. When done, what then ? Jesus gives the
                            answer, ''When ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are
                            unprofitable servants ; we -have done that which was our duty to do." Luke xvii., 10.
                            Nothing more. We have not made the recipient indebted to us by doing the favor, because the
                            gospel demands that it should be done. Whenever we expect a favor returned, we put ourselves
                            outside of gospel power to save us from disappointment and consequent unhappiness. We lay
                            the foundation by which we may be disappointed. All are free-agents, and may return a favor
                            or not, as they may choose. We know from experience, that some do not choose to make a
                            return for favors received. Therefore, let us do the kindness expecting nothing, we are then
                            on the safe side. The prayer of Jesus while on the cross, teaches in all meekness that he
                            took no offence under any circumstance whatever when he prayed that God would forgive his
                            persecutors, "for they know not what they do." Let us do likewise, believing that those who
                            give cause for offence, know not to a fullness what they do. "The promise of Jesus is that
                            he will send his angels and they shall gath-<pb n="77" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> er out of his kingdom all
                            things that offend, and them which do iniquity." Let us consider whether taking offence,
                            does not also offend. Many expect to get into a place of happiness hereafter, although they
                            may have tribulation, care, sorrow and trouble enough to keep them in a state of misery all
                            through their life. They think this state will be changed at once, upon entering the spirit
                            world, and that they will be received into a place where happiness reigns. Such will, no
                            doubt, be sadly disappointed. Happiness is only obtainable by labor and perseverance in
                            obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. The gift of God for our redemption, was, in sending
                            his Son to live a redeeming life, and leave it upon record, that we may learn how to repeat
                            his life, and to follow his example. If his life brought redemption to his soul, the same
                            life will have the same effect to redeem us from unhappiness, in the present, as well as in
                            the future. If we wish to enjoy true happiness, we must learn how to gain and how to keep
                            it; otherwise, we may forever be without it.

" Matt, xi.,
                            28. Living as we do in an age whose prevailing characteristics seem to be a spirit ot
                            unrest, hurry and bustle in all departments of life ; each one striving to outrun his
                            neighbor in the race for wealth, position and the fleeting, transitory bubble called
                            pleasure ; how refreshing and consolatory to the weary mind, come home these soothing words
                            of our divine Master, assuring us of a permanent and abiding rest in Him. Not indeed a rest
                            dependent upon earthly surroundings and concomitants, or a relaxation from physical toil and
                            labor; or an immunity from the cares and burdens, which our daily life imposes ; but the
                            calm interior repose of a soul who, living in an element above the low ambition of earth, is
                            not disturbed by its sordid and groveling cares and pursuits ; but trusting in God, and
                            relying wholly on his promises, pursues the even tenor of its way, whatever may come. We are
                            informed in the context how this rest is to be obtained, by taking the easy yoke of Christ
                            upon us, and learning of Him who was meek and lowly in heart; by a self renunciation, by
                            confessing and forsaking sin, and becoming crucified to that nature of evil, which is the
                            inheritance of every son and daughter of Adam, and which is the true source of restlessness
                            and disquiet. And as we die to this restless and unsatisfied nature, we enjoy that rest and
                            repose of soul, which will find its full fruition only beyond the shores of time. May we by
                            earnest patient endeavor, by watchfulness and prayer, by an unreserved consecration of
                            ourselves to God, attain unto a fullness of this divine and heavenly rest. Canterbury, N.

                            evident that some great event has taken place, or is about to take place ; but what that
                            event is remains to be proved by the event itself, or by the testimony of living witnesses.
                            There was no stronger evidence of Christ's first appearing than the testimony of his own
                            disciples, who were personally acquainted with him, and were daily his companions, and were
                            ear and eye witnesses of the purity of his life, and the miracles he wrought, and
                            especially, the four evangelists, viz., Matthew Mark, Luke and John, and these were rejected
                            at first, but now have gained almost universal credence throughout Christendom, which is but
                            little better than Christian in name, but Pagan in practice, hence the necessity of Christ's
                            Second Appearing not in a man, but in a woman. Let the earth rejoice! In 1827, a book was
                            published at Albany, N. Y., of 178 pages, containing testimonies of the witnesses of
                            Christ's Second Appearing, twenty one Brethren and ten Sisters, in all thirty one, who were
                            men and women of truth and veracity, whose moral characters were above reproach; whose words
                            were "fitly spoken," like "apples of gold in pictures of silver." We know " that no
                            testimony is of any force while the testator liveth." Why? Because his personal presence or
                            verbal testimony supersedes the necessity of anything written, until after his death, aad
                            then his written testimony becomes a force. These witnesses all died, in positive knowledge
                            of Christ's Second Appearing. Let us examine their testimonies already published in the
                            August, October and November numbers of the Manifesto, 1885. "We speak, that � we do know,
                            and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness. " John, III., 11. "And he
                            showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of
                            God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the<pb n="79" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yields
                            her fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. "
                            Rev. xxii., 1, 2. This is figurative language. Let us apply it as we go along for we are
                            living in the days of the fulfillment of this prophecy. And the world know it not. But we
                            knoAv whereof we affirm. What were the leaves of the tree of life? Evidently, they were the
                            testimonies of the witnesses of the gospel of Christ's first and second appearing. And if
                            they were true at the time these events took place, at different periods of the world, they
                            are true now, and will forever remain true, and time and evolution can never altsr facts nor
                            change the truth of God into a lie. What were the twelve manner of fruits that were yielded
                            every month ? Evidently, they are the different articles written by Believers of Christ's
                            second appearing, so different, that no two of them are alike-�more than twelve manner of
                            fruits, which makes a rich and beautiful variety of fruits of the tree of life, which yields
                            her fruit every month, because they are published in a monthly journal, devoted to prove the
                            affirmative side of Christ's second appearing, by tangible evidences. " What advantage then,
                            hath Believers over the world r'� Why ! �' much every way ! chiefly, because unto us are
                            committed the oracles. " What oracles ? The oracles of Christ's second appearing which all
                            true Believers hold sacred, and which are now being published to the world in a reliable
                            form. In all our civil courts of law, where justice is expected to be done, witnesses are
                            examined on both sides of the question at issue, before a just verdict can be rendered. And
                            if this be so, in earthly and worldly institutions, how much more important it is, that
                            things of a heavenly, and of an eternal duration should have a candid and an impartial
                            investigation. When this is done to the satisfaction of an enlightened public opinion, (not
                            malicious persecutors,) on which side of the great scales of God's justice, truth, and love,
                            will the greatest amount of evidence fall ? Let the world itself, be the jury, let them
                            bring in their verdict; and Avhat will that verdict be? Will it not be in favor of Christ's
                            second appearing, in a woman, a representative of the attribute of an eternal "Mother" in
                            the God-head. See, Rom. i., 20. Born in Manchester in England, in 1736, received the
                            revelation of Christ, 1770, came over to America in 1774,- -proclaimed her mission to the
                            world 1780 and from that time to the day of her death, about four years she did not cease
                            her labors, day nor night to proclaim Christ's second appearing wherever she went, in all
                            the country towns and other places, through which she passed, in going to New England. Being
                            saved from sin herself, she had the power of salvation and ministered that power. [See
                            testimony of her witnesses on this subject, published in The Manifesto.] Having finished her
                            work in New England and other places, she returned to her home at Watervliet, near Albany,
                            N. Y. where she departed this life, on the 8th. of Sept. 1784, in the 40th year of her age.
                            I cannot feel to close this article, although long enough for our journal, without quoting
                            as further evidence, a Hymn, said to be sung by Mother Ann, before she left England, when
                            led down<pb n="80" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> into a valley, to be stoned to death, by her persecutors. "'
                            Touch not mine anointed nor do my chosen harm ; I the Lord Jehovah will shield them with my
                            arm. I am a God&gt;f mercy, of justice and truth; [earth; My work of love and power

                            earth I am in spirit known." Here is evidence sufficient to convince the most profound
                            skeptics whose minds are not prejudiced against the Lord's Anointed. The wicked failed in
                            their designs, to take her life ; her work was not done. She had a work to do in America,
                            which was subsequently accomplished by the over-ruling providence of God, and the protection
                            of his holy angels. She possessing her soul in patience- while her enemies " were like the
                            troubled sea, whose waters cast up mire and dirt." "There is no peace to the wicked, saith

                            yearning hope we turn, We find some lesson new to learn, Far in blue depths are stars that
                            burn Obscured by night's dark brow. And flowerets spring from nature's sod Where mortal foot
                            has never trod, And wondrous miracles of God Are wrought, we know not how. Religion, like
                            the desert rose, springs spontaneous wherever it finds an oasis in the soul, in which it may
                            take root. Our trials prove often but friends in disguise, To humble our spirits, and make
                            us more wise. Evince by your conversation and behavior that most angelic of all virtues,
                            purity of spirit. Good deeds are better far than costly gems, True virtue weaves immortal
                            diadems. Justice is the blending of wisdom and love, and not until man and woman are
                            co-equal, will there exist just government among mankind. Vain hearts, to dream that
                            pleasure lies In aught but noble sacrifice. You may cast away your physical life, but you
                            can never escape the responsibility of your actions. If thou just censure wouldst escape The
                            ways of others do not ape. Habits once formed, are not easier to break than the many
                            stranded cable. Vaunt not thyself, shouldst thou attain The sum of human lore, More things
                            unknown would yet remain Than thou hadst learned before. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            body. This is erroneous, as it can never be done while we dwell in clay tenements. When the
                            soul is saved from all sin, the body will also be saved from gratifying low passions and
                            appetites. Not only will it cease to be an instrument or medium for the worst of vices, but
                            every wrong habit will be laid aside. With this view of the subject, it will readily be
                            seen, how impossible is instant salvation, by every one Avho realizes how hard it is to
                            leave old practices, which have been strengthened by the growth of many years. The
                            conviction that some favorite indulgence is wrong, may be and often is, instantaneous; but
                            the power to leave it forever, comes by slow growth, attained through sacrifice, by constant
                            watchfulness and prayer. When we have gained power sufficient to keep us from falling into
                            temptation, this may be called salvation, but not redemption. This is only obtained when we
                            have so far overcome the world that we cannot be tempted of evil, When Satan com-<pb n="82" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> cth and finds nothing in us, by which to incite evil desires, then shall we
                            become like our Lord and Teacher. When the love of God reigns supremely in the heart, it
                            will manifest itself by love and kindness to those around us, thus inspiring them to love
                            and good works. In this way we shall see salvation wrought out through the physical
                            organism. Hence our faith in the resurrection of the body from all evil and wrong habits
                            pertaining to the laws of this life, and through this medium can the soul be resurrected to
                            that which is higher, even unto life eternal. Canterbury, N.

When I was about the age of sixteen, my father, Zechariah
                            Watkins, moved with his family, to Patridgefield, now Peru. I was soon after married to
                            Gamaliel Cook, who had moved with my father, from the same place. From my childhood 1 was
                            often exercised in my mind about the salvation of my soul, which increased upon me as I
                            grew1 older. After I was married I felt still greater trouble of mind ; though my husband
                            was very kind to me, and my feelings were very much attached to him ; I soon found that he
                            was exercised with deep concern of mind as well as myself. We had neither of us joined any
                            church, but were continually seeking for something to satisfy our souls. In the fall of
                            1780, we heard of Mother'Ann and the people who followed her ; but did not in anywise
                            believe they were of God. My feelings, more especially, were quite biased against them. The
                            winter following, my husband's distress of mind became so great, that one day, while on his
                            knees, in prayer to God to direct him in the right way, he aiddenly broke out in very loud
                            acclamations, which were succeeded by a violent shaking of the body, at which I was greatly
                            alarm id. He then testified that the people we had heard of, were the people of God, and
                            that they were in the right way. This was a striking evidence to me; for I believed he was
                            operated upon by the power of God. Soon after this, some who had embraced this new religion,
                            came into Patridgefield, and we visited them, and found them to be very upright and godly in
                            their conversation and deportment; and all their teaching agreed with the precepts of Christ
                            and his apostles. My feelings of nature and the vanities of the world strove hard to stifle
                            my conviction, and induce me to try, if possible, to turn some other way; for this way was
                            excessively crossing to my vain hopes of carnal enjoyments, being then only in the
                            eighteenth year of my age. But their testimony was too clear for me to withstand ; I could
                            not gainsay that word of God which I heard from them. In short we both confessed our sins,
                            and set out, once for all, to obey the testimony of the gospel. This was in Februaiy, 1781.
                            About the beginning of March, we visited Mother Ann and the Elders at Watervliet. The love
                            and kindness I there saw in them, both among themselves aud towards those who visited them,
                            was truly beyond anything of the kind I ever saw before. Many people were there from
                            different places, and their house was but small; but they accommodated all who came. In
                            their THE<pb n="83" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> words and actions they displayed pure godliness and
                            innocence. They taught us to confess and forsake sin, to live uprightand pure and'to be
                            honest and just in all things. They often reminded us that death, judgment and eternity were
                            the certain lot of all; and exhorted us to live in such a manner that we could meet these in
                            justification and peace. My husband continued strong in the faith until he departed this
                            life, at Hancock, in 1788. Mother Ann was very modest and chaste in her deportment, and I
                            have often heard her admonish young women to be modest. I visited Mother and the Elders
                            often at different places�at Ashh'eld, Harvard, Hancock, Mass., and New Lebanon, N. Y., and
                            always found them very exemplary and godly iu all things. As I increased in the knowledge
                            and understanding of the things of God, they appeared to me more and more like Christ, which
                            gave me full assurance that I should be saved, if I would be faithful to take up my cross
                            and forsake all sin ; for sin is the separating line between God and the soul. Mother was
                            always faithful to teach prudence and economy, as well as all o her virtues. " The blessing
                            of God, should not be lost. " They always seemed to receive their food, as well as all other
                            things, with great thankfulness, and taught us the same. "For'" said they "you cannot make
                            one spear of grass nor one kernel of grain grow without the blessing of God. " They taught
                            us to love one another. Mother would say to those that were married, "You ought to love one
                            another in the Lord. " To the man, " Be kind to your wife ;"� and to the woman, "Be subject,
                            and obey your husband in the Lord : it is according to the doctrine of the apostles. " She
                            taught children to obey their parents ; and parents to teach their children godliness, and
                            bring them up in the fear of the Lord. Mother was faithful in teaching, counselling and
                            instructing in every virtue, of which she was herself a perfect pattern. I never saw the
                            least failing in her. I know of a certainty, that in all things, Mother walked very
                            circumspectly. Her testimony is truly that which leads souls to God. This I know because I
                            have proved it by more than forty years experience. She testitied to us that, if we were
                            faithful, her spirit would remain witli us ; and so it has proved. I have felt the same
                            spirit in every succeeding ministration in the Church down to this day. I have also been a
                            witness to the same testimony and example, and can freely testify to what I have heard, seen
                            and felt. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            explanation given me when a child. "The fear of the Lord" said a dear friend, " is to fear
                            to do wrong." Finding the exhortation so often among the choice words of wisdom uttered by
                            the wise Solomon, I had begun to think that the path of the wise and good must necessarily
                            be trodden in fear and trembling ; a not very inviting prospect to the happy heart of
                            childhood. But this simple explanation brought sunshine to the portentous path, and all
                            seemed easy. �' To fear to do wrong ;" not from a slavish fear of mortals, but from the
                            promptings within, which would above all, dread the censure of conscience. The little child,
                            who when tempted by an evil adviser to pocket the rich ripe fruit, because no one was there
                            to see him, possessed the true fear of God, when he replied, '"I cannot for I shall see nr
                            self." Another under the same circumstances said, " I cannot for God will see me." This
                            dread of self-censure and God-censure, is to me all the same. We say, " Godp is good'" "God
                            is Love"' "God is everywhere;" and how can we doubt it, when there is so much evidence of
                            it. God is the synonym for the source of all good, as is the sun, for the source of all
                            light, although as to the material substance ot either, the wisest philosophers are yet in
                            doubt ; while the existence of both is evident without a doubt as shown by their effects. It
                            is God within us, which creates the beautiful glow of love we sometimes feel, melting all
                            selfishness, all hardness of feeling, and it is also the God within us which we dread as an
                            accuser. Then is it not the "beginning of<pb n="85" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> wisdom" when we learn to obey
                            the voice of God�the voice of conscience� the voice of principle ? for though we may be at
                            peace with all the world, if when we "sit alone with our conscience" we find that we are
                            self-condemned, there is no peace. I surely feel grateful that my early instruction deeply
                            impressed me, to fear nothing like self-accusation. It lias been a life-guard to me, amid
                            the trials and temptations incident to a mortal pilgrimage, when I have been guided by its
                            monitions ; aud regrets have always followed a disregard of its counsels. Were I to offer
                            any one instruction as a safe-guard to the young, I would repeat the words of the "brave old
                            Greek." "Let every man wheu about to do a wicked action, above all things in the earth,
                            stand in awe of himself, and dread the witness within him." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            mind. As such, its tub stance is necessarily quite soft, that it may easily respond to the
                            thought or will of its ethereal occupant and control, whose instrument it is. Chemical
                            analysis shows that it contains near the same proportion of water, as the blood, which is
                            fluid, aud the reason the brain is not fluid is because of the organized and fibrous texture
                            of its solid constituents. According to Fremy, about one third of its solid matter is
                            albumen. The white, or transparent, jelly like substance of eggs, is albumen and water.
                            Alcohol, in contact with soft albumen, coagulates or hardens it, somewhat as strong heat
                            hardens the white of an egg. Aud though alcohol may not render the albumen as hard as a hard
                            boiled egg, it will make it harder than it is in its natural state in the brain. It is
                            reported of a noted anatomist, that he said he could tell a drunkard's braiu in the darkest
                            night, the moment he stuck his knife into it, by its unnatural hardness. How was this
                            produced, and what effect does it have upon the manifestation of mind ? Beverages that
                            contain alcohol, when habitually drank, yield their alcohol to the blood, in which it
                            displaces a certain amount of water. It is carried by the blood to the brain, which it
                            serves to harden, and render impermeable to the finer aud nobler sentiments of the mind. The
                            religious faculties, of reverence, conscientiousness, firmness, hope, spirituality, brothel
                            ly and sisterly kindness, and ideality, so far as the latter relates to culture, refinement,

                            organs to expel the poison from the system, are ultimately paralyzed, killed at the top,
                            like a tree whose central top having died, is smitten with decay at the heart. A blight also
                            gradually settles upon the intellectual and reasoning faculties. Thus a kind of vivisection
                            is performed between the rational, aspiring faculties, located in the crown of ^the head for
                            the government of the soul, and the coarse, strong, selfish, brutal propensities, located in

                            which were ordained to contro' and direct, same as an engineer controls steam and directs it
                            to accomplish use ful ends. In the case of the hard drinker, the engineer is- thrust out,
                            and the basilar faculties which were made only to serve, assume entire control, because
                            these alone have sufficient strength to impress the brain in its hardened and enfeebled
                            state. The truth of this statement is constantly being demonstrated by the conduct of
                            inveterate topers toward family and friends. If a long course of excessive drinking produces
                            this result, moderate, drinking of alcoholic stimulants, is oil the road to it, and after
                            the natural barriers of the system to the introduction of intoxicants, are broken down, the

                            ideal Gods who dispense justice regardless of mercy or merit. Who engage in strife to favor
                            party or sect, and suffer a great portion of the human race to perish. Those characteristics
                            popularly held forth from the pulpits is a relic of ignorance and is anything but lovely.
                            The thought that the spirit world is mostly one great chaos with only one heaven at one end
                            and an enormous h-11 at the other extreme where sinners are hurried instantly on their exit
                            thither. All this is inconsistent with the character of parental love manifested by our
                            Savior. It was not in his heart, and as to creed, he had none. His Father was love and
                            peace, who abhorred haughtiness and tyranny. His was the principle of equality to all,
                            constituting all one great family linked by the eternal ties of affection. God manifested in
                            the mother as well as father. How necessary to complete the order of things in heaven and

                            plan. The female mission is to usher in and inaugurate the family of Christ in the true
                            spirit of parental love. Jesus had no home or where to lay his head because the kingdom of
                            heaven had not yet come upon earth. He prophesied that a Comforter should come to reveal the
                            order of God's house. Who is this nysterious Comforter but the Mother spirit. The revelation
                            of truth through he female has brought to light a plan )j which man and woman may be
                            restored to primitive innocence, may live as pure as the angels. Woman is to be the redeemer

                            must needs have a voice in all the parts and wheels of human progress ; in the counsels of
                            the nation ; in moral truth and in the character of literature. Her influence must have

                                    crushed in the ice, and that was for profanity. It occurred to me that if the
                                    penalty of the law should be inflicted in New York, and all pro" fane swearers
                                    strung up at one time, the sight would be at least novel, and the streets be
                                    relieved for a season. It is a provision in the penalty for this crime, that sailors
                                    shall bear all the sins of the muUitude? It would seem to be a fact beyond

                                    that for more than fifteen hundred years, under the Jewish government, the penalty
                                    for blasphemy was death. Was God's fury to be poured out upon his chosen, and not

                                crucifixion of the worldly element in the soul. If the religious work which we have
                                accepted, fails to accomplish this essential point, it is quite evident that we have not
                                chosen the right form of testimony, or have not been baptized at the right fountain. So
                                carefully warned we should not be deceived by accepting an article which is not in
                                harmony with the standard, or the Christ life. There can be no reasonable excuse for us
                                to pass in by the way of the "broad gate" as we know without a doubt that it leads to
                                destruction. If we venture to move along with the worldly crowd, then we may be assured
                                of this fact; we run a great risk of losing sight of the narrow way that leads to life.
                                We cannot walk both roads at the same time. So thorough is the investigation of every
                                department of earthly duties, and so forcibly subjected to the test of criticism that it
                                will be known to the fullest extent, whether an article is genuine or false, or whether
                                it be an amalgamation of good and bad, and as thorough an investigation Avill be made of
                                the systems of religion, by which the lives of men assume to be governed. The only safe
                                course, is to study into lhe truth, and to make that preparation in the soul, that God's
                                word may prove acceptable and that all error may be rejected. Men cannot gather grapes
                                of thorns nor figs of thistles, any more than they did in the early days of
                                Christianity, and yet an effort is made from generation to generation to accomplish this
                                very thing. Attempting to bring righteousness out of unrighteousness and to establish
                                for salvation the rules which governed Adam, Noah, David and Solomon, a Babel of
                                religious ideas has been brought forward as being in harmony with the spiritual
                                instruction of Jesus Christ. Every dispensation may have had its special teachers, and
                                these messengers may have been sent by divine authority to accomplish a certain work. �
                                Adam, although called a son of God came with a message that did not carry him above the
                                elements of the earth, and yet he may have fulfilled the mission for which he was sent.
                                Noah, decidedly in advance of Adam, begun to preach righteousness in the earth, and
                                lived so carefully that the record speaks of him as walking with God. Moses with a still
                                greater work, disciplined the mind to the keeping of laws and regulations. He made his
                                followers more or less responsible to God for the course they pursued in their relation
                                with mankind, and then affixed a penalty for every transgression. The mission of Jesus
                                was of a new <pb n="89" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> order, a new creation, a dispensation of
                                righteousness. To accept him was to accept the assurance of eternal life, which he, in
                                all its fullness brought to man, while the blessings so needful in this world, would
                                through him be increased an hundred fold. We find that those who had been chosen as
                                leaders of God's people before the time of Jesus Avere zealous advocates of the law of
                                generation and even demanded their followers to enter into that relation. The whole of
                                their work belonged to the earthly kingdom and included the selfishness of a private
                                inheritance, the revengefuluess of war and the carnal association of a life in the
                                flesh. YYhen Jesus was called to embrace his gospel work, his whole theme was that of
                                regeneration, in which the kingdom of God that was to be established among men, claimed
                                his first attention. In this kingdom all the selfish relations that have occupied so
                                conspicuous a place in former dispensations, will now cease. The work of Jesus Christ is
                                that of the resurrection order, and all who accept it will rise and become the sons and
                                dauo-ho ters of God. To follow Jesus, we have this simple but effectual rule. A man must
                                forsake all that he hath. "Go," said he to the young convert, "sell all thou hast, give
                                it to the poor, then come and follow me. " Encumbered with selfish property, neither a
                                young nor an old man could be a disciple of the Teacher. If this young man could not
                                secure the privilege of discipleship without this great sacrifice, can it be done now
                                with less sacrifice ? Those Christians of today, who live very much as did the carnal
                                Corinthians, in the days,of the apostles, would not be interested to^bear any additional
                                cross. In their combination scheme they have quoted largely from the writings of Moses,
                                and from those of St. Paul and as one might very naturally suppose, made use of but
                                little that was spoken by Jesus. A healthy revival of the testimony of the Nazarene
                                would be the opening of a new era upon the earth, and the promulgation of the spirit of
                                practical righteousness as it was once heard in the cities of Judea would make of the "
                                kingdoms of this world, the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ." It would also make
                                a radical separation between the sons of God and the sons of Belial, and awaken a
                                testimony that would demand the crucifixion of every worldly element in the soul. </p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary </head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Should we sleep with open windows" TEIform="index"/> SHOULD WE SLEEP WITH OPEN WINDOWS?</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> This question introduces a subject upon which there is a diversity of
                                        opinion. "I have had no bad colds since I learned to sleep with my windows open,
                                        " remarked one gentleman to another recently. " The only hard colds I ever
                                        suffered from were contracted by sleeping in rooms to which the night air had
                                        free access, " replied the other. The bodily temperature sinks slightly during
                                        sleep; all the physiological functions act with diminished activity; the
                                        resistance of the economy to morbific influences is lessened proportionately.
                                        But it is also well known that at night these influences are far more potent and
                                        noxious. The air is charged with greater humidity; in unhealthy places miasmatic
                                        and malarial poisons arise to higher levels and extend with greater rapidity;
                                        the chill of damp night air is penetrating and dangerous; the emanations from
                                        organic decay are more perceptible. <pb n="90" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/>Against these the
                                        sleeper is less protected than in the daytime. He has divested himself of his
                                        woolen external clothing to put on cotton or linen, and lies between sheets of
                                        the same material, between which, at the tops and sides of the bed, the air
                                        gains ready access to his unprotected surface. If he is restless he renders such
                                        access yet more easy. A sudden fall of temperature at night is no unusual
                                        occurrence. In summer a thundergust, in winter a shift of the wind to the north,
                                        often reduces the temperature 10 or 20 degrees. The sleeper is unaware of this,
                                        and so remains exposed to it with no further protection than he found agreeable
                                        at the higher temperature until he awakes chilled and stiff, and feels the
                                        effects of it all day long. With these points to be considered, what rule should
                                        guide us? Certainly we need pure air by night as well as by day, and this we
                                        ought to proA'ide. If the bedroom is very small there is more danger from
                                        draughts than if it is very large. If the person is delicate and sensitive he
                                        cannot bear draughts so well as one more hardy. So there can be no fixed rule
                                        for all persons ; eacli must fix a rule for himself, only bearing in mind that
                                        fresh air is important and must be obtained in some way. The strong, and those
                                        who bathe every morning, may sleep with windows open more or less at nearly all
                                        seasons. The weak, and those who do not keep their skins healthy, may admit air
                                        by doors opening into other rooms, and by openings into the chimney for the exit
                                        of foul air. Several small openings may be made which will admit fresh air
                                        without creating a draught. A screen may be used to break the force of the
                                        current. A little ingenuity will enable every one to provide fresh air, without
                                        injury, for their sleeping apartment.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Herald of health" TEIform="index"/>The Herald of Health.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="shaker report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Among the Shakers no. 2" TEIform="index"/> AMONG THE SHAKERS.

                                unnecessary. It has been many years since I have tasted meat. The ingredients of flesh
                                are all in the soil; beef contains nothing that vegetable diet does not afford us.
                                Still, it is not the fact of eating meat that I object to so much as it is the murder.
                                All animals have a right to their lives. " " Suppose you encountered a rattlesnake." "
                                Kill it. One must use common sense in such matters. The Orientals carry that thing to
                                excess. You remember there was an Eastern monarch who did not wish to destroy the
                                animalcule in water by drinking it." "You believe, do you not, in spiritual
                                communication ? " "Certainly. We live under direct inspiration of spiritual influences.
                                A man may realize that late in life, but to most men the knowledge is sure to come at
                                some stage. I was a materialist until I was converted, as Paul was converted. My eyes
                                were turned inward upon myself and I saw my folly. It is only through a knowledge of
                                spiritualism that many obscure things in our Bible are made plain. For instance, we find
                                the Jews praying for help and guidance to the ' god of Israel' when they start on their
                                expeditions of plunder and massacre and outrage. The ' god of Israel' was not the God of
                                the universe, but a national spirit or tutelary genius, like that possessed by every
                                nation. " " But you do not 'take stock' in spirit rappings and cabinet manifestations
                                and all that kind of thing?" " "Why not? We cannot tell in what manner a spirit may
                                choose to manifest itself. It may be by influence, or by knockings, or by personal
                                revelation. At the time of the great Kentucky revival John the Baptist was distinctly
                                seen for several minutes in our meeting house, and led our people in the dance. Then the
                                motions of the spirit may shape our conduct. For many years our men and women held no
                                communion with the world's people, but after a time the spirit moved differently." " In
                                what way does the spirit usually manifest itself?" " It would not avail to tell you now.
                                'Cast not your pearls before swine'�which means," continued the Elder, with the vestige
                                of a smile at my startled expression "give not your truths to those who are not
                                    prepared<pb n="91" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> for them. You cannot receive them now, but some day

                                experiences in your life that could not be explained through the agency of physical or
                                psychological laws, " which was true, as it probably is in the case of a majority of
                                adults. " Do you not find your life here monotonous at times?" "Nay. It is peaceful and
                                we are bound together by brotherly and sisterly love. This is an earthly heaven. I could
                                live here forever." The Elder presently withdrew, after committing me to the care of
                                Daniel Eraser, a ruddy cheeked brother verging upon ninety years of age, who must at
                                some time have quaffed the elixir of life. The passionless, methodical existence of the
                                Shakers lengthens their lives an average of a dozen years beyond that of other men and
                                keeps them in health, likewise; but Daniel Fraser is as a " world's man" of sixtv, and
                                while he expresses his willingness to die whenever he shall be called, he has a store of
                                life and strength that ought to last him a round score of years to come. It has been
                                said that communities do not foster intellectual growth and independence. I know not how
                                that may be among .the mass of a communal fraternity, but I must do Frederic Evans and
                                Daniel Fraser the justice to say that, in their case, plain Jiving and high thinking go
                                together, and that in extent of reading, in mental vigor, in ready use of logic and in
                                sincerity of utterance they are at least the equals of any two men of my acquaintance in
                                the world. They have convictions, and live up to them. The Shakers and Mohammedans are
                                the only people who do so, and their lives stand out in singular contrast to the mass of
                                those whose religion is lip service and whose lives are guided only by self interest.
                                "Brother Daniel"� there are no " Misters " or titles of any sort among these people�took
                                me through the gardens adjacent to the dwelling, and walked with me along a height from
                                which a glorious sunset view was had, with the fires of the sky glowing in the
                                reflections of a river down the valley. I asked to see the grave yard, but he said there
                                was little there of interest. The graves were barely marked^ and for his part he would
                                as lief be buried without a mortuary token at his head. Of what use were a few handfuls
                                of dust, and what honor need attend them? The life and deeds of a man were not interred.
                                Had they much illness there? Nay, very little. Great care was taken to keep the sanitary
                                condition of the grounds and buildings perfect. The appliances, not only of sanitation,
                                but of agricultural and domestic work, were the latest and best that had been devised.
                                What hours were observed in work? The men and women arose at half past four�he thought
                                another hour of sleep would not hurt them�or at five in Winter, and their duties
                                occupied them until about sundown. The wonderful cleanliness of everything was
                                maintained at a cost of no more labor than the care of live stock or the working of the
                                fat acres we looked out upon. The stables, where a large herd of cattle is kept, are
                                cleaner than most of the New York tenement houses, the stone walls are the best laid and
                                most solid that can be seen in the country, and in the houses, barns, sheds, orchards,
                                shops and fields there is order, economy, skill and neatness. Domestic animals for pets
                                there are none, except a few canary birds, though cats are encouraged .to dwell about
                                the premises " as a menace to another class of domestic animals, rats, " explained
                                Brother Daniel. On returning to the room we had left I was informed that I was to
                                consider myself at home there, and was invited to stay all night. The invitation was
                                accepted when I was assured that my pedestrian costume was not amiss and that I would be
                                thought the better of for my blue shirt and rough clothing. The condescensions of
                                fashionable people who visit Mount Lebanon, parading their silks and jewels before its
                                simple folk and exhibiting such well bred amusement at their ways and appearance as
                                might be in place in visiting a poorhouse or a menagerie, have made entirely excusable
                                the reluctance of many of the Shakers to be pitied or patronized. Condescension is
                                singularly misplaced on the most prosperous and contented people in this country. It
                                would be more in<pb n="92" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> order for Shakers to patronize the worried,
                                dissatisfied, ambitious, fast living citizens who visit them, people overtaxed,
                                overdressed, slaves of fashion, insecure and fearful of the future, unresting,
                                distrustful of their business associates and devoted either to their empty pleasures of
                                society or to individual aggrandizement that perpetuates those false social relations
                                against which, from shop and tenement, comes an ominous mutter of protest. Were these
                                serene Shaker settlements scattered plentifully about the world, where all men might
                                profit by the examples therein set of economy, right dealing, fraternal helpfulness,
                                order and content, I am convinced that the world would be the better for them. I was
                                bidden to supper in due season and had it served to me by a smiling Shakeress in an
                                apartment adjoining the family dining room. From the cheerful rattle of fumirine tongues
                                in the kitchen, the occasional humming of an air and from the fields a whistle, it was
                                apparent that the strict life of the community was not inconsistent with cheerfulness.
                                Most of the faces one sees in the village are to some extent spiritualized, but glumness
                                is not their habitual expression. The supper was abundant and satisfying, and presented
                                a variety of dishes. If one wishes to know how he can fairly luxuriate without meat let
                                him sample Shaker cookery. Daniel Fraser told me that he had not eaten meat in thirty
                                years, I think he said, and in that time he had subsisted joyously without eggs, milk,
                                cheese, butter, lard, spirits, tobacco, soda, saleratus, tea or coffee. Farinaceous
                                food, fruit, vegetables and water he had found sufficient. Meeting me after supper in
                                the room that was temporarily mine lie made a vigorous presentation of his communistic
                                theories and of the scheme for land nationalization made familiar by Henry George. He
                                had, also, in his mental keeping strange scraps of fables and legend that Hawthorne
                                would have caught up eagerly, to base a romance on. He had even met one or two men who
                                thought they had solved the mystery of life and had been guaranteed an earthly existence
                                of indefinite length. These men had joined the Shakers in the belief that their simple,
                                healthful modes of living were most conducive to unlimited length of days, but Daniel
                                made light of their hopes and bade them look at the gray hairs of their heads and beards
                                and asked them if the world to come were not a better one than this? In the evening
                                there was a "reading meeting" in the gathering place or hall of the house, the men
                                sitting on one side and the women on the other, the seats being arranged in crescent
                                form with the reader beneath a bright light in the center. Some hymns were sung without
                                accompaniment, although a cabinet organ stood in the room, and Heber Newton's sermon on
                                "Religious Communism " was read aloud with the preface from Elder Evans that it was "
                                rather a remarkable thing to come from the world. " The company listened in silence, and
                                two boys of the family were distinctly observed to slumber. Elder Evans interrupted the
                                reader twice or thrice to explain and comment on passages in the discourse, and shut it
                                off before its conclusion had been reached by stating that it was perhaps too lengthy
                                for a single reading; a view that was endorsed by one of the sisters, who demurely said
                                "Perhaps we have had as much as we can digest. " About nine o'clock the Shakers were in
                                their rooms. I saw lights burn briefly at their windows for a time, a few windows were
                                thrown open and contemplative figures were seen there gazing at the beauty of the night.
                                The moon mounted the sky, shining on the high, white walls of the houses and bringing
                                them into striking relief against the dark hills. Then fell a silence when even Nature
                                hardly stirred in her heavy sleep, and the serenity of Mount Lebanon was reflected on
                                earth and in the sky. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="S., C. M." TEIform="persName"/>C. M.

Morris, about
                            the head of the Genesee valley. Their lands comprise about eighteen liundred acres, their
                            buildings are substantial and numerous and situated from an abrupt rise from the Cashequa,
                            commanding a fine view of the valley and the eastward slopes of the Grovelan�l and Sparta
                            hills. It was on the last day of the past year that this society met in the commodious brick
                            building, in an inner room, 50xG0, where they "were wont to gather each Sabbath afternoon
                            for conference meetings, to pay the last tribute of respect and love to their departed
                            friend, Elder Peter Long, who for a quarter of a century had given the best years of his
                            life for their success and prosperity. The occasion was one of deep interest, the funeral
                            obsequies impressive and appropriate'. A large gathering of the neighbors about and others
                            from localities near were also there to attest their respect and admiration for the
                            yenerable dead. The " Brethren and Sisters " sat opposite each other near the center of the
                            room. No emblems of mourning appeared. Brother Alexander opened the meeting by a few
                            remarks. Elder Giles, from the Parent Society of New Lebanon, was present and made a very
                            touching and pertinent address, followed by many of the " brethren and sisters, " each
                            giving their earnest testimony of the kindness and love that the dear brother had always
                            manifested to them. They feelingly recalled his genial smiles, his warm greetings, his
                            benign countenance and above all his earnest and unflinching attachment to the faith and
                            doctrines of their society, for which nearly his whole life had been devoted. One or two
                            tributes were read. Several hymns were sung (the "brethren and sisters" rising) very
                            expressive and in harmony with the occasion. After the solemn services, all passed out into
                            another room and viewed the remains of the time-honored dead, then eight of the young
                            brethren bore him to his resting place, the spot selected during his lifetime, just in the
                            rear of the house of worship, between two rows of evergreens, a quiet, secluded nook,
                            suggestive of the ways and manners of the worthy dead. The occasion will not soon be
                            forgotten by the many who were present. Its simplicity was impressive and touching� a
                            pleasing contrast to the pomp and ceremony often exhibited at the burial of the dead. Elder
                            Peter, as he was familiarly called, was widely known in the Genesee valley and highly
                            esteemed for his strict integrity, unpretending and courteous manners and his many virtues :
                            by his death the Shakers lose a true and devoted friend. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="S." TEIform="persName"/>S. Mt.

                            We have a national Constitution that is good enough for all, but do our representatives
                            throw the liberal mantle of the Constitution impartially ever all? I am not a voter, and as
                            a disinterested spectator I think I can see pretty clearly why the major portion of our race
                            mourn under oppression while the unrelenting, iron rule of despotism appropriates the spoils
                            of labor under laws concocted by the despoilers. THE WAY THE GAME IS FLAYED. Large sums are
                            annually expended to support a horde of "representatives" in each state, who waste much time
                            in '' making laws" which the legislature find it necessary to repeal, but before the repeal
                            the scheme has carried the design of lucre's power and influence through. THE KEMEDY. If the
                            people, under the guarantee of the Constitution, have the right of government to the law
                            making power, then, they are sanctioned in their right by the republican spirit of the
                            Constitution, and if the right of rule be invested in a majority representation then are
                            they sanctioned in their right by the original and universal spirit of Democracy, and hence,
                            the new departure of a new amendment to the Constitution causiug every "act" of
                            representatives, both in Congress and in the State Legislatures to be subject to
                            ratification 'or rejection by the people at their next general election ; and let the
                            amendment further require that abstract copies of each legislation act be printed and by the
                            tax assessor distributed to at least each acting magistrate whose duty it shall be to
                            exhibit them to the several voters of his precinct, so that by the next general election
                            every voter shall know (or have a chance to know) what the proposed acts shall be if
                            ratified. Then the majority will constitute the actual ruling power ; and rings, big paying
                            monopolists and caucuses will have to stand aside, for our representatives can no longer be
                            bought, for the exclusive right of government will no longer be in the gift of the people
                            nominally merely, but essentially and practically exercised by the people. The people have
                            no right of complaint of misrule so long as they wilfully delegate their own franchises to
                            public auctioneers who sell them to the highest bidders. Hastily yours for honesty and fair

                                this very commendable form of procuring a supply of food for the table, and then writes
                                of what has been done at a more modern date. " The Carp is an Asiatic fresh water fish
                                and has been cultivated in Austria more than six hundred years. " The flesh is said to
                                be white and of the finest flavor, A carp at three years of age will weigh from four to
                                five pounds. The pamphlet tells the whole story of pond mak ing and fish raising, with
                                every step carefully explained, so that any one can intelligently enter the business.
                                Published by A. I. Root, Medina, Ohio Price 50 cents. We now learn that the Shakers in
                                White Water* Ohio have commenced the raising of carp. They have seven ponds which as a
                                whole occupy some ten acres. Already they are disposing of the little fish at $15.00 per
                                1000. We wish them the best of, success. " We are raising carp fish but no swine. We
                                think it more profitable and more honorable. Come over and we will give you a four pound
                                fish for your dinner." Isn't that nice ? We would have it like the dinner that was
                                served on the shore ot the sea of Galilee. And to make it still better, there will be no
                                swine there. The Shakers do not eat either the fat or flesh of swine. The Phrenological

                                reprinted in a neat volume, Long Primer type, bound in fine cloth, gilt top,
                                bcveledboards.. Price 50 cents. The quaint poem, of the title page of which the above is
                                a transcript, appeared nearly half a century earlier than Paradise Lost, and it is
                                intrinsically probable that it would have fallen under the eye of Milton; in any case
                                there are striking points of re semblance between the two poems, and many have supposed
                                Milton's immortal work to have been inspired by the former. Only two copies of the work
                                are known to be in existence previous to the issue of the present edition, one being in
                                the British Museum, the other in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. The copy in the British
                                Museum was purchased at a noted sale of old books in 1819, by Baron Bolland, who notes
                                upon a blank leaf that it cost him 2U. 17s. 6d., (about $110.00). Some years ago a
                                gentleman of Virginia, Mr. J. L. Peyton, sprung from the old English family of that
                                name, made an accurate transcript of the copy in the British museum, preserving even the
                                quaint spelling, punctuation, capitalizing, and italicizing of the original. This
                                present edition is printed without alteration. Apart from its presumed connection, with
                                Paradise Lost, the poem has very considerable merit of its own, and is in every way a
                                literary curiosity. John B. Alden,. Publisher, New York. 96 A LITERARY</p></div3></div2><pb n="97" id="p27" TEIform="pb"/><!--
