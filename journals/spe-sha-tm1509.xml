AVERY.</byline><p TEIform="p">Preliminary Observations. In order properly to treat this subject, it is first necessary to
                            have an understanding of our terms. If, by the term "fall" is meant " Original Sin" that is,
                            hereditary taint�meaning, sinful by ancestral violations of God's laws, we wish to be
                            understood as not treating the subject in that relation. Thus considered, the question
                            involves a very different analysis than if it be considered iii the sense of one's personal
                            violation of known laws of God. In this article we propose to consider the subject in the
                            latter phase. And, 1st. What constitutes rectitude? Aas. Obedience to all the laws of
                            righteousness instituted by our Creator ! 2nd. What is a fall? Ans. A violation of known
                            laws of righteousness ! Measured by this rule, is not man a fallen being? The Argument. If
                            man hath never fallen, then he hath no sin, for sin premises a departure from
                            rectitude�uprightness-; that is, a violation of known laws of God. 2nd. If there is no sin
                            in the world, then there is no spiritual death ! Is humanities' conditions all spiritual
                            life and light? 3rd. If there is no sin in the world, there can be no sorrow ; for sin is
                            the cause of all sorrow known to man ! Sorrow, is sufferings, for the violations of Law ! Ts
                            there no sorrow among mankind? 4th. Spiritual death is the consequenee of sin. Is there no
                            spiritual death in the world? If not, then there<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>is no resurrection from
                            the dead, as taught by Christ! The English word "resurrection" is from the Greek word,
                            "Anastasis" which means, "to stand up again." How that can stand up again that never hath
                            fallen down from an upright, or standing position is a question for cavilers to answer ! If
                            there is no fall, consequently no resurrection from the dead, then Christ is not risen, and
                            he said untruly, "I am the resurrection, and the life." 5th. If there is no spiritual
                            darkness, the fruit of sin, among men, then Jesus' testimony "This is the condemnation, that
                            light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light, because their deeds
                            are evil." John, iii., 19, was falsehood, and nonsense ; for condemnation is alone the fruit
                            of sin. 6th. If there is no sin and sorrow among men then all our senses belie us. 7th. If
                            man hath not sinned, then he is not lost, and needs r:o salvation ; and Jesus Christ, as a
                            Savior, hath vainly been sent upon earth, for, there is nothing lost to save, and Jesus
                            uttered a falsehood in saying, "I came to seek and save that which is lost." The language
                            should have been, I came to seek and save that which never hath been found, or developed.
                            8th. If man is not fallen, then the present work of generation among mankind is perfect, or,
                            the scriptures belie the character of Noah. Is it the general character of mankind that they
                            are perfect in their generations? Nay, verily, the corruption of generation is the crying
                            sin of our whole race, in al nations ot the earth. Pth. It is impossible for man to sin
                            without falling from his uprightness, and, if man hath not sinned, and fallen, then the
                            whole law and the prophets, is a humbug, and of mere human institution, for, they all
                            recognize sin in the human family, and gross sin too. And, let any one read "Newton" on The
                            Fulfillment of the Prophecies" and he must be convinced the Prophets were inspired from on
                            High. 10th. If man hath not fallen then the whole Gospel plan for man's redemption from a
                            fallen state is a farce, and God has made a great mistake of man's needs. 11th. If the
                            testimony of Moses and the Prophets is a myth, the Gospel of Christ is a myth also, for, it
                            is the fulfillment of the Law, and the prophecies of the Prophets. 12th. If man hath not
                            fallen, all the testimony of Jesus concerning tares in the Gospel field is false, and the
                            whole crop is good wheat, only not fully grown ! What does universal experience say to this?
                            13th. To deny the fall of man, is to deny the whole revelation of God to man, manifested in
                            both the Old and New Testament Scriptures ! 14th. If man hath not sinned, andfallen, there
                            is no regeneration necessary, because there is no degeneration from which to be regenerated,
                            since, according to this theory, man hath nothing lost. 15th. If man hath not sinned
                            andfallen, then the peaceable state of the Kingdom of Christ, anticipated by the prophet,
                            when the lion and the lamb should lie down together, is now reigning on the earth, or, God
                            created man in a state not good ; that is, not in harmony with creation at large! But, does
                            universal peace now reign? lfith. If man hath not sinned and fallen, then the Brute is not
                            fallen, and man is his lord, and the whole brute creation is his willing subject. Is it so?
                            17th. The Gospel testimony is, that,<pb n="195" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>when man had fallen, and rebelled
                            against God, the brute fell, and rebelled against man ! Do we not witness this rebellion?
                            18th. If man hath not fallen, then the testimony ot Jesus concerning taking the Kingdom of
                            Heaven by force, is a falsehood ; because Heaven is man's pristine home ! Or, God created
                            him in misery ; thus, there would be no need of a warfare to take it! 19th. If man hath not
                            fallen, then, either the harvest of the world inaugurated by Jesus Christ is prematurely
                            commenced and God had no cause to send His Son to inaugurate that dispensation, or, being
                            inaugurated and souls, by the voice of God being called to come into it through God's
                            Vice-gerents on earth, all souls would immediately obey the command of God, as the next step
                            in their normal and legitimate development ; This they do not do ! 20th. If man hath not
                            fallen, then, as do the waters form the sea, so doth the knowledge of God cover the earth ;
                            for, it would be cruel in God to create an intelligent and accountable being, make that
                            being punishable for not obeying His will, but not reveal to him that will until myriads of
                            ages after his creation. But, does the knowledge of God cover the earth? Nay, man is in
                            darkness, loss, sin, sorrow, and woe, and very much needs salvation and redemption ! To deny
                            it, is to deny all the revelations from God to man, of which we have any manifestation. It
                            is to make Noah, Moses, all the Jewish Prophets and historians ; John the Baptist, Jesus,
                            and all the Apostles of the New Testament Scriptures, liars, and blasphemers ; It is also to
                            deny all present experience ; for, there is not a living man of intelligonce, but
                            recognizes, that in some degree, either great or small, both himself and his fellow have
                            transgressed some known law of right, for which a degree of condemnation hath rested, or is
                            resting upon the soul, until confessed and repented of. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Fruits of the spirit" TEIform="index"/> THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><index level1="Woods, Joseph" TEIform="index"/>JOSEPH "WOODS.</byline><p TEIform="p"> The Apostle Paul said, " If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his. " "
                            Every good tree" said Jesus, " bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
                            evil fruit. Ye shall know them by their fruits. " Paul in writing to the Galatians, after
                            enumerating the works of the flesh, and declaring that they which do such things shall not
                            inherit the kingdom of God, informs us that the fruits of the Spirit are Love, Peace,
                            Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness and Temperance. Love. God is Love. The
                            apostle John says, "He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God,
                            whom he hath not seen? We know that we are passed from death unto life, because we love the
                            brethren." Jesus said, Love your enemies; bless them that curse you ; do good to them that
                            hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you. The joy of the
                            true Christian is such as no earthly joy can bear any comparison, as worldly joys are
                            momentary fleeting and perishable. While an individual consecrated to God soul and body
                            possesses that joy, satisfaction and true happiness which has no end ; knowing that he has
                            in heaven an enduring substance, far better than the whole world<pb n="196" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>can
                            give. Jesus for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and
                            is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. The Psalmist, "Thou wilt show me the
                            path of life ; in thy presence is fullness of joy and at thy right hand are pleasures
                            forevermore." Peace. Paul said, Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no
                            man shall see the Lord. Jesus said, "Blessed are the Peacemakers. My peace I leave with you
                            ; my peace I give unto you. " The soul that follows peace with all men, that has made its
                            peace with God, by confessing and forsaking every known sin, is sure of the blessing
                            promised the peacemaker. To all such souls the gospel is sown in Peace. Long-suffering. Paul
                            says, Charity suffereth long and is kind. Rejoice that ye are made partakers of the
                            sufferings of Christ. Jesus said, "If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother
                            and wife and children, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. " He should hate the
                            carnal, worldly, generative life in his relations, and forsake it in himself, in thought,
                            word and deed. Let the wicked forsake his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts. Jesus
                            said, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath and his own life also, he
                            cannot be my disciple. This is the condition of such as bring Ibrth tha fruits of the
                            spirit. Gentleness. One of the apostles said, the servant of the Lord must not strive, but
                            be gentle unto all men, patient, apt to teach. To always keep a calm, peaceable spirit when
                            circumstances seem to place you where there is a boisterotas opposing element or spirit of
                            evil, is evidence that the fruit is good. Goodness. "My people shall be satisfied with my
                            goodness, saith the Lord. " Unless any people or individual render obedience to the will of
                            God as made known to them daily, they do not possess the goodness of God, are not
                            fruit-bearers. Faith. Faith is the gift of God ; it comes by hearing it is the substance of
                            things hoped for. Blessed are those that hear the word of God and keep it. By faith we are
                            saved through the grace of Jesus Christ, that bringeth salvation, teaching us that denying
                            ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present
                            world. Meekness. Jesus said Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth. Take my
                            yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, in complete submission to the will
                            of God, he was mild, unassuming. Temperance. The apostle Paul reasoned with Felix concerning
                            righteousness, temperance and a judgment to come. The apostle Peter exhorts to add to
                            knowledge and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness brotherly
                            kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you and abound they
                            make you that ye be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

                            cost. If to obtain it, the sacrifice is great, the greater the value of the prize and higher
                            the appreciation. The quality of that Avhich is cheap in its price is generally in equal
                            proportion to price, and in the end the most expensive and the least to be prized. We
                            realize this fact, both in the natural and spiritual order. The treasure which is to be
                            found in the gospel of Christ is the "pearl of great price ;" and it costs all that a man
                            hath to obtain it. For this reason, few there be, able or willing to make the sacrifice and
                            pay the price to possess it. As a whole, we find the human will the greatest sacrifice man
                            can render, as it is the dearest and most precious object in life ; for the preservation of
                            which, he will sacrifice everything. Consequently, it becomes his god to be idolized,
                            adored, worshiped, fostered and preserved. Therefore, to come into possession of eternal
                            life, the "pearl of great price," to him who has studied his own proclivities and knows
                            himself, it is a self-evident truth that his will, his selfish life, his darling passions
                            must all be surrendered. It is sadly to be lamented, that the present age gives so little
                            evidence of the existence of the vitalizing spirit of Christ in our churches. The outlook
                                is<pb n="198" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>nothing short of utter failure and annihilation of the power of
                            salvation upon earth, unless by the powerful arm of the Almighty, humanity is moved and
                            drawn to the presence of the Most High. The earth needs a shaking that will reach and move
                            even the heavens, and work upon man a revival that will bring him in humility upon his
                            knees, and cause him to cry out, '�' Lord, what shall I do to be saved?" The civilized world
                            seems indeed on the verge of a great revolution ; a revolution that shall make life more
                            real, profession more practical and religion more an elevating and saving power. Where in
                            all Christendom, (and we may extend it beyond) is there not more or less of a spirit of
                            agitation and disturbance politically, financially and religiously? There exists generally
                            unrest and dissatisfaction. Peace is largely taken from the earth, and the true God is
                            little known among men. Nations are convulsed by a party spirit, a want of sympathy and
                            common brotherhood. The ignoring of self-sacrifice for progress and reform, with a spirit to
                            traduce character and work evil abounds. Such representation may seem unkind and
                            uncharitable ; but is it not too true, not to say universal, yet quite general and to the
                            dishonor of a professed Christian people ? Who that has common perception can deny the
                            absolute necessity of a general subversion in the affairs of men, and the need of a more
                            earnest seeking for the spirit of union in support of morality and Christian religion, the
                            genuine doctrine of Christ, the support of principles that will eventually bring in the
                            fullness of the work and the glory of the millennium. We might well conclude with the
                            Adventists, that the end of the world is near, and that its inhabitants are in a working
                            condition to destroy themselves. The mission of Christ was to bring peace on earth. Unless
                            this is seeured to man, labor is in vain and life not worth having. What then is duty?
                            Common perception, general observation and a knowledge of our own hearts teach us our
                            necessities and absolute requirements essential to the possession of eternal life, the
                            "pearl of great price," whose concomitants are peace and joy in the holy spirit, and the
                            godly love which brings man into love with fellow man, and makes him a brother in all the
                            relations of life ; insomuch, that no place is found in the heart for any selfish interest
                            or debasing indulgence. Enfield, N.

TEIform="persName"/>ELVAH F. COLLINS.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Inspiration, is the main-spring of life in the soul, which directs the outcome of all its
                            thoughts, feelings and actions. As the nature of man is twofold, so also, his inspirations
                            direct the impulses of his life and character, under these dual influences. When yielding to
                            the divine, he is supplied with inspirations from higher powers, which, diffused throughout
                            his being, prompt to lofty aspirations of mind, beneficence of heart, and determinations for
                            further progression in a spiritual life ; while on the other hand, when the impulses of the
                            lower nature assert their right, and claim the powers of mind and body in yielding
                            servitude, he again draws an inspiration beyond and below himself, which strengthens the
                            momentary desire, and blinds his eyes to all that is nobler and better for the time being,
                            after which the higher return, to chasten and reprove, and through the chastening to render
                            an atonement. As these dual elements, created to properly balance each other, have become so
                            unbalanced, (the lower sinking the scales lower, and the higher rising, from its lack of
                            proportionate weight,) it becomes apparent to all that the efforts must be strongly directed
                            to create and sustain the spiritual that it may at least balance the opposite, if it may not
                            bear down the scales with au overbalancing degree. To do this, one must study their
                            inspirations, heeding those which come from above, and repelling foreign influences which
                            seek to degrade. While we as individuals have a certain amount of power to control and
                            direct our course in time, to originate and plan for our own or others benefit or harm, yet,
                            the great sum of life is largely made up from the combined influences and action of the
                            mortal and immortal. As the vail between the two worlds has been growing thinner since the
                            inmates of both have held closer communion together, and as the doors and gates between have
                            so often been left ajar the spirit world thus closely connected with ours, has brought a
                            heavy strain to bear upon the mortal mind, for immortals, having the advantage of a clearer
                            vision, over those in the form, are enabled to read our motives and intentions far more
                            easily than we can discern between the good and the vile, who through easy access roam this
                            world today, on missions of love or hatred. Therefore, how much we need to be educated in
                            the science of Spiritualism, (or Spiritism,) to enable us to discern from which class to
                            draw our inspirations. Spiritualism, in the hands of the ignorant is a deadly poison ; as
                            such are easily deceived by wrong teaching, and led forth under a false inspiration, to
                            teach the world of their mission. They are like ships foundered at sea, finally driven
                            ashore by the merciless winds and waves, as mere wrecks of humanity. As are our hearts and
                            lives, so will the fountain of desire gush forth to meet its kindred waters from streams
                            whose source is in the land of souls. The wary, or spiritually gifted, can alone test these
                            waters, ere they partake of them. Wisdom and understanding are the two great essentials to
                            life, on either side the vail between the two worlds. Watervliet, N. Y.</p></div2><pb n="200" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Don't fret" TEIform="index"/>DON'T FRET

Matt,
                            xvi : 26. A question of such vital importance as this, and fraught with such serious and
                            momentous consequences to the whole human race, should commend itself to the earnest and
                            prayerful consideration of every soul. It is a question which, while it admits of no
                            parrying or evasion, could not fail to reach the heart and find a lodgment therein, unless
                            the incrustations of selfishness and worldliness were so deep and profound, that it failed
                            to pierce their gloom. It breathes forth from the sacred pages as a warning voice,
                            admonishing us of the danger of seeking to amass wealth to ourselves, while we neglect to
                            gain the true riches. It comes reverberating down the dim shadowy aisles of human progress,
                            from mysticism, ignorance and superstition, into the radiant light of the nineteenth
                            century, which dispels all those delusions and phantoms of past ages, and with a demanding
                            voice appeals to the inner consciousness of every heart. "What shall it profit?" On the
                            practical answer to this question may depend our weal or woe through the endless ages of
                            eternity. Though we were able to accumulate riches until our possessions were countless ;
                            and though we might exceed in honor and fame all that had ever preceded us ; or drink so
                            deeply of the cup of earthly enjoyments that we were sated and no longer found pleasure in
                            them ; yet in all these we should find nothing to support and nourish the immortal soul; no
                            abiding and imperishable treasure securely laid up in the heavens; no crown of glory which
                            awaits only those who have overcome the elements of the world in themselves, and have
                            counted all its treasures as but vanity and dross, for the excellency of the durable riches
                            of righteousness. We may spend a long life in gathering and storing up the perishable
                            riches, and find when we have finished our earthly course and passed to the spirit land,
                            that we are poor and destitute. How much wiser, then, would be our course in laboring for
                            and garnering up those spiritual treasures which are infinitely more important; for we are
                            told in the Scriptures that " where our treasure is there will our hearts be also. " In the
                            eager, hot pursuit for gain, how often is it the case that honor and justice, honesty and
                            integrity, noble im-<pb n="201" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>pulses, all benevolent and compassionate feelings
                            for the woes and miseries of others, are stifled and swallowed up; leaving the mind so
                            warped and distorted by the unhallowed greed for gold, that all the kindlier emotions of the
                            heart seem dormant and lifeless. Contrast with this picture the lives of those who are
                            striving ever to live in an element of love and kindness ; and holding to the Apostolic
                            order of a united interest, and the Christ principle of loving our neighbor as ourselves,
                            seeking only their best good regardless of selfish gain or aggrandizement; consecrating all
                            earthly possessions to the service of God, and only seeking to know and do His will., This
                            is the profession that we as a Christian church make, and let us earnestly endeavor to live
                            faithfully up to the standard, that we may attain unto salvation and peace, power to
                            overcome the world, " Even as I also, overcame and am set down with my Father in His
                            throne."

                                copy of the Manifesto, which I received from you while I resided in Monroe Co., Ohio. I
                                moved here with my family in December 1883 and have often thought of sending for the
                                Manifesto, which I like very much. You will find enclosed the subscription price. If you
                                have an old copy with woodcut of Union Village on it I would be glad if you would send
                                it to me. I find several in this country who are in favor of community life, having all
                                things in common, but as they have never heard of the Shaker Society they know nothing
                                about it. I am an out and out Shaker Spiritualist, but from what I know of your life in
                                Shakerdom, we are far in the rear of you. I often wish I was m a situation to live a
                                purer life, then pure spirits would attend me and then I would be a happier man. My
                                spirit begins to reach out for a purer atmosphere, where there is not so much
                                selfishness and where can I find it. Not where every man is striving to accumulate
                                wealth and riches of a material character and where impurity reigns supreme. When
                                Spiritualists come to understand the true object of Spiritualism we will find it demands
                                of us to live a purer life, and adopt the communistic. Yours is imitative of angelic
                                life and when you commune with spirits, you are sure of obtaining reliable
                                communications which we often fail to get, because we do not live pure lives as the
                                nobler class of spirits do. I feel moved to say to you all. Be ye encouraged, for your
                                light will eventually enlighten humanity. Brethren and Sisters (for such I feel
                                privileged to hail you) do not forget that your manner of life is the happiest on this
                                earth, for the sorrows and perplexities of a base selfish life are unknown to you. Yours

                                six days. It is exceedingly agreeable to our feelings to see your desires reaching
                                upward in the direction of the only normal and proper growth of the human spirit and
                                intelligence, toward the ever increasing light of purity, and source of all true life
                                and happiness. I do not know if there ever was a time in the world's history that the
                                minds of men were more ready and anxious to receive light than at present. And God has
                                provided the light required in those who walk in His commandments. I mean the light of
                                the spirit of immortality. Our faith and practice is based upon the conviction that
                                human beings are accountable for the light they receive, and that no one is justified
                                before God who does not obey or put in practice all the light given them. Only those who
                                walk in the light, can long see clearly, and only those who see clearly can reason
                                correctly from truthful premises to sound conclusions. Hence I believe that only those
                                who live the true life, can teach from that life, can have the doctrine which imparts
                                life to its receivers, only such are effective and safe teachers. All others are as it
                                were, only reflectors, if they shed any light, or parrot like repeaters by rote or
                                memory, or teachers oi errors which must be unlearned, before the true light can shine
                                in and set the soul at liberty. No soul is really free, who cannot approximate in
                                practice to his highest ideal of truth and purity, and clearest convictions of right and
                                duty. And before one can be set at liberty, there must first be a consciousness of
                                bondage or servitude to inferior desires and habits ; next, a desire awakened
                                sufficiently strong, to enable him to work success; fully for emancipation. Then spirits
                                who have gained emancipation, both in the body and out, spirits who have risen to a
                                higher level, can aid him according to the earnestness and sincerity of his efforts. The
                                proverb says " Steep and craggy is the path of the gods." What! a plurality of gods ?
                                Yea, all are gods in a limited sense, in whom the spirit of God rules with undivided
                                sway. They are the lineal offspring of God, who dwells in them, and molds all their
                                character and conduct. � Well, what of all this? Why, those who travel this path find it
                                roughest and toughest at the beginning or initial end only, for though " hills peep o'er
                                hills, and Alps on Alps arise," the summit is crowned with illimitable fields of beauty
                                and glory, where all talents can be made useful, where all Godly graces and virtues
                                flourish, where no mar nor imperfection, nor stain of corruption, nor alloy of
                                selfishness, nor vexation, nor trouble can come. '' Obedience to law must precede the
                                ripening of the soul." Hence though they wander ten thousand years in the boundless
                                wilderness of nature, o'er bog, or fen, or desert wastes, or through enchanting scenes
                                of beauty, wealth and fame, and all things delightful to the animal man, but which
                                perish with the march of time, that hill or mountain of self-denial and self-conquest
                                they must climb before they can rest from the weariness of toil, or gain that treasure
                                of goodness within which alone can feed immortal desires, or liberate and perfect<pb n="203" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> those highest attributes of the intelligent spirit, the free and
                                proper exercise of which alone can bring the joy of contentment aad everlasting peace.
                                Would to God that all could realize the conviction of this. They would be in haste to
                                begin the work of casting off the clogs of earthly desires, that they might ascend light
                                and free to the celestial p^ins above. Do not think these views speculative, nor
                                rhapsodic, for they are partly testimony of experience, or plain inference from that
                                which has been tested. Man's ideal of the happiness and peace to be enjoyed in the
                                community order of life, where the talents of the strong and skillful are consecrated to
                                God, and the shelter and uplifting of the weaker and less happily endowed brother or
                                sister, is but a foreshadowing of the Real, which we believe is fast approaching through
                                the honest, well directed labors of earnest toilers for a better hope. If you have
                                doubts or questions to solve in relation to the whys and wherefores of our faith and
                                practice, we are ready to try to remove the one, or solve the other as the case may be.
                                Believing you will not fail to find, according to the earnestness and persistency of
                                your seeking, and hoping your example may draw others to the better way, I will close by

                            representative of the Canterbury, N. H. Shaker Community, arose in the audience and asking
                            permission to say a few words, was cordially invited to the platform. I rise to express the
                            very great pleasure I have enjoyed here in attending the<pb n="204" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>meetings of
                            Anniversary Week with you. When I look back and realize the changes that have taken place
                            since the time the founder of our institution, who was a woman, came to this country, a
                            little more than a cettury ago, and first pronounced many of the views I have heard
                            expressed here this afternoon and during this week, I say to myself, The world does indeed
                            move. Ann Lee, whom I am pleased to call " mother " first pronounced in this country, as we
                            understand it, the equality of the sexes, and the duality of the Godhead, which is now
                            recognized and indorsed by many outside of our institution. To set aside the doctrine of the
                            Trinity was then considered almost blasphemous. Yet she did that, and established a parental
                            form of government. She denied, too, there was any such thing as a literal physical
                            resurrection. Perhaps she established the co-operative system as early as any one. Of
                            course, she preached the doctrine of peace and unity; and, coming at the time of the
                            American Eevolution, she was imprisoned as one who was a Tory, and as preaching what was
                            detrimental to a republican form of government which our fathers were trying to establish.
                            But the institution which she so early established has survived so far, and prospered; and
                            whatever there may be of error, whatever there may be of wrong in it, I know that time and
                            the blessing of God will purify it. It has been our effort to live true to the teachings of
                            Christ, and to show ourselves to the world as earnest, Christian workers. I am glad to meet
                            in this hall with the members of the Free Religious Society. My early days were so blessed
                            with the ideas advanced by the anti-slavery movement, and all the way up since I joined the
                            institution I am in, that I feel I live in the very atmosphere of free thought. My father
                            was an intimate friend of Mr. Nathaniel Eogers, and the Herald of Freedom was as well known
                            in our family as the Bible. I remember reading with tears of the murder of our lamented
                            Lovejoy in the West. I have kept pace with the progress of all those movements, and I always
                            feel it a pleasure when I meet any of the friends of woman suffrage or of Free religious
                            thought. I came upon the platform to speak these few words, simply from a conviction of a
                            religious duty I owe the institution of which I have been a member almost forty years. That
                            institution has afforded me every opportunity for freedom of thought, for freedom in every
                            respect; and if any advancement is lacking, and there is much which I hope to gain in the
                            future, it is not owing to our institution. I thank you, Mr. President, for the privilege I
                            have enjoyed. I am very glad to have met all these friends here and hope you may prosper as
                            oar prayers go up to God for your success. Eemarks of Mary L. Wilson, of the Canterbury
                            Community. My dear Friends,�In listening to the earnest speeches this afternoon and
                            throughout the week in behalf of a purer Christianity, of woman suffrage, and temperance,
                            and moral reform, I said often to myself: "Can I leave the city without telling the friends
                            that I live in a home where I believe the kingdom of heaven is established upon the earth?
                            Can I leave the city without proclaiming this truth, and inviting all who have any interest
                            in this direction, who are seeking and asking what they shall do to be saved, to come with
                            us ; to go wherever the spirit of God will lead you to seek a higher life and a greater
                            truth that will bring your souls nearer God? " I have found this life. I have found the
                            truth that has been spoken of this afternoon. It is in Christ. It is a Christian life. It is
                            the purity, the uprightness, the honesty, the nobility, that alone gives a noble character
                            to any one in this world. And it is this character that will bring about the reform that is
                            needed, that will result in the Free Religious associations, that will result in the
                            greatest benefit to mankind. And the Shakers, my friends, are thoroughly in earnest in this
                            work. They are really members of your Association. We are not able to become actual members,
                            but in life and in principle we are members. And I want it to go far and near. I ask you to
                            bear it in mind, and remember us in your prayers before God as brothers and sisters, as
                            co-workers with you in this universal brotherhood.<pb n="205" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>This principle is
                            thoroughly exemplified in our Societies. Practical peace is there taught, and it is there
                            practiced. And there are many other noble principles j I migh, speak of, all taken from the
                            beautiful ex. ample of the life of Jesus. We live after that pattern. We have no other God
                            but the God that you are serving.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Invocation to angels" TEIform="index"/> INVOCATION TO ANGELS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Shepard, Arabella" TEIform="persName"/>ARABELLA SHEPARD.</byline><p TEIform="p"> [The following lines were written by Sister Arabella at the age of eighty five years.]
                            Angels guard my erring footsteps, While life's mazy path I tread, Till my days grow long and
                            weary, Till the morn of life is tied. Till the deep'ning shades of evening, Gather round my
                            sinking form. Then kind Angels sent from Heaven, When the night of death shall come; Lead me
                            safely through the valley, Take, Oh, take my spirit home, Angels take my spirit home. When I
                            fly my homeward journey, Grant me wings as pure as thine, Place a crown upon my forehead,
                            There forever more to shine. On a harp of heavenly music, Teach my willing hands to play
                            Anthems such as angel choirs, Chant through everlasting day. Holy Angels sent from Heaven,
                            When the night of death shall come, Lead me safely through the valley, Take, Oh, take my
                            spirit home, Angels take my spirit home. When my evening sun is setting, Gently let the
                            shadows fall, When I leave this earthly temple To obey the Master's call. Guide me through
                            the chilling waters, Light my pathway to the tomb ; Rob the arrow of its sharpness, And the
                            churchyard of its gloom. Gentle Angels sent from Heaven, When the night of death shall come,
                            Lead me safely through the valley, Take, Oh, take my spirit home, Angels take my spirit
                            home. North Union, Ohio.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Why is it so?"

                            tread, In tireless march, a thorny way �, Some struggle on where some have fled; Some seek,
                            when others shun the fray. Some sleep on while others keep The vigils of the true and brave;

                            Union, Robert Johns, to assist us in finishing the new dwelling. The family arranged to move
                            into the building on the 23rd of May and Elder Archibald read the rules and regulations that
                            were to be observed. It was not uncommon at this date for the Brethren and Sisters to pass
                            from Busro to Union Village, in a carriage or in the saddle. The distance is 300 miles and
                            the trip occupied from eight to eighteen days. In 1825 we had a cold and open winter. The
                            spring and early summer were very favorable but a drouth commenced about the first of July
                            and continued till the first of September. This proved very injurious to the crops,
                            especially to the fifty six acres of corn. The death rate this year was large and the
                            unhealthiness of the place began to be more and more a matter of discussion. The country was
                            but sparsely settled, and the low lands could not be sufficiently drained, so that as warm
                            weather approached the at-<pb n="206" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> mosphere was charged with malaria. Those
                            who were delicate in health or overtaxed by physical exertion soon fell victims to the
                            scourge, and were taken from us, much to our sorrow. In 1826 John Dunlavy and Samuel
                            McClelland made a visit to Pleasant Hill, Ky., on the 19th. of January, arriving at that
                            place at ten o'clock in the evening. Samuel returned on the 27th of April but John remained
                            in Kentucky till the third of June. Thirty or more persons were sick with the fever in the
                            spring and before the year closed nearly every member of the Society had been under the
                            physician's care. On the 8th of Sept., Br. John Dunlavy was taken sick and confined to the
                            house only eight days, as he passed away on the 16th. He was able to walk about the house
                            till the last day. Several of the leaders of the Society made a visit to Union Village in
                            the month of Oct., and on the 19th. of Nov., the Society was informed that the Ministry,
                            Elders and Trustees in the communities of Ohio and Kentucky thought it to be for the best
                            that the people should move from Busro and leave the place forever. Small parties were made
                            ready and sent to South Union, Pleasant Hill or to Union Village. On the 25th. the great
                            removal took place, but the journey was comparatively light as the roads were so much better
                            and the conveyances more convenient. It required much care and wisdom to be able to arrange
                            for those that remained for the present at the old homestead. All the property of the
                            Society was passed into the charge of the Trustees of Union Village and Pleasant Hill as
                            officers in order before them. Several parties had already gone to the Societies in Kentucky
                            and Ohio since the opening of the new year and were finding good and beautiful homes in
                            these several localities. On the 10th. of Mar., four wagons that had arrived from South
                            Union, returned to that place with twenty eight persons. For two or three weeks the making
                            of boxes and the packing of plunder, (baggage) kept all hands very busily employed, and all
                            minds filled with anxiety. The trustees of Pleasant Hill had agreed with the officers of the
                            steamboat�Lawrence, to take us and our baggage on their return trip. The boat arrived on the
                            afternoon of the 19th. when the sailors began to tumble the property into the boat, with but
                            little care so that we were put to much inconvenience as it was to be unloaded at several
                            places. At thirty five minutes past five P. M. we pushed off from McCarter's landing and bid
                            adieu to all our hard earned possessions on Busro prairie. The boat stopped at Vincennes
                            during the night. Many of the citizens who had been acquainted with us, seemed sorry for our
                            departure and sought to entertain us with instrumental and vocal music, and many good wishes
                            for our welfare. To many of us it was a sleepless night, and a season of solemn meditation.
                            At three o'clock the next morning the boat left the landing. We made a stop at Harmony for
                            about an hour and then soon reached the Ohio river. We sailed all night and passed
                            Evansville at daybreak and landed at Yellow Banks at one o'clock, P. M. Here we unloaded the
                            property belonging to those who went to South Union, and left it in care of Samuel
                            McClelland and Washington Rice. These Brethren then proceeeded on foot to their home where
                            they arrived safely on the 26th. Our boat sailed along easily and pleasantly up the Ohio and
                            arrived at Shipping Port at 6 P. M. and remained there through the night. We soon learned
                            that the steamboat could not pass over the falls. Two Brethren 'rom Pleasant Hill came on
                            board today 24th. much to our surprise and pleasure. We are now, the 25th. spending the
                            Sab&gt;ath, and are visited by a great number of )eople. from Louisville Ky., and
                            Shipping 3ort Ky., who look with astonishment at the observance of a Sabbath on board a
                            steam)oat. On the 26th. we left the boat, and all of our goods were unloaded and conveyed
                            above the falls. Those that were going to Union Village lad their goods shipped on board of
                            the teamer, Decatur, which would stop at Cininnati. Those for Pleasant Hill were put n board
                            a keel boat and this was lashed to lie side of the steamer. By this move we were forced to
                            another degree of separation.<pb n="207" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>We had bid adieu to the dear friends who
                            had passed on to South Union and soon must take our last farewell of this company bound for
                            Pleasant Hill. At night we reached Louisville and remained in port till the next morning.
                            The engine was in motion quite early on the 27th* We had a high wind and rough sailing but
                            arrived at the mouth of the Kentucky river at 7 P. M. The distance between the boats
                            prevented the expression of many good wishes for each others welfare, so that one of the
                            Brethren acted as the speaker in the ceremonies of adieu. The keelboat was unlashed and
                            fastened to the shore during the night. The next morning it pushed off into the Kentucky
                            river, and the sailors were now obliged to use their oars and poles as they had lost the aid
                            of the steam engine. The progress, however, was necessarily slow. Several of the Brethren
                            and Sisters were suffering from severe colds and were quite unfitted for such a long and
                            laborious journey. This company arrived at Pleasant Hill on the 9th of April where they
                            found many friends. After a few days of rest they were all pleasantly settled in their new
                            homes. The steamer moved along very pleasantly for awhile, but as ill luck would have it,
                            the steamboat Atlanta carelessly stove into our wheel house. That we were all very much
                            frightened, might well be expected, but we soon learned that the accident was not very
                            serious. Some hard words and strong speeches were freely used by the officers and sailors of
                            both companies. The boats separated, the fright passed away and we once more moved safely
                            along. Mar. 28th. at the mouth of the Big Miami river, Elder Archibald and several others
                            landed at Lawrenceburg. We then passed on to Cincinnati where we were met by friends from
                            Union Village, who had prepared carriages for our special conveyance to their and our home.
                            As we were to remain in the city over night, we gladly retired early ; we so much needed the
                            quiet rest. At eleven o'clock on the 29th. the whole company moved off and having reached
                            the village of Reading we made a halt for the night. Early the next morning the company were
                            again moving along and arrived safely at Union Village where our friends uniformly bid us
                            welcome and treated us with all the kindness our hearts could wish. We spent several days in
                            resting and in visiting from house to house, when we were conducted to our respective homes,
                            where we expect to dwell for the remainder of our uncertain lives. Pleasant Hill, Ky. ( The
                            End. )</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To the Manifesto" TEIform="index"/> TO THE MANIFESTO.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Shepard, Rebecca A."

                            to continue the sweet interchange of thought and feeling among the different Societies of
                            Believers, the universal Brother-hood. I love to read it and enjoy communion in its pages ;
                            I love to see the varied expression of sentiment among our Brethren and Sisters. Is it not a
                            bond of union among ourselves? And then added to this, is the one paramount reason, why we
                            should send out the precious gospel truths, which we believe to us are Godgiven. The world
                            at large are needy of them ; and our God '' will not hold us guiltless, " if we refuse to
                            disseminate them. Some of the words of an ancient missionary hymn are brought forcibly to
                            mind, viz : " Shall we whose souls are lighted,� By wisdom from on high, Shall we, to men
                            be-nighted, The lamp of life deny? " O nay, God forbid ! We must "send out our light." Then
                            go forth, dear MANIFESTO, and bid the gospel kindred to let their light shine abroad ; say
                            to them do not " hide it under a bushel; " but send it forth to the needy and op-<pb n="208" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> pressed. Surely, we feel it is a blessing to us, ought we Jhen, to cease our
                            efforts to dispense it to others? Shall we not rather make some sacrifice, in order to
                            sustain the dear little u Herald of Truth?" I am willing for one, I think, to sacrifice all
                            personal feelings, and contribute my '' mite " to help sustain thee ; and bid thee
                            "God-speed" in going forth to the needy abroad, laden with the blessed gospel truths. Go and
                            carry them far and near ; and may the blessing of the Lord attend the writers word; for we
                            know '' though Paul may plant, and Apollos water, God giveth the increase. " Do we not, each
                            one of mature age certainly owe our efforts, even though they are small, to further the
                            cause of God ? owe it to the human race? And the Sister-hood, to our own sex? We certainly
                            are for "Woman's rights," in the best, truest sense of the term. Shall we not then, use our
                            best endeavors to spread the gospel of truth and freedom abroad in the land, the glad
                            tidings that have brought a blessing to us? Thou Herald of Freedom, go and make manifest
                            these things ; teach our race of a higher, purer life, awaiting them,�a nobler existence.

                            followed his example by living strictly as he lived, renouncing all that might be called
                            good or great by the proud and self-exalted ones of earth; bearing a full cross until the
                            Master could approvingly say, " Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. "
                            They had made a perfect separation from all the elements which constitute or sustain merely
                            a worldly life. Their lives were so fully permeated with that living testimony which he
                            preached that they stood forth as " The light of the world." It is thus that every Christian
                            is called to live, that our lives may be, not merely a candle on a candle-stick, but shine
                            forth with the beauteous rays of the morning illumined by the " Sun of righteousness." Then
                            shall we be disciples in very deed. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Easiest way" TEIform="index"/>THE EASIEST WAY

                                get my lessons so that I can have a Summer ride. I hope my report will be good. I hope I
                                can go to walk sometime, it is so pleasant to go to walk. I am going to try to talk
                                gently while at my work. The flowers are very pretty. I set in type that motto you told
                                us about in "The Manifesto." I liked it last evening very much. I am glad I have got a
                                little flower bed. I like to take care of flowers. I should like to get 100 in all my
                                lessons. I should be glad if I could. Sister Marcia said she would like to hear how I
                                was getting along in school sometimes so I shall tell her. I don't know as I can think
                                of much more, but after all I have a few more lines to write. I like my flower bed very
                                much, I think it is very pretty. I hope it wont rain this evening if it does then I
                                cannot go out and see about it. I should like to set another piece after I get that one
                                done that I am doing. I hope I can have one next week. I shall try to get all my lessons
                                next week. After I finish this letter I shall take my Arithmetic. I wish I could write a
                                longer letter. I have tried to keep my motto.

                                and yet how soon we should discover its loss should we occupy a room void of this
                                article. I have learned that the word broom was first given to a kind of short bushy
                                shrub which grew in India, finally it became the custom to gather this broom and tie it
                                together to use for sweeping purposes. It is of the leguminous species because it bears
                                a legume or pod which is divided into two divisions or valves having the seeds attached
                                to one suture like the pea pod. More recently broom corn lias become more popular and is
                                used quite extensively. It is a tall reed with jointed stem, the head only being used
                                for brooms. I have read that Dr. Franklin planted a single seed in this country which he
                                took from a whisk of broom corn in England and from it have sprung all the broom corn
                                plants that have been raised in this country. The plant that is most commonly cultivated
                                is nearly twice the height of an ordinary man and resembles Indian corn very closely but
                                the head or brush from which brooms are made is much larger than that of Indian corn. It
                                bears no ear, the seed being all on the brush, but these seeds have to be taken off
                                before it can be used and quite frequently they are given as food to horses and poultry.
                                The handles are made of several kinds of wood. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="King, Mary Ellen" TEIform="persName"/> Mary Ellen King. </byline></div3><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear Teacher Jeannette Forest: As you feel very anxious..."

                                are becoming good writers and nice composers I thought of telling you a little story
                                about elephants. I have read that the elephant is the largest and most awkward of land
                                animals they are about eight feet high. The "Young Folks' Encyclopedia" says that they
                                become full grown when about thirty years old, and they sometimes live from one hundred
                                and twenty to one hundred and fifty years. The head of the elephant is very large but
                                they have very short necks, they could not reach to eat or drink without the aid of
                                their trunks. In the picture their trunks look to be about four or five feet long. The
                                food that they live mostly upon is vegetables, leaves, grass and roots. Their tusks are
                                made of ivory covered with a hard enamel. Elephants are found in Central Africa. I have
                                heard that the Arabs are the principle hunters. They sometimes kill over seventy a day.
                                They generally do their hunting on foot and towards noontime. They do their hunting at
                                this time because the elephant wishes to lie down to rest. This is all I learned from
                                the story, but I hope some day to compose and write as nicely as you do. Ever your

                                eventful instances in religious history. Its advent had been heralded for thousands of
                                years and a wonderful anxiety had pervaded the Jewish nation which anticipated the honor
                                of becoming the favored people. The word of God came and dwelt among men. The testimony
                                of the two edged sword was used as only God's devoted messengers could use it. A light
                                was upon the earth which could comprehend all darkness. False coverings were of no avail
                                for God through these ministers of his word declared that what had been hid should be
                                manifested, and that which had been done in secret, should come to the light. It was the
                                wonderful day of God's power. It gave evidence of this in the external demonstrations of
                                healing the sick, giving sighi to the blind and hearing to the deaf; even the dead were
                                raised and came forth praising God. After the falling away of this first Christian
                                Church, and during the long period of spiritual darkness, many faithful messengers of
                                God appeared from time to time and permitted their light to so shine that others were
                                led to glorify God through them. In the Revelation of St. John they are called the Two
                                Witnesses, and indeed, they were witnesses, as they represented the family of man, and
                                as fully and faithfully the two gospel dispensations. They were the living Avitnesses of
                                the word of God and their united testimony was given with great power against the subtle
                                and pernicious doctrines of antichrist's kingdom. Other witnesses arose to speak the
                                word of God. Faithful to the divine voice, they maintained the testimony of truth, and
                                many were called to lay down their lives in defence of the faith. These were the
                                celestial lights that were to be seen more or less distinctly during the long and gloomy
                                night when " darkness covered the earth, and gross darkness the people." This church of
                                Christ was established through the revelation of God, and in proper time gave to the
                                world the benefits of its spiritual light and power. It was the temple that the prophet
                                saw in his beautiful vision.�'; Come ye, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
                                the house of the God of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
                                paths, for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem."
                                Isa. xi, 8. This church, so long as it stood faith-<pb n="211" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> ful to the
                                cause of trutli was a swift witness against the sins of the world and could not be
                                overcome. Not even the gates of hell could prevail against it. It was, however, in the
                                charge of human agencies. Servants of God, more or less faithful were the guardians of
                                the heavenly treasure. In process of time another element was found to be gradually
                                working its way into the order and finally to overcome the church so effectually that it
                                was said to have been trodden under foot and the blessings of religious liberty largely
                                driven from the earth. More witnesses continued to arise and testify boldly against the
                                powers of darkness. It was the midnight of aatichristian reign and ruin, but their
                                voices were heard and the force of the persecuting spirit began to decline. Truth and
                                light again dawned upon mankind, religious liberty was brought forward, and receiving
                                the support of such able advocates as were to be found among men, it continued to
                                increase till liberty of conscience found a permanent resting place, once more upon the
                                earth. Gifted classes arose under the name of heretics, fanatics, enthusiasts, Puritans
                                and New lights, and testified of the incoming of a wonderful work of God among men.
                                "Liberty of conscience was a remarkable display of the providence of God in favor of
                                this divine work. At this time the spirit of life from God entered into the witnesses
                                and they stood upon their feet. In obedience to the voice of eternal love which called
                                them, they rose up in the life and power of their testimony, above the power of
                                antichristian tyranny and all its corrupt principles and doctrines. But from the time
                                these witnesses began to rise, it was a number of years before they could gain real
                                possession of the holy city. " Prophetic numbers led us along from year to year, till
                                the word of God became established in the order of a church which should bear the
                                testimony of eternal life. Of this we now become the active witnesses. Light and truth
                                has beea revealed and we are made partakers of His unbounded love.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>SANITARY</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Constipation" TEIform="index"/>CONSTIPATION

                                        has not yet been vouchsafed to man. This fact, so patent on all sides, is not
                                        due to any deliberate design on the part of a beneficent Creator, but rather to
                                        the failure on the part of man, to fulfill the conditions of perfect beatitude.
                                        This failure is either the result of deliberate contravention of nature's laws,
                                        or is due to an ignorance of these laws When men shall have learned to

                                        however, imply a state of perfection which is in the very remote future.

                                        appreciated except by one competent to discriminate<pb n="212" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/>the
                                        train of complex ills directly traceable to it. The intestines may aptly be
                                        called the main sewer of the body. While very important products of waste are
                                        eliminated through other channels, this is that through which the great bulk is
                                        carried off. Physical well being depends quite as much�and indeed more�on a
                                        proper discharge of waste than on a proper supply of food. The body generates
                                        poisons which, if they were not carried off, would be speedily fatal; and to the
                                        extent that they are retained, through arrest of the function of the intestines
                                        and other emunctories, we have physical discomfort and disease. A surprising
                                        percentage of such discomfort and disease is traceable to constipation. This
                                        fact is very generally recognized, and as a consequence, we have the immense
                                        popularity and use of cathartics and nostrums whose chief virtue lies in their
                                        cathartic properties. The great defect in the cathartics in vogue, lies in the
                                        fact that they work only temporary relief, and instead of improving the
                                        condition to which the constipation is due, they but aggravate it. Constipation
                                        is due to deficient tone or contractile power in the muscular coats of the
                                        intestines. While a brisk cathartic of Epsom salts for instance, may unload an
                                        accumulation which the diminished contractile power of the intestines is
                                        incompetent to propel onward, it does so by stimulating the muscular fibre. Now,
                                        it is a philosophical law that stimulation is followed by depression and this
                                        law is illustrated in the increased torpidity of the bowels and constipation
                                        which follows a brisk catharsis. What is required in the treatment of
                                        constipation is a remedy which, while evacuating the intestines, restores the
                                        lost tonicity of the muscular coats to which the difficulty is due. Physicians
                                        seek to effect this double object by combining such drugs as nux vomica or
                                        strychnia, etc., with the laxatives which they prescribe. Drugs of the latter
                                        nature must be employed with great circumspection, and never without the advice
                                        and under the supervision of the physician. They are thus not adapted to
                                        domestic use. A harmless tonic cathartic that seems to have grown into great
                                        favor during the past few years, is Ehammer's purshiana, or Cascara Sangrada.
                                        This drug is the bark of a small tree found on the Pacific coast in this
                                        country; the excessive bitterness of the crude bark has been overcome by the use
                                        of aromatics in the preparation known as Cascara cordial. It operates without
                                        griping, and has the great advantage of imparting tone to the muscular fibre of
                                        the intestines. The mistake is often made by the patient of "pinning his faith"
                                        to a single remedy, and hence he is often disappointed in the result. In
                                        addition to the use of cascara cordial he should continue the employment of
                                        those means which all have found advantageous : as bread made from whole wheat
                                        flour, pearled oats, etc., besides the free use of fresh fruits. We do not, as a
                                        rule, recommend the use of enemas : but there are cases of constipation that bid
                                        defiance to all other remedies, and in these cases they should be resorted to,
                                        cautiously but persistently, until the object is accomplished; their daily use
                                        may become imperative during life. We have frequently recommended the more
                                        simple and usually more effective plan of using suppositories conjointly with
                                        the use of cascara cordial, as above referred to. When it is considered that
                                        habitual constipation is the cause of more than half of the diseases that
                                        afflict mankind, and that it cannot exist for a long time without undermining
                                        the constitution, no thoughtful person will neglect the employment of any safe
                                        remedies that afford the remotest promise of relief.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Hall's journal of health" TEIform="index"/> Hall's Journal of Health.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Profanity" TEIform="index"/>PROFANITY

                                        occasion or circumstances will excuse him. Not even the sacerdotal robe can
                                        shield the guilty from retributive justice. If there is any difference in the

                                    Ingratitude.�It is an old saying that if you do a man nineteen favors, and for any
                                    reason decline to do the twentieth, he will forget the nineteen requests that you
                                    have granted, and only remember the one that you have refused�and for that refusal
                                    he will hate you for ever after. This is true of some men; it is true of mean and
                                    narrow nature; it is not true of all. It is as natural for a noble soul to cherish a
                                    lively recollection of kindnesses received, as it is to breathe. And while we are
                                    often shocked to see acts of friendship toward others, which have cost us a good
                                    deal of time and of labor, entirely overlooked and forgotten, we not unfrequently,
                                    on the other hand, are surprised by the grateful reciprocation of some favor long
                                    since rendered, and the very performance of which had passed from our own
                                    recollections, until reminded of it by the recipient. We have always regarded
                                    gratitude as a. feeling which is hardly susceptible of being taught to any one. A
                                    lecture on gratitude, to whomsoever addressed, instead of awakening that emotion, is
                                    very apt to engender a feeling of indignation and hatred. People never like to be

                            Who notes down each good deed of ours, and then Seals it with kisses in the Master's sight.
                            Upon our left a sister angel sweet Keeps daily record of each evil act; But, great in love,
                            folds not the mournful sheet, Till deepest midnight; when, if conscience racked, We lift to
                            Allah our repentant hands, She smiles, and blots the record where she stands; But, if we
                            seek not pardon for our sin, She seals it with a tear, and hands it in. "</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Earnest preaching" TEIform="index"/>EARNEST PREACHING

                                    to see how it stands with us, with the deep and dear facts of right and love. At the
                                    same time it is impossible to pay no regard to the day's events, to the public
                                    opinion of the time, to the stirring shouts of parties, to the calamities and

                                    only the Black Sea, but the Straits of Dardanelles were frozen over, and, in some
                                    places the snow rose fifty feet high. In 822, the great rivers of Europe�the Danube,
                                    the Elbe and others were so hard frozen as to bear heavy wagons for a month. In 860,
                                    the Adriatic was frozen. In 991, everything was frozen, the crops totally failed,
                                    and famine and pestilence closed the year. In 1067, most of the travelers in Germany
                                    were frozen to death on the roads. In 1134, the Po was frozen from Cremona to the
                                    sea; the wine sacks were burst, and the trees split, by the action of the frost,
                                    with immense noise. In 1236, the Danube was frozen to the bottom, and remained long
                                    in that state. In 1816 the crops wholly failed in Germany. Wheat, which some years
                                    before sold at 6s. per quarter, rose to �2. In 1308, the crops failed in Scotland,
                                    and such a famine ensued that the poor were reduced to feed on grass, and many
                                    perished miserably in the fields. The successive winters of 1432, 3, and 4, were
                                    uncommonly severe. In 1363 the wine distributed to the soldiers, was cut with
                                    hatchets. In 1683, it was excessively cold. Most of the hollys were killed, coaches
                                    drove along the Thames, the ice of which was 11 inches thick. In 1809, occurred the
                                    cold winter; the frost penetrated the earth three yards into the ground. In 171G
                                    booths were erected on the Thames. In 1744, and 1745, the strongest ale in England,
                                    exposed to the air, was covered, in less than fifteen Biinutes, with ice an eighth
                                    of an inch thick. In 1809, and again in 1812, the winters were remarkably cold. In
                                    1814, there was a fair on the frozen Thames. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Hunt's Merchant's Magazine" TEIform="index"/>Hunts Merchants Magazine.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Never too late to learn" TEIform="index"/>NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN

                                    language. Plutarch, when between seventy and eighty, commenced tke study of Latin.
                                    Boccaccio was thirty-five years of age when he commenced his studies in light
                                    literature, yet he became one of the grandest masters of the Tuscan dialect, Dante
                                    and Petrarch being the other two. Sir Henry Spelman neglected the sciences in his
                                    youth, but commenced the study of them when he was between fifty and sixty years of
                                    age. After this he became a learned antiquarian and lawyer. Doctor Johnson applied
                                    himself to the Dutch language but a few years before his death. Ludovico Moenaldsco,
                                    at the great age of one hundred and fifteen, wrote the memoirs of his own times.
                                    Ogilby, the translator of Homer and Virgil, was unacquainted with Latin and Greek
                                    until he was past fifty. Franklin did not fully commence his philosophical pursuits
                                    till he had reached his fiftieth year. Dryden, in his sixty-eighth year, commenced
                                    the translation of the Iliad, his most pleasing production. We could go on and cite
                                    thousands of examples of men who commenced a new study, either for livelihood or
                                    amusement, at an advanced age. But every one familiar with the biography of
