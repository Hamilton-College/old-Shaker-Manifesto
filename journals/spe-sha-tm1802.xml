A Novel Business Calendar and Stand,
By far the most novel, convenient, and valuable
business calendar for 1888 is the Columbia Bicycle
Calendar and Stand, just issued by the Pope Manu- .
facturing Company, of Boston, Mass. In this calendar a new departure has been made, decidedly
unique and different from any previous attempt in
calendar construction. The calendar proper is in
the form of a pad, containing 366 leaves, one for each
day in the year, to be torn off daily. The leaves
are five and one eighth by two ant} three fourths
inches, and a portion of each leaf is left blank for
memoranda, so arranged that the memorandum
blank for any coming day can be turned to immediately at any time. The pad rests upon a portable
stand, which takes up but little more room than the
pad itself, and when placed upon the desk or writing-table the entire surface of the date leaf is
brought directly, and left constantly, before the eye,
furnishing date and memoranda, impossible to be
overlooked. Besides the month, the day of the
month, and the day of the week, the numbers of the
days of the year passed and to come are specified and
upon each slip appears, as in the previous Columbia
calendars, quotations pertaining to cycling from leading publications and prominent writers on both
sides of the ocean. The notable events in cycling
are mentioned, and concise opinions of medical authorities ; words from prominent wheelmen, including those of clergymen and other professional gentlemen; rights of cyclers upon the roads; general
cycling statistics; records; the benefits of tricycling
to ladies; information about costumes; directions
for road-making; and other matter interesting to the
public in general and to the cycler in particular, appear from day to day. In fact it is an effective, attractive, and fresh cycling encyclopaedia, crowded
into convenient measure. A matter worth stating
is that all of the paragraphs are entirely new from
previous years' calendars, and that, although there
seem to be but little when read from day to di.y, altogether the items would make a medium-sized
pamphlet, and, added to the collections of other
years, a large volume�a collection of quotations
which shows how popular and universal cycling is
getting to be all over the world.

                            entered Richmond, Mass., July 24 1783, aud were received with great joy by the Brethren aud
                            Sisters of this place, and also of Hancock. Their meetings were well attended and the
                            general behavior of the strangers was remarkably good, during the first evening. On the
                            second day a number of persons came and conducted very rudely, but were kept out of the
                            house by the Brethren. A meeting was held on the 3rd. of August, and during the first part
                            of the day the proceedings were very peaceful. Many, without doubt, came with honest
                            intentions. Before the close of the day a change came over the people, and they manifested a
                            very riotous disposition, scoffing and threatening, and some went so far as to beat and
                            abuse the Believers. On Monday the numbers increased and they conducted themselves in an
                            unbecoming and malicious manner, making accusations against Mother Ann and the Elders. A
                            Baptist minister by the name of Rathburne, was the instigator and leader of this mob. He had
                            at a former date, accepted the faith of the Believers, but after a few mouth's trial had
                            apostatized and become very unkind. He entered the house with a part of his company, and
                            began to revile Mother and the Elders, by calling them deceivers and false prophets. His own
                            sou who heard this reproachful language, reproved his father. " I think it is a shame," said
                            he, "for a man of God, and a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as you profess to be,
                            to come here, at the head of a mob, to abuse an innocent people." The reproof only aroused
                            more anger and this minister not being able to say anything in the presence of the Elders,
                            drew back to the door. He then mounted some steps and taking advantage of the position, he
                            leveled several strokes, with a hickory staff, at his son's head, with such violence that
                            his skull was laid bare nearly three inches in length. The next moment the cane was thrown
                            upon the fire. The mob continued clamorous and abusive and seemed determined, by false
                            accusations and hard speeches, to destroy, if possible, the testimony of the<pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> gospel. Mother Ann was taken into a carriage, unperceived by the mob, and
                            returned to the home of Samuel Fitch. Soon after this the Elders walked out and passed on
                            their way, singing and shouting as though they were in a place of the utmost security. One
                            of the men who had been the most active in circulating slanderous reports about Father
                            William Lee, came up and openly vented these lying accusations to his face. Father William
                            paid no attention to him, but continued in the company of the Believers. The man then
                            threatened to beat Father William if he was not awray from the place in fifteen mioutes. No
                            attention, however, was paid to him, and the poor miserable creature soon sneaked from
                            sight. The same evening the mob gathered at the house of Samuel Fitch and were very
                            boisterous. The brethren reproved them for their ungodly conduct, but it was not accepted.
                            Some of the Believers were handled roughly and some of them knocked dowu. John Deming sr.
                            received a severe stroke on the head which caused the blood to flow profusely. This
                            persecution brought much tribulation upon the Elders, and Mother Ann soon after remarked, "
                            I see a white hand stretched out toward me, which is a sign, and a promise of my
                            protection." As this wicked company had influenced the civil authority a warrant was issued
                            to apprehend Mother Aun and the Elders, with others of the Brethren. The warrant was by
                            Samuel Brown and delivered to Philip Cook, who was a constable. It was served upon Mother
                            Ann, Father William Lee, Elder James Whittaker, Elizur Goodrich, Samuel and Dyer Fitch.
                            After these were taken the mob was dispersed. Receiving their word that they would appear
                            the next day, the Believers were permitted to remain at the house.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="True theology" TEIform="index"/>TRUE THEOLOGY.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Eads, Harvey L."

                            understanding. Job xxxii., 8. The subject I have chosen today, is one that I had no desire
                            either to speak or write upon, but having been invited to the task and coming to see the
                            necessity of it, I feel it to be my duty to comply, trusting I may have spirit guidance in
                            the same. Although there can be but one true theology, yet the term is of more varied
                            application than any word in the English language. It is derived from Theos�God and
                            Logos�Discourse. So that any discourse on man's relation and duty to God is termed Theology.
                            All seem to differ more in what they consider to be their duty to God than they do in their
                            relation to Him. On this there should be no difference as only one relation to Him is
                            possible and that is the spiritual. The subject is of such importance and magnitude that I
                            approach it reluctantly�a subject on which few can agree, the question arises how shall the
                            true be demonstrated? Today I will confine myself mostly to man's relation to God. He can
                            have no material connection to Him because He is Spirit; and matter and spirit are
                            contradictory substances and are therefore not tactual; on this all Philosophers agree. The
                            same is true in regard to intellect. God is not an intellectual Being, but "Omnipresent
                            Spirit filling im-<pb n="27" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> mensity," with whom intellectual connection is
                            impossible. I see the danger of getting into water so deep that my line cannot take the
                            sounding, but as far as I go I will strive to be clear. To do this I will say, that
                            intellect pertains only to creatures that are under necessity. God is not under necessity
                            and is therefore not intellectual, hence we have no need of intellectual culture to make
                            connection with Him. If God were an intellectual Being it would then logically follow that
                            the most intellectual persons wculd be the most like Him and the nearest to Him, which we
                            all know is not the case : but God being Spirit, it follows that the most spiritual minded
                            are nearest to Him. l&gt; To be spiritually minded is life and peace." Rom. viii., 6. It
                            cannot be well disputed that the intellect of the whole world, whiHi is not in subordination
                            to the God-directed spirit in man, leads away from God so that every nation of the earth is
                            elated by its intellectual greatness and seems to forget God. Man was but little more than
                            an intellectual animal, until "God breathed into him the breath of life and maa became a
                            living soul." God by his inspiration enlightened the spirit within him which was dead to his
                            relation and duty to his Creator. The difference between man and the animal world is this :
                            The former has a spirit within him which God directs, but is made free to obey or disobey at
                            pleasure, but is held responsible for every act of life. The latter is animointellectual.
                            God operating on the intellect is what we call instinct. Pope says : "Place reason over
                            instinct as best you can, In this 'tis God directs, in that 'tis man." If Pope is right, he
                            confirms the position I have taken : man directing his intellect, which is not in his heart,
                            but is in his brain. God being Spirit every relation to Him mint be spiritual. But on this
                            subject it seems that Philosophers and Lexicographers do not harmonize, and when Doctors
                            disagree who shall decide ? Philosophers say matter cannot think. Brain is matter therefore
                            brain cannot think, while nine tenths of the human race thiak differently and say the best
                            formed head and best brain is the ablest thinker. This is pretty strong against Philosophy ;
                            still Philosophers may be right. Lexicographers seem to be still more confused on the
                            subject. They tell us that intellect is a faculty of the soul and is seated in the brain,
                            and again they tell us that intellect is a part of the human soul ; if distinct it is made
                            an entity, instead of faculty, and that the soul is the immaterial spirit inhabiting the
                            human body ; and then again that intellect is a power to perceive material things in their
                            natural relation,�thus they make confusion of the whole matter. There can be little doubt
                            but what the immaterial spirit inhabits the whole body, the head having its portion ; it
                            would then seem, that the safest ground to take would be between the two extremes and say
                            that the soul existing in the head vitalizes the molecules of the brain thus enabling them
                            to think, compare and reason, when, without this vitalization, they would be dormant. This
                            would meet the world's ideal and reconcile all differences. But this I give for what it is
                            worth without affirming or denying as either is too<pb n="28" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> deep for my line and
                            beyond my power to prove. But wherever the truth may lie, it should be in subjection to the
                            spirit, which God directs from his house in the human heart, and which if obeyed no mistakes
                            will follow. Witness the Savior ; He walked the earth as a Being devoid of intellect� was
                            moved in all he said or did by' the spirit of the Father. He testified that he spake not of
                            himself but what was given him of God, and thus "�spake as no man ever spake." His Sermon on
                            the Mount has never been equaled by all the world's cultured intellect. lie never made a
                            mistake in word or dee 1 ; and where was there ever an intellect of which the same could be
                            said? None�not one, and yet presumptive intellect pretends to find flaws in his teaching !
                            He went so far as to say : I thank Thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast
                            hid these things from the wise and prudent (the great cultured intellects) mid hast revealed
                            them unto babes ; even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. Matt, xi., 25, 26. To
                            which all his true followers can say amen. I feel safe in saying, all the mistakes and
                            blunders of the world come of the intellect, not of the spirit within man, that God hath
                            enlightened by his inspiration as was Christ. As I have before said�Animals are
                            intellectual: How would it do to agree with Lexicographers and say it was a part of the
                            animal's .soul ? It would be as true for the horse as for the man. Let me repeat ; the
                            difference between the man and horse is this: God operates directly on the intellect of the
                            horse, while He has created in man, by a spirit emanation from Himself, a personified spirit
                            on whom is placed all intellectual responsibility, and who is left free to obey or disobey,
                            having God's blessing in obedience, aud his displeasure in disobedience ; being held to a
                            strict accountability to his Heavenly Father, where punishment follows every violation of
                            God's deman 1 upon him, being free as God is free, separate and distinct from the material
                            intellect which it is his duty to govern. This seems to me to be clear. Still Intellect
                            seems to sit Queen of the world, with its g &gt;ld poured down at her feet. It is so
                            with professor and profane ; but light is increasing which I will show by quoting a few
                            words from a late London preacher who said : "No alembics or retort can reveal the soul�
                            neither microscope nor telescope can bring to view the mysteries of spiritual existence, and
                            it is equally true that no man can come to the knowledge of the Father [by the intellect,]
                            but by Him who is the way, t!ie truth aud the life, by seeing, hearing aud obeying Him."
                            Here is the crown and consummation of Christian evolution : "As He lived, so shall we also
                            live." This we may say is light out of darkness. Here it may be asked : Have we no need of
                            intellectual culture? most surely we have; while we have material bodies and
                            manipulations,�can't have too much, if kept in its place. Its business is to direct in the
                            manipulation of material things only and is not needed in spiritual things. It is the
                            province of the Spirit to say ivhat shall be done, and the province of the intellect to say
                            how it shall be done ; hence intellect should never interfere with or try to change
                            spiritual gifts. The spirit says Love your enemy. The<pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> intellect says
                            hate him The spirit says if a man smite you on one cheek, turn to him the other. The
                            intellect says defend yourself and smite him on the other cheek. The spirit says if a man
                            take your cont, give him your cloak also. Intellect says jail him, put him in the
                            penitentiary, &amp;c. Intellect only wants one more thing than a pig, and that is fame,
                            to be the greatest. It has no conscience. Man cannot feel compunction in his head any more
                            than in his heels ; but, turning back to the heart for God's approval, he finds it not. Hell
                            is the consequeuce, until the soul is relieved by confession ;md repentance. God is in the
                            heart. If we look to the brain we find Him not, but turn and look within the heai't, there
                            we find Him, and feel our nearness and relation to Him just in the proportion we have obeyed
                            the spirit's dictation. Were this heeded by all the human race, there would be no mistakes
                            or blunders ; all would love their neighbor as themselves, and this would be a God-ruled
                            world ; but alas ! the reverse is our condition, for selfish intellect rules all the Nations
                            of the earth and their condition is en: ugh to make all the angels in heaven weep. It is now
                            intellect trying to correct intellect, even by dynamite bomb aud bullet, fire and sword,
                            blood and slaughter, cliques and numbers, but all in vain. It is like Satan trying to
                            correct Satan ; but full reformation will never come until Christ's Spirit rules, and the
                            world is conquered by Love. Thus I think the first part of true theology- �man's relation to
                            God, is made clear. The second part, his duty, will follow in another discourse, in which I
                            hope still more fully to prove the truth of the text, that "there is a spirit in man and the
                            inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." Amen.

                            raid John. Why? because they were apostles of Jesus, pioneers, founders of the primitive
                            Church ; tli3 purest sect we read of, and the most perfect pattern of Christian love. They
                            planted the gospel and stood firm against all opposition. They endured to the end, and
                            obtained a crown of life. Yet we do not worship them. We reverence their virtues, and
                            emulate their pure, peaceful lives. We bless and extol the spirit of Christ that inspired
                            them. So in like manner we adore the spirit of wisdom, purity and love, which inspired Ann
                            Lee, and her followers ; by which they overcame sin and selfishness, broke the shackles of
                            superstition, and lived in brotherly and sisterly love, in spite of persecution. We do not
                            worship Ann Lee. She never would allow any one even to bow to her. She directed all, to
                            kneel to God. IShe was but a servant. We do not worship a woman, but we do worship the
                            Mother Spirit. All creation has implanted in it the Mother principle, as well as that of the
                            Father. That intelligent power .which sent forth man and woman, was Mother as well as
                            Father. That vast angel realm where myriads of happy spirits dwell is made joyful through
                            the Mother influence. The spirit of redeeming Love is manifested as purely and divinely
                            through woman as through any other medium. We believe in rendering to woman her proper
                            rights, in her own sphere. Thus we reverence Ann Le�;, by yielding obedience to the spirit
                            of truth through her, by which she and her associates planted a home of love. She taught,
                            where purity aud equality reigned, there is home ; heaven on earth begun. We make our home
                            and heaven, by uniting hearts aud hands, to make each other happy. Innocence and love are
                            the gems that deck the home of the pure in heart. In this, there can be no deception, while
                            we are following the example of Jesus and the apostles. Watervliet, N.

                            escape them. The closer human beings come in contact and relation, the more apparent are
                            their imperfections and peculiarities, and the greater the abrasion of feeling. A community
                            of individuals is like a machine, no matter how nicely adjusted its parts may be, there will
                            be friction, unless it is lubricated by the oil of love, charity and forgiveness. '�To
                            endure and to pardon is the wisdom of life," so said the great prophet of Islam. Inharmony
                            and variance is often the result of selfishness ; an intense self-asserting spirit tramples
                            upon the rights of* others to the seclusion of peace, setting up a little feudal kingdom of
                            its own, claiming all a~ its retainers, and making war upon all who will not acquiesce. "
                            All civilization and every religion; all morality, and every kind of society imply some
                            restraint and subordination," and those who seek to evade salutary discipline, work against
                            their own interests and the good of others. We may prate of individuality and freedom ; but
                            where is the independent man or woman ? Surely they are not the heads of families; for who
                            makes greater sacrifice than the true parent. They are not the leaders of organizations or
                            societies ; for are not the words of Jesus actualized. "He that would be greatest among you
                            let him be the servant of all." He or she that renders noblest service to mankind, merges
                            his or her individuality in that of others ; through condescension, union and harmony are
                            attainable. But, pleads one�I do not want to be like anybody else, I prefer to be myself. If
                            to be one's self is to exhibit those distinctive characteristics that mark the animal
                            creation, then are they unfit for the higher relations, and harmonial associations of the
                            superior life. In Christ all are equal; no distinction recognized save goodness. In Him
                            souls find a centre of life, love and fellowship, which fills all hearts that have received
                            the unction of his divine spirit, with a satisfaction inconceivably deeper, sweeter and more
                            lasting, than is found in the isolated, fractional relationship which orgauizes the ordinary
                            family and makes selfish society. It is love, true genuine love, (not lust) that can satisfy
                            human hearts; without this they perish for sustenance, and "who can show greater love than
                            he who is willing to lay down his life for his brethren." Jesus gave to the world and
                            illustrated in his life, the grandest ideal and conception of human society the world has
                            ever dreamed of. A social and religious fabric to be reared on the eternal principles he
                            enunciated ; of which his immediate followers only had a blessed foretaste in the
                            Pentecostal Christian Church, in whose decline we see aptly illustrated the tendencies of
                            human nature to drift with surrounding circumstances, and gradually lower the high standard
                            raised by those whose souls were inspired by lofty principles and whose lives were examples
                            of heroic sacrifice. If we consult our own interests, desires and wishes in regard to what
                            constitutes our comfort and happiness, then<pb n="32" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> are we unworthy the name of
                            the great Master who lived and died to implant in humanity the grand law of universal love,
                            and self-abnegation. "Not my will but Thine be done" was his contiuual prayer. How strong
                            and encouraging his exhortations. "Be of good cheer for I have overcome the world." "Ye are
                            not of the world for I have chosen you out of the world." "Be ye perfect even as your Father
                            which is in heaven is perfect." "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye
                            have love one for another." Let us inculcate in our lives the beautiful soul inspiring
                            lessons of the divine teacher, and in his kingdom come on earth, be loving and simple
                            children ; so virtuous, noble and true in all the duties and relations of life, that we

                            and, would be Godlike, of whom the Psalmist says, "Thou lovest righteousness, and hateth
                            wickedness! " Criticism, in the spirit of speculative strife, is unkind,�unbrotherly, and
                            productive of no good. But, performed in love, both to Author and reader, with a purpose to
                            avoid misleading the simple, and making more clear to the understanding of the experienced,
                            it must be acceptable to the spirit of sincere friendship to man, and love to God, and man,
                            as a true philanthropist. We will now leave our Author, in the Parlor, with the Psalmist,
                            while we go ont into the field of investigation ; to criticise what is written and seek out
                            truth, because, truth alone can make us free ! In the article "FightingNegations" we find so
                            much gold, it is painful to feel obliged to criticise some of the sentiments therein. Yet,
                            fearing, without a better digest of the same, honest souls might be led in a wrong path, by
                            sophistry, we proceed. The article, as it now stands, to us, appears conglomerate, and, to
                            speak Geologically, like a pudding-stone, which needs the mental geologist to analyze, and
                            refer each idea to its appropriate shelf, or position, preserving the gold in its pure
                            state, and relegating the quartz and pebbles to their proper den. To properly understand a
                            sentence, we need a clear idea of the meaning of words. Let us, then inquire the meaning of
                            " Negations." It is a declaration that something is not, does not exist. In other words "
                            The absence of that which does not belong to the thing we are speaking of."<pb n="33" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> 1st. Now what is our Author speaking of? Ans. Love, and interest for virtue ;
                            mercy, purity, goodness, righteousness. 2nd. What is it that does not belong to these
                            things? He tells us, '�'�Appalling cruelty, disgusting sensuality, sinful habits, courses,
                            evil propensities, violated laws." The absence of these qualities, would be negations of
                            evil. Thus, if there were no such qualities, or habits of evil, there could be nothing to
                            fight! What does experience and observation teach us? Ans. that those properties, qualities,
                            and habits exist as powerfully acting agents, with a vengeance ! Is there not, therefore a
                            something left to " fight" and be " hated?" Look at the destructive and desolating forces of
                            evil that destroyed kingdoms and empires ! Blotted from the face of the earth, billions of
                            human beings by the most barbarous, devilish, and inhuman means of cruelty that human
                            ingenuity could invent; and destroyed thousands upon thousands of large and beautiful
                            cities, as Thebes, with its hundred gates, and multitudes of polished marble temples; a city
                            25 miles in circuit, with streets eight miles long. The Satanic Crusade Wars, that made
                            holocausts of millions of human beings by burning them alive. Look at the devilish
                            martyrdoms, that wrenched the life from millions by every means of torture that a barbaric
                            and hellish imagination could invent, rack, gibbet, thumbscrews, hanging by one foot, head
                            downward, flaying alive, suspending on stakes, &amp;c. These, were, indeed, something
                            besides "negations" they were active forces with a witness. These selfish fiendish
                            influences of robbing the poor of their earnings, depriving them of the land, forcing them
                            to beggary and starvation, to sell their innocence for bread, still exist, threatening the
                            destruction of kingdoms and empires, as of yore. All this arises from the selfishness, the
                            lust for power and dominion, and the gratification of sinful appetites and passions. Call
                            these "negations?" As well call the ei,rth a soap bubble ! Who, in any use of reason, can
                            imagine these evils, "negations?" And, what living soul, sensing the terrible havoc of human
                            happiness produced by these evils can feel that they are not to be hated, and, in reference
                            to them " a godly man�a Christian, is under no necessity to hate anything!" Perish the
                            thought. Jesus Christ, and his true followers hated these propensities in themselves so
                            forcibly that they put their carnal lives to death. Is not that hating with a vengeance?
                            Thus did Mother Ann Lee and thus do all the Saints of the Church of Christ's Second
                            Appearing. Yet, truly it is a great grace to attain that government of the soul, by the
                            Christ spirit that we can hate sins, and not hate souls! But, we opine, that to every
                            enlightened aud living soul it would seem to be a very great "wonder, to eventually come to
                            find that a godly man, a Christian, is under no necessity to hate anything!" Not much less
                            wonder would it be indeed, that the Heavens should go up in smoke ! Our beloved Author of
                            "Fighting Negations" evidently mistakes the state militant of soul, and of the Christian
                            Church, for the state triumphant! But, until the Christian Pilgrim, and every soul of
                            humanity has entirely subdued every evil propensity, every quality op-<pb n="34" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>
                            posed to goodness, human intelligences striving for goodness must be militant; must hate
                            evil in every form, as an active force against good, not treat it as a mere creature of the
                            imagination, a "negation !" When complete redemption of the entire race of man is attained,
                            then, hatred may cease ! But never will the hatred of a heaven born soul cease against all
                            the wicked propensities that deluge the world with sin, while one sin remains in the human
                            family; it would be impossible. To be a Christian, a person must love as Christ loved, ones
                            enemies' souls as really as ones friends, and hate as Christ hated ; and he taught "No man
                            can serve two masters" (at one and same time,) "for either he will hate the one and love the
                            other ; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other." Matt, vi., 24. And again "If
                            any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers
                            and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" cannot be a Christian. In
                            the face of this doctrine, how is it, our brother Author "that we eventually can come to
                            find, that a godly man�a Christian, is under no necessity to hate anything?" Where may we
                            find the authority to impugn the teachings of Christ? And, if we do, what right have we to
                            assume the name of Christian? But, what Christ here taught to hate, was not the souls, as
                            persons, of any of these relations ; but the carnal life, that constituted them sinful
                            beings, and, whose life element was in a sinful nature. To hate souls, the brother, sister,
                            parent, neighbor, is cruel. St. John says, "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer ; and
                            ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding iu him." 1 John iii., 15. St. Jude helps
                            the good sentiments of our Author's article, in that he says, "And, of some have compassion,
                            making a difference. And others, save with fear" (as well as love,) "pulling them out of the
                            fire." (But) "Hating even the garment spotted by the flesh." Jude 23. The angel of the
                            Church of Pergamos told the Church he " had a few things against thee, because thou hast
                            there those, that hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block
                            before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols "negations" and, to
                            commit fornication !"(no negation here.) "So hast thou also, them that hold the doctrine of
                            the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate." Rev. ii., 14, 15. Here, the angel finds something to
                            be hated besides "negations !" Let us not, then, my Brethren, while we would be traveling
                            for the Kingdom of God, be deceived by sophistry, mixing good and evil qualities of doctrine
                            ; nor lay down, or sheath our Gospel swords of hatred to sin while even one soul of humanity
                            is unredeemed to God. At that Advent we may love, and love ONLY ! Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            feeling manner, to be admitted into the North Family of Shakers. She has raised a family of
                            children, who are married and have families of their own ; and, being in good circumstances,
                            they are willing to support their aged mother, but do not wish "to be bothered with her" in
                            their aristocratic households. Answer. Do you know what spirit you are of and what it is you
                            are asking for ? An entrance into a family of sixty men and women who are self-supporting ;
                            have worked for and bought the land they own ; have built houses, and inhabit them ; planted
                            orchards and vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. A people who cultivate their own lands;
                            make and mend their own clothing; cook their own food, and wash the dishes ; do their own
                            house work, without employing a single servant. These men and women, having the faith of
                            Jesus and Ann, have cut themselves off from the self-seeking, self-pleasing, aud ruling
                            elements of the generative order upon which the world of mankind rests and by which it is
                            perpetuated. '' The ends of the world ha^e come upon them." They sowed to the spirit, and
                            have reaped life everlasting�a home ! They enjoy the fruit of their own labors; have
                            received according to their works. And is it not the same with yourself? In youth, you gave
                            yourself to the world, and now the world has forsaken you. Your own children cast you off.
                            They have the same right to bear children, the same duty to keep the world<pb n="36" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> from running out, that actuated yourself. Anon! the measure they mete will be
                            meted to them again, by their own children, who will leave them to go to a poor-house or to
                            an " Institution for the care of aged gentlemen and ladies" whose children cleave to their
                            own dear husbands and wives, and to their own offspring. Those who spend the morning and
                            noon of life in '"marrying and giving in marriage" must needs finish the day in the same
                            field of nature. "The king of terrors" will consign them to a world in which their only hope
                            is in a physical resurrection. If we granted your request, housed, clothed, fed and cared
                            for you, and your children should pay us for the same, should we not be the servants and you
                            the masters and mistresses�the gentlemen and ladies? Thus, instead of a Shaker Society being
                            the head, it would become the tail�a rendezvous for the debris of the generative order. And
                            who would support the order? "He that is not for, is against; and he who gathereth not with,
                            scattereth abroad." Any one receiving our faith, can unite as with any other religious
                            order, and continue to care for themselves externally, as they do. We do not furnish a home
                            for all who may become members. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            Webster's definition. Now, it is mainly used to coverup materialistic outcomes. This being
                            the case, it may be briefly noticed. Evolution is the act of "unfolding." Plants and animals
                            under culture undergo great changes, and within certain limits, adapt themselves to human
                            requirements, and to physical environments. For instance, there is the fleet Arabian horse,
                            and the heavy slow Clydesdale. The latter, can plow day by day with the steady pull of the
                            ox, and needs a heavy ration. The former, subsists on the scant herbage of the desert, and
                            carries its owner from place to place swiftly. Within these extremes, there are many
                            variations, yet, there is no specific change�no evolution of species. The humming-bird and
                            the eagle, and intermediate forms, have throughout the ages maintained their
                            distinctiveness. The public are not informed of the introduction of a single new species ;
                            some have, however, become extinct, and no doubt, others will follow. In the Plant world,
                            the Vitis Vinifera, though under culture for thousands of years, is the Vinifera still. Its
                            richest varieties are today, specifically the Syrian grape the spies carried into the camp
                            of Israel. Hence, modification is not a specific change. The creation, or the unfoldment, of
                            a new species from an existing one, is an impossibility ; except, said species are dual, in
                            the order of its creation. If any entity is dual, has a specifically distinct creation
                            within a creation, the external, the manifest creation, cannot unfold any thing superior to
                            itself. Nevertheless, it may serve as envelope, and in all respects be subservient to the
                            inner, or latent creation. In the fitness of things, this will be so. Materialistic
                            Evolutionists, seem to convey the impression, that if they could get far enough back into
                            the past, it might be shown, that inferior entities,<pb n="37" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> can evolute higher
                            ones, that something, can come from nothing. Judging from what is known of existing
                            organisms, the conclusion is, that the microscopic, infinitesimal, primordial germs of all
                            organisms were as specifically distinct, then, as they now are. That the primordial germs of
                            the apple, the pear, the cherry and the cocoanut, could not evolve the strawberry, nor it,
                            the cocoanut. Even organisms of the same genus hold steadfastly to their own distinctive
                            characteristics. Hybrids are mougreb. The unfolding to a limited extent of living organisms,
                            indicates, that if man is the crowning work of creation, he must be capable of manifesting
                            the highest form of evolution ; and if it can be established that he is dual in his
                            emotional forces, then a new species of man may be evolved, and yet belong to the genus
                            homo. Let us look in this direction for a few moments. Emotions, are the forces of animated
                            beings. First, man has an emotional life, represented by the propensities. Second, he. has
                            also an emotional life, represented by manifestations of Justice, Mercy, and Benevolence;
                            and by aspirations after, and by a growth into these divine attributes. It is worthy of
                            note, that the higher attributes, have opposite results, to those of the action of the
                            propensities. Paul said of them; " they are contrary, the one to the other." Showing, that
                            they are specifically distinct. The characteristics of the divine attributes in humanity,
                            are in the direction " of the love of others, at the expense of self." In contradistinction
                            to the prevailing proclivities of our lower self-hoods. The evolution of the divine man,
                            would illustrate the possibility of being " born again ;" and of, " Behold I create all
                            things anew ;" and of a Millennial period. Again it would illustrate the great fact that
                            individualized living organisms, are essentially spiritual creations. Perhaps it would also
                            illustrate a certain remarkable statement, " that every plan% before it was in the
                            earth�before it was manifested ; was created ;" and so of all organisms. Certainly it would
                            be desirable, that the Evolutionists would unfold in themselves the higher attributes
                            inhering in humanity, to the full exclusion of their lower self-hoods. Society today needs
                            the services of a few millions of divine men and women, who will care for others more than
                            for self. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                difficulty in getting along until we landed at Clyde on Saturday morning, at 3. 30. Here
                                we unloaded and stored our goods in De Zengo store, (on the wharf) took breakfast at a
                                tavern, where we found John Lockwood with his carriage and horses, and started on for
                                this place, where we arrived at 1 o'clock P. M. in better health than we could have
                                reasonably expected, after such a fatiguing journey � We were made comfortable in the
                                Green Bay, the name of the canal boat. The captain, Ambrose Hill, and the hands would
                                oblige the Shakers, although the boat was crowded with passengers ot different classes
                                of people. All seemed to respect us and to regret our departure. They did not use vulgar
                                nor profane language in our presence. We sensibly felt that we were blessed and
                                protected by the prayers of our faithful and lov-<pb n="38" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> ing Brethren and
                                Sisters, whom we never, never shall forget. And, O! that we may ever be so faithful as
                                to keep our union with them. But to return to our journal. We four.d an empty house on
                                the east point, which the Brethren had reserved for us. The other two houses, being full
                                of young Believers with their children. The young Believers, in general, appear zealous
                                and sincere and seem to be thankful that we are here to help them. It is evident that
                                Brs. Proctor Sampson and William Eeed have been faithful laborers in things spiritual
                                and temporal and have acted wisely. They with other Brethren have performed a great deal
                                of work on the land, fencing, clearing, plowing, sowing and planting. And all, both
                                Brethren and Sisters, are zealous striving to get something to subsist upon ourselves,
                                and to feed the visitors that we have from different places. There are already three
                                calls for the Brethren to come and preach; one at Galen, one at Phelps and one at
                                Brutus. We expect that Br. Calvin Greene and three others will go to Brutus next week,
                                about forty miles distant, as there are some there who are very desirous to hear the
                                gospel preached. The country, here, is new and thinly inhabited. We have very bad roads,
                                nearly as poor as they were in Savoy. After our goods were landed at Clyde, we had to
                                store a part of them on a boat and send them to Lyons, on account of bad roads. It was
                                considered dangerous to bring them the way we came. This made it cost some more than it
                                otherwise would, but we do not feel discouraged, for as long as we try to do the best we
                                can, we do not believe our good friends will forsake us. As for provisions, it looks
                                rather dark, sometimes, unless our cruise of oil and our measure of meal hold out beyond
                                our expectations. Now you will doubtless say, " O ye of little faith, " looking on the
                                dark side of things. So we will turn over the story and tell the best side. There are a
                                plenty of good fish in the bay, not more than one half a mile from our home, and Brs.
                                John Lockwood and Thaddeus Cramer went last evening and helped the fishermen draw the
                                seine and thereby obtained one hundred pounds of good fish. The bay abounds with fish,
                                but those that are fit for salting cannot be obtained without a seine lays enough to
                                drag in deep water; so that we are afraid that Sister Asenath Clark will not get any
                                till next fall. We will now give a short description of the place here. The house we
                                live in is 36x24 ft. It has four dwelling rooms, two on each story, ten ft. wide and
                                fifteen ft long, with fire places in each. The house was lathed and plastered. Each room
                                has two windows as large as the windows in the dwelling at the North Family, at New
                                Lebanon. The front room 24x21 ft. was a store. We took down the shelves and counter and
                                made it ready for a meeting room. We met in it and enjoyed the blessings of God. We sung
                                the "Promised Blessing, " and thought it must be that the good spirits were present with
                                us as Br. Calvin spoke of Father Joseph Meacham's words, "Ye will yet be scattered
                                abroad in the earth. " Br. Jeremiah Tallcott spoke of the blessings of God that were for
                                us, which we all measurably felt. We are situated on rising ground, about forty rods
                                from the Bay, and some one hundred feet higher than the water. When we look to the
                                north, we can see nothing but water except once in a while a schooner comes in sight.
                                Our house is about one and one half mile from the west house and one and one half mile
                                from the mill. There is but one run of stone repaired at the mill, which has plenty to
                                grind all the time when there is water. There are 140 acres of cleared land on this
                                place. Twelve acres were sowed to wheat last fall, which looked well before the dry
                                weather. Upland of twenty acres planted to corn, potatoes and broom corn. No flax. We
                                regret that we have no more time to write, for if we do not close soon, as broken as it
                                is, we shall miss the chance of sending to the Post Office. We must now close by sending
                                our unfeigned and best love to our never failing friends at New Lebanon and Watervliet,
                                and to the Brethren and Sisters as far as you may feel to give it, humbly requesting
                                that you would pray for the poor children at Port Bay.

                            will your Heavenly Father forgive your trespasses." Then how important it becomes that we
                            understand the full import of the expression, "I forgive you." Do we forgive when by word or
                            thought we can refer to past grievances? Nay. The bitterness still remains to poison the
                            life, and may at any time break out in cruel animosity. It is by prayer and humiliation of
                            soul that we are enabled to take the offender by the hand and say, "My brother�my sister, I
                            forgive you, even as I hope to be forgiven of my God. Though you may have deeply wronged me,
                            may have wounded my very soul, yet it shall henceforth be as though it had never occurred. I
                            will never more refer to it by way of trial in word or thought." It may be hard to attain
                            this feeling even toward one who a#ks to be forgiven ; then how much harder toward one who
                            does not relent but still pursues the wroiifi course. Yet this is the Christian standard to
                            which we aspire ; else we cannot rightfully claim to be the true followers of Christ the
                            Pattern, who in the midst of keenestjsuffering could, in accents of love and tender pity,
                            pray for his persecutors, "Father, forgive them," and add as by way of excuse, "they know
                            not what they do." This is the true spirit we are to strive for and daily cultivate in our
                            souls. This is the spirit and temper of heaven ; without it we can never find perfect or
                            permanent peace and rest. With it how pleasantly the days come and go ; while the angels
                            smile and the very heavens bend with blessing. Would that the whole earth and all its
                            inhabitants were filled and clothed with this beautiful spirit of forgiveness. Canterbury,

                                fruits of Righteousness." God's gifts, so much to be desired, and for which we should so
                                earnestly pray, are as boundless as the sea. Manifestations of his divine goodness are
                                all around us, and it only requires our spirits to move in harmony with his spirit, that
                                we may share, to a fulness, of this heavenly blessing. If our eyes are closed wo may not
                                see the beautiful treasures that are over and around us, and if our ears are dull of
                                hearing, we may not even recognize the voices of the angels that are passing above us.
                                And yet we need, in its fullest sense, these ministrations which shall lift us from
                                worldly, sensual relations into those which are spiritual and heavenly. If the principle
                                of doing right is engrafted into the heart, and an anxious care exercised that it may
                                become permanently fixed, under the divine guidance of the good angels, then we may be
                                quite sure that the peaceable fruits of righteousness will be manifested; accompanied as
                                they may be with the divine love which culminates, so surely, in the beauty of holiness.
                                Under this loving ministration we can work for failing humanity, as we believe God works
                                for us. Work for and with mankind, in peace and good will, and work with them to build
                                upon a foundation that we need have no fear of failure. Ju his fatherly kindness, "God
                                maketh the sun to shine upon the evil and the good." The rain falls on the fields and
                                meadows of the unjust, with the same impartiality as it does on those who denominate
                                themselves just, or the heirs of God. No class becomes a specialty with inherited or
                                acquired rights to monopolize the distribution of these great blessings. All these
                                subtle discriminations that have been made in favor of some special geographical
                                section, and in the invests of a self-constituted organization, must make their claims
                                clear to others, or a doubt will becloud the mind. That there may have been many
                                wonderful works of God, in the heavens and on the earth, and that they came for the
                                advancement of the mind of man, and the establishing of his claim, as the highest and
                                best of the creation of God, no one for a moment, could admit of a doubt. The whole
                                creation of God, is a miracle of God. But to rest upcn these wonders and declarations as
                                being of any direct benefit in the work of spiritual regeneration, would be as idle as
                                to wish for Noah's ark as a model vessel for the present century. Divine teachers have
                                told us that<pb n="41" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> 'l light has come into the world," and its presence,
                                we know, quite well, is calculated to chase away all darkness. Dark sayings, legends,
                                dreams, fables and every thing that will not bear the crucial test or a thorough
                                investigation by the light which God has shed upon man. That which has proved
                                satis/actory in the past, and worthy as a foundation upon which to build a religious
                                order, falls by the way, and is soon hid from sirht, while that which is embodied in
                                light and harmonizes with the best spiritual qualities of the mind, arises to lead man
                                on to God. " To be spiritually minded is life and peace." The primitive Christians had
                                learned this fact and anxiously and earnestly urged the church to live after the same
                                manner. Paul had accepted the same fact. The disciples had learned it, for Jesus had
                                taught it as the word of God. The multitude may pass carelessly along, in the broad way,
                                reaping a reward corresponding to their lives; that " to be carnally minded is death."
                                That they do not enjoy the light, is evident, and that they prefer the broad way is
                                quite as evident from the manner in which they rush to obtain the pleasures of this
                                earth. If the light which has come into this world can so influence our hearts, that we
                                may be able to repent, and make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight, then
                                we may be able to manifest to others of less faith, that the peaceable fruits of
                                righteousness do claim our attention and that peace on earth, good-will to man, is the
                                message which should inspire every Christian heart, as he anticipates the love and peace
                                that is to reign on the earth in the millennial age.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How I cured my cold feet" TEIform="index"/>How I Cured My Cold Feet

                                        the year round, and more particularly during the winter months, a source of
                                        constant discomfort and depression. Many women and children never know the
                                        satisfaction of being warm. All this is contrary to what was in. tended by
                                        nature. A good circulation of the blood t^nds to produce individual happiness
                                        and comfort. No one need suffer from cold feet, which are symptomatic of
                                        mal-distribution of the blood. It is part of the duty of the healthy nervous
                                        system to regulate the balance of the circulation and, under the vicissitudes of
                                        err" ery-day life, to ensure to every part a sufficient suppiy of blood.
                                        Whenever there is liability to derangement of the circulation, producing local
                                        congestion or depletion, it is evident the nervous tone is lowered. Such a state
                                        opens the way for a variety of diseases. Sedentary occupation, eating
                                        indigestible food, congested liver, disordered digestion, tight lacing or tight
                                        boots are all apt to cause cold feet, unless the constitutional powers are very
                                        strong. The nervous tone will be raised, and so equalize the circulation, by
                                        bracing treatment, as the morning tepid or cold bath, and short sitz each day at
                                        a corresponding temperature. The weak digestion will be improved by foments, and
                                        congestion will also be removed by their use and an occasional hot-air bath.
                                        Treatment directed specifically to the feet, will be mainly cold mustard
                                        foot-bath for five minutes; if the feet are cold to begin with, warm mustard
                                        foot-bath 102 degrees for the same time, followed at once by cold foot-bath,
                                        each finished by vigorous friction. Should the feet be persistently cold at
                                        bedtime, a pair of cotton stockings well wrung out of water, covered with a pair

                                        health than most people generally imagine. Crooked bodily positions, maintained
                                        for any length of time, are always injurious, whether in the sitting, standing
                                        or lying posture, whether sleeping or waking. To sit with the body leaning
                                        forward on the stomach, or to one side,with the heels elevated on a level with
                                        the hands, is not only in bad taste, but exceedingly detrimental to health. It
                                        cramps the stomach, presses the vital organs, interrupts the free motions of the
                                        chest, and enfeebles the functions of the abdominal and thoracic organs, and, in
                                        fact, unbalances the whole muscular system. Many children become slightly
                                        humpbacked or severely round shouldered by sleeping with the head raised on a
                                        high pillow. When any person finds it easier to sit or stand or walk or sleep in
                                        a crooked position than a straight one, such person may be sure his muscular
                                        system is badly deranged, and the more careful he is to preserve a straight or
                                        upright position, and get back again, the better.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="People's Health Journal" TEIform="index"/></bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How long to sleep" TEIform="index"/>How Long to Sleep

                                        muscle, requires a correspondingly lengthy or deep repose. Sleep is the state in
                                        which the bodily fires are damped down and the machinery has an opportunity for
                                        cooling. The bow is unstrung to recover its elasticity during the recurring
                                        periods of slumber. The great point is to secure what Bichat characterized as
                                        general sleep. The whole body should be rested, so far as any avoidable demands
                                        on its energy is concerned. The Irishman who explained that a short sleep did
                                        for him because when he slept he "paid attention to 't,'� uttered a truth in his
                                        witticism. If sleep be thorough, then a short spell will do more good than a
                                        much longer period that is incomplete and imperfect. On general principles we
                                        may sleep all we can, unless we are lazy, then sleep less. The active, wide
                                        awake, energetic, go ahead people rarely sleep too long. We cannot tamper with
                                        the striking movement of a clock without injuring it, and we cannot tamper with
                                        orderly recurrence of sleep without impairing the very constitution of things on
                                        which the orderly performance of that function depends.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Herald of Health" TEIform="index"/></bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Drinking too much" TEIform="index"/>DRINKING TOO MUCH

                                        play, you will take a tumbler of water and drink it down as fast as you can and
                                        then rush to resume play, and perhaps repeat the drink. Now the next time you
                                        feel thirsty, try this experiment: Take a goblet of water and slowly sip it;
                                        before it is half gone your thirst will be fully quenched, and you will feel

                                        through eating, the desire to do so would soon leave, and he will require only a
                                        few sips of water, tea or coffee after the meal is finished. This practice, too,

                            Smart from Asphyxia. Caused by the explosion of a kerosine lamp. Death followed from
                            suffocation and injuries by burning. Last Saturday evening, Jan. 7, at 8.45, an unusual
                            light was observed in the room occupied by Br. George, which was in the second story of our
                            large store-house, in which was packed a large stock of chairs. It is evident that he was
                            preparing to retire for the night, as the doors were secured and all his duties closed for
                            the day. It is thought that his lamp must have exploded, and in his effort to extinguish the
                            flames, he was prostrated by the smoke and the fumes of gas. In less than ten minutes after
                            the alarm was given, we had our hose attached to the hydrant and a liberal stream of water
                            was soon playing upon the burning building. This is the blessing of having a good reservoir,
                            well supplied with water. The Brethren of the Second Family were soon on the ground with
                            afire extinguisher, and ElderWm. Anderson armed with this entered the building on his hands
                            and knees and succeeded in putting out the fire which the water did not reach. When Br.
                            George was found, he had fallen to the floor, and life had already departed, as the
                            physician from New Lebanon, who was present, gave his testimony. A coroner's in_ quest was
                            held and all the points of law, in regard to such cases, were fullj' carried out. Br. George
                            was one of the most careful men in the Society. Every department that came under his charge
                            was kept in the best order. This is another of the sad cases that we are obliged to report,
                            and which we might hope would never more be repeated. About $4500 worth of chairs and chair
                            stock of webbing and other goods were in the building. The damage by fire and water was
                            estimated to be $300. which was covered by insurance. This was adjusted satisfactorily by
                            the agent of the London and Globe, Niagara and Home Insurance Co's. We can thank God that we
                            still have a home left to us, as it was a most miraculous event that our buildings were
                            saved. Your Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anderson, William" TEIform="persName"/>Wm.

                                eighty years she spent a life of virtue and immaculate purity among Believers. For forty
                                years she stood with Eldress Sally Sharp, as second in the Ministry of Union Village,
                                which had general charge of the Western Societies during that period. Obedience in the
                                most minute particulars to those who stood before her in care and burden, was ever her
                                watchword, from which in practice, she never swerved in a single instance. She was

                                calculated to have given her any amount of prestige and success in the pursuit of
                                worldly pleasures. But she rejected all such transitory pleasures, and spent the whole
                                of her life in personal purity and practical righteousue.-s. Her tenderness and sympathy
                                for those in distress were unbounded and her charity to all, both aged and young, was
                                proverbial. The Society where she u as originally gathered were obliged to break up

                                pleasures of sin for a season." Heb. xi., 25. "�And I heard a voice from Heaven saying,
                                Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea, saith the Spirit, that
                                they may rest from their labors ; and their works do follow them." Rev. xiv., 13. Rest
                                is not inertia, when spiritually defined, but change and variety of occupation ; and
                                doubtless our dear Mother in Israel has entered upon the seraphic employments of the
                                angelic spheres and into everlasting blessedness.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hampton, O. C." TEIform="persName">O. C.

                                    whom the Bible, if not an unknown, is a grievously neglected book; that there are
                                    many young men and women, and not a few older men and women, among the so-called
                                    "educated classes," who have never read the Bible, and whose knowledge of it is
                                    obtained mainly, if not altogether, from hearsay. They may, if the children of
                                    religious parents, have learned something about it in Sunday school and from
                                    sermons, but that is all; they have not read enough of it to have any clear idea of
                                    its contents, much less to appreciate them at their true value, or even to fully
                                    understand allusions to them. If this rather startling statement is doubted let the
                                    doubter test it by asking two or three biblical questions in the next miscellaneous
                                    company he meets be the members old or young�and see the answers he gets. Unless
                                    more fortunate than some others who have tried the same experi_ ment, he will be�to
                                    put it mildly�astonished. That the Bible is read more than any other book may be
                                    freely admitted; but the point we urge is�and facts will sustain us�that it is not
                                    read as generally as it ought to be, not nearly as much as is commonly supposed; and
                                    that there are hundreds, if not thousands, in every large community, of what are
                                    considered intelligent persons, to whom� for all the personal acquaintance they have
                                    with them by reading�the Old and New Testaments might just as well have remained in
                                    their original Hebrew and Greek. Let us suppose that instead of being known to the
                                    world for thousands of years, it had been� though as old as it is believed to
                                    be�recently discovered; found, as Tischendorf found the manuscript of the famous
                                    Sinaitic Codex in the convent of St. Catherine, on Mt. Sinai, in 1844 and 1859. Let
                                    us suppose that during the process of translation and publication extracts from the
                                    more important portions had been given to the public through the daily press or in
                                    pamphlet. With what eagerness would all Europe and America wait the appearance of
                                    the completed book; and when it appeared, what man or woman, young or old, with mind
                                    above the clods, would not read it, or have it read to them. If the Bible had
                                    nothing to recommend it but reputation�leaving its Divine authorship out of the
                                    question altogether�even then not to read it would be nothing less than a crime
                                    against the intellectual and moral nature. Here is what has been said by one [Eev.
                                    Theodore Parker,] who did not believe in its inspiration, or only in that kind of
                                    inspiration which is given, in various degree, to all great and good men who strive
                                    to lead their fellow-men through darkness up to the light that is in God : This
                                    collection of books has taken such a hold upon the world as no other. The literature
                                    of Greece, which goes up like incense from that land of temples and heroic deeds,
                                    has not half the influence of this book from a nation alike despised in ancient and
                                    modern times. It is read of a Sunday in all the thirty thousand pulpits in our land.
                                    In all the temples of Christendom is its voice lifted up week by week. The sun never
                                    sets upon its gleaming page. It goes equally to the cottage of the plain man and the
                                    palace of the king. It is woven into the literature of the scholar, and colors the
                                    talk of the street. The bark of the merchant cannot sail the sea -without it; no
                                    ship of war goes to the conflict without the Bible is there. It enters men's
                                    closets; mingles in all the grief and cheerfulness of life. The Bible attends them
                                    in their sickness; when the fever of the world is on them the aching head finds a
                                    softer pillow if such<pb n="45" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> leaves lie underneath. The mariner,
                                    escaping from shipwreck, clutches this first of his treasures, and keeps it sacred
                                    to God. It goes with the peddler in his crowded pack; cheers him at eventide, when
                                    he sits down dusty and fatigued; brightens the freshness of his morning face. It
                                    blesses us when we are born; gives names to half Christendom; rejoices with us; has
                                    sympathy for our mourning; tempers our grief to finer issues. It is the better part
                                    of our sermons. It lifts man above himself; our best of uttered prayers are in its
                                    storied speech, wherewith our fathers and the patriarchs prayed. Men rest on this
                                    their dearest hopes. It tells them of God and of his blessed Son; of earthly duties
                                    and of heavenly rest. Foolish men, find it the source of Plato's wisdom, and the
                                    science of Newton, and the art of Raphael; wicked men have used it to rivet the
                                    fetters on the slave. Men who believe nothing else that is spiritual, believe the
                                    Bible all through; without this they would not confess, say they, even that there
                                    was a God. Not to have read the Bible is not to have read the book of all the books
                                    in the world best worth reading. To read it as it deserves to be read�even conceding
                                    its human origin�is a liberal education. No one can be unlearned who has learned
                                    what this book has to teach. Read the Bible, then; if you cannot read it as "the
                                    Word of God." read it for what it surely is�the highest and noblest word of man. In
                                    it human nature rises nearest Divine nature; in it mortality comes nearest the
                                    Divine nature ; in it mortality comes nearest the putting on of immortality. Or if
                                    you care only for meaner merits, where will you find such poetry as Isaiah or Job,
                                    which Froude, a skeptic, says, " will one day, perhaps, be S'ien towering up alone,
                                    far away above the poetry of the world."' Where will you find such prose as in some
                                    r.f the Epistles of Paul, such soulstirring philosophy as in the sermon on the
                                    mount, the parables of the good Samaritan and the prodigal son; such theology as the
                                    conversation with the woman of Samaria; such sublimity of pathos as in the passion,
                                    trial, and crucifixion of Jesus? "Strike, but hear me." Call the Bible what you
                                    will, but read it. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="St. Louis republican" TEIform="index"/>St. Louis (Mo.)

                                H., Feb. 1888'.</dateline><p TEIform="p"> Daniel Orcutt, Beloved Elder :�-Allow me to say to you this fine morning that we find
                                ourselves at Canterbury still giving thanks for the countless temporal and spiritual
                                blessings which seem to environ as. Among the most noteworthy of these let us mention
                                the kind encouraging words, and the virtuous influences, which reach us so often through
                                the columns of the little Manifesto. And you must not be surprised if we send to you
                                personally a special tribute of thanks from the youthful class, which you will please
                                accept. Your manifest interest in their mental and spiritual growth is very apparent and
                                has been felt and realized in the many instructive letters which you have kindly
                                addressed to them through the medium just mentioned. I trust that we need not quote
                                scripture to prove that yourself and many other worthy contributors to our paper, are
                                entitled to a special expression of gratitude from the many readers. You are, no doubt,
                                already aware of what is stated in 2 Cor. ix., 6, 7, and of its personal application ;
                                thus�'� lie which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully"�and again, " God
                                loveth the cheerful giver," therefore you must easily be convinced that our special
                                tribute is mailed to the right address. As we are all learners in the school of Christ
                                we must also all become children agreeably to his teachings if we would enter the
                                Kingdom of Heaven. Thus v,':' include ourselves always in that class whom you are wont
                                to favor with good advice. A significant jtliought in one of your letters most seriously
                                impressed me. It was this.� ��While you are wai.ingfor opportunities to come, present
                                opportunities are passing away forever:" Could we all properly realize this truth how
                                many golden moments would be saved to us! Another pertinent saying re curs to me by a
                                certain writer who said "A wealthy man who obtains wealth honestly and uses it rightly
                                is a great blessing to any community." So I think that the individual who is rich toward
                                God having obtained a<pb n="46" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> spiritual competence by honest soul labor
                                even while he toils for an earthly subsistence is by far the more wealthy of the two,
                                and the more useful in Society. In this light we view those progressed individuals who
                                always have some good spiritual gift to give to the hungrj poor. It has been my happy
                                privilege to dwell with many worthy characters who are thus rich toward God and who are
                                daily sowing the seeds of virtue in youthful hearts; and they too whose lives are so hid
                                with Christ in God that their good deeds can never be numbered in Time, but Eternity
                                keeps the record. Now, dear Elder, please accept our offering and feel blest in the
                                efforts you have made for the youthful readers of today. That you will realize some
                                satisfactory results from your labors of love, in the future, is our latest petition.
                                Please accept with this an expression of kind regards from all within our home circle,
                                which includes the whole household of Brethren and Sisters.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Fish, Jennie H." TEIform="persName"/>Jennie H.

                                                must take a share. The sun will oft be hidden, The storms will often
                                                come, Before the children enter The safety of "the home." But you, for

                                                them, Nor leave them comfortless. So, if you love the children, Take

                                                a power in you Which still shall bless the children When you have passed
                                                away, And never more shall leave them Till the dawning of heaven's day.
                                                So take the children early To the gentle Master's feet, And he shall
                                                teach them ever ^he lessons that are meet; And he will give them
                                                shelter, And he will be their friend Till the need of prayer is over,
                                                And all their troubles end.</p></quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="London S. S. times" TEIform="index"/>London S. S.

"Spirit Control of People."
A work of the above title is about to appear from the publication office of Phil3ROOK & Dean, Chicago, written by H. B.
Philbrook, author of "What and Where is
God?" "Work of Electricity in Nature,"
"Cause and Cure of Disease," and other
scientific works.
The work is claimed to be a complete
Spirit History of all the essential operations
of spirit people in producing the events and
controlling the affairs of a mortal people�
governmental, religious, political, social and
personal. Every event of the world of consequence is considered, and the author in
spirit life anl the purpose of the event is
given, with details and particulars, and all
matters, names and dates, are as fully set
forth as in any historical work.
A full description of spirit authors, of all
literary works, including bibles or books of
a religious worship, poems, songs or the music of songs, many dramatic writings, all
paintings of extraordinary merit, and the inventions of people of consequence is to be
given, and the spirit author is named
The uncovering of spirit operations in human affairs extends from the commencement
of civilization to the present day, and all the
operations of the people of our own country,
of a public character, are found to be but
the result of a spirit control of persons.
The book will be as full a history of the
important events of both spirit and mortal
worlds as is wanted by a people.
It is perhaps well to say, that if it be correct it will be the most surprising and interesting of all literary works. When the work
reaches us we shall give our own opinion
upon it.
The work will be sold by subscription and
by book dealers.
