TEIform="persName"/>Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p">From this place Mother Ann and the Elders went on to Niskeyuna. All the Believers who had
                            accompanied them were now dismissed, except Richard Spier, aud returned to their several
                            homes. Having traveled but a few miles, Elder William Lee called at the shop of a
                            Blacksmith, by the name of Johnson and asked him to re-set a shoe on his horse, but the man,
                            in a very rough and passionate manner, refused and seizing a pair of tongs, threw them at
                            Elder William with great violence. They fortunately missed the mark and struck the ground
                            near his feet. Richard Spier picked up the tongs and asked Johnson the reason for such
                            conduct. "I will kill all of them," said Johnson, "if they do not leave the shop." The
                            Believers thought it was a point of wisdom to move on, and soon reached the residence of
                            Ebenezer Knapp where they had beeD invited to stop. The family had made preparations for the
                            visit, and were pleased when they learned that Mother Abn aud the Elders bad decided to call
                            upon them. Soon after they had entered the house, Johnson with about twenty characters as
                            rough as himself were before the dwelling and ordered Mother Ann and the Elders to leave the
                            place in thirty minutes or they should suffer the consequences. These ruffianly fellows were
                            armed with sticks and clubs, while some had heavy whips. They wound the lashes around their
                            hands that they might the more effectively use their weapons of cruelty. This threatened
                            interference so disturbed the minds of the family and their guests that they were afraid to
                            sit at the table, at the hour of noon. Elder William Lee went to the door and spoke to the
                            mob without fear. "We came here peaceably to refresh ourselves," said he, " and we have
                            concluded to remain here so long as we may choose, and you have no right to disturb us." No
                            farther abuse was offered and the Believers soon made preparation to continue their journey.
                            On their arrival at the ferry, opposite the city of Albany, they met a party of Indians, and
                            by them the Believers were treated with<pb n="146" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> civility and kindness. After
                            crossing the river they entered the forest, N. W. of Albany where they felt assured that
                            they could rest undisturbed for a few moments. Pursuing their journey through these wild
                            woods, they arrived at Niskeyuna late in the evening on the fourth of September, 1783, after
                            an absence of two years and* four months. [The evangelizing mission of Mother Ann and the
                            Elders has not its parallel on record. Their history tells of a living sacrifice of years on
                            years. Of lives consecrated to God's service in which there was not the shadow of turning.
                            From the day that they received the diviue call, while in England, till they passed from the
                            scenes of time, it was one long aud perilous march through worldly persecution. Remarkable
                            stories have been told of men ; of the tortures to which they have been subjected and of the
                            hair breadth escapes which came at the opportune moment and permitted them to do more and
                            suffer more, while on the pilgrimage through this world. And no less of their suffering unto
                            death in all the agonies that could be concentrated upon the hour of torture. Many cases
                            might also be enumerated where Heathen and Christian savagery has been inflicted upon women
                            by imprisonment, by the rack and by burning at the stake. Remarkable instances of heroism
                            and unshaken confidence in the cause of right, have also been manifested, aud have become
                            the beautiful lessons which to this day enkindle thoughts and acts of self-sacrifice and of
                            loving emulation. But all these instances diminish before this "burning fiery furnace" into
                            which Mother Ann and the Elders were cast, as they through a protracted period of fourteen
                            years were thrown into jails and prisons and filthy dungeons. They were stoned by an^ry and
                            malicious mobs ; they were beaten with clubs and the flesh torn from their bodies by tha
                            cruel strokes of the lash. They were deprived of their food, and of their rest, and suffered
                            daily at th: hands of religious fanatics an untold list of brutal indignities. In all this
                            they never wavered in their confidence before Gcd, that he would be their Father, guide and
                            protector. They received much consolation in the testimony of Jesus. "Because you are not of
                            the world, therefore, the world hateth you." "It hated me, even as it hateth you." "Be of
                            good cheer, I have overcome the world." These servants of the living God, even while under
                            the lash of hard hearted tormentors, would in the exaltation of their minds, sing hymns of
                            praise to God's glory, in that He had called them to suffer, that others might rejoice. And
                            there were times in which these three witnesses rejoiced aud were made exceeding glad ;
                            times even when they could enjoy the fellowship aud friendship of their gospel relation ;
                            when the songs of thanksgiving brought peace aud assurance, aud the voices of little
                            children so captivated them that they would forget the trials and sorrows of the Christian
                            martyr. They were, in the best and most noble sense of the term, men and women, and
                            eminently beautiful representatives of the family of man. Kind, gentle, mirthful aud
                            affectionate. Add to this the love and grace of God and ^e can readily see what made their
                            company so much to be desired by their spiritual children.<pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> On the
                            extended mission which they made in the years 1782 and 1783, they passed through not less
                            than thirty six towns, in the states of New York, Mass. and Conn. In many of these places
                            they held religious services, which abounded in songs of praise and thanksgiving and in
                            exhortations of "peace on earth, to men and women, good will." The mission was carried into
                            effect when the American people were in a very excited state of mind, arising in part from
                            the demoralized state of society, brought on by wars and fightings, and in part by the
                            intolerance of bigoted religionists who were always ready to institute au inquisition and to
                            tyrannize over all that did not subscribe to their churchal dogmas, and lastly to that
                            sordid selfishness of the human heart that always makes '�'�might to be right" as it
                            dominates over the minds of men; It is a source of congratulation, that Mothsr Ann and the
                            Elders were made able to pass through all these heavy burdens of mind and body, as well as
                            to endure all the cruel persecutions that fell upon them, and then, at last, reach their own
                            beloved home in the wilderness of Niskeyima, and be able to dwell in love and peace, for a
                            few days, surrounded by Brethren and.Sisters, who had covenanted before God to be "faithful
                            uuto death." It has been a labor of love to bring this brief historical account of
                            missionary labors of Mother Ann and the Elders, before the readers of "The Manifesto,"
                            having the assurance that it will awaken an interest in the minds of many, to do more for
                            the cause of righteousness, and less for the selfish interests that '�' perish in their
                            using." These three gospel leaders closed their labors on the earth, while in active
                            service. Mother Ann and Father William Lee, at their own home in Watervliet, N. Y., in 1784.
                            The first was forty nine years of age, and the other only forty four. Father James Whittaker
                            closed his labors in the Society at ~Enfield, Conn., in 1787. being only thirty six years of
                            age.�Ed.

                            high. They quicken unto zeal,�they come with conquering might, From thrall of error's chains
                            to bring release; Thro' strife of elements betwixt the wrong and right, They bear the
                            prophecy of rich increase. They bring a chastening power, repentance deep and A gif; for
                            Zion's children far and near; [true, To cleanse her courts from sin, and covenants renew,
                            Her sacred laws and statutes to revere. They will revive the flames of holy altar fires,

                            When over multitudes his Spirit shall be poured, As prophecy declared in days of old. Then
                            cold philosophies, and husks of earthly lore, No more the hungi-y mind shall seek as food;
                            For " hid with Christ in God," is wisdom's boundless store, And those who there abide find

                            pathway of life abounds with snares and traps ; to escape them, requires wisdom, adroitness
                            and eternal vigilance. Varied are their conditions and aspects, and varied the degree of
                            their mischievous character. We meet them in sunshine and in shade ; oft in form hidden or
                            masked, and again open and clear to vision ; the latter equally perilous as the former, as
                            from the absence of the show of disguise, the tendency is to remove suspicion where danger
                            is near, thus eluding the trusting traveler when he should be the most wary. We are often
                            meeting in life individuals, with whom at every interview an introduction is required and a
                            study of their character necessary to be able to discern their moods ; otherwise we come to
                            loggerheads. The movements and manners of yesterday are by no means accepted and borne by
                            them to-day. The language of yesterday, however well accepted, is not adapted to the mood of
                            to-day. If yesterday our eyes were open and we looked up, to-day they must be closed or we
                            must look down. Yesterday, if it were the most agreeable thing to advance, to-day, the
                            course must be reversed. Really, to steer through life free from some annoyances, without
                            some friction is an impossibility and beyond the power of human acquisition. We either are
                            subjecs to be trodden upon or to tread upon the heels of others. A degree of attrition, when
                            under perfect control, may work advantageously by opening the eyes of the blind, enabling
                            them to discover imperfections which otherwise than through sufferings would not be
                            discerned. "Where there is no vision, the people perish." Prov. xxix., 18. The light of
                            truth alone gives progress ; and ray added to ray and beam to beam will ultimately bring in
                            the revelation and blaze of the principles and the glory of the millennium. Conspicuous
                            among the golden rules of Christian life is the following:� " Neither give nor take
                            offense." This principle sustained, peace, love and union is the result, from which
                            development, growth and progress will legitimately follow. Enfield, N.

Calm deliberate inquiry, and an acceptance of truth when
                            presented, however strong our educational and conventional prejudices, may be, betokens the
                            true man. There are conditions of mind favorable to the reception of truth ; and of spirit,
                            to the reception of good impressions�the elemental seeds of happiness.The person who is
                            never in a condition<pb n="149" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> to receive good impressions, will never be happy.
                            As that which is natural is first, suppose we have a little talk about vegetarianism, you
                            being favorable to that way of living. Our experience in that line extends over a period of
                            nearly thirty years. It has given entire satisfaction. No deficiency of, or want of strength
                            in muscle or bone has been felt. It is a blessed way of living, clean, sweet and economical.
                            Again, a little more of that which is natm*al. We take the same view of the procreative
                            subject that Jesus did, (see Matt, xix.) Not dogmatically, nor even by the authority of the
                            scriptures. The germ of the Divine Life being quickened in the founders of this people, the
                            works of the flesh dropped off as a consequence� they rose in the resurrection, and lived
                            out on earth, in their natural bodies, the same principles, that are lived out by the angels
                            who are in a heavenly state. A community of all good things was, and is the happy result. A
                            community with us is not a manufactured article ; it springs up of itself, and is the result
                            of the internal Forces of the Divine Life. We never present celibacy as a dogma ; with us,
                            the word is, whomsoever is able to receive the Divine Life, let him receive it. And who so
                            wills to live the Adamic life, let him. And all who act rightly therein, the blessing of God
                            will rest on them, and on their children. But we cannot see, how any person can hold on to
                            the old man Adam, of the earth, earthy, and to Christ the Lord from heaven�a quickening
                            spirit, at the same time�ye cannot serve two masters. An eminent German wrote as follows : "
                            Why wait for the Millennium to overtake us ? Why not cultivate now the principles which
                            create the Millennium ?" Why should we wait any longer in the world,�the kingdom of the
                            Beast�-of brute foi*ce�the kingdom of the propensities? When we can enjoy a higher, and a
                            happier life, and be now, as the angels are. What good will it do to us, to wait till after
                            our bodies are in their graves ? The same work will have to be done then, that we are doing
                            now ! In his day Jesus thought it no robbery to be equal to the manifestations of God to
                            him. And we think it no presumption to follow his example, and all who will, may do the
                            same. You allude to the fact, that the converts from Paganism married. I have inclosed a
                            small tract bearing on that point. They belonged to the outer court, and were not to be
                            measured as Christians. And much less the so-called Christians of our day. The questions at
                            issue with me, are not, Can I have a wife and be carnal, like the so-called Christians of
                            to-day, and like those of old Corinth. Can I be a slave-holder like Philemon, and like the
                            late slave-holders of the South, and still be called a Christian ? Naj, the questions at
                            issue with me are, Did Christ come to lay a foundation for, and to institute a new order of
                            human society, or did he not? Did he only come to patch up Adam's old clothes, and so make
                            the rents worse, or did he come to create all things anew ? If the latter, then every act of
                            man or woman not logical, with that foundation, is not of Christ. He said " my kingdom is
                            not of this world," if it was, then would his servants fight. The children of this world
                            marry and are given in marriage, and they do fight. The so-called<pb n="150" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>
                            Christian and the Pagan, no difference, only the former the worse of the two. Again, Christ
                            declared, "that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of Heaven " Now, what is heaven,
                            and where is it? Is it a state or a place? according to our ideas of locality. The Savior
                            promptly settles these questions. Heaven is ;n you, and it is peace and joy in the Holy
                            Spirit�a state of mind ; and not gratification to any propensity. F.urther, what is flesh
                            and blood, and what are they of? They are of the propensities�the Forces which create flesh
                            and blood. And if flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven, how can the Forces
                            of the flesh inherit that kingdom. The spirit that moves in the propensities, is the spirit
                            of a beast. The world lives, moves, and has its being in the propensities. Whence are wars?
                            They are of the propensities, which war in our members ; they belong to that division of our
                            nature�the animal part, which cannot appreciate Grod, nor inherit his kingdom.
                            Intrinsically, are not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. Under the Mosaic
                            dispensation the propensities were required to be subject to the following laws. The
                            Dietetic, the Moral, the Financial, the Agricultural, the Sanitary, the Agrarian, the
                            Sabbatical, and the Procreative. These laws, were the shadow of a coming day. The Dietetic,
                            taught discrimination in eating, that every thing should not be gobbled down by man ; and
                            that there is a certain order of diet suitable to him. And pointed to a day, when animal
                            food would form no part of human sustenance, as was once the case. The Moral, on the action
                            of the propensities on the neighbor. The Financial.�take no usury, prevented the creation of
                            a moneyed aristocracy. The Agricultural, restrained from cultivating the land recklessly.
                            The Sanitary, to be cleanly in their persons, and places. The Agrarian, restraint on the
                            propensity of getting all the land next to one's farm. The Sabbatical, withdraw from
                            business one day in seven. And every seventh year, rested the land, and turned the whole
                            country into a common. The poor had access to the plantations of the rich, and all debts
                            were canceled. And every fiftieth year, lost social equilibriums were restored�every man who
                            had lost, went back to his inheritance. The Procreative, imposed restraint on the lusts of
                            the flesh. People now a days have little idea of the extent of the restriction. Probably,
                            such a subjection of the propensities, had no previous parallel. It was a schoolmaster to
                            bring souls to Christ! It was a shadow, it cut off a little. The mission of Jesus was to do
                            the whole work! Now, the axe is laid at the root of the animal in man�the accuser of the
                            brethren�the propensity life, was to be cast out, root and branch. So that the man, the
                            Divine man, enshrined in every human being, may be brought forth�resurrected. Hence, Jesus
                            said "I am the Resurrection." It is a commonly received error, that when persons professing
                            Christianity behave with conventional decorum, as regards the propensities, that they are
                            Christians, and may marry. Jesus said, "Such are the children of this world." But those who
                            are in the resurrection, live in the Divine, of their being, do not. To this life, exclusive
                            of the propensity life, we draw the attention of those who have eyes to see. And, be
                                assured,<pb n="151" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> that even as the natural man, under some degree of
                            restraint, has brought forth a system of natural law, and a kind of order and civilization ;
                            so also will the Divine man bring forth law, order, and a civilization corresponding to the
                            Divine of his being. " Eye hath not seen" etc.�a civilization of love, not of force and
                            fraud. It is very true, what you say about the advantages communities might afford. But the
                            almost universal failure of communities, made up of a number of families, afford ground for
                            suspicion (seeing some of the truest men of our day have given their best energies to
                            establish them) that the Adamic man and woman cannot sustain such an order of human
                            society�that they occupy, inherently, a position antagonistic to that of having goods in
                            common. And that the organic laws of that order cannot be set aside by the willing subjects
                            of said laws. To alter the form of human society, from the individual family relationship,
                            to a community, embracing a number of families, and yet leave intact the organic laws which
                            gave existence to the family relationships, seems to be illogical, and absurd, and the
                            practical results favor this view. Jesus understood that matter, in its positive, and
                            negative bearings. " He who will lose his life"�the selfish life, represented by the
                            propensities�dies to them, "will find it"�the Divine Life, to life eternal. And he who will
                            seek to save his life� the former one, will lose eternal life! I will now say a few words on
                            particular points in your well considered letter. Your idea of the resurrection includes the
                            body, as you and I were early taught. Christ's idea of it wa9 different from that, and so is
                            ours. Martha said " I know he will rise again at the last day.'' Jesus did not prgue the
                            matter, but simply said, "I am the Resurrection and the Life," and left her to ponder the
                            matter. Christ being the Resurrection, though in the body, could not marry; and those who
                            are in his spirit, neither can they marry. And when two or three are gathered together in
                            Christ's Spirit, they will constitute the Resurrection Order, whether they be on earth or in
                            the Spirit land. The more that this matter is looked into, the clearer it will be seen that
                            the Adamic Order, and the Divine, are organically distinct. You state " that the religion of
                            Christ was not intended to cause mankind to ignore, abrogate, or extinguish any of the
                            natural faculties, or powers of the body. Here I will remark that Jesus did speak of a daily
                            cross, of losing a certain,, life. "If any member offends, pluck it out, cut it off."
                            "Better to enter into life maimed," etc. Again, of those who are pure and good and use all
                            their faculties to the highest reason, purity and temperance; we would say, that they are
                            perfect in their Order,�as Noah was. But they are no more Christians than he was. Further,
                            if there be any such, we would like to know where they are. Supposing such do exist, (seeing
                            men are progressive,) what would such people progress from, and what would they progress to
                            ? To me, it seems clear, that their course would be upward, toward the Divine of their
                            being, where Christ is. However pure men may be, it will do no harm to glance for a moment
                            at the Law, and observe how the Spirit that dictated that Law, viewed the works of
                            generation. Lev. xii.<pb n="152" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> There you will find, that the most orderly, and
                            legitimate works of the flesh, are declared unclean, and treated as sinful ; a word to the
                            wise is enough. You remark, "-that Paul hedged marriage round with Christian rules" a proof
                            that said institution was recognized. To me it is proof, that said Church was carnal, and
                            not an integral part of the body of Christ, it was under restraint, and open to the
                            objection �"forbidding to marry." Again, the marriage at Cana. It is a rule in logic,
                            imitations of the Pentecostal Church. Paul wrote to Timothy, at Ephesus, as follows: "But
                            the younger widows refuse, for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will
                            marry ; having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith." The form of these
                            associations, (sayiug nothing of the power,) exists, eveu at this day, in the monkish
                            institutions. In speaking of propagating the race from a sense of duty. All who are so
                            exercised, may claim a right to multithat, that which proves too much, proves ply. But we
                            are not aware of the exisnothing, on the same principle, publicans aud sinners might plead
                            justification. Marriage, in the Gentile Church, was a great advance on Polygamy,�the
                            Mormonism of that day, .and other abominations. Finally, this Gentile Christianity,
                            overspread the Church at Jerusalem, trod it down to the level of the outer court, which was
                            not to be measured. And, from that time, the witnesses testified in sackcloth, during the
                            dark ages, down to the Second appearing of Christ�of the Pentecostal Order, in the Shaker
                            Societies. With regard to the virgin character of the Pentecostal Church, I am not aware
                            that any reliable historian ever successfully called its purity in question. I am confident
                            'hat no philosopher who has got the key, to an analytical knowledge of the Forces of the
                            Adamic man, would dispute the virgin character of said Church, for a moment. But would
                            rather declare, that, for a body of people to exist for more than three hundred years,
                            having goods in common, and still he under thefower of the Procreative Forces, was a moral,
                            ajid spiritual impossibility. Indeed, in the Gentile Christian Church, there were virgin
                            associations� tence of any nation, or family, who do propagate from a sense of duty. If such
                            do not exist, then no nation, no family have a right to propagate. In conclusion, we
                            earnestly desire, that the Adamic man and woman may so conduct themselves, as not to
                            precipitate the extinction of the race, before the appointed time! I seriously believe, that
                            it is the mind and will of God, that the Divine Order of human society on earth, shall be a
                            protection to the race, and prevent the Procreative Order from running itself out, before
                            the time. The two Orders will run parallel through the ages. But the Divine Order, as a
                            general thing, will never be very numerous. With regard to the Mormons, and the Oneida
                            people, i may say, that all communities, nations, and civilizations of the past, have gone
                            to decay, through, and by, the action of the propensities. Aud the more intense the action,
                            the sooner the end will be ! Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Death is the very friend whom, in his due season..." TEIform="index"/>

                            open wide for the ruination of the innocent. These, say some, are necessary evils. As soon
                            as youth enter active life they are met with all the corrupting influences which designing
                            men can invent. If men lived pure these festering sores would not spue their poison to
                            infect the unfortunate. They are legitimate consequences produced by the influence of
                            so-called respectable men and women, even Christians, who are slaves to their passions, and
                            have no confidence to testify against evils which so many love to be surrounded with. When
                            men live above such indulgences those smoky hells of dissipation and prostitution will
                            receive their doom. They cannot exist in virtuous society any more than humors can proceed
                            from a pure state of the blood. No community can enjoy prosperity while brothels exist.
                            These nuisances where evil spirits both in the body and out congregate, must be eradicated
                            by weapons of truth through human instrumentalities. The prayers of the suffering, and the
                            cries of the needy, call for the aid of noble reformers. God, Angels and spirits will

                            </head><p TEIform="p"> [Many of our readers will, no doubt, be interested in the following letter, written by
                                Elder John E. Ead*s of South Union, Ky., to Elder H. L. Eads of Union Village, O., as it
                                was at a time when the Believers were in deep sorrow. Ed.] South Union, Ky., Jan. 4,
                                1862. Dear Brother :�I have received your kind letter of Dec. 20th. and never was I and
                                many others, more thankful to receive a letter from your pen. It seems you had the
                                kindness to try repeatedly to get a letter to me, but succeeded only in this of the
                                20th. ult. I will now, also, try to get one to you, and hope the best I can for success.
                                We were as much surprised, as we were thankful to receive a letter at this time. I read
                                it in both of our families, and, when I read it the second time, I received evidence
                                that it had been supernaturally protected. Your letter, I suppose, had been inspected by
                                the appointed and lawful supervisors, but they had the manliness, and sufficient human
                                sympathy to send it forward, till it reached our depot. For it would assuredly be
                                severe, indeed, as well as destitute of the ''milk of human kindness" to hinder the
                                passing of a communication which consisted only of kindly inquiries of welfare between
                                brothers, and an interchange of pious thoughts toward our Redeemer and Creator. I hope,
                                therefore, this of mine, in return, may be as favorably received by the inspectors, as
                                was yours to me, seeing that it does by no means interfere with the interests of either
                                party, now in the field. For, as you observed, it is so well known to the public that
                                Shakers, (as we both are) take no part in the politics of the world, no sides with any
                                political party, but, loyal to whatever government, under providence, is extended over
                                us, taking no part in its establishment, and that we are peaceable, inoffensive
                                citizens, making an honest, and humble living. That Shaker institutions are clearly
                                religious institutions. This being well understood by the public generally, I think I
                                may fairly infer that we will meet with more clemency from inspectors, than we would if
                                we were at all belligerant, either in our faith, or character. I was very thankful to
                                hear of your reasonable good health, and of that of all our friends ; but I could not
                                forbear sympathizing, when I heard that between two Shaker settlements, so many
                                thousands of dollars had been lost, on account of the war, and that at other places
                                considerable had been lost. On your part, it seemed to me that the stagnation of
                                business, and the multiplicity of widows and children "thick as blackberries" that were
                                coming in to receive your comfort and protection; this, I thought, would be drawback
                                enough upon your temporalities without any further inflictions of the calamities of war.
                                We have not been visited with anything of which we feel like complaining though we have
                                fed the soldiers, in their passing and repassing, from two at a time, up to hundreds,
                                till we have about gone the length of our string without suffering ourselves. Not long
                                since, our sisters had to be up pretty much one whole night cooking lor a company of six
                                hundred soldiers, (cavalry,) and with all of their exertions did not set all of them
                                something to eat, being at first represented as a company of one hundred and fifty or<pb n="155" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> two hundred. The poor creatures were hungry, but a portion of
                                them had to go on, for we were not able to supply them. This thiug of feeding horses and
                                soldiers both, we find soon takes away the subsistence upon which .we, ourselves, must
                                depend. Of late, some who call themselves "Texas Rangers" seem inclined to take by
                                violence what they want or say they need ; but this has not been carried to any great
                                extent as yet. But if the necessities of the war should increase, we are unable to say
                                what may come upon us in this line. But, in a spiritual line, we are promised that our
                                sufferings shall not exceed our ability to bear, provided we will be true to our faith
                                and calling. It was a peculiar comfort to me, and all your friends and acquaintances
                                here, to hear of the welfare, and to receive the pure love of those prominent laborers
                                in the vineyard to whose names you so kindly alluded and mentioned. They feel to us, and
                                we so esteem them, as beautiful branches of the Heavenly Viue, yielding Heavenly fruits
                                ; and 0, how we would love to see them, and be refreshed and cheered and comforted by
                                them ; but we cannot at this time. Beloved Elder John Rankin made an effort some month
                                or two since, to reach your lovely residence, and did go far enough towards the military
                                boundary in that direction to ascertain the fact, that if he passed over, he could not
                                return. He therefore returned, and gave up the point he so ardently desired. We must say
                                that we have got along, thus far, with less trouble than we anticipated. The soldiers
                                make no demands upon the country but what the military necessities of their case seems
                                to justify, are inclined to manifest a good degree of southern politeness, and seem to
                                desire to make themselves as little offensive to the inhabitants of the country,
                                especially in a political point of view, as they consistently can. The exceptions to
                                this do not seem to proceed from the government and regulations of the army, but from
                                over zealous partisans. For a while, we felt great apprehensions of trouble from
                                drafting, and on account thereof two of us made Governor Johusou a visit, at his
                                residence in Bowling Greeu. We found him affable, familiar, and fortunately well
                                acquainted with the Believers. We found no necessity for pleading our faith, habits or
                                manner of life, for he seemed to know much about Shakers, and wt.s favorably inclined or
                                disposed. We found, to our great relief, that he had no thought of drafting the citizens
                                of the country, but simply desired to raise a few regiments of volunteers. We were well
                                satisfied with our visit, (Urban E. Johns and myself,) and the counsel which he gave'
                                was so much like what we had already received at home, and that was, to stick together
                                and stay at home ; make no visits north, and thus avoid censure, remain neutral, as we
                                professed, and show ourselves loyal to the government extended over the land. And in
                                this course he did not think we would suffer more inconvenience than the necessities of
                                the case would bring over the common country. He seemed pleased, aad satisfied with the
                                kindness we had shown to the soldiers. We also endeavored to get an interview with Gen.
                                Buckner, but he was off all day on duty, and we could not obtain it. The great battle
                                yet to be at Bowling<pb n="156" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> Green, does not appear to us to be as near at
                                hand, as it does to you. There is such a seeming remarkable tardiness in the movements
                                of the army on the federal side. As one side increases, the other must increase in
                                proportion, so that ic is difficult to be sufficiently prepared. Fear may have its
                                influence, and it may be a natural backwardness, as it should be where brothers are
                                about to meet in deadly conflict, and we may suppose it will be a bloody matter when it
                                does come off: except, as you remark, there should be another "Bull Run or Manassas
                                race," from one side or the other; which would be decidedly the cheapest way of settling
                                the affair, provided it would be as well settled, when the race would be over. But that
                                would be too good ; we do not expect it, and all the part we expect to take, is to do
                                what Ave can for the wounded and dying, when the affair is over, provided matters so
                                turn that they be thrown, in any numbers, upon our mercy. This only, would be dictated
                                by a truly Christian faith. Your presentation of Christian duty, meets our feelings
                                exactly ; for, as you say, "We cannot go to war, we cannot kill anybody ; for the spirit
                                of our divine Teacher by which we are led, doth utterly forbid it, and disqualifies us ;
                                for his kingdom is not of this world ; therefore those who are exclusively his servants,
                                cannot fight nor shed the blood of their fellow man." Nay, as you further remark, if we
                                ha^. to seek the caves and rocks, the sequestered vallies or mountains, and the solitary
                                places for a home, subsisting upon the merest pittance, which G-od in his goodness
                                causes to grow from the bosom of this beautiful earth, we could not so highly offend the
                                Almighty Father, who has "power to destroy both soul and body in hell." With this kind
                                of resolution, we expect to suffer our share of affliction or judgment, which is now
                                abundantly abroad in the land. In regard to the Christlike virtue of turning the other
                                cheek, when the one is smitten, we have had a little trial in one case. Elder Solomon
                                Rankin who was waiting upon the soldiers, had been advocating this virtue, thereupon,
                                one of the soldiers felt a sudden impulse to try him to test this virtue, declaring that
                                he did not believe in such a doctrine, and with the same brought Elder S. a spat on one
                                cheek. Elder S. instinctively turned the other in accordance with his doctrine, and the
                                soldier brought back his hand with a spat on the other cheek. This caused a considerable
                                laugh with ihe soldiers, as it did with Elder S. but it never changed one stern muscle
                                of the soldier's countenance. This truly represents the spirit and faith of all of us,
                                on whom the powers of the world to come have had their proper influence. But where there
                                is not much experience in this line, another branch of counsel is easier kept. " When
                                persecuted in one city, flee to another," but faith must be kept, if we are protected.
                                Judging from the outward appearance of things, our future prospects are not clear to us.
                                What may come to disturb or unsettle us, we do not know, nor do we know the amount of
                                judgment God will require at the hands of mankind, before they will be willing to do his
                                will instead of their own. Nor do we know whether He will be pleased to establish two
                                republics or one; or whether or not he has something in reserve, differ-<pb n="157" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> ent from the prospects of either party, that he will bring mankind to as
                                their greatest jrood. This .we do not know ; but we hope that we, with all parties, may
                                be reconciled to his will, when his government shall be established. You will of course
                                know that God's will is always foremost with us, and we find that it is a good deal the
                                sense of the soldiers that the success, or ill success of their arms, will, in a good
                                measure, decide what is God's will in the matter. Now, dear brother, I do not see but I
                                have written you pretty much all of interest that I well can at this time. I doubt not
                                that you know more of the present state of affairs than I do. Thank you much for
                                delivering our love in so sensitive a manner. We are also thankful to receive so much
                                pure love in return. Yea, thankful we are, for love is rendered double in value in these
                                times of tribulation. Receive, therefore, the true and pure love, not only from myself,
                                but from many of your old friends and acquaintances ; please distribute the same to our
                                friends so far as you may have opportunity. Kindly farewell,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Eads, John R." TEIform="persName"/> John R.

                            Christ, does not manifest the Highest, but belongs to a lower order of manifesting
                            intelligences. Peter, answering a question, said to Jesus, "Thou art the Anointed, the Son
                            of the living God." Jesus replied, "Blessed art thori Simon son of Jonas, for flesh and
                            blood hath not revealed it unto the?, but my Father which is in heaven. Moreover I say to
                            thee that thou art a rock, and upon this rock. 1 will build my congregation, and the gates
                            of Hades shall not prevail against her." Matt. xvi. A rock is deemed a solid, unchanging and
                            permanent foundation to build upon. What constituted Simon a rock, if not the gift of
                            revelation from the Father? It certainly did uot mean his personality, for soon after, he is
                            severely rebuked and called a Satan, (i. e. opposer,) and told to go behind for being a
                            stumbling block, who was minding not the things of God, but things of men. It appears from
                            the record that Simon was what in this day would be called a medium, inspired by a gift from
                            heaven, or by influences from Hades, or by opinions of people with whom he associated,
                            according to the direction of his thoughts, and the circumstances in which he was placed. He
                            had not learned to discriminate different sources of inspiration, and therefore needed a
                            mentor fo guide him aright, which office, Jesus fulfilled while in the mortal. But what
                            relation have the gates of Hades to the congregation of Christ? Hades is a Greek word
                            signifying the invisible, and was regarded by Greeks as the abode of the dead of all
                            classes. In the New Testament, it means the temporai-y receptacle of unredeemed spirits who
                            have left the mortal body. Temporary, because when all of those spirits shall have heard the
                            voice of the Son of God, (Juo. v., 25 to 29,) through his messengers, and have come forth at
                            the call to judgment, Hades will be abolished, as saith the spirit of prophecy, "O Hades, 1
                            will be thy destruction !" "And Death and Hades were cast into a lake of fire."<pb n="158" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> Gates are used to open or close passways through a wall or other barrier. In
                            walled cities, massive towers were built over gate-ways, to contain soldiers for defending
                            the city. There Governors and Judges held courts, and merchants displayed their wares,
                            because of throngs of people passing to and fro, or pausing to transact business. A common
                            figure of speech in eastern literature, includes defences and people, in the term "gates."
                            The physical senses, or the vail of the flesh, constitutes the barrier which divides Hades
                            from the visible world, so that there can be uo intelligent communication between the dead
                            and the living, except through specially endowed persons called mediums. Hence, natural
                            mediums, through whom unredeemed spirits communicate their knowledge and their wishes to
                            mortals, may properly be called gates of Hades. The congregation, or church of Christ is in
                            like manner, the gate to heaven of life eternal, and has rival claims to man's attention,
                            belief, interest and trust. It is founded on a higher, purer, deeper and more permanent
                            revelation, than any inspiration ever uttered by natural, unredeemed, and therefore earth
                            bound spirits, whether in or out of the flesh. And though the latter may be jealous, or
                            envious of the true Christian work and revelation,- �and though they may be averse to
                            renouncing their petty eminences, boasted acquirements, selfish freedoms, and independent
                            sway over the minds of mortals enlisted in their favorite schemes for perfecting human
                            happiness without the cross of Christ, they never can close this gate of heaven, nor prevail
                            against the congregation of Christ while it cleaves to its foundation. All divinely
                            commissioned spirits must acknowledge the way of Christ to be the open avenue of superior
                            wisdom, to which all must finally come and lay off their fancied greatness and
                            self-importance, to learn the way of life from a beginning, as little children, or never
                            attain to that perfection which alone completes the joy of the soul. It is evident from the
                            New Testament record, that in the time of Christ's first appearing, necessarily so, because
                            the Gospel of Christ, is the resurrection gospel, and when it is preached in this, it is
                            heard in both worlds at the same time. Heuce Jesus declared, " The hour comes and now is,
                            when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they having heard, shall live."
                            They that obey become resurrected. "The gospel was preached to the dead, that they might be
                            judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in spirit," wrote the
                            Apostle. Where-ever the true gospel is preached, there the resurrection and the judgment
                            conjointly proceed. The gates of Hades having been opened to permit the return of the dead
                            and satisfy the afore-mentioned purpose, some mediums set up for teachers, and not
                            submitting to any authority but their own self-wills, brought in conflicting doctrines, some
                            of which, Paul termed "doctrines of demons," which made confusion, and many divisions sprang
                            up, causing parties and contention, among the professed believers in Christ. In view of
                            these things, James exhorts, '' My brethren, become not many teachers, (i. e. of divergent
                            doctrines) knowing that greater judgment we shall receive. For in many ways we all err."
                            Christ the true way is one. "But if<pb n="159" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> anyone err not in word, this I - a
                            perfect man, and able to guide the whole body." He is qualified to teach. John says "
                            Believe not every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are from God. Because many
                            false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the spirit of God. Every one
                            which confesses that a Savior anointed has come in the flesh, is from God. Every spirit who
                            does not confess the Savior, is not of God. And this is that anti-anoiuted which you heard
                            that it comes and is already in the world.'" The confession which Jesus drew from Simon
                            Peter, is here applied as a test. Of course this means acknowledgement and submission to the
                            authority cf the anointed messengers who guide the body, and who make unity of purpose and
                            concerted action possible to all its members. Many thousands of communications claiming
                            exalted spiritual origins, are being received in this day, because Christ is again
                            tabernacled in flesh, and the aionian gospel of the resurrection and judgment is preached,
                            which brings the two worlds near together, as in Christ's first appearing. Without a true
                            criterion or standard by which to test the various doctrines taught by spirits in and out of
                            the body, we are liable either to reject all the wisdom advanced spirits can teach us, and
                            close our eyes against the light which is flooding the world today, and grope with the
                            blind, or like many others, become lost in a sea of error and speculation, because unable to
                            separate true from false, or the things of God from things of men. The congregation of
                            Christ is built by obedience of its members thereto, upon an ever present inspiration from
                            the living God, and is a revelation to the world of the Divine character and purpose,
                            diffusing to each age, in every cycle of its progress, the Divine illumination of its
                            respective degree. Hence the doctrine and revelation of God made knorvn in the congregation
                            of Christ, true to the principles of its foundation, furnish a valid criterion of judgmjnt
                            whereby to distinguish true frcm false revelation. Any spirit coming to us, who does not
                            acknowledge fealty to the doctrines and revelation of the church of Christ's Second
                            Appearing, is to be instructed if it will listen, but not hearkened to as a messenger of
                            Divine knowledge. Whatever his age, name, or pretensions, such spirit is from Hades, and his
                            claims may safe'y be judged by the same rule that we judge a stranger in the body. That is,
                            by the law of Christ in his church, and the testimony of his witnesses. If they speak not
                            according to this, there is no light of the Divine life in them. It may be supposed an
                            objection to the fore-going, that a false church, or a school of philosophy adopting
                            erroneous standards, may proceed in like manner to suppress truth which cannot be construed
                            agreeably to their false or imperfect criterion?*. But this supposed objection is not real,
                            since no counterfeit can invalidate its original, and a false church is clearly by its
                            fruits, distinguished from the true and focal center of Divine light to the world. Mt.

                                incentives to a life of self-denial and the cross. Through the buoyancy of hope we see
                                and hear the anticipated glories of the millennial age. Some are already stepping over
                                the threshold into the house of many mansions and can hear the songs of victory which so
                                unerringly proclaim a thousand years of peace ; can see the oncoming hosts who have laid
                                their lives down, and now are cheerfully and zealously fighting the battles of the Lord,
                                while others, less fortunate are not permitted to see this glorious light that is to
                                illumine the whole world. The inspiration of this hope was signally voiced by the
                                apostle when the vision of the church of Christ burst upon his mind, and he saw it in
                                transcendent glory, not having spot or wrinkle, but holy, and without blemish. Some in
                                visions equally beautiful, have seen the companies of the redeemed, whose robes have
                                been washed to whiteness, whose songs were those of praise, and whose lives were of
                                thanksgiving and joy, dwelling in the beauty of holiness. In the culmination of all
                                these prophesies, looking toward the blissful future where the knowledge of the Lord
                                shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea, and when righteousness will be
                                established in the souls of men, making the kingdoms of this world, the kingdoms of our
                                Lord. This pleasant illustration of the millennium, made beautiful by so many spiritual
                                blessings and then so freely proffered to us for our acceptance, can be obtained only
                                upon the fulfillment of certain conditions. The kingdoms of our Lord are to be in this
                                world, among men, and to claim an heirship one must do no less than did the apostle when
                                he said, "I glory not, save in the cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ, by which I am
                                crucified to the world and the world to me." It is a contest against all the elements of
                                a sinful life. A spiritual warfare to obtain a victory over our own personal enemies.
                                The millennium can come, only as souls establish the principles of the life of Christ
                                among men. Selfishness must give place to that which is higher and better. " Not my
                                will, but thine, 0 God, be done." All that a man hath must be consecrated to the service
                                of God, yea, and even his whole life. If the New Jerusalem is to come down from God out
                                of heaven and God is to dwell with men and they are to be his people, then we ought to
                                have some thought about the order and government<pb n="161" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> that is to be
                                exercised in this new, spiritual home. We might suppose it would be godly, full of mercy
                                and loving kindness, and those who may choose to accept a residence in this heavenly
                                abode, must become of this same order of mind. Men who are under the direct, daily
                                government of God, may be expected to be filled with the '' wisdom that comes from
                                above, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good traits." It is not honorable
                                to accept a leader, an acknowledged Savior, and then neglect to follow him, as he
                                carefully conducts us away from the snares and pitfalls that are found so near the path
                                in which we are expected to travel. We very well know that he will walk in the way of
                                righteousness and peace, and our promise demands that we should cheerfully bear him
                                company on the heavenly journey. Beautiful promises are held out for our acceptance
                                which assures to us an hundred fold of every earthly blessing for our happiness and
                                comfort on our pilgrimage through this life, and then bears to us this greater promise,
                                "In the world to come, eternal life." The story of the selfish man, so well illustrated
                                in Pilgrim's Progress, should afford us a worthy lesson. Giving his whole time to the
                                gathering of earthly treasures, he failed to look above his head, and see the angels
                                that were offering good and precious gifts to all who would accept them. Earthly hopes
                                and earthly loves were the treasures to be coveted, while that which was from above,
                                from God and from his ministering angels was allowed to pass unnoticed. This class was
                                evidently included when Jesus made the remark, "Verily, I say unto you, they have their
                                reward." They certainly have what they can obtain from the earth, but are unable to see
                                or to enter into the New Jerusalem, the spiritual abode of the sons and daughters of
                                God.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary.</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Bath!

                                        are suffered to accumulate, there the enemies of human health are gathered
                                        together, and plague and pestilence hold carnival. Nor does it matter whether
                                        the dirt consists of an exposure to decaying matter on the surface of the
                                        ground, or of an unwholesome or undrained pool, or whether it is distributed in
                                        unwashed parcels over the surface or in the pores of the human body. In the
                                        latter case it is rather more dangerous, since a thoroughly clean person may
                                        escape all injury from contagion, whereas a system not fortified by cleanliness
                                        is doubly liable to the attacks of disease. The majority of mankind, both in the
                                        city or country, are imperfectly washed. We know there are a great many who do
                                        not get a bath once a month, and we fear there are some who have never been
                                        thoroughly immersed. The consequences are found in a predisposition to disease.
                                        The unwashed skin is incapable of discharging its natural and healthy functions,
                                        and the stoppage or interrupted action of the deep pores in the skin, which
                                        throw so vast an amount of the waste of the system, develops and fosters every
                                        morbid tendency. This danger to health may not be palpable at first, but with
                                        each growing neglect of the means of cleanliness it becomes greater, until it is
                                        no longer possible to ward off the attacks of disease. The human family is
                                        large, but we have never heard that the supply of water is deficient for their
                                        wants. Indeed, nature seems to have taken special pains to distribute the
                                        health-giving fluid widely. Not satisfied<pb n="162" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> with piercing

                                        stolid to learn for ourselves. We are forced to realize that pure water with its

                                        the blessing and the glory, and War the curse and the disgrace of nations and
                                        mankind. They would see that Peace is always right, and War always wrong; they
                                        would see that any Peace to avoid any War is always infinitely better and more
                                        glorious than any War can be; they would see that to stand up meekly and firmly
                                        for Peace to loss of property, and even unto martyrdom, in the spirit that Jesus
                                        manifested all the way from Gethsemane to Calvary is always a holy offering to
                                        God; and to die voluntarily in War, for any cause, is to die entirely outside of
                                        the requirements and spirit of Christianity. It is vain to look for the day of
                                        millennial peace and love until the church, as one grand body, shall see that
                                        Peace is always right and War is always wrong, and that it is the duty of the
                                        church, as a body and as individuals, to "follow Peace with all men," be the
                                        temporal consequences what they may, ever keeping in mind that even defeat and
                                        suffering in Peace is immeasurably better and more glorious than the grandest
                                        triumph in War. The Christian has nothing to do with murderous weapons in
                                        maintaining or defending or overturning human governments. For such things let
                                        the unregenerate children of Adam fight and die, if they will. The Christian's
                                        mission on earth is like as was our Divine Master's : Peace and goodwill to all
                                        mankind. Blessed be God for the gift of a Savior so ineffably peaceful and
                                        lovely. Not a thread of military glory, so magnificent in the eyes of many who
                                        call themselves his followers, was woven into his seamless garment. The more the
                                        Christian studies meekly the character of Christ, the more he will see the
                                        beauty of his sublime title : "The Prince of Peace." Christians, do you wish, in

                                        your Savior�do you wish that he<pb n="163" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> would henceforth take the
                                        title: "The Prince of War?" No, you shudder at the thought. If such could be his
                                        character for the eternal future forever, vain would be all your hopes of Peace
                                        for time, of Peace for immortality. Let all our bo-oms bound with holy and
                                        eternal joy that Jesus is, and forever will be, " The Prince of Peace;" and let
                                        us all labor that he may be the Peace of all nations as well as individual
                                        souls. Let us move forward with the beautiful branch of Arbitration in the
                                        blessed name of philanthropy, praying that its precious " olive leaf" may be
                                        accepted gladly by all individuals, classes, and nations, as the healing for all

                                        Peace" be all the glory forever and ever. And when the banner of Arbitration
                                        shall wave in peaceful triumph over the world, then it may in truth be said the

                            unfilial posterity but as the ''chief of sinners?" Because of his sexual

                            non-celibate posterity, so deeply are they impressed with the enormity of the sin of their
                            primitive parents. He is not so worshiped by the celibate� Shakers. Peter and his
                            successors, the popes, down to Leo XIII., with all cardinals, Jesuits, and orders of monks
                            and nuns, have been the rulers of Christendom for ages, and were, professedly, all
                            celibates. Is there another man who wields an equal amount of power over the nations of
                            Christendom, that Leo, the celibate, wields? Were not Luther and Calvin sworn religious
                            celibates, like the rebellious Dr. McGlynn ? And his friend, Henry George, has only to
                            marry, to lose his power over the masses who worship the celibate Jesus. Cannot the
                            Protestants find food for thought in the above cited mighty historical facts ? Many
                            far-seeing people expect the Catholic hierarchy to steadily continue to gain the ascendency
                            of power in these United States as things are now going. Query�doe- not the secret of that
                            power consist in the principle of celibacy, so much cherished by the Catholic church, and
                            which the Protestants so fully endorse by their idolatrous worship of Jesus, the celibate?
                            Although Mary bore a son, by some thing or some one begotten, the Catholic is bound by the
                            church to believe her to be still a '�'�virgin Mary." What are Shakers but an order of
                            religious, scientific and intellectual celibates, who would unite all classes together in
                            the formation and support of a celibate secular government? As the Jews cherished and loved
                            the Essenes, so should all parties and all sects love and cherish the Shaker order, as the
                            friend of God and humanity. Build up, therefore, the shaker order, in its place, as the
                            kingdom of heaven upon earth. It is "not of this world" of generation ; it is what you have
                            all been praying for and desiring. It has come. Bless it; and unite with it, to create a
                            "White Cross" class of intellectual celibates, male and female, from which class, all civil
                            officers and legislators shall be chosen, to rule and govern the whole nation ; leaving the
                            married people at home, to do business of all<pb n="164" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> kinds, farming,
                            mechanical, mercantile ; and to take gool care of their families �"their own households."
                            These� like the Jews and Quakers�should learn to observe, and be ruled by, the same laws and
                            principles, iu propagating human beings, that they learn to observe in raising domestic
                            animals ; then their progeny would be fit for something better than "food for powder," or
                            butchers of human beiugs. Reduce things to order�now it is Babel. What is Law, Theology, or
                            even "Science," falsely so called, but confusion? We are in perpetual danger of war, from
                            one cause or another, by reason of the absence of woman as a peace-maker. And blessed are
                            the peace-makers ; they are children of God. Warriors are the children of the evil one ; war
                            is hell; devils only wage it. Napoleon, Wellington, Washington, Grant, have all denounced
                            war ; and they all knew that the more reckless and dare-devilish the men became, the better
                            soldiers they were. Then they would do what they were ordered, uninfluenced and unrestrained
                            by individual conscience or morality. What else but "White Cross" soldiers, would be
                            intellectual celibates? When divided into senates and houses of representatives� between
                            them, they would fight sexual sensuality, in and out of the marriage relation. Thus would
                            the axe of reform be put to the root of the national and society evils, which are preying
                            upon the very vitals of these United States, and of all other nations in what is called
                            Christendom. And "the work of righteousness would be peace, and the effect of peace would be
                            quietness and assurance forever." "There is no peace for the wicked, saith my God." "The
                            wicked are as the troubled sea, whose waters cannot rest." Could a better symbol of the
                            adulterous church and state governments of earth be found than the fathomless, restless
                            ocean? It is liable at a moment's notice to be violently agitated to an unknown depth by
                            storms that would roll its waters up mountain high. "Peace is as really taken from the
                            earth" as rest from the salt sea ! There may be a calm ; but what next? "Wars and rumors of
                            wars" are constant�never ending. White Cross celibate men and women will, like the celibate
                            Jesus and Ann, bring from the Christ-heavens the white-winged dove of peace. " Let us have
                            peace." Mt. Lebanon, N.

When
                            half way up, my strength failing, I feared I should never be able to reach the summit or get
                            back again. I well remember the help given by Arab hands, drawing me on farther; and the
                            step I could not quite make myself, because too great for my wearied frame, the little help
                            given me� sometimes more and sometimes less�enabled me to go up, step by step, step by step,
                            until at last I reached the top, and breathed the pure air and had a grand outlook from that
                            lofty height. And so, in life's journey, we are climbing. We are feeble. Every one of us,
                            now and then, needs a little help; a,nd if we have risen a step higher than some other, let
                            us reach down for our brother's hand and help him to stand beside us. And thus, joined hand
                            in hand, we shall go on conquering, step by step, until the glorious eminence shall be
                            gained. Ah, how many need help in this world!�poor, afflicted ones; poor, sorrowing ones;
                            poor, tempted ones, who have been overcome, who have been struggling, not quite able to get

                            despairing! Oh, give such a one help, a little kindly aid, and the step may be taken, and
                            another step may then be taken, and, instead of dying in wretchedness at the base, he may,

                                article. I think if you will study the English language that you will find it capable of
                                expressing all the ideas that you may have. I have always found it so and in all that I
                                have written, I do not recall an instance when I was tempted to use a foreign word, but
                                that on searching, I found a better one in my own language. Be simple, unaffected, be
                                honest in your speaking and writing. Never use a long word when a short one will do.
                                Call a spade, a spade, not a well known oblong instrument of manual industry, let a home
                                be a home, not a residence, a place, not a locality and so of the rest. When a short
                                word will do, you always lose by using a long one. You lose in clearness, you lose in
                                honest expression of your meaning, and in the estimation of all men who are competent to
                                judge, you lose in reputation for ability. The only true way to shine, even in this
                                false world, is to be modest and unassuming. Falsehood may be a very thick crust, but in
                                the course of time truth will find a place to break through. Elegance of language may
                                not be in the power of all of us, but simplicity and straight forwardness are. Write
                                much as you would speak, speak as you think. If with your inferior speak no coarser than
                                usual, if with your superior speak no finer. Be what you say and within the rules of
                                prudence. No one ever was a gainer by singularity of words or in pronunciation. Tiie
                                truly wise man will so speak, that no one will observe how he speaks. A man may show
                                great knowledge of chemistry by carrying about bladders of strange gasses to breathe,
                                but he will enjoy better health and find more time for business who lives on common air.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bryant, William C."

GOOD INVESTMENTS.
The original investors in Bi 1 Telephone stock
are considered fortunate because the value of it has
increased ten-fold. It was no doubt, a verv pleasant surprise to them, but they could not express
their satisfaction in more earnest words than do the
purchasers of �� Plain Home Talk and Medical
Cemmon Sense," hundreds of whom write that it
is worth from ten to one hundred times its cost. An
editor writes : " It contains more of v lue than any
book on my shelves." A physician writes: " It is
without doubt the best and most interesting book I
eve-consulted." Here is a chance to invest $1.50
for something that you will soon find will rise in
value, and be worth many times its cost. It is especially interesting to those just married or about
to be, and to poisons "who enjoy poor health.''
