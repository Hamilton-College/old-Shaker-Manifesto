                            visit Jabez Spencer in Stephentown, Mass., and return to NewLebanon on Saturday, Aug. 23,
                            1783. Mother Ann and the Elders, with a large company of Believers left the house of Nathan
                            Goodrich, to visit New Lebanon. They arrived at the residence of Israel Tolcott, who lived
                            on the mountain between New Lebanon and Hancock, a short time before noon. Abigail, the
                            mother of a small family, was preparing the dinner, when Mother Ann said to her,� "Abigail,
                            we shall all dine with you today." "And I will arrange accordingly," said Abigail, "and
                            enlarge the supply of food." "Nay," said Mother," "there will be a great plenty." Between
                            thirty and forty persons were provided with food that day and were satisfied. Abigail was
                            greatly astonished that so many people were fed upon so small a quantity of food. The EHers
                            then passed on to David Shapley's and made a short call, and then to the house of John
                            Bishop in New Lebanon. At this time was fulfilled the prophecy which Mother Ann had made to
                            John, several years before this date, and while she was in the prison in Albany. It was a
                            joyful day to John. Mother Ann walked through the house from room to room, singiug a song of
                            joy and blessing. The next morning Mother Ann asked John if he had any suitable place on his
                            farm where they could hold a meeting. "There will be," said she, "many more people here than
                            you can accomodate in your house." "Yea," replied John, "we will have the meeting in the
                            orchard." It was estimated that some four hundred people were present. A piece was sung by
                            Elder Wm. Lee, and the Believers enjoyed a beautiful season, in which was manifested the
                            spirit of God in a gentle, inward power and gift. Amos Rathburn asserts that he realized a
                            great outpouring of the spirit of<pb n="74" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> God. He saw with clearness the sad
                            state of the children of men, and the gift of salvation that was offered by the gospel. He
                            warned all against losing the day of their visitation. Elder James came forward and said,
                            "My name is James AVhittaker. I have prayed for you, my friends, as earnestly as ever I
                            prayed for my own soul." He then spoke of the sinful state of man, and of the necessity of a
                            restoration through Christ, in order to find salvation and redemption, now offered through
                            the medium of the gospel. "The time has fully come," said he, "according to the prophecy,
                            for Christ to make his second appearance for the redemption of man, and we are the
                            witnesses, through whom Christ has manifested himself in this day. The only means of
                            salvation that will ever be offered to a lost world, is to confess and forsake their sins,
                            take up the cross and follow Christ in the regeneration." He also spoke of the necessity of
                            believing in these messengers whom God had sent, and declared that the only way that they
                            could find the will of God, was to find it in the followers of Christ. This was the way,
                            according to the scriptures, that God manifested Himself to the ancients and that it was as
                            much so at the present time. Father James spoke of humility and self-abasement. '' You
                            cannot blame me for abasing myself." He declared the great riches he had found by the
                            gospel, and the awful consequences that would follow those who rejected the day of their
                            visitation. Elder Joseph Meacham and Calvin Harlow, made a few remarks in confirmation of
                            the work of God. The power of the holy Spirit was very great and the evidences of the
                            testimony clear. Every mouth was stopped, and every tongue became dumb, and the assembly
                            appeared as though arraigned before the bar of judgment. The Believers went forth in the
                            worship of God with power and with spiritual gifts. There was no one to molest them or to
                            make them afraid. At the close of the service food was prepared for the Brethren and Sisters
                            and for a large number of strangers. At the suggestion of Mother Ann, John Bishop gave a
                            general invitation to all present, to accept of his hospitality. Sixty persons were soon
                            seated, and all amply supplied as had been done for the Believers. It was estimated that
                            some two hundred people had been furnished with food. Concerning this visit, John gave the
                            following statement. u I evidently felt the blessing of God rest upon my house and upon all
                            that I possessed. Though the temporal blessings are the least, and were at this time, yet as
                            they are evidences of the good fountain from whence they flowed I shall insert some of them
                            in particular. " There were about forty persons in the company that came with Mother Ann,
                            and nearly all came on horseback. The horses were turned into a field that contained ten
                            acres. At first I thought my feed would soon be gone, but concluded not to be over anxious,
                            as I had the privilege of entertaining Mother Ann and the Elders. These horses and four cows
                            remained in the field from Saturday P. M. till Monday noon following.<pb n="75" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> "
                            The same day after they were taken out, I went to see the field, and as strange as it may
                            seem, it was as fresh and as green as though a creature had not been in it fora week. "
                            Although the company had been amply supplied with milk for drink, the dairy did not show the
                            loss, as there was as much butter made as usual. ''These things may appear impossible but I
                            feel confident that they were effected by the same power as that which fed the five
                            thousand." Mother Ann and the Elders now visited several families of Believers, among whom
                            were Hezek:ah Hammond, George Darrow and Reuben Wright. A meeting was held in Reuben's house
                            and the Believers were blest with wonderful power and zeal. Mother Ann while kneeling,
                            addressed the people present.� " God created my soul in innocence, but by sinning against
                            his holy commandments, I was defiled and made unholy in his sight. While I was in this sad
                            state, God was pleased to call me by the gospel of our Savior, Jesus Christ. By the gift of
                            the holy Spirit I was made able to see and feel the depth of my loss, and by this same power
                            I was helped to travel out of it. "When I was despised and afflicted by my enemies, thou O
                            God, didst comfort me ! When cruel persecutors rose against me, and put me in prison or in a
                            dungeon, thou didst stretch forth thy hand for my deliverance. "I thank thee, O Father! Lord
                            of heaven and earth, for the revelation of our Savior, Jesus Christ, which has shown to me
                            the depth of man's loss, and the way of recovery by the gospel. '' I crossed the great
                            waters with a little company, through many dangers and perils, and by the miraculous power
                            of God, we arrived safely in this land. God has supported us by his special grace under all
                            trials and afflictions, and given us strength and fortitude to stand in defense of the
                            truth. "We thank thee, O God, for raising up so great a people in this land. Thou hast made
                            us able to plant the gospel in the hearts of many, who now through love, glorify thy name.
                            We pray God protect and strengthen thy chosen people, and keep them from all evil." Mother
                            Ann and the Elders then visited the family of Josiah Skiuner, where they held a meeting. It
                            was a demonstration of great joy and not uncommon at this date, for those who had been
                            baptized into the faith of the gospel, to shout and sing as they were journeying from town
                            to town. It was the day of glad tidings and they were anxious for all to hear them. While at
                            the residence of John Spier, a mob surrounded the house and demanded admittance. They used
                            much threatening and abusive language and at length burst open the door and entered the
                            dwelling. No farther violence was attempted and after they had made all the threats of abuse
                            that their wicked minds could suggest, they departed and the Believers retired to rest. A
                            visit was made to the residence of Nathan Farrington by the urgent invitation of the family.
                            As a meeting had been anticipated, a large company of Believers had assembled, but Elder
                            William remarked.�"As the house is not large enough for the people to serve God in, we had
                            better go into the field." Some of the people who were present<pb n="76" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> thought
                            Farrington was very foolish to allow such a body of people to enter his field and ruin the
                            crop of grass. But Nathan was full of faith and only made answer, "You will see."� To the
                            disappointment, however, of many who were present, more grass was obtained from the field
                            than for many years of previous date. Mother Ann and the Elders next visited Jabez Spencer
                            of Stephentown. On Sabbath morning Capt. Ichabod Turner informed the Elders that a mob was
                            gathering, but it would take several days for them to form into companies. The Elders said
                            they expected to leave the place on Monday morning. Several ruffianly characters, however,
                            came on the Sabbath and maliciously struck some of the Brethren, but Jabez put the rioters
                            out of the house and they offered no further violence. A large body of people attended the
                            religious service. Some of the company manifested an opposition to the work and charged
                            Mother Ann and the Elders with being deceivers and false prophets. Elder James Whittaker in
                            preaching, introduced his discourse with these words,� "O full of all subtilty and all
                            misqhief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness. Wilt thou not cease to

TEIform="persName"/>Oliver C. Hampton.</byline><p TEIform="p">A DEAR friend, for what purpose I am not informed, has lately requested me to write an
                            article on the above subject Love is one of the dual principles or elements of the Heavenly
                            Father and Mother, the other being Wisdom or Intelligence. In these two are contained every
                            variety of virtue, every possible or conceivable good in Heaven and Earth, into whatsoever
                            names they may be divided, such as Purity, Honesty, Grace, Kindness, etc., etc. Love and
                            Righteousness stand to each other therefore, in the relation of cause and effect. The first
                            is principle, the second practice. If I can by any means develop in my spirit the love of
                            God, of Jesus, of Mother, as a well of water springing up into everlasting life, I shall not
                            be in the least afraid but that all my actions will culminate in righteousness. This is my
                            desire above all things on this earth and the only sublime desideratum in my estimation
                            which makes existence worth having. I think that unequivocal obedience to the visible Order
                            or anointing of the Church, established by our gracious infinite Father and Mother, and in
                            accordance with the great law of the Universe enunciated by Saint Paul (viz.,) "Without all
                            contradiction, the less is blest of the better," is the only safe and sure path to travel,
                            in the attainment of true and eternal righteousness, purity and all the virtues. For this,
                            obedience subdues the unregenerate man within the limits of God's mercy and love, while as
                            it seems to me, nothing else will. But, O, what a tremendous selfsacrifice it is to learn to
                            love our enemies.<pb n="77" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Still I believe it possible, because I have to some
                            extent attained unto this most precious giftWhen I was quite a young man I was at work in a
                            Brickyard. We hung our clean clothes on one side of a little shanty and our fatigue dresses
                            on the other. One young chap amongst us proceeded to hang his soiled clothes with our clean
                            ones. I requested him to remove them to the opposite side, in what I thought was a kind
                            Christian spirit. He refused, and when he left the shanty I removed the -aid offending
                            garments to their proper place. This incensed him and he wrought upon me a very summary
                            retaliation. O how very angry and wicked I felt for a moment! But the next moment I thought
                            of Christ and his life, spirit and precepts ; and here, now, thought I is an excellent
                            chance to prove my sincerity and also the efficacy of love and frank forgiveness. So I
                            treated the young Brother with even more softness and courtesy of manner than ordinary. The
                            moment I resolved on this, forgiveness flowed to him like a river and I had nothing in the
                            world against him. After two or three days he could stand it no longer, but came and humbly
                            asked my forgiveness. I told him I had nothing to forgive, that I had forgiven him three
                            minutes after the offence was committed. Said he, "Nothing would have reached my case only
                            your uniform kindness since the difficulty arose. That was more than I could stand."
                            Hereupon perfect union was permanently restored, and ever since that scene I have tried very
                            hard to carry out that most benign principle of Christian love and forgiveness. This I call
                            one form at least of practical righteousness. "He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God and
                            God in him." What greater boon can we possibly possess than this unspeakable blessing of
                            Christian love flowing out in all directions, in acts, words and thoughts of practical
                            righteousness? From a long experience I feel as if I could recommend all and especially the
                            young to sell all they have and buy this diadem of inimitable glory and beauty. Union

                            John, viii., 12. I will extend the text and say : he that folioweth me not, shall walk in
                            darkness. In my former discourse on Theology I endeavored to show man's true relation to
                            God. To-day, I purpose to show his duty to Him, but there is nothing in which mankind differ
                            so much as in what God requires of them ; this seems to necessitate that something should be
                            said on this part of theology. For the external world, man's duties to God are summarized in
                            the Decalogue ; but the great Ecclesiast puts them all in a nutshell, saying: "Fear God and
                            keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work
                            into judgment with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." Eccl.
                            xii., 13, 14. No better counsel nor warning can be given to the world outside of God's
                            Kingdom, either civilized or barbarian than this; which means obey the high-<pb n="78" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> est dictates of conscience, being your own judge. This is confirmed by the
                            apostle. " In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted with
                            him." Acts x., 35. But acceptance is not redemption, this is obtained only in one way, and
                            that is to find the Order which God has established in his kingdom on earth and to accept
                            and live in accordance with the same ; but the very best that any can do outside of this,
                            and on the lower plane of life, either professor or profane, is to walk in darkness and be
                            liable to stumble at every step they take ; yet they are justified and accepted while
                            obeying their highest light, because in this they are doing their duty to God, and while
                            this is continued they will be in the ascendant, rising and drawing nearer to God, by whose
                            inspiration they will continue to be enlightened. But if they do not, they will recede from
                            Him and lose his blessing. All history from the creation to the present day bears witness to
                            this truth�beginning with Adam and Eve who lost Eden by their disobedience to the light that
                            God had given them. So it has been ever since with every human being and with all nations
                            and people and will be so to and through Eternity. "This is the condemnation, that light has
                            come into the world." Johniii., 19, showing past errors and present duties and will continue
                            until we find Him who said as in the text�"I am the light of the world and he that followeth
                            me shall not walk in darkness," and hence will stumble no more. He it is of whom the voice
                            of God said: '' This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased." Matt, iii., 17. This
                            person then was and is the God-Anointed head of his established Order for the redemption of
                            man, and was the first that ever walked the earth, who was moved in all he said an^ did by
                            the God-di ected spirit, depending nothing on the intellect, and never made a blunder. But
                            see how it is with the outside world where intellect rules, the brain in triumph, the heart
                            in mourning, their spirits asleep and buried in their graves as they were at the time of
                            Christ's resurrection, after which (we are not told how long after,) being awakened by the
                            resurrection, the sleeping saints arose, not a lot of bodies of flesh and blood that was not
                            there, coming up through holes in the ground as �,he blind guides teach, but the Saints who
                            had been sleeping as to Christ's spiritual work were awakened by his resurrection. Some
                            sleeping Saints now ha\ e need of such an awakening coming over them or they may be
                            swallowed up in the sleep of death. How often do we hear it said : "O that God would send
                            into his Ziou sonr- cultured intellects who are competent to lead and build up Zion, I am
                            weary of the hedge and ditch comers. " Is this prayer of the Spirit or intellect? Do not the
                            hedge and ditchers need redemption as much as the cultured? Intellect cannot lead to God ;
                            if all withic his kingdom on earth were spiritual minded, led and governed by the Spirit,
                            all would be life and peace, his Zion would blossom as the rose and flourish as a
                            well-watered garden. But without the spiritual mind and the child spirit, the cultivated
                            intellect would be the worse accession of the two. So our duty is to labor for the spiritual
                            mind and all other things necessary will be added, and God will prosper Zion and all will be
                            satisfied with his goodness. If Zion is to depend on intellect, then<pb n="79" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> she
                            had better appeal to the world for wisdom and guidance, where the most cultivated intellects
                            are and ever will be found, greater even than Christ himself possessed. To become like him
                            who was tba light of the world and not walk in darkness our first duty is to cultivate the
                            spiritual. But I am told that I have quoted the philosopher John Locke on p. 69 of Shaker
                            Theology, who affirms that all inspiration should be subject to reason, the intellect being
                            the reasoner. This 1 consider to be true with all who live on the lower plane of
                            intellectual life where philosophers are mostly found ; ignoring the Spirit, they have no
                            means of judging, but philosophy and logic aud all walk in darkness. But in coming into
                            God's spiritual kingdom with Christ who is the light of the world at the head, the
                            conditions are reversed. Here is the sea of glass where the philosopher is on a level with
                            the child ; here his duty is to receive the child spirit, &gt;k become as a little child,"
                            ignoring his philosophy, and listen to the voice of the Spirit comiug from God through his
                            Order, no more to walk in darkness. Right here it may be asked: Is not the intellect a
                            God-giveu faculty to the human race? Surely it is. The same question may be asked of other
                            faculties ; procreation, for instance, is a Godgiveu faculty, and with the unenlightened
                            generative world who are ou the animal plane of life when properly used is uot wrong ; but
                            on the upper floor or Christ plane where the Angel life is to be lived our duty is to
                            crucify it with all its partial affections and lusts, but intellect with speech, hearing,
                            seeing, feeling, are to be kept in subordination to the Spirit; but if this is not done, all
                            the faculties become a curse instead of a blessing as the millions of murders, broken hearts
                            and suicides testify, yea the millions who wish they had never been born. But I am further
                            asked : Would not Christ have been better off" himself if he had paid more attention to
                            intellectual culture and secured house, home and property for himself and his little
                            community? Not at all, even though he, the good, the better and the best of earth,
                            plaintively said, '"The foxes have holes aud the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of
                            Man hath not where to lay his head." The time had not come for the establishment of communal
                            homes. This could not be made permanent until the Bride had "made herself ready" to care for
                            it. But it has come as predicted, "as a thief in the night," and although it has existed
                            more than one hundred years but few seem to know it. The keen prophetic eye of the Prophet
                            Isaiah saw it in the long distance and said: "They shall build houses and inhabit them, they
                            shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof. " Isa. Ixv., etc. This is now literally
                            fulfilled. Why is it not seen ? Because that wily, tortuous, conscienceless intellectual
                            Serpent has stolen into the garden and climbed the tree of knowledge and is now talking down
                            to man instead of woman and offering him the fruit of intellectual greatness, saying to him,
                            God knows you shall not surely die, but become as Gods, great in the earth to be envied by
                            Angels. By listening to this serpent, the world is more cursed to-day than were Adam aud Eve
                            in the garden of Eden. O yea, Moses was a little late in coming down from the mountain, and
                                what<pb n="80" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> did intellect do ? It made a golden calf to worship instead of
                            God and the whole world with little exception have been worshiping the golden calf from that
                            day to this. This is the effect of neglecting our duty to God and placing the affections on
                            the vanities of the world depriving ourselves of real happiness here and hope of heaven
                            here-after. But when Christ's fold is entered by the honest seeker after salvation, whether
                            he comes from the hedges or the mountain top, who desires relief to his sin-burdened soul,
                            he does not choose a position for himself, but, with all his brain power bowed down before
                            the Spirit, he will say, after confessing all his sins before God's Order ; here O Lord is
                            my all, my gold and my silver is now to me but as dung and dross, the redemption of my soul
                            and union with God's people is all I crave. If I can but be saved and have my sins blotted
                            out to be remembered no more, all else may go. I now thankfully accept the child spirit
                            demanded by Christ. Mould me as you will, I am as clay in the hand.; of the potter. I am
                            without will or judgment of my own they are taken from me as Christ's were, myself, my all I
                            here lay down on thy sacrificial Altar, never more to grieve the Spirit by permitting my
                            intellect to occupy the judgment seat. O nay, never. All such will be overcomers as Christ
                            was and shall sit with him on his throne as he overcame and sits with his Father on his
                            throne. South Union, Ky.</p></div2><div2 type="quote" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="On our knees is the fittest place to surrender our wills..." TEIform="index"/>

                            has espoused, either on the spiritual or material plane. As we are connected together, no'
                            for the cultivation of the sensual, but for the moral aul .spiritual, the former must be
                            denied by a rigid self-denial, to give place for the growth of the higher faculties. One of
                            the first commands of the spirit to the children of earth, was, "Thou shalt love the Lord
                            thy God, with all thy faculties and thy neighbor as thyself." To do this, must require of
                            the individual a deep coasecration of spirit in every part of their being. Watch as well as
                            labor, pray as well as think. It brings upon them a constant struggle to have the spiritual
                            or higher faculties, the governing power. And what will give to man or woman a more angelic,
                            dignified character. This love to man is the love of the Savior. It has for its neighbor no
                            jealous eye, no prejudiced heart. It leudeth a hand to the weak and feeble. It speaketh a
                            word of courage to the drooping spirit. It is ever strong and valiant for the right. When a
                            man or woman has traveled to the state of consecration that their property, small or great,
                            is immerged into the divine interest, and their purposes into the divine purpose, then their
                            individual labors will be immerged into the labors of Christ's kingdom. Into whatever place
                            we may be called to act, we should feel the necessity of self-devotion to the cause in which
                            we have enlisted, and thus feel the same interest to build up an earthly home as we do our
                            spiritual. True consecration is selling self for the good of our brother or sister. It looks
                            with charity upon the erring and judges them as thej wish to be judged. It is when the
                            brother is borne down by the burdens of life ; a loving voice spoken in teuderest of
                            feeling; Brother, can we assist you in your heavy burdens? It has the spirit to come up
                            boldly and take part in the duties of life. It ever feels for the public good and never can
                            and never will see any useful article, however small, wasted. The summing up of this noble
                            virtue is, '� Hands to work and heart to God."

No. 2.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Moseley, Daniel" TEIform="persName"/></byline><p TEIform="p">I visited Mother Ann and the Elders three times while they were at Harvard. I also saw them
                            at Ashfield, Richmond and Hancock, and always found in them the same spirit of meekness,
                            temperance, kindness and charity; and they maintained the same powerful testimony against
                            all sin and every evil work. Mother, indeed, abounded in the gifts of God, wherever she
                            went. She gave the people much good instruction in things spiritual and temporal, exhorted
                            them to put their hands at work and their hearts to God ; to pay all their just debts and
                            rectify their wrongs, and to be kind and charitable to the poor. She instructed the Sisters
                            in their duty, to manage their family affairs with prudence, neatness and good economy ; to
                            bring up their children in the fear of God and set good examples before them, to<pb n="82" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> dress and prepare their food in good order, that when their Brethren came in
                            from their hard work, they might bless them, aud be able to kneel down together and give
                            thanks to God. Great multitudes of Believers assembled in all the places where Mother Ann
                            and the Elders visited, and were taught and instructed by them ; while many of the wicked
                            gathered round, full of persecuting venom, stirring up "lewd fellows of the baser sort," to
                            beat and abuse them for their faith, and belch out their oaths and blasphemies against
                            Mother Ann and the Elders, and accuse them of drunkenness, witchcraft aud all manner of
                            evil. These afflictions they had to suffer, more or less, in most of the places where they
                            went to visit those who had embraced their testimony ; but they always bore them patiently,
                            and often kneeled down aud prayed for their persecutors, that God would forgive them ;
                            because they knew not what they were doing. When Mother Ann and the Elders first arrived in
                            New Lebanon, from Hancock, they stopped at John Bishop's, where they tarried from Saturday
                            till Monday. Here they spent the Sabbath and held a public meeting ; and the assembly of
                            Believers and strangers was so great that the meeting was held in the orchard. Elder James
                            delivered a very powerful discourse on the subject of humiliation. He was followed by Elder
                            Joseph Meacham, Calviu Harlow and others, who spoke with great power of God. After speaking,
                            the Believers went forth and worshiped God in singing and dancing. The exercises were solemn
                            and powerful, and the numerous company of spectators were very attentive, and went away
                            peaceably, without committing any act of outrage. Mother Ann spent more than a week in New
                            Lebanon and Stephentown. During this time she visited a number of families of the Believers,
                            who received much ^ood instruction from her, and enjoyed many Opportunities with her in
                            worshiping and praising God. But the wicked, who were continually plotting mischief, at
                            length raised a great mob and dragged her before Eleazer Grant, under a pretense of trial
                            for disturbance. This was a mere mock-trial, instigated by the spirit of persecution, and in
                            which cruel abuse was the disorder of the day, and it was carried to a shameful extent,
                            without auy color of law. I was an eye witness of the scenes of that day, aud saw the
                            transactions of the mob, from beginning to end. Mother was shamefully aud shockingly abused
                            and Elder James had several of his ribs broken, and many of the Believers suffered badly.
                            But as others have given a particular and correct account of these transactions, 1 shall
                            pas?s them over, by only remarking that the spite aud malice of the wicked seemed to be
                            leveled against Mother, whom they falsely charged with all manner of evil but I had
                            sufficient opportunity to find out the character of Mother Ann and the Elders not only from
                            my own personal knowledge and observation, but from the codstant intercourse kept up with
                            them by great numbers of my friends and acquaintances for more than four years. After Mother
                            Ann and the Elders left New Lebanon, I visited them several times at Watervliet; and always
                            found the same testimony against all wickedness, and the same upright and godly example in
                            all their conduct. The truth is, Mother Ann had the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ
                            given her to search<pb n="83" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> out all the crooked windings of the serpent, and
                            all the deceit of the devil, which has been so craftily diffused into the nature of man ;
                            and she was thereby able to rend that glossy coveriug which, like a mantle, they have spread
                            over their works of concupiscence. By this means she was enabled to unmask all the base and
                            unclean desires and deceitful wantonness of both male and female, and detect all those
                            alluring charms of lust by which they entice and deceive each other. She declared these
                            shameful gratifications to be the cause of all those base and wicked abominations which
                            corrupted the human race, and filled the earth with deceit, hypocrisy, fraud, knavery,
                            covetousness, injustice, theft, robbery, dissipation, idleness, contention and strife ; and
                            from whence proceed hatred, envy, jealousy and murder among individuals, and war and
                            bloodshed, destruction and rapine among nations. " These things," said she, "-are the fruits
                            of the flesh, which bring distress and poverty, shame and disgrace upon families and
                            individuals, and fill the earth with wretchedness and misery." And according to her
                            testimony, they are doomed to everlasting condemnation. But those who willingly bear the
                            cross of Christ, and endure the purifying fire of Zion, which purifies the soul, will be
                            crowned with everlasting salvation. The wricked hated that testimony, which struck so
                            powerfully against their iniquitous practices and they could not endure it. Indeed Mother's
                            testimony was ofteu so powerful as to make sinners tremble in her presence, like a leaf in
                            the wind. Yet the wicked would belie her most shamefully, as though she had been guilty of
                            their own abominations, and they had lived in innocence ! But if any are able to believe
                            that pure streams of water can flow from a corrupt and filthy fouutain, that a poisonous
                            tree can yield good fruit, or that grapes are the natural fruit of thorn-bushes, and figs
                            grow on thistles, then they are welcome to believe all the ridiculous and inconsistent
                            reports that are abroad in the world concerning Mother Ann and her followers. All who are
                            acquainted with this Society will readily admit that the fruits of it are good, and are
                            firmly established in good works ; and yet many will insist, and affect to believe, that its
                            principles are wrong, that they originated in error, and of course that we are built on a
                            false foundation. How unreasonable and inconsistent, not to say downright foolish, such
                            opinions must appear to every rational and reflecting mind ! and are not good grapes the
                            best proof in favor of the good vine that bore them? and when the branches flourish and
                            yield good fruit, then v\ e know the root is sound and good. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. 1826.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Tapestry weavers" TEIform="index"/>THE TAPESTRY WEAVERS

                                    From the ways of the tapestry wearers on the other side of the sea. Above their
                                    heads the pattern hangs, they study it with care. The while their fingers deftly
                                    work, their eyes are fastened there. They tell this curious thing, besides, of the

                                    weaver is, no tongue but his own can tell. The years of man are the looms of God,
                                    let down from the place of the sun, Wherein we are weaving always till the mystic
                                    web is done. Weaving blindly, but weaving surely, each for himself his fate; We may
                                    not see how the right side looks, we can only weave and wait; But, looking above for
                                    the pattern, no weaver need have fear. Only let him look clear into heaven�the
                                    perfect pattern is there. If he keeps the face of our Savior, forever and always in

                                    when his task is ended, and the web is turned and shown, He shall hear the voice of
                                    the Master, it shall say to him : " Well done!" And the white-winged angels of

                            sacred, yet simple resolve. But, what is it to be good? When the great ocean-waves lay
                            quietly upon its bosom, and the ship sails along undisturbed, leaving in its wake a stream
                            of rainbow-light, does it test the seaman's skill ? If he cowardly deserts the burning deck,
                            or seeks to flee the wrecking craft regardless of the safety of his passengers and crew, is
                            that true manliness ? does it indicate courage ? Does he who runs from battle, or seeks

                            euJist in the cause? or when retired upon the camping-ground is real character exhibited ?
                            We think not. When we dip the oars of circumstance into the shining waters of life, and the
                            tide of condition runs smoothly, our real worth and capabilities are not tested ; but, if
                            amid the turbulent storms of trial we ride safely aud direct our course wisely, we shall
                            triumph in the pleasure and victory of noble action. To be truly and positively good, is to
                            maintain the power of right doing in the face of all contrary and opposing influences ; to
                            resist temptations wheu they are presented ; to bear with patience the vexations and crosses
                            that appear in our way. It is easy and pleasant to sing of pain, sorrow, or triumph, when no
                            cause for them exists ; occasion makes the man, not the want of it, without it he is not
                            proved. Dr. Chapin said, "Goodness consists not in the outward things we do, but the inward
                            thing we are. To be is the great thing." True, but the exterior will indicate the interior.

                            proof of its divinity ; it is simply a negative being, until the realities of its oncoming
                            years stamp their impress and make it what it finally becomes. At one time Jesus said,
                            "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of<pb n="85" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> heaven." These words appear to refer, first, to those of tender years,
                            before their course was turned the downward way, and their lives ripened in sin, they might
                            be led in righteous and heavenly ways, and their faculties trained for goodly purposes. The
                            Chinese spoke with wisdom when he said, "As the twig is bent the tree's inclined;'" and
                            again, his words may have been to those of mature yet childlike, simple and teachable minds,
                            who had conquered the vain ambitions of their inward beings, acknowledged the folly of pride
                            and vanity, and brought into subordination the evil passions and propensities of their
                            natural lives. Gold is not pure until refined, neither is the human mind until cleansed by
                            the spirit of Christ. On the mount it was said, �' Blessed are the pure iu heart. Blessed
                            are the peace-makers," those who maintained harmony when combativeness was aroused ; and
                            they shall see God who neither taste nor handle the unclean thing ; not the frail infant,
                            the imbecile, ignorant nor negative, but the thoughtful comprehensive and responsible being,
                            who knows God and evil apart; who maintains the standard of right as revealed to his or her
                            inner consciousness. Let uone be too great or too proud to make known their good, wise and
                            lofty intentions, and when failing in their actual and continual fulfillment, be not
                            discouraged, but press for the goal of perfection. Laurels are not won without conflict, nor
                            crowns without crosses, nor clean raiment without toil. It is an all glorious achievement to
                            be really good. Tennyson accepts the truth in these words, " Howe'er it be, it seems to me
                            'Tis only noble to be good ; Kind hearts are more than coronets, And simple faith than
                            Norman blood." Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="This was the petition of Solomon, the wisest of kings" TEIform="index"/>

                            kings, when in a dresim God said, "Ask what I shall give unto thee. "�It is not stated in
                            the divtee record that Solomon's answer was hesitatingly given, though it is consistent for
                            us to imagine that through the youthful mind there passed iu rapid succession, visions of
                            earthly pomp and splendor, wealth and fame, yet his innate regard for the Divinity above and
                            the divinity within, with a noble humility of heart, rendered his aspirations of a loftier
                            character than mere considerations of self. Though young, he seemed to realize that all
                            earth could give, would not fit him for the leadership of Israel. His mind having been
                            religiously cultivated and prepared, was able to turn from all minor worldly interests, and
                            ask for an understanding heart. Are we not, dear readers, at some period of our lives, in
                            the same mental position with Solomon of old ? I think so. The Savior has said, "Ask and it
                            shall be given unto you, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you." To
                            Solomon then was given the gift of his choice. Shall we be as wise in our decision, is the
                            question ; and what shall we say when the spirit of God meets us with, "Ask what I shall
                            give unto thee ? " Will the baubles of earthly wealth, the fsinsel of fashionable
                            attainments charm us, or shall fading beauty or that bubble, Fame, so engross our interest

                                interesting. I wish we could have them continued, and more of them. An account of the
                                spiritual, and more private labors and meetings, if such could be had, I think would be
                                very instructive. It has been recorded that some of the religious services of the first
                                Believers could be heard for a distance of three miles. I should very much like the
                                particulars of some of those meetings. We all know that principles never change. "That
                                which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit, and
                                these are contrary the one to the other." Will there ever be any process by which flesh
                                can be converted to spirit ? Will the lusts of the flesh and of the mind ever be
                                destroyed in soul and body by any other way, than by self-denial and the cross of Christ
                                and hating and warring them in battles of shaking? So long as the world, the flesh and
                                the devil are in any human soul, shall we not ueed a baptism of the Spirit to overcome
                                them? If the spirit enters the soul, "where the elements of the world are, will there be
                                auything but war, till one or the other triumphs? "Think not that 1 came to bring peace"
                                to the earth in your soul; " I tell you nay, but a sword. " "If any man come to me, and
                                hate not his father and mother and wife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and
                                his'own life also, he cannot be my disciple." Is not hatred and war admissible in the
                                kingdom of heaven ? Is it not the baptism of the holy Spirit, the fire from heaven, the
                                indignation and wrath of God and the hate of Christ, ths means, and the only means
                                whereby the soul is prepared for the divine element, love ? "By their fruits ye shall
                                kuow them." Has not every Society of Believers had more or less experience with souls,
                                that were perfect in their own eyes and filled with love�lust? They would soon want to
                                minister to Believers, a perfection in generation, and teach them to bring forth a holy
                                perfected offspring. Can there be a greater abomination in the house of God than this ?
                                Could a greater man of sin be found to sit-in the temple oi God? I hope that we shall
                                never be ashamed of our glorious name, nor of the power of God and baptism of the holy
                                Spirit that gives to us a just claim to the name. May The Manifesto be heard many miles

                                from Louis B. iu Nov. No. fairly made my heart jump with delight. I felt like extending
                                my hand across the Continent with a hearty grasp. Well done etc. The right and truthful
                                spirit is there. Would ;-7ou could spare a score of fully matured souls to carry the
                                light over to this coast. Nowhere in the world is there a people with such few bigoted
                                isms as here. The gospel was established in the east while general society was yet in a
                                formative state and the majority of men wore broad brimmed white felt hats as they do
                                here now. We are in that formative state here, only people are more enlightened and
                                ready to receive anything that promises progress and a higher better way of living than
                                they were then. -No prejudices here except against iguorance and dogmatic religious
                                cant. O for more such faithful souls as I can mention, tc form a nucleus and a seed that
                                would promise a growth like the giant trees we have here. It is yet time to light other
                                candles from a flickering one. Success here would more than doubly ensure your revival
                                in the east. It would repopulate your partially neglected lands with the best, and the
                                universal cry of "They're dying out"twould disappear like a puff of smoke in the evening
                                air. Since I have been here I have answered numerous queries about the Shakers and have
                                chased away many a cobweb of misunderstandiug. Fully one half of the population is
                                celibate from choice and as population nearly doubles every generation, their numbers
                                must necessarily increase. They are mostly under the impression that the Shakers are a
                                trembling, paralytic, semiidiotic helpless old people, Free lovers or a kind of Mormons.
                                I would think the full title "Shakers of evil" (angelic social) or some title in one or
                                two words that would express the real soul of their battles would drive away these false
                                impressions. The word "Believers" covers all mankind and has no specific meaning. In my
                                wanderings over the world, In my moments of greatest unrest. By the sorrows of being
                                depressed, I still yearn for the purest and best. With the flag'of my freedom unfurled.
                                Or with peace of the mind I am blessed, If the wealth of the earth I possessed, I would
                                yearn for the sweetest and best. From my spirit all evil I've hurled, And I've set all
                                my passions at rest; And of all the beliefs I've addressed The angelic and social is
                                best. I expect to meet all the friends I have made, in the east again if not here at

                                earnestly for a life of righteousness, and for the kingdom of God, which was the great
                                mission of Christ to his disciples, and why thought strange that they should at the same
                                time work as carefully for the health of the body. The divine approval of the work of
                                Creation, and in particular after the creation of man, should not be lost from sight, as
                                it was '�'�very good." If man had been as careful to keep to the standard as at first
                                manifested, as he was active at a later date to " seek out many inventions" perhaps he
                                might have been a much better representative of the gift of God than he now is. For a
                                long period of time the best interests of both body and soul were sadly neglected, and
                                an animal existence, in common with other classes in creation, was the only absorbing
                                object in life. This "very good," as Adam the son of God was said to be, at the time
                                when he appeared in Eden, must have become singularly transformed to very had when he
                                became a wanderer in the world and descended to the level of an omniverous animal. Since
                                that date many changes have occurred. Some races have gradually arisen to a more
                                civilized state and to better moral conditions, while others have scarcely passed above
                                the plane of the animal creation. It is anything but pleasant to bear witness of the
                                life which man has sometimes led. Blest as he is, by the goodness of God, with the
                                ability to become an angel, while on the earth, and to establish a home wherein should
                                dwell righteousness and peace, it quite too often happens that he is only able to govern
                                by force of arms, and by crude dominating passions. The march for the race, however, is
                                onward and upward, and probably will be till all the kingdoms of this world "become the
                                kingdoms of our Lord," and until peace on earth and good-will to all men and women, is
                                permanently established in the heart. Quite early in the history of the race, societies
                                for reformation were formed. Man could plead his case before a judge and justice was
                                awarded to him. A better system of religious worship was established, and the subject of
                                dietetics was brought forward. The "very good" began to assert itself and those who had
                                been buried more or less under an accumulation of violence, evil imaginations and lust,

                                anticipate better things.<pb n="89" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> Enoch, it is said, walked with God ; Noah
                                was perfect in his observance of law, and Abraham instituted a radical change in the
                                articles to be used for food. This work of reformation has been and is still going on.
                                The world is growing better, and contending for a higher form of existence. Even by a
                                careful analysis of facts, it will readily be seen that some very marked changes for the
                                better have taken place, in every department of life, since the beginning of the present
                                century. Wars and rumors of wars, and deeds of violence may follow in the path of the
                                undisciplined man, as the legitimate fruits of the life he leads, but better classes are
                                coming forward and establishing higher degrees of moral influences. The language, the
                                habits, the inspiration of the mind, the dress, the food are all brought to the front,
                                and judgment passed as having reference to the health and to the moral tone of society.
                                Nothing can escape the investigation of the age. Every order must pass through this
                                ordeal and whether religious or non-religious they will be judged by the advanced light
                                of today. But should we return to an earlier age when "�every imagination of the heart
                                was evil continually," when violence filled the earth, and when the diet of man
                                consisted of "every moving thing that liveth," we might well be astonished at the great
                                change ! Religious people cannot exercise too much care in regard to the language they
                                speak, and to the food they eat. The direct sympathy of the soul and body with each
                                other, shows plainly the necessity of caring for them as a creative blessing from God's
                                hand. Paul says,�"Ye are the temple of the living God." What defiles the one may in
                                corresponding measure defile the other, and it would be difficult to become spiritually
                                minded unless the whole man is disciplined to observe the laws of God, that govern the
                                health of the body, aud the laws of morality that lead toward righteousness, and on to
                                God.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Serving the Devil" TEIform="index"/>SERVING THE DEVIL

                            and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof." Rom. xiii., 14. The
                            Eastern mind not only delighted in metaphors, but found them indispensable. The Hebrew
                            language for instance, is one continual picture; every fact and every emotion is rendered
                            visible by an image.<pb n="90" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> Had it not been for the pictures, the similes, and
                            the parables pi Holy Writ, we should have had a far less vivid impression than we now have
                            of the facts of spiritual lite. Now there is one central fact of the spiritual life which
                            the Apostles try to impress upon us again and again. It is the necessity of nearness to
                            Christ, of union with Christ, as the most essential element of true life. Now, this truth
                            that Christ is life, and that apart from Christ is no life, is set forth by our Lord and his
                            apostles in many different ways, and most often by vivid metaphors. Sometimes Christ is
                            represented as the true vine, and the members of his church as the branches of that vine.
                            Sometimes the Church is pictured as one living body, and all its children as members
                            belonging to that one body, which can have no feeling and no life apart from Christ, who is
                            the head. Of all the Apostles, no one realized these truths more fully than St. Paul. He,
                            without any metaphor, speaks of himself and of all the saints of God as being "in Christ. "
                            When he spake of faith in its highest sense, he did not mean a passive assent, a blind
                            orthodoxy, an unreasoning belief, a torpid assuranc. , the feminine aspect of mind which
                            dares not inquire; he was speaking of something very different�namely, the mystic communion
                            of the believer with his Lord; he meant the being lost in Christ, the being found in Christ;
                            he meant the death of self the life hid with Christ in God, which is the human and the
                            animal life no longer, but is the oneness of man's spirit with Christ's spirit. This is what
                            he means by such a sentence as "It is now no more I that live, but Christ that liveth in
                            me," and such thoughts reach their culminating intensity of expression when he says "For me
                            to live is Christ." All that he regards as real in his own life is the transforming energy,
                            the permeating glow, of that spirit of Christ which pervades and overfloods his heart and
                            leads him with no will but the will of his Lord. Such, then, is the general significance of
                            the metaphor; but what is the meaning to us, its practical meaning. Whether when we know the
                            meaning, we choose to make it for us a reality�that, alas! is a very different question. The
                            first part of the meaning, then, of the metaphor, "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, " is try
                            to be like Christ, walk in the footsteps of Christ, imitate the character of Christ, iearn
                            to love what you know that Christ loved, and learn to hate what you know that Christ hated.
                            The very next clause helps quite clearly to explain this part of the meaning, by giving us
                            its opposite. " Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to
                            fulfill the lusts thereof. " The one is the opposite of the other. Using the same metaphor,
                            putting on the robe, the apostles often say, "Put off as the beloved and the elect of God,
                            anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communications out of your mouth; lay aside every
                            whit, and the close fitting sin, put on the whole armor of righteousness, put on the
                            merciful heart, kindness, meekness, long suffering; tie humility about you as a robe with a
                            knotted girdle ; put off the old character, put on the new creature "�they are the
                            metaphorical ways of saying " Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the
                            renewing of your mind; " they mean that in Christ Jesus no outward rite or ceremony or
                            profession avails anything to new creation, they mean walk in newness of life; they mean
                            walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. If we are living in
                            flagrant violation of our consciences we cannot feel the renovating glow of Christ's
                            awakening spirit and transforming power; there must be some answer on the part of our souls
                            to the call of God; we must break through the thick conventionalities of our worldliness and
                            of our religion, and when we begin to make the Sun of Eighteousness the centre of our
                            desires, and not this low earth; when we do from the heart desire to be holy, pure and good,
                            then none but Christ can help us. The Church is a glorious thing; but it will not do to
                            trust the Church or Church ordinances between us and Christ; if we do we shall only deceive
                            ourselves by the traditions of men. The Bible is a blessed gift; but it will not do to trust
                            the Bible between us and Christ, for without his present spirit, and without the direct
                            contact with his personality, the Bible will be for us but a dead book. The true Bible is
                            that which Christ writes on the freshened table of our hearts.<pb n="91" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> Suoh
                            then, my friends, is the meaning, in part at least, of this Divine message to us, "Put ye on
                            the Lord Jesus Christ." It means, first vf all, break with your past self and that you will
                            be able to do this; it means to come to Christ, that you may have the strength you need, and
                            by prayer to Him and earnestly seeking Him, be healed, be raised, be quickened, be
                            transformed, be made a new creature, be born again. And as it means this hope for the future
                            and this strength in the present, so also it means forgiveness for the past; it means
                            "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
                            crimson, they shall be as wool. "</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Thou hast left us, kind father. In memory of Brother Simon Mabee" TEIform="index"/>THOU

                            And has torn herself away; Away from earth and earthly cares So long and patiently born,
                            Until the summons came for her To enter her future home. At crosses great she murmured not,
                            They were too heavy to bear; Nor did she flinch when duty called On her to perform her
                            share; But with a Christian's fortitude, She gave her might and main, Knowing a recompense
                            was sure For all her toils and her pains. When her cup so full of sorrow Seemed e'en full to
                            running o'er, She would quaff the bitter contents Meekly whispering, one drop more; For she

                            And death on her brow was sealed, Her visage bespoke God's praises For his love to her
                            revealed. Her footprints on the sands of time, They can never be erased; Nor pictures of her
                            memory left, They can never be effaced; But as a grand memorial � Will stand erect evermore;
                            As a beacon in the distance * Aiding to perfection's goal. Truth was inscribed on her banner
                            While treading the upward way Leading to life everlasting In that land of endless day; Where
                            cometh no sin nor sorrow But peace eternally reigns; Where the sunshine of love so bright
                            Will banish gloom and despair. From our midst we oft shall miss her Now her voice is hushed
                            for aye, But we could not think to hold her Since she could no longer stay. So now, kind
                            guardian angels, We commit her to your care, Trusting she'll find you waiting, And the

                                    many seasons been hooted at, scorned for my looks or dress, called names, affronted
                                    for being old, in winter snow-balled, and sometimes from a dark nook struck by one
                                    or another small coward, who would instantly, for concealment and protection,
                                    retreat into the intrenchment of a dozen scamps of his own color, obdurate against

                                    party, were ready to renew and rub in the affront. "Best, " says a gentlewoman of my
                                    acquaintance, " not to notice them at all, as it only makes them worse." One might
                                    be tempted to follow this prudent advice if consulting personal comfort alone. But
                                    do we not selfishly expose others to the same effrontery by such apparent consent to
                                    any crin.e against ourselves? Besides, it is not of themselves that experienced
                                    elders think under this battery of juvenile contempt; but of the community and
                                    country, of the ill augury and dark horoscope for a land they are about to leave,
                                    where liberty can be abused into such license and nobody care to interfere? For, on
                                    such occasions of mockery by boys�in which, I am glad to say, girls, in haunts

                                    on and laugh. Where were the police? you may inquire. I know not; only they were not
                                    there! Perhaps like Baal, as Elijah ironically told the worshipers of that false
                                    deity, they were "talking, or pursuing, or on a journey, or peradventure sleeping
                                    and must be awaked, " ^or which there was no time ! If they had been present they
                                    would probably not have considered the saucy taunts a violation of any statute law
                                    rendering their shameless unblushing authors liable to arrest. We talk of the low
                                    Irish; and such there are. But these half grown and ill-begotten offenders are not
                                    all of the Celtic race, I have known not a few sons of Anglo-Saxon reputed
                                    gentlemen, whom their proud parents had from childhood put out to pride for a nurse,
                                    to be taught and trained to think themselves better than common folk, and so
                                    entitled to look down upon and maltreat from a safe distance whomsoever they took a
                                    notion to jeer or throw stones at. What cure can there be but reverence, mutual
                                    respect practiced and instilled. Fear is natural to the child. Reverence must be
                                    acquired. It is humility expressed in our manner, posture, motion, behavior and
                                    speech; root and essence of religion, which we are told must not be inculcated in
                                    our public schools because religions are so many. I<pb n="93" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> deny the
                                    proposition. There is but one religion, many as are the forms. " I am of the
                                    religion of all men of science," said Alexander von Humholdt, meaning, I suppose, a
                                    lowly bowing before the glories of the creation, which it was his life and joy to
                                    explore. That, without sect or dogma, is enough. If the Romanist ties religion to
                                    the worship of saint or virgin, or the Orthodox to a trinity, or the Unitarian to
                                    one person, or the Baptist to total immersion, or the Episcopal to an apostolic or
                                    priestly succession, they are all confounding their several ceremonies and
                                    definitions of religion with the fact of that adoring attitude before the Most High.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To an early song sparrow" TEIform="index"/>TO AN EARLY SONG SPARROW.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Calver, A.

Many resentments
                                    are really without cause. Some arise from simple misunderstandings; many more, so
                                    far as we have observed, from wounded vanity. And there is nothing so easily
                                    wounded. The egotist is easily hurt. His harness has only "joints, " and they are
                                    all open. A random arrow can't miss him. A presiding elder, friend of ours, lost the
                                    friendship of a country brother whom he esteemed, and years afterwards found out the
                                    cause. It seems that the brother saw the presiding elder in the crowded street of a
                                    city one day, and bowed to him. But the presiding elder�a little near-sighted
                                    withal�did not see him, and so did not return the brother's salutation. The brother
                                    never forgave him for what he took as an affront. Moreover, he nursed his resentment
                                    and told the story of his wrongs, till at last he concluded that the presiding elder
                                    had done him a real injury. He would hear him preach no more. Eesentments do not
                                    need nursing; it is better to nurse vipers, for they will only sting the bosom that
                                    warms them into life. Resentments nursed will sting the heart that nourishes them.
                                    Many a man has embittered his whole life and set a neighborhood by the ears, because
                                    he fancied that somebody had slighted him. It seems, to use the mildest word the
                                    case allows, excessively foolish. One must think his life of vast con sequence to
                                    spend his life nursing little viperlings in the shape of resentments. One other
                                    thing should be said�it is very wicked. It is not the spirit of Christ, nor does it
                                    lead to Christ. What a waste of time and feeling it involves if there were no
                                    greater evils in this foolish weakness! Charlotte Bronte says on this subject, quite
                                    conclusively: "Life appears too short to be spent in nursing animosity or
                                    registering wrongs.

                                        loss of property by war�of life, that is so precious�of property, that is so
                                        indispensable to the enjoyment and usefulness of life! But there is an
                                        unspeakably greater loss than this with which war is also chargeable. I refer to
                                        the damage which morals and religion suffer from it. All I need add, on this
                                        point, is that the power of war to demoralize the world, and to corrupt the
                                        purest religion in the world, is abundantly manifest, in the fact that the moral
                                        and religious sense of even good men is not shocked by war. No stronger argument
                                        can be brought against war than the fact of its power to conform the morals and
                                        religion of the world to war,</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Messenger of peace" TEIform="index"/>Messenger of Peace.</bibl></cit></p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Smith, Gerrit" TEIform="persName"/>Gerrit Smith.</byline></div3></div2><pb n="95" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Juvenile" TEIform="index"/>Juvenile.</head><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Striking children" TEIform="index"/>STRIKING CHILDREN
                            </head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">It is not likely this article will ever meet the eyes of
                                        those for whom it is intended. The ones who really need advice are usually those
                                        who can not or will not read it. But in the hope of arresting even one angry
                                        hand which might otherwise do untold damage by a single ill-aimed blow, these
                                        lines are written. " A box on the ear," has come to be so common an expression
                                        that we smile when it occurs in a racy narrative; but it should never be smiled
                                        at. A box on the ear may cause partial, or even total deafness for life; it may
                                        cause internal injuries, which may result in stupefying, or even entirely
                                        destroying the intellect; it may cause illness�even death. Should an act
                                        freighted with such tremendous possibilities ever be lightly spoken of? And what
                                        sort of a soul can the man or woman possess, who, knowing the results that may
                                        follow the act, can recklessly give a child a box on the ear? A blow on any part
                                        of the head may, and most likely will, be followed by grave consequences. A blow
                                        upon the chest, the stomach, the spine, is almost equally dangerous. In fact,
                                        there are only one or two places upon the human body which may be struck with
                                        comparative safety; and, when it seems necessary that corporal punishment should
                                        be administered to a child, it should be administered in those places. The
                                        teachings of scripture and commo ; sense seem to point to the occasional
                                        necessity of corporal punishment. It should never be bestowed in anger, however;
                                        never without the most careful deliberation, and as a last resort. If a child
                                        has been trained from early infancy to habits of obedience, there will rarely,
                                        if ever, be found a necessity for whipping, after it has attained the age of
                                        five or six years. Other punishments, equally effective, can and should be
                                        devised for older children. In any case, never strike a child at random in a
                                        moment of impatience. The remark which is often made, that bright, precocious
                                        babies often develop into the most commonplace men and women, may perhaps be
                                        accounted for in another way than that fond parents overestimated their
                                        brightness in infancy. Blows, kicks, and violent shaking must have their effect
                                        upon the tender brain and nerve of childhood. It would not necessarily require
                                        much of such treatment to reduce an originally brilliant intellect to a
                                        condition little short of idiocy.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Congregationalist" TEIform="index"/>Congregationalist.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Acrostic from Psalms" TEIform="index"/>An Acrostic from Psalms.</head><p TEIform="p">Except the Lord build the house, they labor in rain that build it. 127 : 1.
