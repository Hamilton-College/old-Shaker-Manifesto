NO. 2</head><byline TEIform="byline">By <persName reg="Blinn, Henry C." TEIform="persName"/>Elder Henry C. Blinn</byline><p TEIform="p">IN the forming of the Shaker Communities, ministers, deacons, lawyers, doctors and tradesmen
                            of all kinds were brought together, with their wives and children, and they were quite like
                            those mentioned by the Apostle in Corinthians, Galatians and Ephesians, and like those who
                            are found in every city and village. So soon as the Community was organized a Christian
                            discipline was brought forward, and by multiplied, gradual steps the work has past on
                            through many degrees of religious experience. The sermon on the Mount now became the subject
                            for contemplation, as preferable to the study of military tactics or to the accumulation of
                            selfish interests. "To live righteously, soberly and godly in this present world," became a
                            theme for practical righteousness, as this new family or church of Christ came out from the
                            relations of the old inheritance, and were baptized into that life which comes from God.
                            These old heroes of the Revolution had now enlisted in the army of the Lord, and were
                            fighting as zealously for the kingdom of God, as they had fought for the success of their
                            national freedom. In the service of their country, and in the service of their God, they
                            became the victorious conquerors and could rightfully say with the* Apostle,"We have fought
                            the good fight, we have finisht our course, we have kept the faith." It was a wonderful
                            reformatory work that these soldiers of the cross had entered, and in their zeal to fight
                            against the sins of the world, many things <pb n="18" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 18 THE MANIFESTO. were past
                            over, that at a later date must be brought to the test of a Christian discipline. While
                            there may be much neatness and much kindness among Americans, there may also be much love
                            for tobacco and strong drink. The orators want it when they make a speech, and the ministers
                            of an earlier date wanted it when they preacht a sermon. One of the old poets tells us why
                            tobacco was so largely used, "Men of sound reason used their pipes, For colic pains and
                            stomach gripes." A record of the installment of a Christian minister informs us that two
                            "barrels of New England rum were purchased for the company. During the few past years the
                            temperance people and the anti-tobacco society have accomplisht a wonderful work. It was
                            customary in the earlier part of the century to place before all visiting friends, the glass
                            and decanter. Sometimes it was a glass of common cider, while at other times it was
                            blackberry or strawberry wine, or perhaps a glass of cider brandy. Regular drains of spirit
                            were taken every morning before breakfast, and then more or less cider at each meal. At the
                            lime of establishing the Shaker Community and the accepting of a Christian life or
                            discipline, as leading toward a more spiritual order, all the elements of human nature were
                            brought together. These had existed in the family of man since the day that they entered the
                            garden of Eden. In some communities might be found not less than three hundred people of all
                            ages, of both sexes, and with multiplied religious professions. In the year 1828 a
                            temperance wave past over the United States, and the several Societies of Believers at that
                            time agreed to discontinue the use of the morning dram and the practice of placing wine or
                            cider before any visitors. No spirit was to be drank except by order of a physician; and
                            from this date a markt reformation began. It had, strange to say, taken some forty years to
                            be able to comprehend the necessity of this advanced step in Christian progression. Altho
                            the subject of temperance was more earnestly agitated in England than in America, yet
                            neither those in the Christian church, nor many out of the church made any special change
                            for several years. In 1837 the subject of eating and drinking was agitated and became a
                            matter worthy of consideration by those who had accepted the life of Christ, and were
                            learning how best to accomplish the most good as Christians of the resurrection order. The
                            subject was brought before the people in several Soci*etics, and quite a large number of the
                            Brethren and Sisters abstained from the use of fat and blood and from the grosser kinds of
                            meat that came to the table. Some even abstained from meat of every kind, and no less from
                            the use of tea and coffee. This was in accordance with the spiritual profession of the
                            Shakers and could not otherwise than do a large amount of good. <pb n="19" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 19 Up to this date the majority of good Christian people had given but little or
                            no thought to the subject of dietetics and were quite well satisfied to eat that which was
                            placed before them, asking no questions. A slice from a ground hog was accepted with the
                            same relish as a piece of roast beef, while a "coon" well basted was a tidbit for an
                            epicure. Believers in the Bible must be interested to know that Abraham has the honor of
                            being the first reformer in this line and that he made a radical change from the customs of
                            his day. Moses followed the example of Abraham and made more advanced regulations in
                            dietetics. A most remarkable success attended the children of Israel, the foundation of
                            which was laid whileon their wilderness journey. At the time that Abraham instituted the
                            reformation, the human family ate very much as did the wild beasts, and like them made fat
                            and blood a luxury. The Bible holds on record this remarkable commandment,"Every moving
                            thing that liveth shall be meat for you," and the race has followed this to the very letter.
                            Every thing that could be procured, whether on the land or in the water, whether beast, bird
                            or reptile has probably been used more or less for food. Strange as this may seem, the
                            carniverous, and even the onmiverous habit still rules the human race and so late as the
                            nineteenth century, the civilized nations find appetizing food in the cooking of reptiles.
                            As food and drink have a ruling influence over the mind for good or ill, no Christian can
                            well afford to allow the subject to pass without a thorough investigation. (To be
                            continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Enroute" TEIform="index"/>ENROUTE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Mace, Aurelia G."

                            Eldress Elizabeth Haskell and the writer started from Alfred, Maine, for a visit to the
                            Societies of Believers in New Hampshire. Through a clear, crisp atmosphere, the smoking
                            engine hurried us along, over hill and through dale, by pleasant woodlands and cultivated
                            farms to Alton Bay. Then for a number of miles, along the shores of Lake Winnipiseogee,
                            through whose clear, placid waters could be plainly seen the white pebbly bottom of the
                            lake. One view of Mt. Washington, far to the north-west and we are off to Laconia, at which
                            station we are made glad by meeting two Brethren from Canterbury, Elder Benjamin Smith and
                            Brother Arthur Bruce, with carriages to take us to their pleasant village twelve miles
                            distant. We arrive as the shades of evening are falling and are welcomed to one of our most
                            beautiful homes, by our own Brothers and Sisters. All things needed for our comfort are
                            amply supplied by their love and care. The days of our visit come and go, all pleasant days,
                            bringing pleasures and surprises manifold. <pb n="20" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 20 THE MANIFESTO. In the
                            Office of The Manifesto, our beloved Elder Henry C. Blinn, explains to us the machinery by
                            which our thoughts are stampt upon paper, and the little pamphlets are made, which carry our
                            ideas to the Societies of Believers and to the outside world; all done under his watchful
                            guidance. He then took us to his museum where are carefully stored many relics of old, so
                            interesting to us in these latter days. We saw the skeleton in the closet, reminding us that
                            we are "fearfully and wonderfully made," and while these earthly forms are niouldeiing to
                            dust, the spirit, which is the reality, is marching on in the beautiful life beyond. We are
                            visiting with those we have long loved, and surrounded by scenes which call to mind
                            historical events of the old times. Not the least of these is the building in which the
                            Sacred Roll was printed in the year 1843. Before us, we seem to see Philemon Stewart in all
                            the glory of his great inspiration. Of our company, only one can remember those days. The
                            evenings are delightfully enjoyed. One evening we listen to the quartet, to the piano and
                            organ ; the next to the orchestra; but the evening in which the pilgrims marcht to the Holy
                            City, was the entertainment which took the palm. We saw the beautiful city with its
                            battlements and towers. We saw the shining ones passing out and in, guiding the pilgrims
                            along their weary way. We saw Doubt and Scorn and all the powers of evil vanquisht. Then the
                            door was opened to receive them, amid the rejoicing of the angels. At this time there came a
                            scene for which we were wholly unprepared. Elder William Duraont said to Elder Henry Green,
                            "Let us go in, it may be our only chance." So they past in, and "in my dream," I saw them no
                            more. Under the loving control of Eldress Dorothy A. Durgin, these entertainments are
                            perfected and carried out. The magnetism of her spirit smooths down the roughness, always
                            strengthening the weak and drawing out the good. It is the divine Mother Spirit, in her,
                            personified. "Beauty reigns all around thy borders, Where her lovely feet have trod, Peace
                            and order, love and union, In the power and gift of God." As time passes on, the Sabbath
                            comes. This day is marred by no cloud. It is a perfect day. At the appointed hour, the
                            Sanctuary is opened, not only for the Believers, but also for those friends who choose to
                            attend. The singing is in perfect harmony, and most beautiful and inspiring. In this service
                            we had the privilege of listening to a discourse from Brother T. A. Dwyer, late from the
                            outside churches, and now establisht in the New Jerusalem which hath come down from God, out
                            of heaven. The Word is held forth in perfect language, and as the Testimony of true
                            Shakerism falls from his lips, we can not wonder that the two thousand, who listened to his
                                <pb n="21" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 21 pleading tones in the Universalist church in
                            Laconia, turned to their homes in tears of joy and new resolves for the future. Thus will
                            the old heavens and earth pass away and all things become new. This day came to a close like
                            the others, and it will never be forgotten. In the course of the coming week, Elder Henry C.
                            Blinn and Eldress Emeline Hart conducted us to their home in Enfield. Places of interest
                            were pointed out to us along the way. We past the birth-place of the immortal Webster, and
                            the Webster Lake, where, in youthful days, he spent hours of recreation in fishing. The
                            journey was made very pleasant for us, and the time past quickly, bringing us to their home
                            in Enfield. Eldress Joanna Kaime met us at the door, and her kind welcome gave us the
                            assurance that we were not among strangers, but with our near and dear relation. Great
                            kindness is shown to us in this home, where Elder Abraham Perkins spent so many years of his
                            devoted life, the home of his heart's deep love. We remained nearly a week in this beautiful
                            place, visited the North family, which was the home of Elder John Lyou, that great
                            expounder, who kept the sieve full and kept it shaking. Would that he were here now, to
                            continue the work, until the deserted villages were filled with the "Elect," "Sought out and
                            chosen." The scenery here is magnificent. The Brethren of our company went to a lake, far up
                            the mountain, on the west, fifteen hundred feet above the level of the village, from which
                            the Society is always sure of an abundant supply of water. It seems to be in the crater of
                            an old volcano, and there is no danger that it will ever break away and damage property.
                            Elder William Wilson very kindly took us around Mascoma Lake, east of the village, pointed
                            out the spot where the first Shaker meeting was held in New Hampshire, where the home of
                            James Jewett, the first convert, was situated and where John Cotton received faith ; he
                            being the first one to bring the gospel testimony after the order of our Church, into the
                            state of Maine. That meeting was held the 8th of Sept. 1782. We stopt a day over our time
                            that we might meet Eldress Rosetta Cumings and Sister Caroline Whitcher and three young
                            Sisters who were absent from home. We enjoyed a lovely visit with them in the afternoon. In
                            the evening had our farewell visit with the Ministry and Elders, only for the present,
                            however; many meetings are to be in the future. The next day we were taken to the station by
                            Brother George Baxter, and saying farewell to him until our next meeting, we retraced our
                            way to Canterbury. When we arrived in Concord the rain was falling in gentle showers. Elder
                            Henry Green left us at this point for Boston, homeward bound. We were expecting Sister Lucy
                            Ann Shepard and a company of Sisters from Canterbury, who were on their way to Boston. We
                            enjoyed an hour's visit with these loved ones, and then went on to Canterbury with the young
                            Brethren, leaving the Sisters to take the train. When we drove up to the Office, <pb n="22" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 22 THE MANIFESTO. many anxious ones were there to meet us; altho the rain was
                            pouring, the quartet was out singing of the "patter, patter of the rain." One day more in
                            lovely Canterbury, which is to be wA\ improved. We are granted another short visit with our
                            dearly loved Sister, Asenuth Stickney, who is suffering from injuries received by a severe
                            fall; also au additional visit with Sister Harriet Hastings whom we have all known to love.
                            Then we enjoy a delightful season with Elder Abraham Perkins and tell him of our visit to
                            his home in Enfield. He bears up remarkably under his ninety years. By the kindness of our
                            Canterbury friends, Sister Ednah E. Fitts is to accompany us to our home at Sabbathday Luke,
                            stay with us during the winter and teach music. The last morning arrived, and with Sister
                            Ednah we are taken to the station in Laconia. Here we part with Elder Benjamin and Brother
                            Arthur, who have been so kind to us, and we are on our way home. We stop at Alfred over
                            night and go on to Sabbathday Lake the next day. All is well. We again take up the thread of
                            life in the old accustomed way. Our music teacher arranges her classes and commences her
                            labor of love. Music is in the atmosphere and a song of rejoicing in our souls,a song that
                            can only be learned by the hundred forty and four thousand. The half has not been told.

                            the wood grains exposed by the cutting, but by close observation he can read the history of
                            past seasons. Each has left its impression upon the wood, the dry or rainy, pleasant or
                            dreary periods are plainly discernible. So with our life. Each year adds to our spiritual
                            growth, each trivial act forming a tiny grain, which in the future will tell what the life
                            has been. As the tree grows, each year the outer ring is pusht toward the centre, leaving a
                            place for the nevv growth constantly forming. So our characters are daily adding new growth.
                            What we now give or receive, our thoughts and words, as truly as deeds, in process of time
                            is pusht into the heart-lil'e becoming a part of our characters. As good wood is not formed
                            in constant sunshine, neither is the truest life obtained by continual prosperity. Days of
                            wind and rain, of trial and disappointment are necessary to a full development; and
                            temptation firmly resisted, proves the strengthening tissue. But how often when yielded to
                            they make upon the character, a blemish. We may be rude and ask to be excused, or
                            thoughtless and implore forgiveness until the "seventy times seven" have been fulfilled, in
                            a thoughtless half-hearted manner, but such sorrow does not work repentance. If we are
                            sincerely repentant and in humility, pray for strength to atone for the wrong committed, it
                            will be given. When this spirit prompts a search for forgiveness we own our hatred of wrong,
                            acknowledging before others our standard of right, thus strengthening our purpose to live
                            more perfectly in the future. When again tempted to a like sin, we will think, "I met this
                            evil once and was conquered by it, this time I will be the conqueror, for the seal of true
                            forgiveness is, 'Go and sin no more.' " In the battle of life we often are wounded;
                            sometimes unknowingly, by those around us, while at the same time we may send a dart at
                            another, wounding those whom we hold dear. So it behooves us often to apply to the needs of
                            others the oil of love and forgiveness, that we may in return merit the same. If we are
                            wounded while fighting for the right, so deeply wounded that we feel we can no longer stand,
                            we need not regret it, for it is only by losing the natural life that we gain the eternal.
                            The soldier who returns from battle, bearing many scars as test of faithful service, is more
                            honored than he who flees from the dangers and escapes unharmed. So the Christian
                            approaching heaven's gate, when the battle is ended and the final roll is called, will count
                            each scar an honor, while the dangers are forgotten in the joy of the welcome, "Well done."

                            which has bi en the hope of the founders of all forms of religious belief, and the desire of
                            reformers in the political world for ages, organizations have been establisht among men for
                            the purpose of solidifying and making the efforts to that end more effective. In reviewing
                            history it is plainly realized that necessity is the parent of the forces that are evolving
                            human destiny. For a larger scope and a broader freedom that will enable life to realize
                            those conditions which are more favorable for its advancement new sects and parties have
                            been establisht; the result of a breaking away from the old lines of thought which formerly
                            controlled. The effort to attain this ideal is not prompted by the desire to win fame, for
                            the percentage of such lives as have been recognized by their contemporaries is so small in
                            comparison to the whole as hardly to be discerned. When in the course of human events the
                            vestments worn by nations and races, by sects and parties have become outgrown, ragged and
                            moth eaten, there must be a change. It is not merely a question of like or dislike, for from
                            its exalted station the everlasting truth has given the command to advance, and obedience
                            must be rendered. The Reformer who undertakes the beneficent tusk of educating human thought
                            to a higher standard of duty must be a soul that is in close communion with its divine
                            Parentage and can receive its inspiration unmixt with human foliies and wrongs; one who can
                            meet the errors that afflict life with on unflinching look and condemn its infamous reign
                            without cringing. One who has received the everlasting truth in his life and made it his
                            permanent possession. "What is Truth?" This was the question askt of the divine Teacher and
                            is being repeated by every one who realizes that his life is capable of further unfoldment,
                            and is anxious to come into a more perfect knowledge of that power which is able to clear
                            away the debris of false ideas and customs and illuminate the soul with more perfect light;
                            and as that is attained the answer is given. Human progress is not the result of forces
                            moving in a confused and unorganized manner, but like the student in the rudimentary school
                            who is led up to higher grades by a systematic development of the latent powers, so is the
                            unfoldment of truth in its varied manifestations to the soul who is prepared to receive it.
                            We are astonisht at the operation of laws which are evolving from apparent chaos an orderly
                            condition, and call it the mysterious. That border land loses its claim for recognition in
                            proportion as the truth is made manifest. No arbitrary lines can establish the boundary
                            withno further shalt thou gofor being the offspring of the infinite Spirit we can only be
                            satisfied when striving to attain unto our destiny. The advance thought of one generation

                            which enables us to understand that the spirit of truth is the one supreme and Almighty
                            power. The environments that to the outward sense control the individual life, many times
                            prevent it from realizing that "there is a Divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them as
                            we may," even making the wrath of man or his ambition for personal honor redound to the
                            benefit of his fellow-beings. Bonaparte, the central figure in thoLe mighty events which the
                            opening years of the nineteenth century witnessed is the most prominent one of modern times.
                            The scourging that was given to the effete despotisms of Europe that were styled civilized
                            and Christian governments but whose principle object for existing was to live on the plunder
                            extorted from the people regardless of the cres of the opprest and which compelled them to
                            come to the people as supplicants asking for help to resist the invader, granting
                            concessions which the ruling powers have never recovered, proving that life is more than the
                            result of external forces, and that the immortal principle which alone can make free is the
                            directing power in human events. When all the energy of life is given for the purpose of
                            developing this principle, the question is not askt,Is it popular? What will the people
                            think? But is it right? The uplifting power of truth is best exemplified in the words of the
                            divine Teacher,uIf I am lifted up I will draw all men unto me." The higher plains of thought
                            and life can offer no compromise, and if we would commune with the dwellers it must be by
                            ascending to their ideal. Garrison when he was contending against the powers of slavery
                            said, "I will not retract one word, and I will be heard." Expediency, thou art a delusion
                            and a snare. The honest man is honest whether material gain or loss is the result. Policy
                            can not sit as an honored guest in the parlor of the soul who is entertaining that
                            Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth which alone can grant absolution from the conditions of
                            servitude from which every progressive soul is longing to be free. Shakers, N.

                                years, laden with two feet of pure white snow for a winding sheet. We willingly bid
                                adieu to the past year with all its pleasantness or unpleasantness. Altho storms and
                                clouds have been superabundant, yet we share one of life's choicest blessings,good
                                health. While sickness is very prevalent, yet, our family have escaped its
                                contamination, for which neglect we are truly grateful. Christmas was a festive day with
                                us. The youth and children did themselves honor and made the day replete with enjoyment
                                by their juvenile manifestations. Our dining-hall was beautifully festooned with
                                woodbine and other ornamentations. While we were seated at the breakfast table, boding

                                appropriately caparisoned and surrounding an organ they had placed in the room, gave us
                                an unusual musical entertainment both vocal and instrumental. At the conclusion, the
                                band departed as quietly as they had entered. In the evening we met in the dininghall
                                and had a season of enjoyment which was made doubly pleasant by the enthusiasm
                                manifested by the young, even to the least. The meeting was interspersed by .
                                recitations alternated by vocal and instrumental music. An hour or more was filled by
                                the young people, and the ancients of the mansion were made glad by the inspiration
                                which permeated the meeting. At the close of the sociable we were treated to the
                                bounties provided by those in temporal care. In this the young people were the waiters
                                to carry the viands and drink and confectionary about to the company. As pleasant as the
                                entertainment was, the nobility exhibited by the actors, filled the hearts of we
                                recipients with a love and Christian blessing for them that language is incapable of

                                hands placed a beautiful evergreen tree in our chapel, and with its brilliant
                                illumination from the candle lights presented a very cheery aspect. But best of all was
                                the burden of gifts placed thereon by that dear old friend Santa Claus. He must have a
                                splendid memory as no one was forgotten. On Christmas eve we met to receive the gifts
                                that he had to bestow. Hope that every fireside and home in our land was visited. While
                                we step on the threshold of the New Year and find its page clean and white we question
                                what will be its record at the close? Just what we make it. Only one moment at a timp is
                                all we have to carry and the future ceases to be, by becoming the present. As we read of
                                rumors of war and see the belligerent attitude assumed by the dying monarchies of Europe
                                as a bluff to frighten their enemies; at the same time trembling with fear at the
                                portends of the coming revolution which will be their overthrow, we pray that in our own
                                beloved country the counsels of wisdom may prevail, so tha,t her mission can be to
                                direct the nations of the earth to that condition of life which is founded upon the

                                encouraged. We wish all of our gospel friends a prosperous year, and may the cause that
                                we have given our life to sustain be blest as the result of faithful efforts. Hamilton

We enter the Home Circle for the first call since 98 has been substituted on
                                the record of time, for the familiar 97 of the past year. That, now, has taken its place
                                in life's history, and the present and future await our writing. May its pages reveal to
                                us the beauty of a life of true consecration, and of Christ-like deeds. As we took up a
                                paper this morning we noticed these words by Phillips Brooks; "What is going to be our
                                truth for the New Year? Is it not that the love which has never deserted us shall come
                                closer to us, because it finds us readier to receive it,-making us better, stronger,
                                purer, nobler, more manly, more womanly, more fit for life. Not because God loves us any
                                more, but because we with new openness are more ready to receive him into our lives."
                                There are beauties in the rocks and stones which we daily see, not noticed, until by
                                careful study we learn of their wonderful formation. The smallest flower possesses a
                                double beauty for us when we analyze each separate part, and realize the use of each in
                                forming the perfect whole; and the dainty flakes of snow, reveal to us history of past
                                miracles, as we investigate the truths of their formation. All around us are hidden
                                beauties which only eyes opened to see, and a mind prepared to receive can fully
                                appreciate. So with our spiritual natures quickened, we shall see in every phase of life
                                the wisdom, love, and power, of an unseen hand. We have had some very cold wintry
                                weather. The snow fell, the wind blew, and the cold was so intense that their united
                                forces nearly formed a blizzard. The thermometer stood at ten deg. below zero at one
                                time which was a signal for all water pipes so situated as to be able to hear of it, to
                                refuse to hold the frozen water within them, until coaxt to resume their work once more.
                                Among the blessings for which we daily are grateful, not the least is the daily addition
                                of strength, which Brother Ira obtains, tho at present not free from suffering, we are
                                glad for all taken from him. Our little girls were made glad on Christmas eve, by a
                                nicely laden Christmas tree, its variety of fruits were eagerly gathered by them. May
                                the coming year be one of true blessing to all of our friends, while each day as a step
                                heavenward, leads to perfect happiness the glory of a Christ-like life. Fidelia

The tide of winter travel and business has never set so strong toward Florida
                                as it does to-day, all telling a good record for the future of the State. The leading
                                question of the tourist is this,"Is the soil of Florida capable of raising enough to
                                sustain the farmer?" Florida is willing to trust her own unaided charms, even against
                                the false reports that have been made. Let the farmer come and show for himself or go
                                and see what his neighbor has done. The enterprising advertiser of the Pacific coast has
                                caught the men who deal in wheat, and pork and beef, while Florida has done all too
                                little to offset these efforts of the California boomers. Since writing the above we
                                have had another sad experience. Jan. 1, 2, and 3rd. Florida is again visited with an
                                untimely freeze. The mercury fell to 25 deg. below freezing, which killed much of the
                                vegetation that was not protected by fire or shelter. This may, for the present, retard
                                the tide of emigration which has been so strongly turned this way. Like the other
                                states, Florida has a dark side, and has also a bright side. Three years ago we had a
                                big freeze which cut down most of the fruit trees north of the frost line, and the state
                                has hardly recovered from that sad blow. "A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner." We
                                can hardly learn humility and tenderness, except by suffering.

                                Social Reform by Joshua K. Ingalls. As the first item of interest was an experience
                                sometime in the year 1821 when the author was an infant of only five years, there has
                                been a long series of years through which to study "The Ways of Man." The closing of
                                this wonderfully interesting story takes place in July 1897. In the experience of more
                                than seventy years the author has walkt and talkt, most familiarly, with many of the
                                leading men of the country, and also become interested in many of the reformatory
                                movements that were agitating Society, so that his book of Reminiscences or the story of
                                his life becomes intensely interesting, especially to those who can bear in memory many
                                of the pleasing incidents which he so graphically narrates. Publisht by the Gazette Co,

"Home, Mauuiagk, and Family Relations"
by Jatnes Inglis, ami publisnt by H. L. Hastings of Boston, Mass, deals as one sees by the
title page with subjects of vital importance
in the social life of the world to-day.   The
book shows the need there is for a moral revival, the necessity for quickening the ethical
sense of man, and shows parents that the
home furnishes better opportunities for instructions in righteousness than either the
church or school.   This is no new truth but
one that can not be too often repeated.   The
book deserves the attention and patronage of
all who are desirous to know the best way to
give society not only cultured men and women but men and women (if such sterling
moral chaiacter that they will be able to assume the responsibilities of "IIomk, Mauuiaijk
and Family Relations" by lighting baseness
