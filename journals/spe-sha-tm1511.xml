TOBACCO.
Having read so much on the tobacco question, I thought I would put in my mite. I
had been a slave to it more than twenty years,
and ought to know something, about it and its
effects. Many times I would have given
almost anything I had to get rid of the appetite.
In due time the Lord led me to see in reality
the evil there was in it. I then promised the
Lord that provided my health was as good
without as with it, and he would give me grace
to overcome it, I would quit it, and if not.
that I was at liberty to use it again. I can
truly say that my health has been better, and
my nerves are more steady to-day than they
were twenty years ago. Bless the Lord, he
gives us the victory. In less than a week
all desire was gone ; and to this day, when I
think of it my heart says, bless the Lord.
^Butalas, so few are Mailing to make the sacrifice. They all confess that it is a filthy and
evil practice, yet they cling to it�not only
church-members, but ministers ; and some of
them must have spittoons in the pulpit.
Shame ! Be careful, brethren, how you spend
the Lord's money.�Abraham Mumaw.--><pb n="241" id="p3" TEIform="pb"/><!--CONTENTS.

                            enjoy in this world, and as I was among the first in this country who received this precious
                            treasure from Mother Ann Lee, and became personally acquainted with her, I feel it my
                            privilege to maintain her testimony and bear witness of her character and ministry. I lived
                            iu New Lebanon at the time of the great revival of 1779, when religion seemed to call the
                            attention of almost all classes of people. I was then fifteen years of age ; and though I
                            sometimes attended their meetings, and was not without serious impressions; yet I made no
                            profession of religion. I considered it no trifling matter to profess to be a Christian and
                            not be one in reality. I could not consider myself one ; because I knew I did not follow
                            Christ. Nor could I see among all the professors, any one that I thought did -follow him as
                            I believed a Christian ought to do. When I heard of Mother Ann and her companions, and was
                            told of their faith aud testimony, and the manner of life they lived, I felt a serious
                            impression on my mind that they were the people of God, and I had a desire to see them. I
                            soon found that the reports which had made such an impression on my feelings, had produced a
                            very different effect upon my parents, and filled their minds with prejudice against the
                            people and their religion. Though the opinion of my parents did not alter my feelings ; yet
                            as I was young, I thought it best for me to keep still and say nothing till I could see them
                            and judge for myself.<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>It was not long before I had an opportunity to
                            visit them at Watervliet, in company with other young people from New Lebanon ; and was soon
                            convinced that they were, indeed, the true followers of Christ. "We spent the Sabbath and
                            attended their worship ; saw the power of God among them, and heard their testimony, which
                            made a solemn impression upon all of us. Many of our company had been very light and carnal
                            while on our way ; but they returned with very different feelings. On our way home, all were
                            solemn, silent and thoughtful; scarcely a word was spoken by any of the company. None
                            doubted of its being the work of God; nor did they hesitate long in making their choice. I
                            embraced the testimony with full confidence, and confessed my sins. I was then sixteen years
                            of age, and have ever found cause to be thankful from that day to this. By faithful
                            obedience to the precepts of Mother Ann, I have been saved from sin, and have been enabled
                            to walk in the straight and narrow way, of selfdenial and the cross which Christ and his
                            apostles taught. In this way have I walked, and this cross have I borne for nearly forty-six
                            years, and maintained my faith with an unshaken mind. It has proved to me a treasure more
                            valuable than mountains of gold : nor would I exchange the name of a Shaker, and the
                            heavenly treasure I possess with it, for all the kingdoms of this world. With regard to
                            Mother Ann, who was so much abused and persecuted while living, and whose character has been
                            so scandalized by the wicked, I can truly say, I bless God that I ever found such a Mother.
                            I can testify before all people, that I ever found her remarkable in all piety and
                            godliness, and a swift witness against every propensity, and every thing that pertained to
                            the depravity of nature. She was faithful in strengthening and confirming the feeble,
                            relieving Ilia buffeted, comforting the afflicted, cheerk-g the sorrowful, building tip the
                            good, and purging out the evil. In her common deportment she was meek, modest, reserved and
                            thoughtful; yet free and open in conversation when occasion required, and her words were
                            words of wisdom. I really loved and feared her more than any person I ever saw. I loved her
                            testimony and the blessed power of God which attended it; for it was life to my soul; yet
                            that which was ungodly in me would often tremble at her presence. I then believed her to be
                            a woman chosen and anointed of God, and endowed with the spirit and power of Christ. By the
                            increasing light and understanding I have received, and the continual support I have felt
                            from the same heavenly and Divine Spirit, I have been constantly confirmed in my first
                            faith, without a doubt. As to Mother Ann's religious character and conduct, I never felt
                            under any necessity of going to her enemies for information, nor of listening to the tales
                            of slanderers, "who know not what they say, nor whereof they affirm ;" because I have had
                            sufficient opportunity of knowing for myself. I have heard, seen and felt the true and
                            genuine spirit of righteousness which she displayed in all her words and actions. I have
                            seen her undaunted and composed even in times of the bitterest persecution, and saw her meet
                            her en-<pb n="243" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> raged persecutors with a calm and unruffled countenance. I was
                            a witness of the cruel persecution which took place in New Lebanon, wheu Mother and the
                            Elders were so shamefully and cruelly abused. I was at George Darrow's when that riotous mob
                            assembled and surrounded the house. Mother and the Elders had been some days in the
                            neighborhood, visiting the Believers from house to house. They had been to Jabez Spencer's
                            in IStephentown, and on their return, accompanied by many of the Believers, they called and
                            visited several families on the road, where they were detained, and spent their time in
                            singing and serving God till a very late hour. When they arrived at the house of George
                            Darrow we all arose and thankfully received them. We had a joyful and happy meeting. Mother
                            was very bright and cheerful, and her soul seemed to be filled with divine power and love.
                            She displayed nothing but godliness in any of her conduct or conversation. After much
                            exercise, the night being far spent, Mother retired to a small room on the lower floor, and
                            the Elders up stairs. I was very early in the morning employed in the kitchen, with a number
                            of the Sisters, in preparing breakfast and putting the house in order ; and we had nearly
                            finished our work when the mob came. The house was at that time neat and clean and all was
                            still and quiet, when suddenly we were beset on every side by unprincipled men in mob array.
                            The rooms below were nearly filled with the Brethren and Sisters, who endeavored to keep the
                            mob out; but regardless of remonstrances or entreaties, they rushed in like furious tigers.
                            A number of them burst into the kitchen and furiously assaulted the Sisters who were
                            collected there. We strove with all our strength to keep the mob back, but in vain. They
                            seized and hurled us out of doors, one after another, with the utmost violence. I was thrown
                            out and beaten severely. Many others of the Brethren and Sisters shared the same fate.
                            Several doors were broken to pieces ; the ceiled partition of the little room where Mother
                            had retired, was torn down; and she was hauled out and thrown into the carriage without
                            ceremony. Two of the young Sisters followed her. The mob then drove furiously to Eleazer
                            Grant's abusing all who attempted to follow her. Mother Ann was cruelly and shamefully
                            treated. Indeed the inhuman conduct of this mob was such, that I should really think any
                            persons of character would shudder at the thought of having their names exposed to the
                            public, as being concerned in such wicked transactions. The appearance and behavior of the
                            mob was indeed, more like intoxicated madmeu than like sober, rational beings. When they
                            left the house it looked shockingly. Mother Ann's deportment was perfectly upright; and as a
                            passive sufferer in the hands of a cruel mob, no person could justly accuse her of the least
                            impropriety. It is true she did not fear the mob ; nor could they compel her to yield to any
                            of their unjust requirements. Knowing her own innocence, and conscious that she was doing
                            the will of God, and feeling confident of his divine protection, she could not fear the
                            wicked ; although she expected to suffer abuse from their hands. Had she been guilty of the
                            base things<pb n="244" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> charged against her by her enemies, they would have had no
                            occasion to continue their accusations down to this day ; for both she and the Society which
                            she planted would have been sunk in oblivion many years ago. "The tree is known by its
                            fruit; and a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit." This testimony of the gospel which
                            Mother Ann planted in the midst of so much opposition, has weathered the storms of
                            persecuting malice, and I am thankful that I am able to bear witness of it: I know it will
                            forever stand, " and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            the name ; a place where father and mother, brothers and sisters dwell in love and peace,
                            and sound of discord should never enter. This should be the condition of every earthly home,
                            but the blessings of a gospel home far surpass all the joys of earth. A home where each
                            inmate is pledged to give all his strength to upbuild gospel purity and love. They may have
                            come from different nations, yet, making the love of Gol their guide, they seek to lay aside
                            all incongruities of habit and disposition and mold themselves to the one pattern of love
                            and good will. Our Christian communistic home is a place where all are striving to rise from
                            that which is immoral or unchristian, and forsake all that pertains to worldly mindedness
                            even the life of generation, which in itself is good, being ordained of God as the seed time
                            for the continuance of the race. But now has come the harvest when those who are ripened for
                            the heavenly garner, are being reaped from earthly conditions and gathered to the home
                            above. Above earthly, sensual desires ; though still on earth, yet above earth's elements or
                            attractions. Here is found the bread of life which feeds the hungry soul, here flows the
                            fountain of living waters, where all may drink to a fullness, and freely bathe until made
                            pure and white, free from all the stains of sin. We would invite all who are truly sick of
                            sin, and earnestly desire to " lay their heavy burdens down," to seek this home, " beyond
                            the wind and tide " of earthly strife, and find that peace and rest their spirit's crave. As
                            all we possess is dedicated and consecrated to the service of God and his people, we have no
                            right to appropriate aught for selfish purposes. Neither may we admit those who merely wish
                            a worldly home where they can be cared for in their infirmities. Those who wish to be
                            shielded from disgrace, still have no desire to relinquish the life leading thereto, need
                            not seek admittance to our gospel home for those elements would soon destroy the order and
                            harmony of heaven itself. Rather let such take their fill of the fading pleasures of earth
                            until their souls are glad to seek the mercy of God. But to the humble and penitent soul the
                            offers of salvation are free, for the mission of the Christ Spirit is to save people from,
                            and not in their sins. Therefore we rejoice that we have found the " new and living way, "
                            where the old life is no " more remembered, neither comes into mind. " Here we are called to

                            of the best mediums ever brought under natural inspiration. His physical, moral and
                            circumstantial qualifications were happily adapted to his remarkable intuitive capacity. He
                            came forward in life a young man uncontrolled by others before he was of age. He was of
                            noble lineage, great powers, strong mind, ardent love of character, strict moral integrity,
                            and his sweetness of disposition inspired for him love and universal respect in all circles
                            of Society, in a manner extraordinary. He was born to move among the highest aristocracy at
                            the French Court. At the age of nineteen he was in public ; and among the millions of
                            Frenchmen none had more fairly entered the road to earthly glory and honor. Before he was
                            twenty years of age, he was commissioned in due form to hold rank in the French army. It was
                            at this period that the American Colonies were struggling for independence. Prince William
                            of England w-is making a tour through France, near where Lafayette's regiment was quartered,
                            and was guest to a French Nobleman in that neighborhood, and one of a select number invited
                            to dine with him. The loquacious English Prince though among the more liberty loving
                            Frenchmen commenced an unreserved conversation respecting the American war. Perhaps none at
                            the table but himself had any definite knowledge of the character of that struggle, or the
                            true object the Americans were contending for. With Saxon frankness the Duke talked the
                            whole matter out without the least duplicity or covering. There is no believer in inspired
                            cause and effect but would discern at a glance that his caution was controlled, his
                            perception beclouded and his descriptive powers excited by some higher presiding agency. He
                            is reported to have been very eloquent, candid, and to have represented the Americans an
                            oppressed people struggling for liberty, though he seemed unconscious of what he was doing.
                            Deep down in the soul of the youthful Marquis lay slumbering a noble patriotism, unbounded
                            liberality, a universal love of his race, and a disposition which would prompt him when
                            rightly inspired to sacrifice treasure, and pour out his blood like water in defense of the
                            rights of man. The story of the Prince, and the spirit which inspired it, thrilled the
                            inexperienced soul of Lafayette like holy fire. It awakened the budding powers of his
                            manhood, and aroused the newer and greater qualities of his being into action. In
                            contemplating the man, to many then he seemed quickened and transformed into a new being. He
                            seemed suddenly<pb n="246" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> to have developed the wisdom of a sage and the courage
                            and daring of a hero. He soon presented himself as the champion to help crush out tyranny,
                            that human freedom might be erected upon its ruins. He seemed moulded for the very age in
                            which he lived ; his whole career in the new and old world, and the part he took in both
                            proves it. On the world wide plane upon which he acted no man ever had a better opportunity
                            to show the weakness and blemishes of the human character; but though moving among the most
                            varied and corrupt masses, and effecting the most fearful overturns, his character through
                            life, for consistency, firmness and moral virtue ever stood untarnished. Lafayette's first
                            interview with Washington goes far to prove that he was a strong medium, passing review
                            under the severe inspection of a Master spirit of the same organization. With a board of
                            Officers he sat down to dine with Washington and before the hour had expired, by careful
                            observation and deep impression his whole character was read, and read correctly, by the
                            great American Chief. Though a child in years, by clear penetration, and the impulse of an
                            incomprehensible inspiration, he was attracted to Washington at all times as to some
                            guardian angel. In him he saw all the qualities of sage, soldier and civilian for which he
                            longed ; and drawing near to the great Chief to study these, he was unconsciously influenced
                            by the same powers, which ministered to the Father of his Country. We introduce this
                            singular man in this manner, to claim that it was not possible for him to enter where any
                            kind of inspiration was agitating human beings without being excited by it. Among the many
                            confidential labors and missions entrusted to Lafayette he was sent from Albany to negotiate
                            with the Indian tribes, to take up the war hatchet for the Americans. In his intercourse
                            with them he commanded their veneration and enlisted many of the red warriors in defense of
                            the colonies. It was on one of these missions as he passed that way that he called on
                            Believers. It was an important period in the inspiring commencement of the latter day. A
                            time when many were flocking to see Mother Ann and the Elders, to hear the gospel
                            requirements and tidings which brought salvation. A period when all became quickened by the
                            power and inspiration which attended the first witnesses of truth who proclaimed Christ's
                            second coming. When the Marquis entered the neighborhood at Watervliet he heard of their
                            meetings and in company with another Officer he called to visit them. Among the Believers
                            there were many who had been connected with the army from the beginning ; some who had
                            joined before, and some after Lafayette had entered the service ; and as both officers were
                            in second regimental dress they were easily recognized. He entered very quietly the little
                            dwelling where they first held their meetings. Some were conversing, some passing in and
                            out, and some were under singular inspired operations, among the most eccentric of these
                            cases were the outward manifestations of Abijah Worster. He and many others were men and
                            Avomen of strong minds, they had investigated diligently, had received faith correctly, and
                            believing that Mother was inspired by higher spirits to declare to them the most
                            self-sacrificing word of<pb n="247" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>God ever uttered, the power which attended her
                            testimony had set them all on fire and all in commotion. According to the laws that control
                            organizations, it was utterly impossible for Lafayette with his singular powers to enter a
                            place with such surroundings and not feel the state of the atmosphere and the electric
                            current into which he had entered. Lafayette was a tall, manly form and was observed by
                            many. He was silently and as busily engaged in closely inspecting the strange scene before
                            him. True to his mediumistic powers and instincts where the most remarkable inspiration was
                            apparent there he was the soonest agitated and attracted. Abijah Worster was at that time
                            under perpetual agitations, jerking, shaking, twisting in sudden convulsions. Seated on the
                            back side of the room Lafayette passed directly through the crowd and quietly seated himself
                            by his side ; to him he devoted his undivided attention. He did not seem attracted to the
                            man but to the power that controlled and moved him. He looked steadily and watchfully upon
                            him, and when agitated and moved, he would lay his hand upon the limbs of the subject thus
                            agitated. By closely observing him at all times, laying on his hands much of the time, and
                            continuing his investigations persistently, it embarrassed Abijah greatly. He said he felt
                            him to be a powerful spirit that brought him into great bondage. Wishing to break this
                            disagreeable spell and find relief from it, and the singular freedom thus taken with his
                            gifts and person he said to Lafayette " You seem desirous of obtaining this power," but the
                            only answer received was, " It is desirable. By this time Abijah became so disconcerted,
                            that he suddenly arose and walked out of the door, and Lafayette rose as suddenly and
                            followed after him. Determined to make good his escape from him, he cast about in his mind
                            what he should do next, and finally went down to the barn, but his investigator followed on
                            and went to the barn also. The condition of the pursued was rendered more awkward, in everj
                            movement the pursuer continued to make,, and to make it appear to the latter that he had
                            business there he seized the broom and went to sweeping the barn, floor, taking all the
                            pains to clean and put the place in order that was necessary ; but the patience of his
                            inquisitorial friend was not to be exhausted, for speechless and motionless he serenely
                            waited to see what the next move would be. The sweeper of the threshing floor now started
                            for the house but close in his footsteps followed the man that stuck far closer than a
                            brother. Resolved to escape at all hazards he lifted the hatchway and walked down into the
                            cellar closely followed by the man who was not to be shaken off for trifles, who descended
                            into the cellar also. The confusion of Abijah at this period of the chase may be imagined,
                            but not easily described, but he rallied and resolved upon one more effort. A rude ladder
                            extended from the cellar to the room from whence they started ; the victim followed ascended
                            hastily but as hastily was he followed up by the unrelenting Lafayette. In all these moves,
                            turns and round-turns nothing like levity or ridicule was apparent in the man, but a settled
                            determination to learn what power or impulse controlled the man and caused these strange
                            movements and<pb n="248" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>commotion in the object of his study. When they returned,
                            Mother Ann and the Elders and others were in the room. By these he was soon drawn into
                            conversation ; and as they became earnest in conversation, Abijah thinking he had already
                            come in for his share of the entertainment seized a favorable moment to slip away. What
                            followed after that he learned from the Brethren and Sisters who were present at the
                            interview Lafayette enquired what the nature of the religious movement among them was that
                            brought so many people together. Mother Ann described to him the work Believers were
                            entering into. That the kingdom of Christ was gradually opening upon the world and many were
                            awakened to see their lost condition and were coming to judgment. That after passing through
                            the work of cleansing they received the spirit of Christ and became inspired with the true
                            light and power of salvation. Lafayette enquired to know why he could not share in this as
                            well as others ; Mother Ann now under inspiration plainly declared to him that his time had
                            not come to share in this spirit. She seemed to enter quite into his case, and informed him
                            that a great work lay before him on the earth plane and that he would have to pass through a
                            wide field of suffering before he could ever receive the gospel of salvation. In after years
                            he may possibly have called the words of this singular Prophetess to remembrance when what
                            was promised under inspiration became a great fact in his sorrowful life. It may often have
                            come back to his meditations as he lay bound for years in the cold dungeons of Olmutz and
                            Magdeburgh. However this may have been, in the bloody struggles of the French revolution or
                            in his exile in foreign lands something of the kind was unquestionably revived in bis
                            recollection when his spirit took its flight from the noble earth form of the Marquis de
                            Lafayette. Many yet remember the startling intelligence that reached America of his sudden
                            death. After his decease was reported in Paris the first packet that came to America brought
                            the sad news, but ministering spirits at the time of his death honored Believers with the
                            first reliable dispatches. I have been informed that the night after his death, one of the
                            Brethren saw Lafayette and others near him in a night vision, and from his own spirit he
                            learned that he had passed into the regions of immortality. Daniel's vision was no more
                            certain to him than this was to the more modern visionist. From the impression made on the
                            dreamer was so confident of the fact that when he arose with the morning he stated without
                            qualification, Lafayette is dead. The statement made its impression, the dream of course was
                            remembered, the date recorded, and when the tidings reached this continent all came out
                            correct and true. Washington was born to break the strong chain which bound the colonies to
                            the old world, Lafayette was led by that power which guides the destiny of nations to join
                            hands with Washington and pass through the first fiery struggle and be taught by his genius,
                            and to drink deeply of his inspiration. Their real labors lay in two hemispheres. Washington
                            ever cherished the same tender recollection of Lafayette that a father would for a beloved
                            son. In the oloody struggle of the French revolution<pb n="249" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> the sympathy of
                            Washington was the strongest power which supported the Marquis ; and while suffering through
                            gloomy years of prison life the toils he had shared and the good he had done under the
                            Father of his country were among his most sustaining recollections. After he obtained his
                            liberty he still toiled on for the welfare of France and died as he lived imitating the
                            example of the man he held dear and who had long used all his influence to obtain his
                            liberation. On the hard fought fields of the American Revolution he formed a tender
                            acquaintance with the old patriots and heroes which gained for America her independence.
                            When his tried soul was released from the fetters of mortality his spirit instinctively
                            turned to his dearest friend Washington and to his old associates in arms of revolutionary
                            notoriety tn this hemisphere. When his stormy life was closed and he was awakened to realize
                            his entrance into the abodes of the departed dead the first consolation he sought was the
                            sympathy and friendship of the noble patriots that first found a place in his youthful
                            affections. In this far off' nation were the dearest objects of his love and here he took
                            his course. Inspiration teaches that many of these spirit friends were then in the work of
                            God in the spirit land. At the head of these stood Washington, who like a guardian angel
                            stood ready to gather into the order of redemption all who had suffered and bled with him in
                            defense of the rights of man. It would seem certain that many of these early friends, like
                            ministering spirits hovered over the dying couch to soothe the last agonies of the noble
                            French Hero. No doubt they were anxious to conduct him to that resting place where they bad
                            found the treasures of immortality and eternal life. And when his soul had broken the
                            fetters of clay they tenderly conveyed him to their own resting place. Mediums in Zion in
                            vision had informed us that they have often seen him thus associated. They have told us of
                            revelations, and have presented gifts which they received from the spirit of Lafayette who
                            with a noble band of patriots had become true children of God in the spirit land. Harvard,

                            Christian who loves it, and lives it each day. Such are true leaders and their examples are
                            the lights that are illuminating our pathway and destroying the power of sin and darkness
                            that surround us to-day. Those self-sacrificing lives, devoted to God do not live for the
                            enjoyment of selfish indulgence, but are guided by a benevolent love for humanity. Such have
                            helped to mature and give strength to the formations of all good Institutions, wherever
                            located. All are in obedience to the will of God, when the purpose is to counteract the
                            depravity of our natures and raise the soul to a better condition. Just so tar as the spirit
                            of Christ rules that body, it will be under the blessing of God, He allows us to make our
                            homes as we may wish to, with many or few, provided we live in love and obedience to his
                            commandments, have love erne for another, and are pure and peaceable. All such have helps to
                            mature and give strength to the great truth which will when souls are prepared to receive
                            it, give to the mind that rest and repose, that is far beyond all the treasures of earth.
                            Until a soul has within itself a reverence for God, and a love for his creatures, can it
                            feel and know the happiness arising through the exercise of charity, love and sympathy, they
                            move in action all the finer feelings of our natures. They enable us to look with compassion
                            and sympathy on those whose lives have not fallen in pleasant places, and give to the soul
                            that meekness and affection that draws the soul to it. Let us bear ia mind that our sphere
                            of action here is not only to benefit ourselves alone, but all or any who wish to live the
                            life of Christ and his followers.

                            This is the impression that rests upon my spirit. As the tongue is the mouth piece, so it
                            will speak the heart-throbs. As the Spring time is the season for sowing the seed for the
                            temporal or physical support so is youth the spring with each individual for sowing the
                            seeds of a virtuous life, forming- those principles and habits that mark the perfect man or
                            woman. In gaining these principles there is something higher to reach after than the gaining
                            of earthly fame or power. There are victories over self to be won, there are treasures of
                            immortal inheritance to be gained which will brighten and adorn the spirit through all
                            future life. If this happy condition can be gained by self-abnegation and true self-denial,
                            to me it is well worth the sacrifice. How truly apparent it is that humanity needs the
                            spiritualizing process, needs to cultivate the devotional spirit which lifts the soul above
                            the narrow confines of the little selfish circle of Me and Mine into a condition of harmony,
                            an atmosphere of purity where they can claim a relation with the angels. An eminent mind
                            ence said, "Give me the first twenty years of your young<pb n="251" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> people and I
                            will be responsible for the remaining years. " Habits that are formed within the period of
                            those years make a life's impress. As our education is largely taken from books and
                            periodicals how necessary that we select the right ones. Books and papers do more to
                            determine the mental abilities and tastes as well as to form the character and disposition
                            of their readers than perhaps any other ca.use. How important it is young friends that your
                            minds be directed to, and by the choicest of earth's literature. The reading of weak,
                            sensational literature never did and never will prepare a boy or girl to become a loving,
                            helpful and tender hearted self-reliant man or woman. The perusal of blood and thunder
                            stories filled with tales of strife and horror, not to speak of the evil reports of gross
                            wrong doing on the part of their heroes, is not calculated to awaken deep thought concerning
                            the duties of life. A wise consideration of the future, a desire to be noble and grand in
                            character, and to build up a self made practical existence, is the condition and the faith
                            of the true Christian. " Where there is no vision the people perish." "Hands at work and
                            heart to God" is a revelation from God to the true disciple of Christ. It is a self-evident
                            fact that without faith in a spiritual ministration the people run into infidelity and
                            materialism. My young friends, " Character is the eternal temple that each one begins to
                            rear yet death can only complete : the finer the architecture the more fit for the dwelling
                            of Angels." Our life deeds form our character. Habits formed in early life either elevate,
                            strengthen and lift up, or dwarf or degrade the spirit. They will be our judges or accusers.
                            A bad resolution broken is far better than kept to the dishonor and shame of the individual.
                            To covenant with death is to make a bad resolution and then to keep it regardless of the
                            tender feelings of your instructors. Dear young friends ; to you we are looking as our
                            successors. We expect you to occupy some of the important positions that awaits your
                            generation. To do so successfully you must know how to handle the great problem of life. It
                            is so enwrapt with every interest, public and private, moral, social and religious, that you
                            cannot escape one or the other. If you meet them wisely and honorably let your principles be
                            thoroughly based upon truth and well understood. Rather suffer wrong than do wrong. Two
                            wrongs never made a right. In the day of trial you will show how much you have of the spirit
                            of Christ. If you can extend the forgiving love of God to your erring Brother or Sister for
                            the insult received, you are strewing your path with flowers and building up that eternal
                            temple which is to be your home when you drop the mortal form.

                            life blood of our heart and the very spiriTof our existence. "It is not he who says Lord,
                            Lord, but the doer of the will of God shall be justified." And as every one shall be judged
                            by his works, it is plain and evident, that the true Believers and real followers of Jesus
                            can only be found and acknowledged as such by their works. The only way we can love God, is,
                            to love one another. James ii, 8. " If ye fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture,
                            Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well. " Mark, xii., 30. "Thou shalt love the
                            Lord thy G od with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, with all thy mind, and with all thy
                            strength, this is the tirst commandment. And the second is like this, Thou shalt love thy
                            neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. " Matthew declared
                            xxii., 40, that on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Every
                            intelligent man<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>and woman must come to the conclusion, that the true
                            meaning and chief subject of all the sacred writings are contained in these two simple
                            sentences. As there is only "One Lord, one faith and one baptism, " it is certainly a matter
                            of the greatest importance to ascertain, who are in possession of this one faith and who
                            make their love manifest to God by their works, loving their neighbor as themselves ! It is
                            obvious and must be admitted, that this can be effected and carried out only on principles
                            of the strictest equity aud equality, true fraternity, charity and love. It follows, as a
                            matter of course, that all sects and denominations, no matter what their name, who do not
                            come up to this standard, are false. The primitive Christians set us an example, how to
                            live, and to love one another, by having all things in common, in a joint interest, no one
                            seeking anything better than others, all living and carrying out the principles of equity
                            and equality. It fell to the lot of the writer of these lines, to live in the world before
                            coming among Believers 29 years. I resided aud came in contact with five different
                            nationalities : German, French, English, Americans and Spanish, have carefully examined
                            their dogmas, doctrines and general profession of religion, but when I considered their
                            works, with the exception of Believers, (Shakers,) I found written on the wall " -mene,
                            inene t'eJcel upharsin" that is, weighing in the balance, but found greatly wanting. I
                            joined our community in the month of August 1840, just forty five years ago, and am nearly
                            seventy five years of age. It must be admitted, that during such a lengthy privilege among
                            Believers, I have had sufficient experience, to find out, who are actually the true people
                            of God, and who are not. The first commandment of our Savior is self-denial. " If any one
                            will come after me let him deny himself, take up his cross, (against the lust of the flesh,
                            the lust of the eye and the pride of life,) and follow me. " That is, live exactly as he
                            did. Now to come to the point on this all important subject. If any one of my beloved
                            Brethren or Sisters, or any one of our friends, has found a denomination, sect, or people,
                            who as a body live and follow the life of Jesus, they have found what I never could find ;
                            but since I came among Believers, I became intimately acquainted wTith many who follow after
                            and live the life of Jesus. " That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the
                            sight of God." Lk. xvii., 1;"). Does not darkness cover the earth and gross darkness the
                            people ? They do not see the veil, the covering which hangs over all nations, that under the
                            illusion of being married, they can violate the laws of nature with impunity. Shall men and
                            women, created in the image of God, violate the laws of God? Was not the lust of the flesh
                            the cause of the fall of Adam and Eve, whose first offspring was a murderer, was it not the
                            cause of the flood, when all flesh corrupted its way, except the righteous family of Noah
                            who were perfect in their generations, was it not the cause of all war and bloodshed, that
                            ever came upon this earth ? Can any one be so benighted, as not to perceive, that most all
                            the calamities and miseries, that ever befell mankind, were caused by their carnal
                            propensities, and consequently the curse of God did follow? We find in Revelation xxii.,

                            modified or regulated, they have to be annihilated, extirpated, for as our blessed Mother
                            Ann declared, "To taste of the forbidden cup is to drain it, and to drain it is to die." "To
                            be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. If ye live
                            after the flesh ye shall die, but if through the spirit you do mortify the deeds of the
                            body, ye shall live. " Rom. viii., 6. 13. As in Adam all die, (or who live in the work of
                            generation,) so in Christ (who introduced the regeneration, which is right the reverse ot
                            generation) shall all be made alive. 1 Cor. xv., 22. To conclude, I wish to say to all our
                            friends who have any desire to live a pure and holy life; The prodigal son has returned to
                            his Father's house, the fatted calf is killed, and there is music and dancing. My time of

Psalms cv., 15. We have evidence to
                            believe the Order of God is more perfect in its organization in this day than it ever was in
                            any preceding age of the world, of which we have any knowledge. During the dark ages and
                            even in Christ's first appearing, it was a one-sided thing, because it was all in the male
                            order they only saw in part and prophesied in part, because only a part was revealed in that
                            day ; but in this day of Christ's second appearing, through Mother Ann Lee, the " urim and
                            thummim, " light and perfection have come, and that which was in part is done away. Woman is
                            as fully established in the order of God, by divine Wisdom, as was the man. Two of each sex,
                            when the order is full and complete. Thus the spiritual house of God is four square, equally
                            balanced, and on all sides equal. Thus the foundation principles were laid in the first
                            millennial church formed at Mount Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y. in 1792, of which all other
                            churches of " like precious faith" were but branches of this. This church has stood almost
                            one hundred years, in tact, without a schism, and stands yet, and is like to withstand the
                            wreck of time ; because it is founded on the Hock of revelation, of Christ's second
                            appearing its principles are divine, and cannot be overthrown. It is built on the divine,
                            and not on the human, i. e. It is built on the divinity of Christ, and not on his humanity.
                            That which is divine is eternal, and abideth forever. Moral reformers will yet be delighted
                            to find in this church a living example, an embodiment, of all their reforms, especially,
                            the " equality of the sexes," practically illustrated and thoroughly tested, by long
                            experience, and found to be superior to anything in the natural order. Mother Ann of her
                            self, was not divine, she did not claim to be, but<pb n="255" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> the revelation of
                            Christ through her was divine, and this revelation of Christ's second appearing, which can
                            no longer be questioned, was that which gave her the pre-eminence over all other women. She
                            was the first and only woman of the human race, that was perfectly redeemed from the fall,
                            while in the body. The first born among many Sisters. The Lord's Anointed�pi*oved by many
                            infallible proofs, and testimony of living Witnesses. In the spiritual order of Grod it was
                            necessary, that two of each sex should be appointed, that in the absence of the first, the
                            second might fill the vacancy, that the body might not be left without a head, and the
                            church never be left without a visible lead. Each sex stands first in its own order, and on
                            its own side of the house, except by mutual agreement. If any man or woman undertakes to
                            govern both sides of the house in this day, independent of the established order, it will
                            fail. I have seen this tried, and proved a failure, in every instance, and always will. Why?
                            Because it is built on the human, and not on the divine. And God will not own and bless it.
                            It is building up the elements of the world more than the spiritual order of God. " Touch
                            not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm, " was a sacred and divine injunction. Thus the
                            order of God is established in this day of Christ's second appearing, forever more to stand.
                            It is to be perpetuated by a regular line of succession. Noah was the order of God to the
                            ante-diluvians, and as they treated him, so God treated them. So, it will be with the
                            present generation ; if they heed not the warnings given through the order of God in this
                            our day.

                            this ; " The mill streams that turn the clappers of the world arise in solitary places. "
                            How many noble souls have blest the world with their powers of good, whose humble beginnings
                            few may realize. As this is true of the moral world, so also of the physical. From the
                            developing of the giant oak, to the unfolding of a blossom, under the subtle influences of
                            light and heat, they reach perfection, without ostentation and without show. We gaze upon a
                            lovely flower, it reveals a vision of beauty to our minds, but when we reflect that its
                            beautiful life has been boi-ne to it on the wings of solar light, it not only becomes
                            lovely, but wonderful. In all the vast laboratory of nature, the subtle laws of Alchemy are
                            continually changing gross particles of matter, into the most beautiful forms, and their
                            silent workings, still remain mysterious and undiscovered. I have recently read an incident
                            referring to silence, which to me, is very interesting. "Many years ago there existed at
                            Hamadan in Persia a celebrated academy. One of its principle rules was expressed in these
                            words. The academicans must ' think much, write little and talk less.' It went under the
                            name of the ' Silent Academy ;' there was not a scientific man in the kingdom who did not
                            aspire to the honor of becoming a member. A certain Doctor, and a man of great science,
                            heard that there was a vacancy, and he determined to apply for admission ; upon arriving<pb n="256" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> he humbly requested the honor of filling the vacant place, but, it
                            was already tilled. The President arose, and, with an appearance of great disappointment,
                            silently showed him a goblet full of water, so full that one more drop would have caused it
                            to overflow. The Doctor saw at once that he was too late ; but, without giving way to
                            despair, he thought how could he convince the President that an extra number would not
                            effect the well being of the rest? He saw at his feet a rose leaf, which, picking up, he let
                            fall lightly on the surface of the water, so lightly that not a drop escaped. Every one
                            applauded the ingenious response. The ride was, to have but one hundred members, but this
                            was laid aside, and the Doctor Avas received with universal joy. After he had inscribed his
                            name, he wrote on the margin of the book, the figures 100, which was that of his new
                            colleagues; then putting 0 before the figures he wrote underneath, ' they will be worth
                            neither more or less.' The President answered the modest Doctor with much politeness and
                            presence of mind, placing 0 after 100, thus making it 1,000 he wrote, ' they will be worth
                            ten times more. ' " Silence is a virtue, and should be cultivated as such; some persons are
                            naturally so noisy and obtrusive, that levity and wit appear to be the ruling
                            characteristics of their minds, and apt we are to tliink that no good thing can flourish
                            there, though often we are happily mistaken. On the other hand, some are so habitually
                            silent, that it grows into moroseness, seeming to possess no mental sunshine by which to
                            cheer the hearts and lives of others; therefore, moderation in all things is much the better
                            way. We cannot overestimate the advantages of silence. Many wonderful facts in science have
                            been brought to light, by the persistent and silent researches of the thinking mind, and
                            lofty thoughts, aspirations and impulses have found birth in the silent chambers of the
                            heart, that have developed to noble efforts for the uplifting of humanity, while God has
                            crowned them with success. One has truly said that " Silence is the perfected herald of joy.
                            " Who has not felt this in the silent hour of communion, when the soul's aspirations are
                            reaching upward for an inward perception of the Divine ; at such moments we realize a
                            foretaste of blessedness that is of God ; we also feel a vital influence impelling us to
                            toil and struggle for the truth and right, assured, that only through a life of practical
                            goodness and ardent effort can the soul expand in spiritual growth and loveliness. A life of
                            goodness is a life of silent praise, more audible in the ear of God than those mighty deeds
                            which cause nations to tremble. To do our duty in the sphere assigned us, to unfold those
                            God-given powers of the mind and soul that have ennobled so many humble lives without
                            aggrandizement, should be the end and aim of our being. We may thus feel assured, that our
                            lives of silent goodness have not been altogether in vain ; but, like the way side stream
                            has refreshed many a weary traveler on the journey of life ; and when we silently cross the
                            river of death to join the blest immortals in eternity, we may not receive the applause of
                            the multitude, but that which is far better, the blessing of God, the benediction of His
                            holy angels and the approval of our own conscience. Mt. Lebanon, N.

What a beautiful, spiritual name, embodying as it does such
                            wonderful possibilities. u Fear not little flock for it is your Father's good pleasure to
                            give you the kingdom for which you contend." The whole world, for ages, has bees familiar
                            with that class, that have entered upon the field of battle with weapons of warfare, and
                            that have mercilessly contended with each other for the mastery of the kingdoms of this
                            world. The dominant spirit of man has, to a large extent, been on the side of personal
                            selfishness, and every obstacle has been thrown from the way, that would in the least,
                            prevent the accomplishment of this purpose. As was the ferocity of the lion and the tiger,
                            and in fact of every wild beast, so has been that of man, among men. It was, indeed, a low
                            and savage st-ate of existence. Admitting that the fighting quality as found in man, is good
                            in its place, and necessary for the natural, wild man that he was, it is by no means the
                            only good thing, and possibly not the best that he received from the hands of his Maker. To
                            secure his right among the beasts of the field, he in common with them must fight for it,
                            and the same warfare has been maintained with his own race, so that his history has been one
                            of wars and rumors of wars. But we are living in an age when we can very readily accept this
                            remark: " Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and
                            afterward that which is spiritual. " The Apostle now urges us to enter the warfare that is
                            not carnal, to fight the good fight of faith, and lay held on eternal life. This takes us
                            into an entirely differ ent element from the natural, fighting man. We are now to "Put on
                            the whole armor of God. " This is a spiritual work, and instead of contending for a
                            government over others, it becomes a warfare against the passions that rule<pb n="259" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> in our mind, and we soon find that prayer is the Christian weapon which will
                            overcome all opposition to the spirit of God. With this preparation from ou high, Ave are
                            now soldiers of the cross of Christ. Not in name only, not in the beautiful external
                            appearance, not because we have chosen to call ourselves Christian volunteers, but in that
                            we have made ourselves ready and willing to contend earnestly for the faith. Whatever may be
                            the trials or crosses whatever may be the privations or persecutions, this warfare must
                            continue from day to day and from year to year, till all the kingdoms of this world shall
                            become the kingdoms of our Lord. After having received the armor of God, to lay it aside,
                            would prove ruinous. Our mission is a never ending battle against the sins of the world, and
                            this warfare must be, as was that of Jesus, the Christ, so aggressive that the Scribes and
                            Pharisees may be alarmed for the safety of their own temple, and for the foundation upon
                            which they stand.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>SANITARY</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Physiological aphorisms" TEIform="index"/>PHYSIOLOGICAL APHORISMS

                                        consumption is laid before the age of twenty-five years; in women, during their
                                        teens. 2. The hereditary element is not of special account as a cause of
                                        consumption, as less than twenty-five per cent of cases are clearly of
                                        consumptive parentage. 3. One of the ruling causes of disease and premature
                                        death, in large cities, is found in that exhausting strain of the mental
                                        energies in the struggle for subsistence�a death-race for bread. 4. Insanity
                                        runs m families ; but, as in the case of family likeness, it sometimes overlaps
                                        a generation or more. 5. Personal resemblance entaih like characteristics of
                                        mind and disposition. (&gt;. A current of the purest air from the poles, for
                                        half an hour, on a person sleeping, sitting still, or over-heated, is a
                                        thousand-fold more destructive of health and fatal to life than the noisomeness
                                        of a crowded room or vehicle, or the stench of a pig-sty for thrice the time. 7.
                                        To exercise in weariness, increased by every step, is not only not beneficial,
                                        it is useless and worse than useless ; it is positively destructive. 8. As no
                                        good traveler, after having fed his horse, renews his journey in a trot, but
                                        with a slow walk, gradually increasing his pace, so in getting up to address an
                                        assembly for a continued effort, the first few sentences should be uttered in a
                                        low, slow tone, gradually intensified, otherwise the voice will break down in a
                                        very few minutes, with coughing or hoarseness. 9. A growing inability to sleep
                                        in sickness is ominous of a fatal result; in apparent health, it indicates the
                                        failure of the mind and madness ; so, on the other hand, in disease or dementia,
                                        a very slight improvement in the sleeping should be hailed as the harbinger of
                                        restoration. 10. No one can possibly sink if the head is thrust entirely under
                                        water, and in this position a novice can swim as easily as Avalk, and get to
                                        shore readily by lifting the head at intervals, for breath. 11. Intense thirst
                                        is satiated by wading in water, or by keeping the clothing saturated with water,
                                        even if it is taken from the sea. 12. Water can not satisfy the thirst which
                                        attends cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea and some other forms of disease ; in fact,
                                        drinking cold water seems, to increase the thirst, and induce other disagreeable
                                        sensations; but this thirst will be perfectly and pleasantly subdued, by eating
                                        a comparatively small amount of ice, swallowing it in as large pieces as
                                        practicable, and as much as is wanted13. Inflammations are more safely and far
                                        more agreeably subdued by the application o* warm water than of cold.<pb n="260" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> 14. Very excessive effort in a short space of time, as in
                                        running, or jumping a rope, etc., has repeatedly caused instant death, by
                                        apoplexy of the lungs, the exercise sending the blood there faster than it can
                                        be forwarded to the heart, and faster than it can be purified by the more
                                        infrequent breathing on such occasions. 15. No disease ever comes without a
                                        cause or without a warning; hence endeavor to think back for the cause, with a
                                        view to avoid it in future, and on the instant of any unpleasant bodily
                                        sensation, cease eating absolutely until it has entirely disappeared, at least
                                        for twenty-four hours ; if still remaining, consult a physician. 16. The more
                                        clothes a man wears, the more bed covering he uses, the closer he keeps his
                                        chamber, whether warm or cold, the more he confines himself to the house, the
                                        more numerous and warm his night-garments, the more readily will he take cold,
                                        under all circumstances, as the more a thriftless youth is helped, the less able
                                        does he become to help himself.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Hall's journal of health" TEIform="index"/>Hall's Journal of Health.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="For patience vining" TEIform="index"/> FOR PATIENCE VINING.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Boyle, Katie" TEIform="persName"/>KATIE BOYLE.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Go rest from thy toils, faithful pilgrim, For the cares of thy earth-life are o'er; Go reap

                            sound, As the skillful knitter plies, And the changing needle flies. O'er the bended finger
                            joint Spins the yarn to gleaming point, In and out, each stitch is caught Seemingly without
                            a thought. Now she sits with steadfast gaze, As if lost in thought's deep maze; Still the
                            work is borne along Like allegro speed in song; Automatic as the time, And as true as
                            perfect rhyme. Lo ! she muses on the past, Memory's shadows are recast, Varied pictures come
                            and go Like a panoramic show ; Shuttles speed, and spindles twirl, Wheels are flying with a
                            whirl, Feet are pacing on the floor Just as they were wont of yore, Drawing out a fibre
                            fixed That is not with shoddy mixed; Warp and woof the weaver takes Firm the fabric that she
                            makes. Spinning, weaving, happy sounds Where the love of home abounds; But, it proves a
                            passing dream, " And things are .not what they seem, For those halcyon days have flown
                            Onward to the dark unknown. Still one industry she'll hold Of the blessed days of old, With

                            invented other ways, Which have wrought with greater speed Goods that meet the present need.
                            Manufactures fill the land, Over-plus the great demand, Makes the operatives poor, And in

                            estate, Fills the land with crime and hate. Angel justice ! hast thou flown Far away to

                            evenings, long and drear Pass away with pleasant cheer; Labor sweetens every hour With its
                            hallowed life and power; Dissipation finds no place In this home of love and grace; Wealth
                            of heart, of soul and mind Are with industry combined; And the muses with delight Often to
                            their feasts invite, While the nimble fingers time Stitches to the passing rhyme.
                            Drawing-room with music's charm Has its avenues of harm ; Envy, jealousy and pride Turn the
                            heart from love aside, And where social castes arrayed, Harmcny cannot pervade. But, in
                            blessing, we are blest, All united, toil is rest; And with sweet communion crowned, Love,
                            and home, and heaven abound. Thus we meet�with noble aim� Duty's high and holy claim.
                            Consecration rules each hour With her blooming wand of power; Hearts that keep her laws of
                            grace Nothing sinful can deface. Thus, are all the threads of thought In some precious work

                            tried, and the prayer that would save a soul may be restrained and hangunuttered on the
                            lips. When Peter placed his foot in faith upon the water, he felt it firm as the solid rock,
                            and he walked; he feared, and he sank, and would have perished but for the timely
                            interposition of the ever-watchful and loving Master. Fear exaggerates and misrepresents. It
                            sees lions in the way that are lambs, vultures that are doves, mountains that are molehills,
                            trials that are mercies. Courage conquers all things, and makes the path of duty easy and
                            delightful. The coward dies a thousand deaths, the brave only one, and that covered with
                            glory. Nothing in this world is gained without the courage to endure pain and hardship. The
                            merchant works and wearies himself to attain a perishable good. The mariner is oft exposed
                            to death in storms. The warrior dares the deadly rain of bullets, and seeks victory and
                            success at the cannon's mouth None complain of mishaps or danger, but shield themselves with
                            an invincible courage to reach the goal of their wishes and hopes. And shall the Christian,
                            who has the covenant and the promises of God as his shield, be deterred from duty amid
                            threatening danger? Nothing can harm him. Even the fiery trial of the Hebrew children
                            resulted in their coming forth from the furnace unscathed, with not even the breath of fire
                            upon their garment. Faith must effectually banish fear if we would gain the mastery and
                            surmount the most frowning obstacles in our pilgrimage heavenward. Be assured we shall not
                            reach the "Delectable Mountain " without first passthrough the " Slough of Despond " and the
                            " Valley of Humiliation, " and encountering all the obstacles which met the Pilgrim in his
                            progress to glory. " In this world, " says the divine Redeemer, "ye shall have
                                tribulation.',<pb n="262" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/>But why need we fear? If faith be regnant, if the
                            love of Christ constrain us, all difficulties vanish, toil becomes a pleasure, the yoke easy
                            and the burden light. In the extremest depths of trial, if faith can but compass the
                            assurance that "all things work together for good, " the abomination of desolation is but a
                            dissolving view, and when passed we see erected on its site a Bethel. The huge trouble, the
                            Alpine sorrow overhung with clouds and thick darkness, becomes a moiintain of beatitude.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Burchard, S. D." TEIform="persName"/>S.

                                    parents. Not only is it a growing evil, but one that leads to untold misery and
                                    threatens to sap the foundation of the family, of the church, and of our nation,
                                    however strong it may be. Young America is becoming too independent and too smart to
                                    have any regard for the parental command ! At the age of five the self-sufficient
                                    youth may frequently be heard to say, " I won't do it, " in reply to the command of
                                    his loving mother. A little mismanagement on her part and a little resolution on
                                    his, and the son is his own master. This accomplished, he is ready to travel rapidly
                                    on the downward road to ruin. Swearing must be begun at once ; lying must follow as
                                    a matter of course, so as to conceal other wicked deeds ; smoking and chewing will
                                    make the boy more like a man in his own opinion. But this will not suffice to admit
                                    him in the society of " the boys, " and since he does as he pleases, drinking comes
                                    next. Now he can associate with " anybody," but his perverted passions and wicked
                                    desires drive him with accelerated speed to destruction of body and ruin of the
                                    soul. What a fearful calamity ! A young man ruined himself and perhaps irretrievably
                                    influenced many companions. What a wide and deep chasm between such a sinful life
                                    and a life of usefulness and devotion to the cause of truth ! Where did it all
                                    begin? Certainly not in the middle of the chain of wrong doing, but at the beginning
                                    of it�disobedience to parents. No doubt some boys are ruined because the fault is
                                    entirely their own ; but in the majority of instances the parent is to blame for the
                                    first dangerous step taken by the child. A.

                            before us, Heb. xii., 1. The Apostle Peter speaking of persons "who walk after the flesh in
                            the lust of uncleanness, and despise government "says, " These are wells without water,
                            clouds that are carried with a tempest, to whom the mist ot darkness is reserved forever " 2
                            Peter, ii., 17. The Sodomites were spoken of by Jude as " Clouds they are, without water,
                            carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth without fruit, twice dead; plucked up
                            by the roots. " Jude 12th. This word is a Hebraism, and used to denote witnesses, or, media
                            of representation, in this sense, when applied to the coming of Christ, it is in the same
                            sense in which we use the word "staff" when speaking of the sub-officers of the General of
                            any army. CONQUEST, hew far powerful. Individuals, no more than nations, cannot thrive by
                            mere conquest; that is, power over other souls. There must be progress in the bosom of the
                            Church, also, or, she cannot thrive. Religion, to thoroughly permeate life, must be
                            domestic. Like the patriotic fire which makes a nation invincible, it never burns with
                            inextinguishable devotion until it burns at the home hearth. Mt. Lebanon, N.
