possessing the unity, variety, and interest of a
magnificent poem. It deals with a series of
facts and exhibits a gallery of characters, which
to have invented would place its creator by the
side of Homer ; and which to realize and represent in the mode Mr. Prescott has done, required a rare degree of historical imagination."
ALL PRAISE. "This

                            Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders go on a gospel mission to the state of Mass, On the 4th of
                            May 1781, Mother Ann and the Elders left Watervliet, N. Y., to visit the state of Mass. This
                            had beeu a subject of contemplation for some time. Daniel Wood, of Upton, Mass., had opened
                            the testimony to hi&amp; frieads and neighbors and some of them had already received the
                            faith. Agreeably to a gift from Mother Ann, Daniel had been preparing the people for the
                            reception of the Believers. Mother Ann was accompanied by Elder William Lee, Elder James
                            Whittaker, Samuel Fitch, Mary Partington and Margaret Leeland. A few days previous to this
                            date, Jonathan Slossou had beeu sent to the home of Benjamin Osborne, on Tucconockf mountain
                            with orders to wait for a further gift of God. The first visit was made at this place, where
                            all of the Believers were very kindly received. Several families had fully embraced the
                            faith and testimony. On hearing of the arrival of Mother Ann and the Elders, all the
                            Believers in the neighborhood, and some from a distance, gathered to hear the word of God.
                            Those who had believed were strengthf Now called Mt. Washington in Berkshire Co., Mass.<pb n="266" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/>ened in the truth, while several more were added to the faith. On the
                            Sabbath there was a large body of people iu attendance, besides the Believers. The spirit of
                            God was manifested by much outward operation and testimony against the sins of the world. A
                            spirit of opposition was also present. Dr. Hollibert attempted to dispute with the Elders
                            but did not succeed. As they would not enter into a controversy with him, he soon Avearied
                            himself and left the place. Although there were many evil persons present, no acts of
                            violence were committed. After tarrying in this place ten days, Mother Ann and the Elders,
                            bid their dear friends farewell and passed on to Enfield, Conn., and called at the residence
                            of David Meacham. Their arrival aroused the people of the town and the Believers were
                            threatened with persecution by mob violence. They however, remained in the place about one
                            week, during which time many persons came to obtain information about the religious work.
                            Several persons accepted the faith and made a confession of their sins to God. This
                            awakening enraged their ungodly neighbors, who to vent out their spirit of darkness were led
                            to denounce the sacred testimony with the stigma of delusion. As the Believers had no desire
                            to seek persecution, they concluded to leave the place and proceeded on their journey
                            unmolested. They next visit the residence of John Maynor, in Grafton, Mass. With this family
                            they remain three days, and then pass on to the home of Daniel Wood in Upton, Mass., and
                            remain over the Sabbath. On Tuesday they reach the home of Zacheus Stevens, in Still Eiver,
                            and on Wednesday the home of Isaac Willard where they tarry one week. Meetings Avere held in
                            all these places and the word of God preached with zeal and power. After arrangements had
                            been made for the reception of Mother and the Elders, at the "Square House" in Harvard, the
                            company moved on to that place and made it their residence. Here they were visited by
                            persons from every section of the country where the testimony had extended. They continued
                            to preach the gospel, and to administer the power of salvation and eternal life to all who
                            Avere Avilling to receive it. Here Mother Ann found the place and the people Avhich had been
                            shown to her in vision, Avhile in England. During the residence of Mother Ann and the Elders
                            in this place, the gospel Avord and Avork had a rapid and extensive circulation. They
                            visited many places Avhere the testimony had been preached, particularly, Shirley, Littleton
                            and Petersham. The Believers passed through many scenes of tribulation and suffering, in
                            their labors to plant the gospel of Christ, and to nourish and strengthen the faith of all
                            who had accepted' the cross. They spared no pains, day or night, in teaching and instructing
                            the people, and in ministering the power of the resurrection to lost souls. The blessing of
                            God attended their labors and multitudes followed them from place to place, to hear the
                            words of living truth, and to partake of the power which accompanied their ministration.
                            These things so alarmed the spirit of evil that the Believers frequently suffered
                            persecution and sometimes <pb n="267" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>were abused shamefully. Soon after Mother Ann
                            and the Elders reached Harvard these acts of persecution began to be manifested. As many
                            persons came through honest intentions, to seek after truth, so also many came from time to
                            time with a caviling spirit, to search after evil and if possible to overthrow that which
                            was good. At one meeting a large persecuting company assembled and even came armed with
                            clubs and other weapons of cruelty. They pretended that they came to attend the meeting and
                            to hear what the people had to say. Being unwilling to admit such characters into the house.
                            Elder James requested them to assemble in the yard. Taking his Bible he read selections to
                            them after which he delivered a discourse, and then very kindly dismissed the company. This
                            seemed to have a very salutary effect and they all retired without offering any abuse. Near
                            the close of the month of July, 1781, a report Avas circulated in the town of Harvard that
                            the Shakers had come with seventy carriages and six hundred stands of arms; that they were
                            enemies to the country and had come to aid the British in the war against America. It was
                            also asserted that a man by the name of Whitney had seen a chest of fire arms at the Square
                            House. These reports alarmed the weak and ignorant and served as a pretext for the enemies
                            of the truth, by whom they were fabricated, to vent their wicked spirit and to urge that the
                            Shakers should be driven forcibly from the town. Others of more candor, and consideration
                            were willing to inquire into the matter and ascertain the truth of such vague and doubtful
                            reports. Ephraim Davis, captain of militia, soon after this, collected his company and
                            informed them that he had heard such and such reports concerning the Shakers, and that he
                            intended to go and see whether they were true or false. "If they are true" said he, k I
                            .-hall see to them, but if they are false, I shall not molest them. " Their first request
                            was to have an interview with the Elders to whom they stated a full account of the reports
                            that were in circulation. Elder James Whittaker then suggested that he would speak to the
                            assembly, to which the captain very readily consented. " I understand from your Committee
                            that this large representation of the town of Harvard, has been informed that the Shakers
                            have in their possession concealed weapons of war, and that these weapons are in the Square
                            House. "�You are incorrectly informed. We have no weapons of war. We are not enemies to the
                            country. We are a harmless, inoffensive people. We do not want to injure any man either in
                            person or property. We want no man's silver or gold, but want only their souls to God. If
                            yoti believe the reports you may have full liberty to search the house or any other
                            building. " This speech had a salutary effect on the candid part of the assembly, but those
                            who were enemies of the cross, after searching, in vain, to find any weapons of military
                            warfare, or anything to warrant the reports, were still unwilling to relinquish their
                            design. Seeing the truth afforded no pretext to molest the people, they were determined to
                            proceed upon any pretext which their enmity might suggest. In accordance<pb n="268" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> with this state of feeling, the Committee ordered the Believers to leave the town. Elder
                            James Whittaker remarked, " We came here peaceably, and we can say as did St. Paul, ' We
                            dwell in our own hired house.' " After the company had indulged in some more unkind words
                            they began to leave the place, without having committed any violence. Some concluded to
                            remain till evening, and said they should like to hear the Elders speak their faith. Elder
                            James while addressing the company was interrupted by a rude fellow in the crowd. Elder
                            William Lee requested them to be silent or peaceably withdraw. Elder James continuing his
                            discourse spoke of the necessity of confessing and forsaking all sin, and closed with these
                            words. " If you believe and obey these words, it will be well with you, but if you disobey
                            them you must answer to God in judgment." At the Square House where Mother Ann and the
                            Elders had their residence, there had been no stores of provisions laid up, and though a
                            large nun*ber of people came to visit them, and crowds were fed, almost daily, yet through
                            the abounding goodness of God, they were never known to lack for food. Mother Ann felt that
                            it was the duty of Believers to provide for their temporal support, and not always be
                            dependent upon the hand of Providence. She then spoke to one of the Brethren concerning
                            these things and reminded him of the small quantity of provisions on hand with which to feed
                            so large a body of people. " We are fed, " said Mother Ann, "by the hand of God. A great
                            many people come to us, bringing but little, yet they are fed and have plenty. It cannot
                            always be like this. " She then asked the Brethren to devise a plan to procure bread for the
                            multitude. Although grain was scarce in Harvard, Jonathan Slosson knew that it was plenty in
                            the town of New Lebanon, N. Y., and in Hancock and Richmond, Mass., and offered to go and
                            solicit a contribution. Reuben Harrison was selected to accompany him. The Brethren called
                            upon the Believers in the above named places and made known the circumstances of the little
                            church of Christ in Harvard. By the kindness and liberality of the Brethren and Sisters, a
                            good supply of grain and other articles were obtained. On the return of Jonathan and Reuben,
                            Mother Ann and the Elders kneeled in thankfulness to God, for such a manifestation of faith
                            and liberality in his people.

                            stretched out for the relief of the poor sufferers. In this we see God is a God of mercy as
                            well as of justice and truth. Hell and destruction is not the law of our God without mercy.
                            This was manifest in past ages, and is manifest in this day. Admitting that the spirit of
                            antichrist has commenced his second reign upon earth and history is repeating itself; what
                            better condition of things could we expect under an infidel power ''until the indignation is
                            past" which is manifest in these calamities which are the natural elements combined�Air,
                            Earth, Fire, and Water which are God's agencies which he has employed in all ages of the
                            world, for the punishment of crime, and workers of iniquity. The day is come for all to
                            beware at what fountain they drink and with what spirit they unite, for many false spirits
                            have gone out into the world, and will, if possible deceive the very elect. And as the
                            testimony of Noah condemned the old world, so does the testimony of Christ's second
                            appearing condemn the present generation.

Several thousand years ago, the wise man of the
                            East, declared there was nothing new under the sun. History, and its recorders repeat the
                            fact; and nature, the oldest, and truest of all teachers, bears its truth through all her
                            treasured volumes. Even the fresh bright robes of Spring, are woven of fabric as old as
                            Eternity ! The same water that supplied rivers andjoceans in ages past, and then blest the
                            earth, descending in gentle showers, or in copious rain-falls, or bursting forth in bubbling
                            springs from her deep boscm, has continued to bless the earth and the inhabitants thereof
                            ever since : it may have formed many new channels, but the material is the same. Activity
                            has kept it pure, and it comes to us ever as a new gift. Each individual inherits the germ
                            of every faculty possessed by uny of the human race, and these must be developed in all by
                            the same changeless laws of progress. The inventor, thinking he has something new in the art
                            of mechanics, seldom offers the product of his toil to the public, but A, B, and C, coming
                            in from different sections, are ready to bring forth similar improvements, attesting that
                            the idea was first theirs ; and history bears record of ancient nations where the same
                            principles had been in service in far superior development, for centuries previous.
                            Excavations in our own New Country so called, bring to light ruins of cities and peoples
                            long since extinct, and bear undeniable evidence of high civilization, and traces of arts
                            and sciences there buried, which have not as yet been re-discovered by the now existing
                            races. And what of literary and spiritual attainment? It has been said that "a new verse in
                            literature, is as rare as the appearance of a new star in the constellations of
                            heaven,'"�and it must be apparent to any acquainted with ancient writings, that the product
                            of mind to-<pb n="270" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> day. only reflects the light that illumed the pages of the
                            past. The poets of the present, reverberate the strains of lofty thought that pulsed the
                            minds and hearts of bards in ancient time. Media of long ago, beheld glimpses, and were
                            gifted in prophecy of that Millennial Day that has so gloiuously dawned upon our souls, and
                            for whose blessed increase, the Saviors now risen on Mt. Zion, are toiling. Many beautiful
                            chapters in our own Bible, and in the sacred writings of other nations, although written in
                            different periods, and in tongues unknown to each other, prove the unity and antiqui ty of
                            Truth, and how actively it circulates through the universe of Soul, vitalizing and supplying
                            the elements of growth, to the immortal part, as do the pure waters that intersect the land,
                            giving fertility and life thereto. Again, in studying the personal history of individuals in
                            whom the earthly life has been supplanted by the development of the higher, angelic part;
                            wheth- | er this growth has been attained by souls struggling in isolated conditions, or in
                            community relations, as did the Essenes, and those of the Pentecostal church, or within the
                            cloistered walls of monasteries and nunneries, or even in the more advanced relations of the
                            Shaker Order, we cannot fail to observe the simularity of spiritual experience, and the fact
                            that one common cross, and the same rugged highway awaits every one who would reach the
                            celestial heights of conquered self-hood. This echoing of the past, must ever continue ; no
                            one can hope for a new thought, or experience, until having advanced beyond that which has
                            been attained by any predecessor, and even ( then it will only be shadowed from
                            intelligences still beyond, in higher spiritual spheres, for God alters not. and human
                            nature remains the same from age to age. But the mind is a germ of God, it is endowed with
                            the capacity of limitless unfoldment and expansion, and religion, the vitalizing principle
                            of the soul ever operates to refine, elevate, and liberate it from the chains of error and
                            death. It is this, that prompts the deep yearning and ceaseless struggling of the spirit to
                            reach the divinity which gave it birth, where aspirations mingle with inspirations from the
                            deep springs of Truth, whose waters impart new life eternally. Thus truth, although the most
                            ancient, and all comprehending reality, is also the newest because it is the force of
                            activity that keeps all things within its power, ever new. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            shall in no wise enter the kingdom of Heaven." Matt, v ; 20. This admonition was spoken by
                            our Savior to a few humble fishermen who bravely left the narrow circle of separate family
                            relation to be co-workers with him in establishing on a much broader basis a new order of
                            life among mankind. Although Jesus found in the Jewish church a great deal that was wrong,
                            it seems that he also found righteous individuals, since of one he said: "Behold an
                            Israelite in whom there is no guile." Yet notwithstanding the good which existed among the
                            Jews, our Savior said to his disciples, "Unless your righteousness shall exceed theirs ye
                            shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.' Who were the Scribes at?d Pharisees do
                            we ask ? Biblical history informs us that the Scribes were a class of men specially educated
                            for the purpose of preserving and expounding the sacred writings. They were called also the
                            schoolmasters of the nation. Their influeuce was great and the co'mmon people held them in
                            high repute. The Pharisees, however, were a numerous and dominant sect of the Jews, who
                            professed sanctity and close adherence to all the external forms of piety and for which
                            strict observance of the traditions of their fathers, expected to inherit the kingdom of
                            heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Yet from Bible record we learn that they drew nigh
                            unto God with their mouths and honored him with their lips while their<pb n="272" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>hearts were far from Him. And iu vain did they seek to worship Him, teaching for doctrines
                            the commandments of men. So we perceive that neither the great nor good deeds performed by
                            this class of persons could be accounted for righteousness to those who were called to
                            follow Christ. This reminds us of the prophecy of Isaiah concerning the order of Christ's
                            kingdom, the beauty and righteousness of which should exceed all others. When we compare the
                            Law written by Moses the acknowledged guide of the Jews, with the teachings of Jesus to his
                            disciples, and which all who followed him must embrace, we understand more fully the
                            difference between the two orders, of life. The Savior said he came not to destroy the law
                            but to fulfill it. Yet it is as plainly affirmed that he was the end of the law to as many
                            as believed on Him for righteousness' sake. Throughout his whole sermon on the mount, when
                            he refers the listening multitude to what was said by "them of olden times," he closes each
                            reference with the emphatic,�"but I say unto you." Would it not be well for us to study more
                            wisely and pray to understand wherein our righteousness exceeds the righteousness of those
                            who make no profession of following Christ, lest when we come to the Christ spirit seeking
                            greater truth we go away sorrowfully as did the young man who came to Jesus inquiring : "
                            What good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus first cited him to the law which
                            reads,�Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not bear false witness. He answered, "All these
                            things have I kept from my youth up." The Savior looked upon him lovingly and remarked, "Yet
                            lackest thou one thing. If thou wouldst be perfect, sell all thou hast and distribute unto
                            the poor, and thou shalt have treasures iu heaven, and come follow me. " What! go and sell
                            all that he had ! All that the law had permitted him to retain? Sell all? Give up his claim
                            to the righteousness of the past? The righteousness that the wise and good has ever approved
                            ? Yea, all this and thine own life also, if you Avould follow me in the new order of
                            spiritual progress which I (Christ) came to establish, was the decision for this young man,
                            and by the same sacrifice shall we meet the approbation of God. In this way only shall our
                            righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, is the plain
                            declaration to all who would be true Christiaus in this day of perfected light and progress.

                            devoted to the good of humanity.] Milford, Hopedale, Mass., May 17, 1842. Henry Todd, Dear
                            Friend and Brother :�Your inquiring letter of the 23rd. April came duly to hand, and found
                            me so "careful about many things," and so "cumbered with much serving" that I delayed much
                            too long returning an answer. We have just made a very humble commencement of our grand
                            experiment. About forty persons great and small have taken up their abode on an estate which
                            we call Hopedale, in the town of Milford about two miles from my former residence iu<pb n="273" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> Mendon. Fraternal Community No. 1 consists of about sixty members
                            about equally male and female besides numerous children and dependents. We were barely able
                            to purchase a run down farm with a mill power on it, one large old two story dwelling-house
                            one hundred and live years old, two barns and other out buildings all on the decay. The farm
                            contains 258 acres, mill power pretty good, considerable fruit, capabilities good. To
                            purchase and1 stock this farm and make some little preparation for building has cost us from
                            five to six thousand dollars. We begin at zero, and hope to rise by slow degrees. We are now
                            all lodged under one roof and fed from one table in love and peace. Thus far we have
                            realized less perplexity and more good than could have been reasonably expected. Our hearts
                            are firm, our faith is strong, our hands are willing. We feel that our principles and plan
                            are heavenly, and that our heavenly Father is with us to bless this work of our hands. We
                            distrust nothing but the waywardness of our own souls. We are afraid of nothing but sin. If
                            we adhere to our profession with a good purpose of mind, we are sure that the gates of hell
                            can never prevail against us. We Hre digging, pruning, plowing, planting, gardening,
                            repairing buildings, putting up or rather preparing to put up new ones a few, and doing what
                            we can to iive out of the products of our hands. We have ten or twelve men and several boys,
                            three carpenters, one printer, and the rest farmers and lazy reform ministers, a pretty
                            happy company of working men, about the same number of the other sex. We are a plain sort of
                            people determined to live out and realize practical Christianity. Come and see us, if you

                            are social beings, and we ought to be united in a practical Christian society, the

                            join ours till you can swarm off to a better location. It is true we are so poor at present
                            and have so little accommodation that we ought not to ask you to come and reside with us at
                            once. We can only ask you to be getting ready. I think you could be exceedingly useful to us
                            and that we could be of some use to you so soon as we could come to a full understanding and
                            get into co-operation. Our constitutions are all gone but one copy or two. We mean to print
                            a new edition forthwith. There are several other things which we mean to print, that you
                            should see. I will pick up what I can and send you. Would you like to receive our little

                            be without a copy. The origin of the present unsatisfactory private property system in land;
                            the long struggle between productive industry and unproductive capital�the employe and the
                            employer�through many generations, is given in a good spirit and after a wise method. The
                            author abjures war and all destructive contention, while he advocates a peaceful
                            re-organization by means of universal equal education, in place of the present system
                            unequal class education, which teaches neither morality, hygiene, nor industry. Upon the
                            basis of the common inheritance and possession of the common and necessary elements of
                            existence�laud, air, and water�he wrould reconstruct Government, as the machine of the
                            sovereign people. Cummunistic and co-operative associations, including a very full, friendly
                            and liberal notice of Shaker Communion, occupies a large space in the book. It shows that
                            might not right, was the origin of private property in land. That the land being held, in
                            unlimited quantities by the minority, the majority became either their chattels or their
                            wages slaves. As chattel slaves they had food, lodging, clothing and work. As wages slaves,
                            they had neither. They are beggars. As hirelings, they compete with each other in begging a
                            privilege to labor upon the land, or iu the factory. As tenants, they beg for a house to
                            live in ; as paupers, as a last resort, they beg for a temporary home iu a poor house ;
                            whilst as tramps, they beg for everything, and steal when opportunity offers. As landless
                            poor, in crowded tenements, they die by the thousand. In some districts at the rate of
                            ninety in one hundred, before they are five years of age. They die for want of work, land,
                            room to live in, air to breathe, proper care and food to eat. They have not the raw material
                            to spend their productive labor upon. Iu America, the majority have the power iu their own
                            hands to establish society upon the basis of natural rights. God has given the earth to all
                            human beings from which, by their labor they can derive their subsistence. All have equal
                            rights to the life elements�they being the raw material. Hitherto, by superior and class
                            education, the few have monopolized the land and made slaves of the majority. And by
                            universal and equal education the laborers will monopolize the land and make slaves of the
                            minority, the non-producers and they will become beggars. This condition is already attained
                            by Believers. Why may it not be reached by the rest of mankind? Published by Thomas B.

                            extent of their departure from God in so doing, they would abhor their own flesh�"all tribes
                            of the earth would mourn, " wall and lament their lost condition and roll in dust and ashes,
                            crying and praying to Gud for deliverance. Joy would cease and pleasure vanish, and if they
                            could see no way of hope of release they would sink in despair. All the judgments announced
                            \ y prophets for the destruction of wickedness, and the correction of evil-doers, would seem
                            a light burden, compared with the heavy woe of sin that rests upon them. All the afflictions
                            of the righteous, and the suffering of the martyrs of all ages would seem less grievous to
                            endure. Yea, even the cross of Christ would lose its barren and forbidding aspect, and be
                            embraced with rejoicing, as the sure precursor of freedom, light, and happiness. They would
                            be ready and willing to part with all that is dear to the carnal mind that they might be
                            delivered from their strong enemy and obtain the better and lasting inheritance of the
                            righteous. The Beast with seven heads and ten horns,�the m.an of sin, sitting in the temple,
                            and opposing and exalting himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped�the
                            abomination that astonisheth the angel messengers of heaven, making the human heart desolate
                            of God and his light, love and saving power, are faint comparisons. It is truly a black
                            abyss, from whence issues continually, fire and smoke that darkens the Sun of Righteousness
                            and obscures and pollutes the air of the Spirit, converting the heart to stone. The root of
                            this depravity in man, is the " Lust of the flesh " or of natural generation; from whence
                            proceeds the "Lust of the eye, " which desires to see only that which will please the flesh;
                            and the "Pride of life, " which would cover all with a fig leaf profession of sanctity, or
                            of false honor, and exclude that light which searches the heart and manifests the true
                            character of its actions. " God is light�in him is no darkness. " "He that dwelleth in God,
                            dwelleth in light." "That which makes manifest is | light." Souls are not conscious of guilt
                            except they receive that light of God which manifests the real nature of their actions.
                            Hence said the Apostle, "By the Law is a knowledge of sin." Hence also Jesus testified,
                            "this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world. " God having endowed man with
                            a self-conscious power (if volition and reasoning intelligence, termed free agency, without
                            which he could experience no more reward or happiness in doing his duty than does the hand
                            or foo'j for obeying the head, proceeds by enlightening the conscience or understanding with
                            a knowledge of the way of happiness which is life, and of the consequences of departure from
                            the way of protection and blessing. The degree of accountability that rests with any soul,
                            depends upon the amount of this know ledge that is placed within its reach. Hence it is
                            written, "The Priest's lips should keep knowledge.�They should seek the Law at his mouth; "
                            for he is the messenger of the Most High; And of Jesus who was to manifest the light of
                            man's eternal Order, it was foretold, " By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
                            many. " The same spirit, referring to the restoration that would take place under the New
                            Covenant in Christ, said, "I will give you pastors according to my heart, and they shall
                            feed you with knowledge and understanding. " This knowledge or light in the understanding,
                            concerning the way of true happiness, is called "Wisdom, who is a tree of life to them that
                            lay hold of Her. " Every human rational intelligence, (before it prodigal like, sins away
                            its first estate,) is entitled by virtue of its origin, and the designs of Eternal Wisdom in
                            creating it, to receive at some period of its existence (fittest time best known to the
                            Creator.) the fullest manifestation of this Light of Life, that can be made clear to its
                            rational understanding. This superlative manifestation could not be made to man, until the
                            race had sufflciently matured for Christ to appear in human nature, in his perfect Order or
                            " Glory, " to establish among men, the spiritual and eternal Order of the supernal heavens,
                            of which the seed was planted in<pb n="277" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> human nature, when God breathed into
                            man the breath of life. The natural life and Order in which man was first created, was an
                            Order of types and figures, designed to instruct his infant mind by symbols until he was
                            sufficiently grown to enter his ultimate and eternal Order, where the mistakes and errors of
                            inexperience could not be so easily overlooked�which accords with the testimony of Jesus
                            "All manner of sins, and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against
                            the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. " Matt, xii., 31- Because the former is a
                            transgression against the light of shadowy and temporary things but the latter is a sin
                            against the eternal and substantial. As the first " Adam is a figure of him Avho was to
                            come, " that is, of the second man, the "'Lord from heaven," or quickening spirit, which
                            existed with God " before the world was, " so all natural things in their primitive order
                            and creation, were but types or secondary effects of an invisible substance in the eternal
                            world. Hence " The invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being under stood by the things
                            which are made. " Yet "The things that are seen are temporal, while the things that are not
                            seen are eternal. From these premises, scriptural ard rational it will appear that Christ,
                            who was and is the life of the supernal Order, is the real substance and tree of life, of
                            which the nat. ural tree of life, containing the directive light of the natural Order, was
                            but a reflection or figure. Hence we read " In him was life, and that life was the light of
                            men. '&gt; The light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehends it not." Also that
                            the " spiritual rock " which followed the children of Israel in the wilderness, and of which
                            they all ate and drank, was Christ. Hence also Christ is the source of light, is symbolized
                            in the language of Revelation, as the Sun of Righteousness, and the light and genius of
                            nature, being derivative and secondary, is typified by the Moon. In the beginning, the
                            directive liglit of the natural Order was abundant, while man's ultimate or spiritual Order
                            was placed before him as an object of hope to which he might attain by faithfulness and
                            obedience. But man lost the greater part of his light, both in the figure and substance by
                            transgression. Therefore it is written "The entrances of the elder world were wide and sure,
                            and brought immortal fruit. When Adam transgressed my statutes then was decreed what now is
                            done. Then were the entrances of this world made narrow�full of sorrow and travail�few and
                            evil�full of perils and very painful. So I considered the world and behold there was peril
                            because of the devices that were come into it. And I saw and spared it greatly ; and have
                            kept me a grape of the cluster, and a plant of a great people. " The pain and sorrow
                            pronounced upon the woman in child-bearing, while operating as a check or corrective of
                            licentious passions, was the inception or sign of the pain and sorrow that her offspring
                            were destined to pass through in consequence of transgression and according to the laws of
                            origination and transmission, if the mother suffered patiently her offspring would have more
                            fortitude to bear their part. It was also a figure of the increased sufferings of spirit
                            that would be required to bring forth the new or second birth. The flaming swords that
                            turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life, are the fires of tribulation and the
                            cross of selfdenial, necessary to hold that poisonous sensual nature in subjection to the
                            higher life and light of the rational faculties. The thorns and thistles decreed to man,
                            represent the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches, that tend to choke the
                            good seed or light of life, as shown in Christ's parable of the sower. The first effect of
                            transgression upon the primitive pair, was a sense of guilt and shame. The next desire was
                            to conceal their shame from each other, and the third effect was a desire to hide from the
                            liglit, which made manifest and reproved their sin. This is the history not only of the
                            primitive man in Eden, but also of his descendants to this day. Jesus bore witness to this
                            fact, when he said to Mcodemus, " He that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the
                            light, lest his deeds should be reproved, (marg. made manifest.)<pb n="278" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> ral
                            types and figures) for the purpose of introducing the final order of eternal substance, with
                            which the Believer is gradually brought by travel, face to face in open view. 1 Cor. xiii.,
                            12. Jesus was the first to fulfill the whole law of God, so that lie could say, "I do always
                            those things that please Him. " " The Son can do rothing but what he seeth the Father do."
                            "It is my meat and drink to do the will of Him that sent me. " Thus it was his love or life
                            to keep the commandments of God; and "Love is the fulfilling of the law." To love God truly
                            is to love to obey his commandments, and "His commandments are not grievous to those who
                            love, but are life everlasting." Hence in this spirit he could say "I am the bread of
                            God�except ye eat my flesh (word) and drink my blood (spirit or life) ye have no life (of
                            God) in you." Through the power and operation of faith, tie was able to impart or transmit
                            that life to others, so that he could say " He that believeth in me, though he were dead (in
                            trespasses and sins,) yet shall he live, (by virtue of a superior law to that of the natural
                            life which is temporary and perishable,) and "he that liveth and believeth in me shall never
                            die." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                    he would meet the final harvest or judgment of the natural order, when Christ should
                                    be revealed, The holy seed, mentioned in Isaiah vi., 13, which was preserved in the
                                    " grape of the cluster," and "plant of a, great people,'' matured its first perfect
                                    fruit in Jesus Christ who is the pattern of the only kind of character that God will
                                    ever admit to dwell in his eternal kingdom of perfect peace and righteousness, man's
                                    highest destiny. And in him was the justice and perfect righteousness of God
                                    vindicated and made manifest to all that received him. Therefore Jesus testified in
                                    the name of Christ with whose life he had become identified, "I am the light of the
                                    world. .He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of

                                    often sp ;aks worse than the heart feels. It shows more ill-will in the tone than in
                                    the words. It is often in mirth that one gets a voice or a tone that is sharp, and
                                    sticks to him through life and stirs up ill-will and grief, and falls like a drop of
                                    gall on the sweet joys at home. Such as these get a sharp home voice for use, and
                                    keep their best voice for those they meet elsewhere. I would say to all boys and
                                    girls : " Use your guest voice at home. " Watch it by day as a pearl of great price,
                                    for it will be worth to you in days to come more than the best pearl hid in the sea.

                            it is well to inquire where we are as regards prophecy. In the physical, material world are
                            terrific storms, floods, cyclones and tornadoes, with pestilence and famine, to destroy
                            human life aud prospects. In the civil, political world are oppression, mobs, murders, riots
                            and strikes ; society divided into numerous factions and parties, each striving for the
                            ascendency. In the spiritual or religious world is a breaking up of old creeds _andj dogmas
                            ; former traditions and systems of faith and belief are dissolving before increasing degrees

                                transpiring, as some of the would be wise men of the church have voted to themselves a
                                right to a heavenly habitation, and at the same time voted that a certain class, whom
                                they love to call heathen, have no right to enter our Father's house of many mansions.
                                Jt is an amusing instance of assumed authority, which can only end in a display of many
                                words. The penitent heathen will probably go down to his house justified, while the
                                Christian Pharisee stands boasting of his pious ceremonies. Churchal power as manifested
                                in manmade creeds has no vitality which need cause the least anxiety. So long as the
                                righteous man shall receive the righteous man's reward, names, nor sects nor parties can
                                have but little influence in effecting a change. u A good man out of the good treasures
                                of his heart brings forth 2;ood things" whether he be white or black, or whether he
                                lives in America, Asia or Africa. This agitation of an old system of effete theology
                                revives the history of a medieval age, when creedal authority determined through force
                                what a man should believe in this world, and then assigned him a place of happiness or
                                misery in the world to come, in accordance with their own selfish wills. The simple
                                testimony of Jesus is far more preferable. Seek the righteousness that belongs to the
                                kingdom of God, and make not to yourselves, friends of the mammon of unrighteousness.
                                This religious thought of the divine Teacher, pointed unerringly to a life above the
                                pleasures of this world, and this was the saving grace that led the sons and daughters
                                of Belial to become the children of the living God. The growth of goodness in the mind
                                had ever led to the same results. An Israelite in whom there was no guile was certainly
                                on the road that leads to God, and probably quite as sure of successfully reaching the
                                holy city as a sensual Christian might be who worshiped in some creedal church. "If the
                                wicked man restore the pledge, give again that he hath robbed, walk in the statutes of
                                life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live, he shall not die." This promise
                                of God as given by the prophet, was a divine encouragement for every one to lead a good
                                life, to turn from unrighteousness and learn to live with God,�forever. With the
                                privileges of a more advanced age, we are commissioned with greater responsibilities.
                                The light that has come into the world should be a guide in our path, and with this we

                                arrogate to themselves this l'ight, show very plainly what course they would take, if
                                they only had the power to exercise it. In all confidence, however, we may accept the
                                words of Jesus, that whoever �hall keep the commandments and teach men so to do, the
                                same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Let us as the wise virgins have our
                                lamps trimmed and burning, and keep our souls unspotted from the world, that the
                                testimony which has been committed to our charge may not be lost through any neglect on
                                our part. God has given to us an inheritance of which we need not be ashamed ; a new
                                earth and a new heaven wherein shall dwell righteousness and peace. The faithful
                                maintenance of this sacred inheritance is our crown of glory,�our happiness now and our
                                reward of eternal life. </p></div3><div3 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><p TEIform="p"> With this number we close the sixteenth volume of our little monthly. For sixteen years

Many look
                                        upon it as a luxury, and a few shudder at it, conjuring up internal torments at
                                        the name. Children, on the contrary, are only too happy to eat fruit at anytime,
                                        and undergo much discomfort to get it. It is elderly people, or those past their
                                        first youth, who cannot eat fruit and enjoy it. Cooked foods, highly seasoned
                                        meats and alcoholic liquors have spoiled their taste, and in many instances a
                                        ripe strawberry or plum would inconvenience them sadly. But the person who
                                        values health, and who knows a little of the value of fruit, will make it a
                                        point to eat it daily, and on occasions to make a meal almost entirely of it.
                                        Another cause why ripe and wholesome fruits are given a bad name is because they
                                        are eaten at the wrong end of a meal. After many courses of heavy foods and
                                        strong drinks, a few harmless strawberries are indulged in, and then when these
                                        rich foods and stimulating drinks upset the stomach the blame is put on the
                                        strawberry! The real order for fruit is at the beginning of a feast rather than
                                        at the end. A better plan still is to make a meal of stale bread and ripe fruit.
                                        The best meals to be made thus are breakfast or lunch. The bread should be brown
                                        and the fruit ripe and raw. Dry brown bread cleans the tongue and brings out the
                                        flavor of the fruit. Butter on the bread would give its own flavor, or even the
                                        salt in the butter would destroy the pure taste of the fruit. Again, the fruit
                                        should be raw, except in rare cases, as many delicious odors and delicate
                                        flavors are lost by cooking. A meal of brown bread and ripe strawberries,
                                            cher-<pb n="282" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> ries, gooseberries, raspberries, pears, apples,
                                        peaches or grapes should be regarded as a wholesome corrective to high living.
                                        Those who want to be cool in the summer and autumn, and who wish to retain their
                                        mental clearness all day, cannot do better than lunch off fruit and bread,
                                        leaving heavier andsolider food until evening. Children may be given plenty of
                                        fruit, and so long as it is ripe no harm will result; on the contrary, it clears
                                        the complexion and skin, and acts as a laxative and cooler. When children have a
                                        half holiday, and they are in the way at home, you should buy them some fruit
                                        and send them to the nearest park or common or open space, where they can romp
                                        and play, and instead of sickly and often poisonous sweets they may regale
                                        themselves with the fruit you gave them. A picnic party should never start
                                        without a banket of fruit to start the meal. It is astonishing how exhilarating
                                        and enlivening a meal of fruit is, and instead of feeling dull after it as you
                                        do after ordinary food, you feel stimulated and brightened up. It is not wise to
                                        eat raw food too late at night. Fruit is best in the morning. I have many
                                        patients who take an orange, apple or other fresh fruit the first thing in the
                                        morning, the same as many people take their early cup of tea. This early fruit
                                        eating is to be commended ; it clears the tongue and is the cause of laxation.
                                        Many people, some of whom are doctors, are of opinion that autumnal diarrhea is
                                        due to fruit. This is an idea not borne out by facts. I have inquired into the
                                        subject and find that diarrhea is due to meat and fish, but never to fruit
                                        alone. I have experimented on myself, and got friends to test the result of free
                                        fruit eating on themselves, but in no case have I received a report of diarrhea
                                        from it. I lived one day last summer on strawberries, managing to eat seven
                                        pounds during the day, but I had no diarrhea. Other times I have lived on plums
                                        and milk, and have eaten freely of cherries and other fruits in their seasons,
                                        but never had looseness of the bowels in consequence. The true explanation of
                                        autumnal diarrhea lies in the fact that in hot weather flesh putrefies very
                                        quickly, and that during putrefaction alkaloids called ptomaines, are formed ;
                                        these are emetic and purgative, and give rise to very distressing symptoms.
                                        These alkaloids are found in meat at all times, especially in hot weather. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Herald of health" TEIform="index"/> The Herald of Health.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Night air" TEIform="index"/> NIGHT AIR.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">An extraordinary fallacy is the dread of night air. What air can we breathe
                                        at night but night air? The choice is between pure night air from without and
                                        foul air from within. Most people prefer the latter�an unaccountable choice.
                                        What will they say if it is proved to be true that fully one-half of all the
                                        diseases we suffer from are occasioned by people sleeping with their windows
                                        shut? An open window, most nights in the year, can never hurt any one. In great
                                        cities night air is often the best and purest to be had in twenty-four hours. I
                                        could better understand shutting the windows in town during the day than during
                                        the night, for the sake of the sick. The absence of smoke, the quiet, all tend
                                        to make night the best time for airing the patient. One of our highest medical
                                        authorities on consumption and climate has told me that the air of London is
                                        never so good as after ten o'clock at night. Always air your room, then, from
                                        the outside air, if possible. Windows are made to open, doors are made to shut�a
                                        truth which seems extremely difficult of apprehension. Every room must be aired
                                        from without, every passage from within.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Sanitary world" TEIform="index"/> Sanitary World.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The Manifesto, the monthly magazine..."

                                        only come from sympathetic relation with the Infinite. Will you accept a

                                        yourselves through that spirit of love that is universal, and which cannot be
                                        manifested through strifes and discords. The essence of spiritual power is
                                        harmony. A single family in a condition of spiritual unity can stand against the
                                        Prince of Evil and all his powers of darkness. The crown of victory is now

By Arthur Gilman. Boston : The Interstate Publishing
                                Company. Price 60 cents. Large books are not always the most instructive, however
                                entertaining they may be, and a small work with a special purpose is often worth a shelf
                                full of ordinary volumes. That fact is true of Mr. Arthur Gilman's Short Stories, which
                                have a double valne, that of simple interest, and that of teaching readers to think.
                                Although they were prepared forj'oung readers, there are very few who will not find in
                                them much that is of genuine profit. The titles of some of the chapters will suggest
                                some of the details of the boob�� "Names of Countries," "Parts of the Body," "Names of
                                Noises," "Handy Words," and "Dwellings and Other Places." Although not prepared for
                                school use, Stories from the Djctionary would make an admirable book for supplementary
                                reading or study in our grammar schools. Among the many papers that go out from month to
                                month on the mission of " good news and glad tidings," will be found " The Christian, "
                                an illustrated Religious, Temperance, family paper. It contains four papers of 4 pages,
                                each. The Christian, Safeguard, Armory and Common People, and all are filled with
                                interesting and instructive reading. It is a good thing to be able to present a paper
                                for the acceptance of all, old and young, with the assurance in your own mind that
                                nothing will be read of which you need to be ashamed. II. L. Hastings, Editor, 47
