TEIform="persName"/> By Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> WHAT a lesson in life ! Its simplicity and its powers so in contrast. A fable and yet so
                            true. Written to amuse for the moment, it stamps an indelible impression upon the heart. The
                            fable says,�"A man on his daily mission through life carries two sacks. The one in front of
                            him was a receptacle for the faults, or crooked ways of his neighbors, while the one upon
                            his back was a deposit for his own faults." How easy it was for him to see that directly in
                            front, and how utterly impossible for him to see that which was behind him. It might have
                            been much better for the man as well as for his neighbors if he had occasionally changed the
                            position of the sacks, as this would have brought his own errors in sight and possibly have
                            changed the whole course of his life. It may be very true that our neighbors and even our
                            dear friends may have faults that are not agreeable to our minds, and may sometimes seem
                            almost startling, and then what? How about our own faults, our own darling, selfish, crooked
                            ways ? While the sins of our neighbors have been under a crucial examination we become
                            astonisht to learn that some one has made a report of the course of our procedure. A close
                            observation of our own case might many times ameliorate the conditions so essentially, that
                            instead of censure or unkindness, we might be induced to manifest the spirit of charity and
                            then that of love. What says Jesus on this subject? "By this shall all men know that ye are
                            my disciples, if ye have love one for another." Jesus is good authority for this form of <pb n="82" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> righteousness. It is the seal of Christian discipleship and to secure
                            this, there can be no place for malice. Those who live in the elements of the world know
                            quite well that its influences lead to hatred, wrath, strife and sedition, which are the
                            destroyers of peace and happiness among men. On the other hand the elements of a Christian
                            life are love, joy and peace, and those who are interested in the promotion of joy and peace
                            among their neighbors, certainly would not care to magnify their faults, or place barriers
                            in their line of progress. A much better course of procedure would be to accept the doctrine
                            inculcated in the first sermon that Jesus preacht. It is a marvel of brevity, but of just
                            the right length to be of immense value in making a deep impression upon the mind. "Repent
                            for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Those who repented were expected to change their
                            minds. They then must walk in strait paths. As Christians, they must treat others as they
                            would like to be treated. Nothing less than this wTas worthy of the name of a Christian. It
                            was the work of a revival and men needed to have a change in their life work, for the
                            kingdom of heaven was now at hand, and was to be establisht on the earth. Here commenced a
                            new life, and Jesus and his disciples began to pray, "Thy kingdom come." They were anxious
                            to make this demanded change as essential to their present and future happiness. 'kThy will
                            be done on earth as it is done in heaven." People who enter into the spirit of this prayer
                            become "new creatures," and instead of seeing so clearly and so fully the faults of their
                            near neighbors, they soon find that these are vanishing and others stampt with their own
                            signature have become the most conspicuous. Those who are anxious for the coming of the
                            kingdom of God, will make all due preparation for this wonderful event. The tabernacle of
                            God will be placed among men, and God will dwell with them as with his sons and daughters.
                            Is there not great necessity for a consecration of the life to God, for preparing the way of
                            the Lord and making his paths straight? Indeed, this spiritual work must eventually result
                            in a new life and in a life where the foundations will be establisht in righteousness. It
                            would be the building of a new city, where holiness will find a dwelling-place, and where
                            the spirit of consecration will find an abiding home. East Canterbury, N.

                                <pb n="83" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> The soft dark earth from out her heaving bosom Sends up the tender
                            shoots of tree and fern, And early, budc the sweet and lowly blossom, Whose roots defied the
                            winter cold and stern. As spring awaked the latent seed-germs sleeping, From dells where
                            long a wealth has hidden lain, So in my heart I find there is in keeping, Some good to
                            resurrect to life again. My pulses throb in unison with nature! Her Maker gave my being form
                            and birth; And life adapted to each living creature, Links all in harmony with mother Earth.
                            And when the breath of southland comes upon us, When Blue-birds warble and the Robins sing,
                            When gentle showers drop dewey freshness o'er us, 1 hail with joy these harbingers of
                            spring! It is a festival of joy and gladness! My heart would join Creation's rapturous lays,
                            Not keyed in minor tones of pensive sadness, But rich and full the swelling songs of praise!
                            O hasten to the forest girded upland! Where long the trees have rtood so grey and bare,
                            Which now seems vieing with the beauteous lowland, To greet sweet spring in vestments bright
                            and fair. In yonder haunt�'tis nature's quaint seclusion� The low Arbutus trails along the
                            ground, x Blue Violsts and white, in rich profusion, With tiny Hare-bells blooming may be
                            found. The Maple leaves ambrosial nectar's swelling; The Pine and Fir in brighter robes
                            appear; The Ash, the Beech and Chestnut, all are telling, That rosy June her wonted smile
                            will wear. The Shade tree first the vestal garment wearing Stands like a spectre 'gainst the
                            Oak and Bay, Whose dark green leaves with virgin white comparing, Cast sombre shadows o'er
                            the woodland way. The Black Birch tempts us with its twigs so tender, For roots of Sassafras
                            we search the ground, The Sptuce and Hemlock healing juices rendet, For Esculapian balsam
                            there is found. The noble Elm that graces yonder meadow, And towers aloft beneath the sunny
                            sky, With spreading branches forms a grateful shadow, For the contented flocks that graze
                            near by. Soon will the Ash with coral clusters bending, Look like a queen in Orient array;
                                <pb n="84" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> The low Sumac with opening plumes ascending, Skirts all the forest
                            by the hedge and way. The Poplars tall come forth in shining vesture, And Popple leaves
                            still tremble as of old, For nature, true to every form and gesture, Transcends no law as

                            flow from wooded hills, And fragrant as the flower extracted lotion, The air with perfume
                            from their censers fills. The Squirrels pace the outstretched Walnut branches, Their
                            storehouse in its trunk is now quite bare, Instinctively they cast their wistful glances, As

                            in discordant cawing seem to vie, As hither�now the wintry storms are over� To tree-top tall

                            the latter part of June, 1781. They soon came to the "Square House," but were coldly
                            received by the followers of Ireland, in consequence of having been disappointed in their
                            former leader. They said they did not want to be deceived again by a people, whom they had
                            heard held corresponding doctrines to those advanced by Ireland. Before the setting of the
                            sun, Mother and the Elders had gained their love and were made welcome, and ever after found
                            a home and firm supporters in that place while they remained on earth. The house and farm
                            were deeded to Shadrach Ireland and he kept it without conveyance to any one, but as most of
                            the doners or contributors embraced the gospel, no trouble was experienced on this account,
                            till David Hoar made known to Shadrach's lawful heirs the state of the case. The heirs
                            accordingly came and made their demands, putting Mother and the Elders to much trouble, from
                            which they could not get free except by paying a large sum of money. Mother Ann wishing to
                            retain the right of the place paid as her share $144. (one hundred and forty-four dollars.)
                            The other Believers united by their contributions and secured the residence. Some thirty
                            other Brethren and Sisters made contributions to the fund. It appears that the testimony
                            brought forward by Ireland, and manifested by his disciples to the world had served to
                            arouse a spirit of bitterness against it so that when Mother Ann came forth with a greater
                            light and testimony against sin the spirit of bitterness was prepared to oppose it to its
                            fullest extent. While the preceeding work had prepared a people for the gospel who received
                            it with gladness, it had also prepared others to oppose the same testimony, and rather than
                            be annoyed by a testimony which condemned them for their sins it is no wonder that there
                            should be formed a combined force to drive the subjects from the town of Harvard. It appears
                            that these people were prepared to persecute and were one generation older in bitterness
                            than were to be found in any other place where the gospel was planted. By their united
                            exertions they desired, if possible, to overthrow the work of God. The Square House was
                            raised in August, 1769, in the night, and in so quiet a manner that not even their children
                            knew it at the time of its erection. Jemima Blanchard, an adopted daughter of Isaac Willard,
                            who was then living in his family, said she frequently carried refreshments to the workmen,
                            but some one always met her when half way there, so that she never saw them at work but
                            once. Jemima was then about twelve years of age. The principal builders and proprietors were
                            David Hoar, Isaac Willard, <pb n="86" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> Abel Jewett, sen., Zacheus Stevens and
                            Malabar Bean. Several others made small contributions, but the above named persons resided
                            in Harvard and its vicinity. Everything in relation to Ireland was conducted with the
                            greatest secrecy. His followers seldom used his name before each other, but called him "The
                            Man." Abigail Lougee, Shadrach's spiritual companion, was still living at the Square House
                            when Mother Ann arrived. Mother manifested a very tender care for Abigail, who died before
                            Mother Ann left Harvard. The money paid to Shadrach's heirs for the Square House and farm
                            was added to their other property and laid out in building a large and spacious house, which
                            was not long afterward burned to the ground. The Square House was not fiuisht, until done by
                            Believers after Mother Ann's arrival. The South west chamber has pannel work in it now which
                            was done by Shadrach Ireland. The present stair-railing and posts are supposed to be his
                            work. The deed of the house and farm was given to Shadrach in confidence, to be held as a
                            united and consecrated property for the use of those who consecrated it, and for their
                            security in the faith which they had espoused ; but for lack of such specification in the
                            deed, they lost it. The following are the names of the persons who paid toward the purchase

                            Square House was repaired, re-shingled and clapboarded ; the porch on the north side taken
                            away and a new one b.iilt. In 1835 the roof was altered and slated, the chimneys taken down
                            and rebuilt, and considerable work done inside the house. The building, however, still
                            retains its former name, "Square House."

                            our Communal Home, our motto, "All for Each and Each for All," made practical by word and
                            deed, and bringing the same united consecrated spirit into the house of worship, we can not
                            fail to attract pure and heavenly ministrations, which like the morning dew upon the thirsty
                            plant, invigorates our spiritual aspirations, teaching us to endure patiently, the little
                            annoyances incident to life, creating an earnest desire for a love that is higher, broader
                            and purer than is found in the things of earth. If as individuals we fall below our
                            standard, are false to our colors, then the fault is ours and should never be laid at the
                            door of the Shaker Church. Our honored parents suffered too deeply, workt too incessantly
                            and prayed too earnestly for the continued prosperity of their united efforts in
                            establishing gospel principles in consecrated homes to admit of anything but that of the
                            highest regard. They entertained great hope for the future and it is not for us to say that
                            they were mistaken. If Shakerism is yet in its infancy and some of us believe it is, we have
                            nothing to fear. We may rejoice at the progress already made. Nothing should prohibit us
                            from proclaiming the truths revealed to us, remembering it is our duty to sow beside all
                            waters, and in trusting faith and confidence leaving it to a higher power to bring in the
                            returns. The words of the Rev�iator, ' 'Whosoever will, let him come and partake of the
                            waters of life freely," applies to the members of our Church. <pb n="88" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> There
                            may be no compulsion in the gospel of Christ. Brethren and Sisters who claim a relationship
                            are justly entitled by virtue of their uprightness, honesty and fidelity to the best that
                            heart and hand could offer. I would say to every young person, Beware of the sin of
                            ingratitude. It is well to bear in mind that we are indebted to an older class of Brethren
                            and Sisters for many of the spiritual and tempoial blessings which we now enjoy, while many
                            of those have past beyond our mortal vision. Let us remember that the spiritual and temporal
                            inheritance placed in our keeping is not to be used for any selfish purpose. In Christ's
                            kingdom there are no rich, no poor, no higli and no low. In that perfected kingdom the
                            golden rule which is the outcome of the pure, unselfish love by which the disciples of
                            Christ are known, will be in active operation. The doing by others as we would wish to be
                            done by will settle all difficulties between capita] and labor in that kingdom ruled by the
                            Prince of Peace. It will be impossible for strife and contention to exist, and it is our
                            duty as Christians to be cultivating in our own hearts the elements which constitute the
                            kingdom of heaven. We may feel as we often do that our lives are obscure and that other
                            Christian workers are coming to the front, and leaving us in the rear so far as the
                            evangelization of the world is concerned, yet the youngest child in our midst is being
                            taught the very principles which will be prominent factors in this work of redemption and
                            the angel voices are already crying to us,� Zion be no longer dumb, Let thy sons declare
                            What thy wondrous love hath done, What thy daughters share. Of the sacrifices tell, Which
                            the work requires; COf the light, the truth and love, Which the cross inspires. Enfield, N.

                                organizations, I take the liberty to present a picture in brief of how things move in
                                and around our domicile. It is the vernal season of the year, when "Vernal flowers are
                                preparatives to Autumnal fruits." It being seed time we are busy in making preparation,
                                by plowing and sowing, for the future harvest. The earth is attired:� "By the soft
                                season, when descending showers Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flo wei's."
                                If old Tyrant Frost is firmly kept in check and martingal, the indices point to a
                                fruitful season. Sr. Amelia Calver having taken a trip to the United State's Capitol

                                runs against a query, that may not, at present, admit of a definite solution.�Example:
                                Is the earth plane a nursery for producing intelligent individualities to people the
                                spirit spheres'? Were there individualized spirits without first being developt in the

                                of winter, so during the long period of seeming spiritual inertia which, has brooded
                                over the world, vital forces have been concentrating that ere long will find expression

                                present seeming advantages, bear always in mind that no blessing to the individual or
                                community can ever accrue through a compromise of righteous principles. Many before us
                                and with us have set noble examples while some have mist the mark. We are debtors to the

                                that "History of the Shakers" has been put in pamphlet form entitled "A Christian
                                Community." We think it the most agreeably written and, for its length, the most
                                comprehensive of any sketch which has yet been issued. In appearance and worth it is a
                                twin to "Advent of the Christ in Man and Woman," by the same author. The latter is
                                equally graceful, clear and well-adapted for present circulation among refined and
                                intelligent people. Blessings to all who are spreading the light.

As I tried to recall some item of news by which I might interest the members
                                of the Home Circle, and finding none, Sussyi Coolidge's beautiful poem came to my mind
                                so appropriately that I "pass it on" for the benefit of others. "A commonplace life we
                                say and we sigh, But wliy should we sigh as we say? The commonplace sun in the
                                commonplace sky Makes up the commonplace day. The moon and the stars are commonplace
                                things, And the flower that hlooms, and the bird that sings, But dark were the world and
                                sad our lot, If the flowers should fail and the sun shine not,� And God, who studies
                                each separate soul, Of our commonplace lives makes His beautiful whole." Daily duties,
                                enobled by Christlike motives may, like the diamond, be transformed from stones in the
                                pathway to bright jewels in a crown. Housecleaning has been the chief industry during
                                the past few weeks, and the "Little drops of water, and little grains of sand," have
                                found a more practical use than "making mighty oceans" or "forming beauteous lands."
                                Nature's artist is busily at work adorning the hills and valleys about our home. The
                                sweet Trailing Arbutus, which in part recompenses for the long cold winter, has
                                brightened us with its star-like blossoms, and the friendly wild flowers, respond in
                                answer to the "Roll-call," of the sun. The birds are daily holding long sessions of a

                                other welcome spring arrivals was that of Eldress Miriam Offord who alighted at our home
                                and spent a short time with us, but she "spread her wings for flight" and disappeared,
                                ere we had but heard the flutter of her wings. Elder George Clark also spent a few hours
                                with us. We are at present enjoying the presence of our loved Ministry. We would chain
                                the feet of Father Time if by so doing we might hinder his flig ht, and thus make their

                                Sol" in his journey beyond our mountains in the west, before we can capture him. Eldress
                                Lois, of East family, left us, the last day of April for a home in the Sum- <pb n="91" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> mer Land, where we are told the beauties of summer are never interrupted

                                domain. The tillers of the soil are preparing it for the reception of the good seed and
                                will anxiously watch its growth and defend it against its many foes in the shape of
                                weeds and injurious insects. We hope that the harvest will be one that will gladden
                                their hearts. That nature abhors a vacuum is proven by the fact that whatever the
                                preparations may be for sowing the good seed if it is not placed in the ground where it
                                can receive warmth and moisture to cause its latent powers to come forth into a more
                                advanct life, its place will be filled by he tares which will be a hindrance to its
                                development. The harmony that exists in the forces that are denominated the material and
                                the spiritual is such that the line can not be drawn which is to decide where one ends
                                and the other begins. In both there are the seasons of seed-time and harvest, and also
                                the silent winter of rest waiting for the resurrection of the spring-time. May not the
                                present be that season in which our spiritual forces are being strengthened for the
                                coming compaign? The prospect at present is looking favorable for all kinds of fruit. We
                                would just whisper to our good Editor that we planted some melon seeds a few days ago
                                and will guard their growth very carefully, hoping the Editor will make his appearance

                                Julia Kussell. The departure of so valuable a member is only consolable in the sweet
                                anticipation of our future meeting when we exchange the germ of materiality for a
                                spiritual robe of immortality. Living justly and purely, life becomes glorified in
                                Christ. Should grief assail, if out of the waters of tribulition we piss upon the golden
                                sands of moral solidity, we shall receive from the spiritual censor of God's love, soul
                                strength and consolation. Difficulties insurmountable? "Where there is a will there is a
                                way;" and in the wilderness of human imperfection, the ax of industry in the hands of
                                earnest heartedness only hews off all unprofitable branches that disfigure the tree of
                                life: whereas the jump rope of pleasurable ease never rids of that which defileth. Thus
                                in the life of Christ, and with the knowledge of right and wrong which experience gives,
                                no one his an excuse to walk blindly from the way which requires willing service for the
                                good of home and humanity, that tones life to the key of harmony with Christ and enables
                                one to read the notes of Christian service in every law of righteousness, prompting the
                                strife to "go and sin no more." Sister Fanny Fallon has opened the summer term of school
                                with twenty-two pupils. Our maple harvest was very short, consequently the yield was
                                less than that of last year, yet one hundred and ninety-five gallons of syrup were made.
                                Our kitchen garden, under the fostering care of Brother Fred Houndslow, gives promise of
                                a satisfactory yield of good things. While busy hands are active in caring for the
                                temporal needs of our Society, may our lives yield but those fruits which bless Zion and
                                fashion us after the Christ life. George H.

                                another year. Notwithstanding the low price of apples we have taken courage and are
                                setting out two hundred apple trees. Elder William Dumont has planted chestnut trees for

                                by. The young Brethren are setting out raspberry bushes and caring for tomato, celery
                                and cabbage plants and at this time the green-house is much crowded and the many
                                blooming plants make it quite an attractive place. We have nearly three hundred potted

Beloved Editor;�We have just received a beautiful letter from Elder Abraham
                                Perkins requesting a few items from us, as to our present standing. It is now over two
                                years since the first two pioneer Brethren came to this place, and just two years since
                                the Sisters came. Looking back over that time and comparing notes with the present we
                                must say we have been greatly prospered and blest be yond expectation. We have about
                                eight acres of land cleared and in good order for cultivation, two and one half acres to
                                sweet potatoes, two acres to Irish potatoes and the remainder to orchard and garden and
                                one fourth of an acre to pine apples of which we shall receive about seven hundred
                                apples from our first planting. To our main building which is 20x30 feet two lofts and
                                attic high has been added another small building 15x10 two lofts high. As to farming we
                                have done but very little in the original line tho we are now keeping one hundred eighty
                                head of cattle hoping to receive enough to compensate for expense and be able to do more
                                farming. -We are now growing one third of an acre of Cassava root which is destined to
                                be in the future the main crop for feeding stock. The only stock which needs feeding are
                                the horses and milch cows. The main herd roam at large on the ranch and is driven up at
                                night for cow penning. At 9:30 a. m. we have a general meeting every Sunday. Our friends
                                from Order No. 2 are regular attendants this gives us a chance to compare faith with
                                them. They are an open hearted, true and loving people, holding strongly to the
                                principle that all difficulties will finally be settled by the spirit of love. We are
                                resting in hope. If God has intended the building of a city here to his name and honor,
                                we that labor will not labor in vain.

                            dearly loved friend, he fashioned his grief in these beautiful lines,� "Good-night
                            Good-night, as we so oft have said Beneath this roof at midnight, in the days That are no
                            more, and shall no more return. Thou hast but taken up thy lamp and gone to bed; I stay a
                            little longer, as one stays To cover up the embers that still burn." Dearest Sister, thus,
                            we bid thee, a kind "Good-night." There are embers still burning which we must cover, before
                            we retire, and tho the hours may often seem long, we will work with hope, and trust that a
                            glorious, eternal morning will break for each of us, when we shall meet thee in spirit life,
                            never to part.. Thy call was sudden, but it reminds us that "We are but tenants in the
                            Lord's house, we must assure ourselves ol this, for shortly the great Landlord may give us
                            notice that our lease has expired." Wise indeed, are they who live in constant preparation,
                            and can meet this call with a justified conscience and answer, "Lord, thou deliveredst unto
                            me five talents, behold I have gained beside them five talents more." Our departed Sister
                            needs no eulogy of words to portray her character, her example of daily consecration speaks
                            for itself and we know her to-day, as an earnest, devoted spirit. Not alone have her hands
                            toiled for temporal interests, even to the last moments of consciousness, her consecrations
                            for the upbuilding of a religious home, have been manifest to all. While her life was molded
                            by Godly principles, she earnestly exhorted others to the same care. We shall miss her voice
                            which has so constantly joined in the service of God, but we pray that her ministration will
                            remain to bless the labors of her companions. From the young, especially she receiv* s a
                            tribute of deep gratitude; many times have they realized her Christian charity, and none can
                            say they ever failed in duty through her influence. We realize all too deeply that the
                            home-circle has been broken and a gem of worth has been snatched away. We mourn thy absence
                            dear Sister as we would the loss of a beautiful treasure at the zenith of its usefulness;
                            the bereavement is too great. In our grief we turn to our Heavenly Father who knoweth the
                            depth of every mystery, and give thy life into His keeping while we pray for guidance to
                            fashion our own after the pattern of Christ. Rest in peace; already thou hast heard the
                            summons, "Well done, good and faith, ful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." Thy

                                        do not use it to wash in or to drink. For those purposes use fresh water just
                                        drawn, or use from vessels that are already covered either by metal or china or

                                    our perception of what we in our turn owe. There are, it is true, many selfish,
