                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 9.</head><p TEIform="p">In the infancy of the Community, Farming and Gardening were accepted as nece'ssary to the
                            welfare and comfort of the Society, but the first business of the Community by which to
                            obtain a livelihood was the acceptance of several mechanical branches . or trades, which
                            were creditably sustained and proved to be a great benefit to the Society. Both Brethren and
                            Sisters were industriously employed, and the work which they sent out from the Society, was
                            made of the best material, and at the same time nicely finished. Everything commanded a good
                            price and a ready sale. Several persons were appointed to the management of the farm. All
                            the available land was put in use, and crops of wheat, rye, oats, barley, corn, flax and
                            potatoes, soon told of the faithful labors of the workmen. They were quite limited in the
                            number of horses and oxen and many times suffered much inconvenience on this account. Their
                            stock of agricultural implements was of a coarse manufacture. These consisted of wagons,
                            sleighs, ploughs, harrows, scythes, rakes, forks, shovels, hoes, sickles and axes. In the
                            year 1788 the wheat crop was nearly ruined, by the cold and open winter. After it was
                            harvested, the whole Society made an equal division through the several families. The fruit
                            crop was also injured and they were afforded only a limited supply of apples, pears or
                            cherries. This stimulated the Society to increase their supply of fruit, and many acres were
                            soon appropriated to the cultivation of fruit trees. For a few years more, attention was
                            given to the raising of potatoes, and in 1789 some 3000 bushels were harvested for the use
                            of the Family. Since 1848, the gardeners have given considerable attention to the raising of
                            strawberries, and of this fruit we have bountiful supplies. From year to year the improved
                            implements of agriculture have been purchased, which have been of great service in the
                            management of the farm. In 1827 a hay rake, drawn by a horse, was introduced into the
                            hayfield. Those who saw its first work thought it was wonderful and for many years that was
                            an indispensable article. In 1825 a side-hill plough was used on the farm, and in 1856 a
                                mowing-ma-<pb n="50" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> chine, drawn by a span of horses, was taken to the field,
                            and when the ground was smooth it did excellent work. The machines first invented for
                            cutting grass were very heavy and cumbersome, but their introduction into the field was of
                            decided advantage to those who were obliged to use the scythe. In 1815, machines were used
                            for threshing the grain, and the improvements made on them since that date, has now given to
                            the world a machine of inestimable value. The work on the farm for a few years was largely
                            under the management of certain persons who were appointed specially to that calling. It
                            then became necessary for all who were able, to assist during the time of planting, haying
                            and harvesting, and in securing the fire-wood. Our stock on the farm consisted of 15 Horses,
                            60 Milch Cows, 16 Working Oxen, 44 Young Cattle and 220 Sheep. No dogs were owned in the
                            Society. Several hundred hens, about one hundred turkeys, and a few colonies of bees have
                            been kept since the forming of the Society. The rigid system of economy on which the
                            Community was founded, forbid the keeping of any creature for its beauty or for mere
                            pleasure. The making of maple sugar has never been very extended, but in 1792 some 6 bbls.
                            of sugar and 200 lbs. of cakes, were made for home use. In 1857, 250 gallons of syrup were
                            made. Gardening is a branch of industry distinct from the farm. A garden for the family use
                            was laid out as early as 1797 and a liberal supply of all that would be needed for the table
                            was carefully cultivated. So early as 1800 the raising of garden seeds became a prominent
                            industry. At one time this branch of business had so enlarged that the seeds were sent
                            throughout theU.'S., and into Europe. At the time this record was written, 1858, the raising
                            of Garden Seeds was one of the most profitable sources of income. Since that date or since
                            the opening of the civil war, this industry has met with many unlooked-for reverses, and
                            induced us to turn our attention into other channels for employment. Very few plants have
                            been cultivated in the gardens, merely for ornament. All the land was needed for a more
                            profitable use, and large sections were devoted to the cultivation of small fruits. Many
                            excellent specimens of grapes have received careful attention, and yielded very satisfactory
                            returns. Tomatoes were introduced into the family in 1828 and from a small beginning and the
                            forming of an acquired taste, this fruit has become a prominent article of food and hundreds
                            of gallons are preserved for winter use. The gardens still continue to afford an abundant
                            supply of fruits and vegetables for the use of the family. A careful attention is given to
                            secure the best varieties for cultivation, as this may be as easily done, as to retain those
                            of less value. MUSIC. The science of music, or the art of writing music and singing by note
                            was not largely cultivated among the Believers for many years. Yery few embraced the faith
                            at that time who understood the rules of music. The<pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> songs and tunes were
                            learned by hearing. In 1807 the reading of music was gradually introduced, and for several
                            years following, there was a great increase in the number of songs that were brought forward
                            to learn. In 1815 an Anthem was written and the musical notes attached. From this small
                            beginning the knowledge of the rules of music began to be cultivated with more care. It was
                            soon found to be very beneficial in the sending of musical composition to the several
                            Societies. Up to this date no singing schools had been organized and the study of music was
                            attended by many difficulties, through the want of an able teacher. The notes that were
                            adopted at this time, were those in general use, and what many have called the "old
                            fashioned, round notes." In the course of a few years, great improvements were made m the
                            writing of music, as the use of letters was introduced. Various methods were used to
                            indicate the length of the notes, by making the letters, Capitals, in Roman or Italic form.
                            It required considerable care and skill to place these notes correctly and at the same time
                            have the page neatly written. This however, was soon followed by the introduction of small
                            letters and excluding the Capitals. Breviatures were used to indicate the length of the
                            notes, as well as other marks as the music demanded. In 1835 a thorough reform was made in
                            the system of modes, and generally adopted among the Believers. A book was published
                            entitled the "Rudiments of Music," containing one hundred and fifty-eight pages, explanatory
                            of the system as now used. A small work on music was published at New Lebanon in 1842 and
                            about the same time one was published at Enfield, Conn. After a few years the use of the
                            staff was almost universally neglected, as the center or medium line was considered
                            sufficiently distinct in the writing of music. This system, with slight improvements,
                            continued in general use until the year 1871. In the publication of "The Shaker" which began
                            this year, it was arranged to publish a piece of music, each month, and in order to do this,
                            we were obliged to use the round notes. From this date the round notes have gradually grown
                            in favor, while the letter notes have as gradually passed out of use.

                            national call for representatives of all religious denominations, to meet in the city of
                            Washington, I). C, on October 1st. 1889, for two purposes,�1st., to inaugurate or make
                            initiatory measures for the inauguration of a Congress of nations, for the noble and godlike
                            purpose of settling all national strifes and disturbances by arbitration, thus to disband
                            all armies and institute universal peace ! A glorious purpose ! 2nd. To seek a system of
                            universal religion ; meaning one universal Creed,<pb n="52" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> or Code of Faith.
                            Permit us to consider, first, what is necessary to inaugurate this reign of peace,�the boon
                            of Christ's kingdom. It is a tremendous step of progress! Well, true progress operates to
                            purge out the brute of our natures, the lion, the tiger, the wolf and the ape, and to put on
                            the heavenly angelic character. The Apostle James proclaimed a wonderful truth concerning
                            the brutal, fighting nature, thus, "Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not
                            hence, even of your lusts that war in your members ?" It has been truly said, "The pleasure
                            of the senses easily lapses into the lusts of the flesh." Therefore, to inaugurate peace on
                            earth, good will to man, the lusts of humanity must be eradicated, both the lusts of the
                            flesh, and of the selfish human will. Lust is abnormal desire ; there is a lust of
                            selfishness, of power over one's fellows, of dominion, of notoriety, of unmerited honors, of
                            fame, &amp;c. The means to subdue a bad weed, is to root it up ; the same course is
                            needful to subdue an abnormal passion. The way to do this is, first to confess it, then deny
                            its exercise, its life ! Now we come to the Christian standard, as taught by Jesus, thus�"If
                            any man will come after me let him deny himself, take up his daily cross and follow me."
                            Jesus came to inaugurate the kingdom of peace, and his way of doing it, was to walk in
                            denial of self! Thus we have the solution of the question "What is the true religion?" "Not
                            my will, but thine 0 God be done." A very simple Creed ! Yea, true Christianity, is a very
                            simple, straightforward life! It is the one only way to Heaven. The dogmatic career of
                            creeddom, which, for ages, has been called Christianity, is a hydra headed monster; it has
                            not satisfied the human soul, because it has not contained soul food, and nourishment ; has
                            not lifted the soul to God, or to see God ; has not produced purity of heart. "Blessed are
                            the pure in heart" said Christ Jesus, "for they shall see God," and "Blessed are the
                            peacemakers, for they shall be called the Children of God." There is a popular song sung by
                            professors of Christianity to-day, the sentiment of which is, "Nearer my God to thee." The
                            only way to get nearer, is to get purer; and the way to become purer, is to purge all sin
                            out of the soul by confession to God, in the presence of his angel witnesses, in human
                            tabernacles, then to walk in self-denial of all the temptations and pleasures of sin. To
                            purify a house, we first sweep, then mop and scrub, then air it, then deny the dirt an
                            entrance, thus it will become pure and keep pure, just so of the soul, our spirit house.
                            But, to purify the soul, and keep it pure, the little, as well as great evils must be
                            denied. It is "the little foxes that spoil the vines." A trite old maxim is, "For want of a
                            nail, the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe the horse was lost; for want of a horse the man
                            was lost, for the enemy came, and took him." Even thus, for want of self-denial, salvation
                            is lost; for want of salvation the soul is lost; for want of a soul saved, heaven is lost!
                            But, to return to the subject of a<pb n="53" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Creed. Creeds are not religion ; they
                            are simply the bony skeleton of true religion. They have, so to speak, no muscular power of
                            action, no blood or spirit life.; to do the mil of God, is the muscular power of religion;
                            its soul life is the power and wisdom of God ; and its life's blood is the inspirations of
                            the Heavens ! But, many professed religionists weary of the strife, because they see the
                            flock of Christ to be small, therefore they fear, for the hosts of the servants of sin are
                            numerous. Well, we are here reminded of Bishop Newton's remark : "But numbers are no mark,
                            that men will right be found, A few were saved in Noah's a&gt;rk, While many millions drowned.
                            Obey the Gospel call, And enter while you may, The flock of Christ was always small; But
                            none are saved but they;" Also we think of the Prophet Elisha's answer to his servant, who,
                            when the King of Syria sent a host to the city of Dothan to arrest Elisha; and his servant
                            saw them, and said, "Alas my master, how shall we do." And Elisha answered, "fear not, for
                            they that be with us, are more than they that be with them." "And Elisha prayed to the Lord
                            to open the eyes of his servant, and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw
                            the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. And when the hosts of
                            Syria came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord to smite the hosts of Syria with
                            blindness, and it was done. Then Elisha told them, this is not the way, neither is this the
                            city ; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek." But, he led them to
                            Samaria. And Elisha prayed for their eyes to be opened, and it was done, and they saw
                            themselves in Samaria. 'And the King of Israel said unto Elisha,' "Shall I smite them?" But
                            Elisha admonished him for proposing to smite his captives, and told him to feed them and let
                            them go. 'This was done, and it strengthened Israel's hosts.' This was overcoming evil with
                            good. We are also here reminded of the Theban General�Pelopidas, who, when his Captains told
                            him that the enemy was manifold stronger than his army, replied, "So much the better ; we
                            shall conquer so many the more." This intelligent self-possession was better than a thousand
                            spears. So Beloved Gospel Friends, our wise course is, to pray to God that our eyes may be
                            opened to see the hosts of the Lord who surround the pure in heart; then, so to live, that
                            we feel that these are with us, and, that we can confide in them to give us the victory over
                            all the powers of evil that afflict us. Then we will have strength to build up the Kingdom
                            of Heaven upon earth. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            being under some engagements, and absent for a long time I became darkened. On my next visit
                            I became fully assured that they professed the power of salvation, and I honestly confessed
                            my sins with the firm resolution to forsake them. I visited frequently while they remained
                            in Harvard, and Shirley and in the adjacent towns. I lived with my mother in the town of
                            Mason some twenty miles from Shirley, but we walked this distance, attended a protracted
                            meeting and then we set out on our return home. Having proceeded about half the distance, it
                            began to raiu. We entered an old school-house, where we remained till the siorm was over. It
                            was now not far from midnight, and very dark, but we resumed our journey and arrived at our
                            own home just as the sun was rising in the east. We were soon engaged in our u&gt;ual
                            employment, the same as though we had enjoyed our- rest through the night. Elizabeth
                            Woodard. Our Mother Haunah Kendall exhorted us to be kind to each other and be very careful
                            not to hurt the oil and the wine. We should reverence God in each other and respect our
                            Brothers and Sisters and treat them with good manners. When we speak of our Brethren and
                            listers we should call them Brethren and Sisters. We should leave all profane language and
                            all jesting and all speaking unkindly of each other to the children of the world. Our words
                            should be seasoned with grace, that we may not say that which is wrong. When Mother Ann and
                            the Elders made their first visit to Harvard they called at the Square House. Sister Abigail
                            Cooper says, "They asked me if the religion I had received saved me from sin." "We have,"
                            said they, "the gospel of Christ, and if you will accept<pb n="55" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> us, we will do
                            you good." Abigail replied, "I have seen a great deal of false religion, and I do uot want
                            to see any more. If you have any new religion you mi;rht as well keep it to yourself, as I
                            do not want it, and indeed I do not care about seeiug you." After a short visit they
                            arranged to leave and Mother Ann said, "Do you uot love us?" I told thorn I did rot. Father
                            William Lee replied, "We will makethee to love us before we leave the place," and presented
                            me a nice apple. I did not want the apple, but took it and laid it on the mantle. They had
                            been absent but a short time, when I began to feel a great love for them. I could say in
                            truth that I loved them as I had never loved before. I loved the apple for their sakes, and
                            wh^n I was about my work I would, occasionally, look at it and take it in my hand. I knew
                            they must be a good peopie because I felt such love for them. I longed to have them return
                            and when they did I was thankful to receive them, as I counted it a great privilege to do a
                            kindness for them. I found Mother Ann's words to be true.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Cooper, Abigail" TEIform="persName"/>Abigail Cooper.</byline></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Truth" TEIform="index"/> TRUTH.</head><p TEIform="p"> The Gospel of Christ comprehends every means necessary for the elevation of the human race

                            needful to -'end out a circular of such import. We have been taught and honestly believe,
                            that the gift of God is in the Order of God. and that each, in their Order, should W&gt;k to
                            the Order before them, for a' true manifestation of that gift; and, that the Order, in its
                            institution, had a nobler purpose than to gratify and sanction the cravings of the senses,
                            especially when they conflict with the pure flowings of divine inspiration, which, to the
                            spiritual minded, are as the lnvad ai'd waters of life! Nevertheless, as you do ask our

                            It would detract from the gift of the worshipers to do so. 3rd. If it is thought advisable,
                            by the Ministry cf any Bishopric to use the Organ, at the commencement of worship, and they

                            query may be propounded by some reader of this paper�not of oar order,�the reply may
                            properly be given here. There is nothing obscure, puzzling, or metaphysical about Shakerism
                            ; it does not require that one should have a collegiate education, or be profoundly versed
                            in theological lore to enable him to penetrate its obscurities, or sound its depths. It
                            cannot be said of Shakerism as a New England writer said of transcendentalism when asked to
                            define it, that it is "a soaring after the unattainable, and diving after the unfathomable."
                            Nay, Shakerism is so plain that ' 'he who runs may read," and "the way-faring man though a
                            fool, cannot err therein." Here are the fundamentals of Shakerism.�"Thou shalt love the Lord
                            thy God with all thy heart, and mind, and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself." "Do unto
                            others as ye would that they should do unto you." "Cease to do evil, learn to do well." "If
                            thou bring thy gift to the Altar�of God's service�and there rememberest that thy brother
                            hath aught against thee, go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and
                            offer thy gift." "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.''
                            "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us ; but if we
                            confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from
                            all unrighteousness." "Owe no man anything, but to love one another." "Let us walk honestly
                            as in the day." "Be not conformed to this world." "Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that
                            which is good." "Bless and curse not." "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
                            good." "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest." They
                            that are Christs, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts. "Blessed are the
                            peace-makers. Blessed are the pure in heart." Superadded to this, Shakerism re-<pb n="57" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> quires a life of virgin purity as taught and lived by Jesus ; a baptism of
                            the spirit in the waters of repentance as typified by his baptism in the waters of Jordan ;
                            and as in his case, so in ours, we must be baptized "confessing our sins." As our Savior and
                            his disciples and the ' early Christian church "had all things in common," so Shakerism in
                            its temporalities follows in the same path, and its disciples live the same communal life.
                            As the teachings of Jesus were of God, so Shakerism is not a man-made faith, but is of God;
                            divine : and as our Savior "learned obedience by the things he suffered," so Shakerism holds
                            that through trial and temptation, by resistance and self-abnegation, by a daily bearing of
                            one's cross regardless of its form and the weight of the burden, by humility, charity and
                            self-denial, by love and by prayer, a way is opened for man to enter into "that rest which
                            remaineth for the children of God." Such in brief is Shakerism. Canterbury, N.

                            the questions for the Bible Class accord with mine. I had decided in my mind that Jephthah's
                            daughter was the greatest sacrifice and that the Book of Daniel the most interesting, before
                            I received the last Manifesto. And now the question, "Who is the grandest character in the
                            Old Testament ? " Is it not Daniel ? where will you find another whose record is so free
                            from blot or stain as his, courage so dauntless, faith so steadfast and humility so deep.
                            What a commanding presence he must have had as he stood before the throned Kings of Babylon,
                            and anoounced his firm allegiance to his God, and then he was pronounced by a mighty
                            archangel to be greatly beloved, his glorious visions of the far off future and the
                            assurance that he should stand in his lot in the last days, surely, he was the grandest man
                            in the Old Testament. From the signs of the times and what we read from the best literature
                            of the day, it is evident that there is a silent unseen power working in the minds of men
                            that will shake their old ideas into "chaff that the wind driveth away." Perhaps Daniel may
                            now be sitting at his king's gate and is a medium of truth and righteousuess to us poor
                            mortals. The Manifesto is as good as ever, the Editor's notes in January No., are excellent.
                            The "Notes about Home" are very interesting I wish we could have more of them. Is Sister
                            Mary Ann Hill still with you ? I saw her name mentioned in the Manifesto a while ago, she
                            must enjoy her last days after such a long life of rectitude and unselfish love. Kind angels
                            are hovering about her, and when her earthly life is ended will bear her spirit to the
                            presence of her Savior whom she loved and honored so well while here. My grand-daughter
                            after four months confinement has recovered and is apparently well. I have not much to say
                            about myself. My health is not very good. 1 am still compelled to "walk in the world with
                            the worldly." I try to bear my burden with patience. Hoping to hear from you again, I remain
                            with sincere respect and love to all, Your Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Lewis, A." TEIform="persName"/>A.

                            I sincerely thank you. I perceive by the tenor of your communication that you have enlisted
                            in the gospel of Christ's second manifestation, which is a gospel of peace, love, and
                            purity. I heartily congratulate you on starting in the noblest and most glorious work that
                            was ever revealed to mortals. "By the way," you speak of loyal souls in the gospel work;
                            they will surely win the victory. The foundation principles of the new creation, are not in
                            harmony with the principles of the old creation. Therefore those who come out from the old,
                            into the new, do forsake the principles of the old, which are inherited, by every
                            individual. The kingdom of Christ is free from all unrighteousness, and those who dwell
                            therein, forsake the principles of evil in every form. As the Order was established in the
                            days of the Apostles, a Community of interest was one of the foundation pillars on which the
                            church of Christ was to stand, and here was where the work of self-denial came in, no one
                            saying that aught of the things he possessed were his own. There are few persons, so
                            careless or indifferent, as not occasionally to look forward to the time, when they shall
                            become religious ; although they neglect God, and disregard the duties of religion at
                            present, they hope to serve and obey God before they die. They consider not, that by a
                            continuance of evil practices they render it almost impossible to attain to any love of
                            virtue ; that by forming habits inconsistent with purity in the early period of their lives,
                            they expose themselves to the almost certain hazard, of never acquiring one pious sentiment,
                            however protracted their existence in this present world. We are creatures of habit, if we
                            wish to be found in old age, walking in the paths of wisdom and vir-, tue, we must yield
                            ourselves to the counsels of religion in the days of our youth. Those whose declining years
                            are dignified by virtue and purity, are for the greater part, those who sought wisdom early
                            and found her. If we cannot resolve to be good 7ioiv, how can we hope for the resolution
                            hereafter? If passion exerts so strong an influence at present how can we expect that long
                            indulgence will lessen its power? If we neglect to form habits of virtue when everything
                            invites and assists us, in this important work, how can we trust to that period when, to the
                            labor and difficulty of acquiring new principles, will be added that of undoing all that the
                            former years of our lives have effected. With these few lines I tender you my gospel love
                            and well wishes.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bradford, John" TEIform="persName"/> John Bradford.</byline></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="We are invited by our Savior to take his Yoke..."

                            wicked, worldly Christianity of Christendom�which made China eat opium and buy it of India,

                            government makes one hundred drunkards�these seventeen villages of people have so crucified
                            in themselves "the lusts that war in their members," from whence come all wars, private and
                            public, that they live like the Prince of Peace, celibates, with property in common; having
                            neither magistrates, policecourts, nor prisons. Why may not the whole world be either
                            Quakers or Shakers ? As Quakers, they would not fight; would abolish poverty; educate all
                            children in industrial schools; use marriage only for offspring; would take no oaths, pay no
                            war taxes or tithes, dress plainly, use simple language, and t,41 the truth or keep silence
                            ; would take no part in church and state governments, or monopolize life-elements; thus
                            being a "new earth." Or else, as Shakers, forming a "new heaven," they would institute the

                            occurs to us that there is an equal demand in the world for the best exponents of pure
                            religion. If the spiritual faculties were as keenly alive as are the natural senses, would
                            not the soul within us, cry out� -'Lord, send me from the selfish, The worldly HfV within,
                            To fields where the seed must be sown; There let me labor and work in good faith Till a

                            Resurrection Heavens, calling for active Christian workers and angel reapers in the
                            harvest-field of the world. Lives of honest self-denial have prepared them for this

                            many are expecting, what would be said to those who profess and preach a gospel that they do
                            not practice ? Could our Savior look upon the efforts now be-<pb n="60" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> ing made
                            by his disciples, as worthy of the mission in which they are engaged ? Shall science claim
                            more attention than the practical religion of ''Doing good and being good?" Science will
                            eulighten the understanding, while religion teaches us to use the understanding for the
                            elevation and salvation of the soul. We think Christ would say to many disciples, "One thing
                            thou lackest, go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and come, follow me." Our possessions may be
                            earthly riches, or they may be other selfish conditions ; but all of self must be
                            surrendered before the soul can be consecrated to the service of God. Let us read what the
                            Recording Angel has written about our spiritual status. It is over the door in golden
                            letters ;�"Wanted, meu of integrity, who obey God's laws ; women who do not stoop to the
                            menial servitude of a fallen nature ; but stand uprightly, co-workers with their brothers in
                            creating a "heaven on earth." We also read�"Almost, but not fully persuaded," Wanted, more
                            firmness of character. Over the second door is written�"The ^st of the flesh, the lust of
                            the eye and the pride of life," have reigued supreme. Wanted, a messenger of truth to carry
                            conviction to this household. Over the third, the augel writes�"The cares of this world, and
                            the deceitfulness of riches have choked God's word." Wanted, more of those who "seek first
                            the kingdom of God and its righteousness." The fourth record says�"Where envy and strife is,
                            there is confusion and every evil work." Wanted, more of that wisdom which is pure and
                            peaceable. Over the fifth door�"God is no respecter of persons." Wanted, that these should
                            learn that "whoso exalteth himself shall be abased, but whoso humbleth himself shall be
                            exalted." The sixth record tells us that "the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity." Wanted
                            here; "those who can show out of a good conversation, their works with meekness of wisdom."
                            Finally, the angel pauses at a plain, obscure dwelling and writes, "I know thy works, and
                            tribulation, and poverty, but thou art rich in Christ. I know the blasphemy of those who
                            belong to the synagogue of Satan. Fear none of these things, be faithful unto death, and I
                            will give thee a crown of life." Wanted at this Harvest Church, those who are sick j of sin
                            and desire salvation therefrom. The angel of Judgment now passes through every homestead
                            visited by the former, and with the sword of truth destroys every condition that offends the
                            Spirit of God. These are followed by the angels of Mercy and Forgiveness who continue their
                            ministrations of love until every soul is healed of its infirmities^ and led to glorify God.

                            grand subjects which your philosophers have handled with remarkable ability and erudition.
                            The Buddhists, or I may say, Orientals, were a nation who did not touch meat, but since the
                            advent of Europeans, to the East, our countrymen have degraded themselves to . such a low
                            pitch, to the great shame of their forefathers. The European idea of civilization is about
                            like this, I think. 1. Live beyond your means, and get into debt. 2. Use whiskey and tonics.
                            3. Go to the (popular) church, whatever your i eal faith may be. 4. Be a convert to
                            Christianity, without inquiring into one's own (native) religion. 5 Ape the mode of dress
                            adopted by the European. (His dress is made to suit a cold climate, and how can it possibly
                            suit that of a "not country, and vise versa. Recently, I was told by one who takes a liberal
                            and impartial view of us, that our national dress was more graceful and becoming to a nation
                            than the shabby breeches and cut away coat of the Europeans.) 6. Keep a carriage and cut a
                            dash! The above is a brief resume of English civilization. The missionary has abused his
                            trust. He brought the brandy bottle that the poor native might be taught the good quality of
                            its contents. Then of course, roast beef was introduced The result was. he accepted
                            Christianity, and never for a, moment thought of his country, its religion, manners or
                            customs. Certainly the case would be pardonable, had he found for himself that the
                            missionary's introductions were better and preferable to his native habits. The religion of
                            Buddha, distinctly forbids the taking of life, but I am sbrry to tell you that a great
                            number of his followers eat meat. I think they do not kill, but purchase from the markets.
                            Even thus, it is wrong. If they refrained from buying meat, fewer animals would be
                            slaughtered. I am no meat eater. I used to be some time ago, but left off, simply obeying an
                            instinct of my nature. So you see, I stand in the same position as you do. I think nature
                            has intended us to be vegetarians. In comparing our bodily structure with that of other
                            animals, we may safely place the ape on the same footing as ourselves. Its digestive organs,
                            teeth &amp;c , are quite identical with our own. And what is its food? Vegetable.<pb n="62" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> And yet we, who have the same, anatomy, feed like wolves and tigers,
                            transgressing a great natural law. Our forefathers must have had very good reasons for
                            prohibiting the use of meat. It is suicidal to those, especially, who try to lead the higher
                            life. We are, naturally, more or less in a state of intoxication through our passions, and
                            when we take meat and spirits, additional intoxicants, the result, of course, is sad to
                            think of. If our natural inclination is to anger, anger will become excessive, and acts of
                            violence will be the result. Vegetarians here as a rule, are weaker, physically and more
                            sensitive than meat-eaters. It may be through climatic influence, but I found that in India,
                            which is much hotter than Ceylon, the case was just the reverse. I really cannot account for
                            it. It may be the influence of the climate, or it may be owing to the kind of food which the
                            vegetarian takes. Most of the Christian clergymen here have abused their trust very much,
                            to, the shame of their great Teacher. If you ever come here you will see it for yourself.
                            These men live very high, on salaries drawn from state. They did not even dream of such
                            positions when they were at home. "There is no religion higher than truth," is the motto of
                            a family of Rajahs in India. Truth is an eternal principle, and every man with brains ought
                            to have this motto engraved upon his heart. The world would then go on smoothly. I am no
                            sectarian, (Buddhists, properly speaking, are unsectarian,) and I always like to learn the
                            truth from any form of "ism."' Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed uttered many truths which I gladly
                            accept. I do not care from what quarter the truth comes. I cannot yet answer,
                            conscientiously, all the following questions in the affirmative. 1. Am I a total abstainer
                            from all spirituous liquors? 2. Do I live a perfectly pure and chaste life? 3. Am I
                            perfectly truthful, just and honest in all my thoughts, words and deeds? 4. Is my mind
                            permanently in a state of serenity (i. e.) have I banished from it, all passion, pride,
                            hate, malice, envy, anger, greed and craving for worldly advantages ? Is my heart at peace
                            with itself and with all the world? 5. Have I learned to subordinate self to others; my own
                            pleasure to the good of my fellows? Is my heart filled with loving-kindness to all living
                            beings ; and do I watch for opportunities of doing kindness to all within my reach? 6. Do I
                            thoroughly realize the empty and transitory character of all earthly things, and while
                            zealously discharging all duties, falling to my lot. during my brief halt in this world, can
                            I truly say that all my desires center on the unseen and imperishable, and on the attainment
                            of that higher knowledge which leads to this reality? Perfect conformity with these rules is
                            not in man, until he has made considerable progress in things spiritual. These rules should
                            pervade the mind, and guide the conduct. Until we try these rules have we any right to
                            denounce the Masters or Adepts, as impostors? I think not. Apart from this our ancient books
                            treat of the existence of the beings in question, and without a thorough investigation, with
                            care and patience we should not jump into rash conclusions. In Ceylon the larger number of
                            the inhabitants are Buddhists, yet there is not a single girls' school, for their daughters,
                            and how sad it is to think that these girls grow up to be illiterate women. The Buddhists
                            sometimes educate their daughters, at home, to read and write their mother tongue, and in
                            the rudiments of the English larguage. I have not heard of a Buddhist young lady who could
                            speak English, sing or play on any musical instrument. There are many Christians, brought up
                            at Christian boarding schools, who have some of these accomplishments, but for what good
                            when they are made so bigoted by their Christian superintendents. These children are mostly
                            daughters of "billy" Christians, as they are commonly called, (people who have become
                            Christians for the sake of money or employment, one of the inducements offered by the
                            missionaries.) I am afraid the time has not come, in Ceylon, to make her daughters stand
                            shoulder to shoulder with her sons. I really hope the case may be so some day. I long to see
                                the<pb n="63" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> day when the women can stand as equals with the men in
                            intellectual and spiritual attainments. The English have our fair land under their yoke. The
                            Eurasians (sometimes called Burghers) are a mixed race, coming from the English and the
                            lower classes of the Singhalese. You will readily see that the word Eurasian is a word
                            compounded from Europe and Asia, and tells its own infamous story. What do you think of a
                            religion which takes the Lord Jesus for its leader and guide, when the outcome of their
                            teaching and example is the advent of this mixed race, born mostly outside of any legal or
                            other rigiit. 0 you would weep to see the misery thus perpetrated. I think that all animal
                            life is sacred and should not be destroyed, unless a human life is endangered by it. Animals
                            are a part of the universe; they proceed from the great Absolute, which you term God, just
                            as do humans, and as a part of the All, they are just as much entitled to our considerate
                            mercy and loving-kindness, as any other part which proceeded from the Creative Source.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Be kind to the living" TEIform="index"/> BE KIND TO THE LIVING.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Goepper, Anna B."

                            to an aching heart than all the eulogies heaped upon the inanimate and pulseless clay. No
                            look or tone of censure or praise, can thrill or chide that silent casket now, yet we stand
                            with awe-struck faces and voice the virtues which had graced the living, but alas it is too
                            late, too late to cheer the bruised aud aching heart. We pull the mote out of our brother's
                            eye but fail to recognize the beam in oar own. When we are taking the last look at some dear
                            departed friend, comes thi; better thought, could I not have made her life happier, was I
                            always as gentle aud kind as 1 would now be had I the power ? Alas, every unkiud wont and
                            look is burnt into our memory now. Can we not learn from past sorrows and bereavements to be
                            more kind to those near aud dear to us? Let us resolve to begin the .New Year with higher
                            and holier ambitious than ever before. Let us help each other to be truer to the Higher
                            Life. Let us check the unkind or sarcastic word before it has power to wound another heart.
                            We will not sharpen our wit with the tears of our loved ones. We are too prone to forget
                            that the shafts hurled from our quiver may be as poisoned arrows in some bleeding heart.

                                righteousness," nothring very mysterious can ever disturb the order of his mind. No
                                churchal creed and no established form or ceremony can ever obscure his light from God,
                                or take from him the assurance that he is a free man, and that the truth as found in
                                Christ, has made him free. Of all the systems of religious life that has ever been
                                introduced among men, the Christian comes as a marked innovation, by ignoring every form
                                of ritual that has been the accompanying credential of the religious devotee. Jesus
                                created life anew, while love toward God was the crowning feature. Little children were
                                by him brought forward that the disciples might learn even from them the lesson of
                                confiding trust, and of obedience, so necessary for those who would accept the words of
                                eternal life. Christianity is a lesson to be learned, and it demands the careful
                                attention of the pupil that its application may be commendable to the divine teacher.
                                When Jesus directed the minds of the disciples to the fact that the peacemakers were to
                                be formed into a class for special commendation, and to be designated as the "children
                                of God," he presented the lesson in so simple a manner, that there could not have been
                                the least hesitancy in comprehending it, although so different from the course they had
                                previously accepted. "Except ye turn, and become as little children,"�and this was said
                                to men of mature minds, men well versed in worldly experience,�and then he
                                continues,�-rrye shall in nowise enter into the kingdom of heaven." Such an example
                                before a nation of soldiers was to destroy all hope of conquest. With the prophetic
                                assurance that they wrere as secure in the possession of their city as they were of the
                                everlasting hills, they would have accepted more readily the example of Joshua, Jephthah
                                or Gideon, who were called the sons of God, and had given their lives to protect the
                                children of Israel. Jesus was also the son of God, and the author of a new and living
                                way, in which righteousness and the<pb n="65" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> love of doing right should have
                                the precedence. Christians in their zeal say a great many good and endearing words about
                                Jesus and his redeeming love, and then accept Jephthah and Gideon as their Christian
                                examples. Ages of wonderful revelations have transpired in the history of man since the
                                days of the simple Nazarene. The Christian age with its beautiful, pentecostal season of
                                spiritual refreshing, when tongues of fire announced the presence of the Lord, and when
                                the family of Christ were baptized into one spirit of love and good-will. That wonderful
                                age of the witnesses of God, when the Marchionites, Novatlans, Albigenses and Quakers
                                gave their testimony of truth, and manifested the light of the spirit of Christ, and yet
                                the peacemakers, who were to be called the children of God, are lamentably in the
                                minority. That there is a reason why the pure and peaceful day of the anticipated
                                millennium has moved so slowly is quite apparent. Instead of accepting the doctrine of
                                Christ, the churches have accepted the spirit of the world, and their exhortations and
                                prayers have been from that standand been thoroughly the consecrations and point. Had
                                they received Jesus the Christ, they would have preached as he preached. "Put up thy
                                sword into its place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword."
                                Instead of peace the Christian church has been the strong advocate for war, and no less
                                for all the horrors that have followed in its train*. The example of the little child
                                has been nearly obliterated from the mind. Rights that are personal and extremely
                                selfish have dominated in the character infused into daily prayers. That salvation from
                                the sins of the world is attainable, we have the best of evidence, and that the
                                peaceable fruits of righteousness will come to us from above, if we so pray, and that we
                                shall be made better and happier while thus engaged is also clearly evidenced by the
                                life of the great Teacher and of his disciples, as well as by many faithful witnesses of
                                more recent date. It is one of the wonders of the present age that this light of God
                                should have become so obscured. Even the Christian will contend for the necessity of
                                demanding our rights by the influence of powder and ball, as earnestly as he will
                                contend for salvation by some traditional ceremony, and think he is doing God's service.
                                By and by the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord, and then it
                                will be,�Peace on earth, good will to all mankind.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Two well-known clergymen lately missed their train..." TEIform="index"/>

                                revolution in our laundry and laundry building. Taking out two old boilers, replacing
                                with a steam boiler and fixing over some store-roonis into work-shops. In our Second
                                House have taken down one chimney and built a larger one in its place; set a boiler in
                                the cellar and are now engaged putting in pipes and radiators. Well, just after we got
                                fairly under way, what should come along but his i-f-r-n-1 majesty La Grippe. He soon
                                tried to take hold of every one but there were a few that could not be gripped and he
                                was given such a hot watery reception, inside and out that he had to flee. If we had
                                known of his coming we probably should not have had our chimney down ; this opened the
                                avenue and made it easy for La Grippe to seize on those, who with mop and broom were
                                fighting amidst dust and dirt in the draughty hall and rooms. We got started and could
                                but go on. And the weather, oh the weather! the like was never known before. What a
                                story we that are younsr will have to tell in the next century. If this world and the
                                weather are only the effects of spiritual causes, what reformation in the world of cause
                                will have to take place before our earth will be a paradise. W" need not wait to die,
                                (leave our mortal bodies) before we enter the spiritual world of cause. There are many
                                now upon the earth who are laboring to remove spiritual causes, that the direful effects
                                manifested on earth in human conditions may cease. When this is done, no doubt the
                                weather and all other unprofitable conditions will be greatly improved. The Feb.
                                Manifesto was right on time, we were thinking it would be behind on account of La
                                Grippe. It is good, and some articles very excellent; there is one word in "Glory to the
                                Eighteous," that is a mistake. It should read who can know their worth; not work. In

                                "the purifier of sins." The poultry man may not need sulphur so much as the hens, and
                                therefore it is recommended for the latter. D.

                                sacrifice and consecration to God while in the body; my sincere prayer is that we all
                                may become purified aud glorified spirits like unto her. We are very much interested in

M., thu
                            12th inst., in the Hull of the Family Dwelling. Elder Elijah, who had reached the well
                            filled age of sixty-si;; years, came to Harvard when only a little boy of four years. From a
                            virtuous child he developed into a beautiful Christian man and has been an interested and
                            devoted supporter of our gospel order for a lung scries of years. By all the dear friends at
                            his own home, and indeed throughout all of the Eastern Societies where he was widely known,
                            he was loved as a gospel father, and as one who was solicitous for the comfort and general
                            happiness of every one from the aged to the little children. The death of Elder Elijah
                            occurred very suddenly on tlie afternoon of the 9th of Feb. He was sitting in' company with
                            the Ministry and Elders of the Church and had been conversing on several subjects of
                            interest, and then introduced a letter that he had just written. lie read till lie reached
                            the closing address, "Your abiding Brother" and then suddenly expired; although he had stood
                            on the threshhold of death for some weeks during the early part of the Winter, he had so far
                            recovered, as to be able to give some attention to his several duties, and even ventured to
                            spend two days away from home last week and returned in comfortable circumstances with the
                            remark that he felt "quite well." By invitation of Elder John Whiteley, who conducted the
                            services at the funeral, Elder Henry C. Blinn with three Sisters L. J. Forest, A. E. Newton
                            and J. H. Fish from Canterbury, N. H., and Elder John B. Vance of Alfred, Me , were present.
                            A brother of Elder Elijah and his family also attended and some twenty of the invited
                            friends from the town or vicinity. The meeting was opened by the singing of an appropriate
                            hymn. Elder John Whiteley gave a brief address adapted to the occasion and having reference
                            to our departed Brother. Eldresses, Eliza Babbitt, Maria Foster, Annie L. Walker and several
                            other members of the Society of Harvard then offered their tributes of affectionate
                            remembrance, either by speaking from the fulness of the heart or by reading what had been
                            prepared. Several members from the Society at Shirley gave corresponding contributions. The
                            speaking was interspersed with the singing of some selected pieces eminently appropriate to
                            the occasion. After this Elder H. C Blinn offered a few timely remarks in harmony with the
                            season of sorrow and closed by reading the twenty-third Psalm. The three Sisters from
                            Canterbury sung a piece, by request, in remembrance of all the suffering and deeply
                            afflicted burden bearers in this our gospel home. Elder J. B. Vance then spoke very
                            feelingly and sympathetically which found a ready response in the hearts of all present.
                            Sisters, E. A. Stratton and M. L. Wilson called, as they were on their way to Boston, and
                            attended the funeral. By invitation one of the friends of the Believers, spoke a few words
                            of appreciative regard for his acquaintance with Elder Elijah and with the Society of
                            Shakers in Harvard which had extended over many years. The Service continued for two hours,
                            in sorrow, in tears, in hopes ami encouragement for the prosperity of our Zion Home. During
                            the time of Service all that was mortal of E'der Elijah was placed in an adjoining room. The
                            countenance was so life-like that one might have thought him lying down to rest from the
                            weary labors of a day. His dress was peculiarly expressive cf his own neatness during life.
                            The coat was of white alpaca, very tastefully arranged, and the spotless bosom and collar of
                            the under dress was in close harmony, as was the becoming white silk neck-tie. The casket
                            was made of the beautiful white pine of our own New England forests. This was, in its
                            simplicity, unstained and unvarnished. The trimmings on the inside, as arranged by the free
                            gift of the undertaker, a special friend of Elder Elijah, were also choice in their
                            simplicity. The duties of the Service having been closed, the body was taken to the cemetery
                            for interment.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.

A. S.] A friend of mine says there are two sorts of people in
                                    the world�-'posts" and '-rails," and a good many more rails than posts. The meaning
                                    of this is that most people depend on somebody else� a father, a si.-ter, a husband,
                                    a wife, or perhaps on a neighbor. Whether it is right to divide the whole population
                                    of the eartli quite so strictly, it is true that we all know a good many rail-like
                                    people. Blanche Evans tells me one of the Rail-girls sits by her in school. Miss
                                    Rail never had a knife of her own, though she used a sort of pencil that continually
                                    needed sharpening; so Blanche's pretty pen-knife was borrc ved until one day the
                                    Rail-girl snapped the blade. Blanche was so tired of lending the knife that she was
                                    not very sorry. Miss Rail's brother works beside Henry Brown in the office of the
                                    Daily Hurricane. They both set type, and Henry's patience is sorely tried by Master
                                    Rail. If Henry tells him to-day whether the / is doubled in model when ed is added,
                                    he will have forgotten tomorrow ; and Henry has to tell him whether the semicolon
                                    comes before or after viz., every time he "sets it up." The truth is, the Rail-boy
                                    doesn't try to remember these things; he has taken Henry for a post and expects to
                                    be held up by him. I met two pretty young ladies traveling together last summer. One
                                    was always appealing to the other to know if they were to change cars at Osanto, or
                                    not until they reached Dunstable, or if they should not change at all. She asked her
                                    companion the time, though her own watch was in order; she "couldn't bother to
                                    remember" names of routes and hotels and people, but she found it very convenient
                                    for somebody to do all this for her, and she never concealed her surprise if her
                                    friend forgot or neglected anything. Being a post is often unpleasant, but how much
                                    worse it is to be a rail! The post can stand by itself�but take it away, and where
                                    is the rail? Boys and girls have this advantage over a woode.n fence�if they fear
                                    that they are rails, they can set about turning themselves into posts at once, and
                                    they will find the post business a far more delightful one.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How to kill an enemy" TEIform="index"/> HOW TO KILL AN ENEMY.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">[Contributed by D.

                                may now be said to dot every hillside in New England. Especially in eastern
                                Massachusetts, whs. e it apparently had its origin, there is scarcely a town, however
                                small, which does not have its library for the free use of its reading public, however
                                limited in numbers. These institutions are often benefited by a small private endowment
                                from some liberal-minded citizen, and are generally well supported by an appropriation
                                from the town. The existence of nearly all of them is covered by the past forty years.
                                The primary object of their establishment was the furnishing of readingmatter for
                                amusement or entertainment, the object of instruction being a secondary consideration;
                                and this is true to a great extent to-day, although the element of instruction is
                                gaining in prominence, and the library is regarded more a/ud more as an adjunct of the
                                public schools. If they were originally intended for the very poor, our experience shows
                                that that use has long been superseded, for their privileges are now shared by the rich
                                and poor alike. The public library is one of the most democratic of our institutions and
                                a good librarian will show the strictest impartiality in the treatment of his patrons.
                                The current literature of the day is brought into speedy contact with the genera] public
                                in the libraries, and as the interest centres largely in the newest books, the patronage
                                is greatly increased by the circumstance of finding them there. Everybody can appreciate
                                the privilege of finding the latest and best literature on any subject in the public
                                library, knowing that the free use of such books may be had for the asking. Most of the

                            come a combination of library and reading-room, and this enlarges the field of their
                                usefulness. The influence of these centres of intelligence makes better citizens of our
                                young people, enlarges the thought of the older ones, and enables many, no doubt, to
                                bear the ills of life better, and affords entertainment for many an idle hoar.�</p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="New England magazine" TEIform="index"/>New England Magazine

                            more goes out you will always be poor. The art is not in making money, but in holding it;
                            little expenses, like mice in a barn, when they are many, make great waste. Hair by hair,
                            heads get bald. Straw by straw, the thatch goes off the cottage, and drop by drop, the rain
                            penetrates your roof. A barrel is soon empty, if the tap leaks but a drop a minute. When
                            j^ou mean to save, begin with your mouth ; there are many thieves craving admittance
                            therein, but do not allow them to enter. The ale and beer jugs are great wastes. So is the
                            tobacco box. Keep away from them, and you will never find occasion for their use. In all
                            other things strive to keep within compass. In clothing choose suitable and lasting
                            matereal, not tawdry fineries; also avoid very prominent colors. To be warm is the main
                            thing; never mind the looks, but always clothe yourself, honorably, healthfully, and
                            comfortably. Never stretch your limbs further than your blanket will reach, or you will soon
                            be cold. A fool may make money, but it needs a wise head to spend it. Eemember it is easier
                            to build two chimneys than to keep one going. If you give all to back and board, there is
                            nothing left for the savings-bank. Fare hard, and work hard while you are young, and you
                            have a chance of rest when you are old. And your rest will be honestly earned.</p></div2><div2 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Simple relief for lung troubles" TEIform="index"/> A SIMPLE RELIEF FOR LUNG TROUBLES.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">It has long been known that pine needle pillows would alleviate persons afflicted

                                    River, this editor was told of a discovery that had been made which may prove a boon

                                    peculiar virtue in a pillow made from pine straw, and having none of that material
                                    at hand, made one from fine, soft, pine shavings, and had the pleasure of noting
                                    immediate benefit. Soon all the members of the household had pine shavings pillows,
                                    and it was noticed that all coughs, asthmatic or bronchial troubles abated at once
                                    after sleeping a few nights on these pillows. An invalid suffering with lung
                                    troubles derived benefit from sleeping on a mattress made from pine shavings. The
                                    material is cheap and makes a very pleasant and comfortable mattress, the odor of
                                    the pine permeating the entire room and absorbing or dispelling all unpleasant
