                            WITH REPLIES AND CRITICISMS LOGICALLY AND CLEARLY SET FORTH. BY H. L. EADS, BISHOP OF SOUTH
                            UNION, KY. This is the great Shaker Book of the present day. Its author is well known as the
                            champion of the Shaker Faith; and any one at all interested upon the subject of Shakerism,
                            will find herein all he could wish of information concerning the Shakers and Shakerism. The
                            book has been most favorably received by the general and religious press; and the most
                            gratifying letters have been received from very prominent individuals of our country, who
                            are justly considered experts in logic and comprehensive in judgment. The work is
                            beautifully printed, bound in cloth, and will adorn, very gracefully, any library or

                            the " Substance of Shaker Theology;" and we suppose the fact that it is published at the
                            office of The Shaker Manifesto, the organ of the United Societies, must be construed as
                            evidence that it is an authorized statement of Shaker doctrines, did we not have the author
                            indorsed by its editor, Geo. Albert Lomas, as an "excellent authority upon Shaker theology,"
                            and "a most excellent representation of what Shaker principles can do for a man." The book
                            certainly has no uncertain sound. You are not left for one moment in doubt as to the opinion
                            of Bishop Eads upon any subject he discusses. He believes fully in God, in the cardinal
                            principles of Shakerism, in the Shaker Order, and in himself. He has not the slightest
                            hesitation in expressing his conviction that of the eleven hundredreligions in the world,
                            Shakerism alone is absolutely true; he does not simply guess— he says he knows it is true."—

                            Sir:—Accept my thanks for a copy of your book, which I received last night. Its
                            typographical appearance, is very neat—making a suitable casket for the preservation of your
                            clear logic. The portrait of yourself is an excellent one, and will cause your readers to
                            have a good idea of what you yourself are. I trust your work will have all the good effect
                            contemplated by yourself. No matter what people may think of any peculiar feature of your
                            faith, no one can question that your people appear to lead an upright an* happy life — much
                            more so, to all appearances, than is led by our more numerous carnal and combative
                            Christians. Yours truly, K. LYNCH. This beautiful and interesting volume is mailed,

                            keeping As they watch the coming light. They are blessed with revelation, Standing in their
                            robes of white ; God reveals to them salvation, As He gives the day its light. And He calls
                            the high and lowly To come forward in their might ; Not with weapons, all unholy, But with
                            banners of the light. In the anguish-freighted ages — When the race was wrapped in night—
                            Prophets, Seers, Martyrs, Sages, Saw afar the dawning light. For its coming are you ready ?
                            Can we all in strength unite ? And with purpose brave and steady, Hail the day and spread
                            the light ? You, whose heart can feel an error, Or a wrong however slight, Let your brother
                            be a sharer, Show it up, and spread the light. O, the wars, the desolations,— Famines,
                            ignorance and blight, That have cursed and crushed the nations, Just because they lacked the
                            light. You, whose soul hath comprehension, Of the wrongs of giant might, Let your knowledge
                            have extension — Agitate — and spread the light. You, whose place is at the altar, God will

                            Ohristos,"—anointed; and this is a derivation from the word " chrio,"— to anoint. Whether
                            Christians have properly or improperly applied this term to Jesus, it is thus used in their
                            Scriptures. " Jesus " means Saviour, hence—Christ Jesus is made to mean "Anointed Saviour."
                            Thus the Spirit of Christ would truly mean, the spirit of him who was anointed — Christ
                            Jesus. This anointing, received of the Father, by Jesus, made him " One with the Father ; "
                            and the same received by Christ's followers made them one with Jesus Christ, as he was one
                            with the Father; thus constituting them Christs, with Jesus, who was the Living Christ. In
                            reply then to the oft repeated question " What is the Shaker Theology concerning Christ, and
                            what do Shakers teach their children on this subject ? We answer: (1) Shaker theology
                            teaches that Jesus, abstractly considered, aside from his baptism, and when born of Mary,
                            was not the Christ, nor Christ Jesus. (2) He became Christ by a spiritual baptism of the
                            Father, God, constituting him the heavenly "Bridegroom." This baptism caused Jesus to be
                            born again, of the spirit of God ; by this baptism he became " A creature'' of the
                            resurrection order ; and in this order, " The first born of every creature ;" " The first
                            born among many brethren ;" "The Elder Brother." In this capacity he was the Christ of his
                            day, or Master. " One is your Master^ even Christ, and all ye are brethren." (3) We teach
                            our children that Jesus, when born of Mary, was not possessed of the nature of angels ; that
                            " he took not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of Abraham, wherefore it became
                            him—Jesus— to be tempted in all points like unto his brethren " of the seed of Abraham,
                            meaning children of this world. (4) That Jesus, in order to become Christ, had to be born
                            again of the spirit of his Heavenly Father — into a spiritual Kesurrection Order — a " New
                            Creation "— thus making Jesus '' a New Creature," " a quickening Spirit," " The Lord from
                            Heaven," " The Second Adam." He was now constituted Christ Jesus (i. e.) the anointed Jesus.
                            This anointing, Jesus being true to his mission, he has never lost ; hence he is still the "
                            Christ Jesus " — the " Anointed Saviour." (5) That Jesus, and all his faithful followers who
                            crucify and overcome the world — the generative worldly life in themselves, as Jesus set the
                            example, and thus become harvested from the world, as Jesus was — become eunuchs,
                            spiritually, for the " Kingdom of Heaven's sake," constitute the Christ Order now manifested
                            on the earth, and to all the souls of men, both in this and in the spirit world ; and yet,
                            that this Order was not completed in the dispensation of Christ's first appearing. (6)
                            Christ Jesus, and his faithful followers, constituting the true Christ Order, were for ages
                            lost from the earth ; but Jesus and his true disciples maintained it in the spirit world,
                            and constituted still the one true body of the Christ. (7) The John Baptist unction, or
                            forerunning spirit began to be manifested on earth the second time, in the latter part of
                            the seventeenth century, in Vivarais, France, extended into England in the early part of the
                            eighteenth century, and, about the middle of this century the revival of the manifestation
                            of the Christ Spirit, an unction from the Motherhood of God, began to be poured out upon a
                            little band of united souls in England, headed, for a time, by James and Jane Wardley. Of
                            this unction, Ann Lee at length became baptised, and eventually received the acknowledged,
                            leading gift, as the " Elder Sister of many Sisters m the Christ Order,"—as Jesus became the
                            ' Elder Brother " of many brethren, thus she became the anointed Bride, for which Jesus, the
                            anointed Bridegroom, waited. And spoken in its collective or united capacty, — Jesus Christ
                            and his true church, and Ann Lee, and her true church — constitute the manifest Christ Body,
                            being " one " in spirit as Bridegroom and Bride. Thus it is <pb n="3" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKES

                            revealing the Fatherhood of God, the second, the Motherhood of God. This church is Christ
                            now made manifest on earth ; the true followers of Christ Jesus are " one " with him as he
                            is "one" with the Father. In like oneness is the Bridal Christ Church, united with the

                            why it may not be a true idea. " All natures, intellectual, intelligible, and material, are
                            derived, by successive emanations, from the infinite fountain of Deity ; these successive
                            emanations are termed eons." Is it not so ? All agree that God is the Creator. This merely
                            aims to explain the mode of creation. If Jesus was born a natural man — a Jew, and when
                            between thirty and forty years of age, became a Christian, is it not quite as proper to say
                            Jesus toas the Christ, as to say Jesus is the Christ. Was not Jesus the first Christian man,
                            and Ann Lee the first Christian woman ? Were they not both baptized with pre-existing Christ
                            Spirit? Does not that idea leave other nations beside the Jews as Christian, and other races
                            as recipient of the Christ Spirit ? And further, could not a pre-existing Christ Spirit be a
                            Saviour — a resurrection power — to the intelligent inhabitants of other globes ? If Christ
                            be not pre-existent, whence came the spirit in the form of a dove that lit upon Jesus, and
                            who, and what was that dove, if not "a foreign spirit?" We say the President of the United
                            States is over all the realm, and is omnipresent, in that the United States laws extend to
                            the remotest boundaries, and go with each citizen to the ends of the earth — but the man,
                            Hayes, lives and resides in the capital of the nation. By his agents, commissioned and
                            clothed with his authority, all the functions of government are performed. And thus we say,
                            God is Spirit, a Supreme Being, ex- isting in the God element, as Hayes exists in
                            Washington. And yet we say God is omni- present, omniscient and all good; that all things
                            are in God ; they are in the God element ; and God rules and governs, by His agents and
                            officials, in all creation. The affairs of a race — a nation — a society — an individual—a
                            sparrow—of this and all inhabited globes, are directed by the spirit of Deity, through
                            rulers of his selection and appointment. One is Euler — a tutelary Deity —of a race.
                            Another, of a globe, with their subordinates, powers and principalities — Gods many and
                            Lords many. Jackson says: " God is the great Father (and Mother) spirit of all spirits — the
                            great type of whom all other spirits are but indications and corresponding organizations —
                            the Creator, Sustainer — Father and Mother of all." Kiddle snys : " Man must, in spirit and
                            from his heart, or the depths of his spiritual be. ing, go to God in prayer, or the holy
                            angels, who do the will of God, cannot visit him and assist him. He prays to God because it
                            is only by God's will he can be aided, and then the aid comes from God, through His
                            ministering spirits who bring it — thus His attributes are described as personal — Love,
                            Mercy, Wisdom, heedfulness to prayer." All these imply personality, either of primary or
                            secondary beings. If God be dual — Father and Mother — the first emanation, we will suppose
                            to be a materialization of the spirit world, or sphere, by some termed the Christ sphere, or
                            Heaven. Its inhabitants may be as Gods and Goddesses, who are sent as ministering 3 <pb n="4" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. spirits. By them worlds are made —visible and
                            invisible. We will then assume this sphere to be the fountain of inspiration to the
                            Prophetic or Resurrection order of men and women, in all worlds, who speak as they are moved
                            upon by holy, Christ Spirits. When we admit that there is a third heaven, reached unto by
                            Paul and Swedenborg, we admit gradations from earth to Deity ; and if there be higher and
                            lower orders of being, there must be one nearest to Deity, and that one could but be a
                            Mediatorial Order to all others. Is there any sphere beneath the earth sphere, or above the
                            Christ Heavens ? Are we necessarily limited to the precise degree of knowledge that those
                            before us have attained unto in spiritual things ? " The spirit searcheth all things, yea
                            even the deep things of God." If Paul had knowledge of these, why may not we have knowledge
                            of seven heavens ? If Jesus not only teas, but is the Christ, except Jesus be in us, then
                            are we reprobates, which is an awkward saying that we would avoid using.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Prentissiana" TEIform="index"/>"PRENTISSIANA."</head><p TEIform="p">In the days of spiritual manifestations among the Shakers, when the Eternal Parents bowed the

                            more," are the provisions that under the Shaker gospel are " the power of God unto salvation
                            from sin." We believe Jesus " worked out " His salvation ; and as He did this, so must we.
                            We believe He was born with the same nature which we possess — inclined to estrangment from
                            God, but he took up His cross against His lustful, fleshly nature, and overcame all
                            temptations to be less than a Christian. Doing thus, He was the first to be baptized with
                            the unction of the Christ— became the first Christian, and a model for all Christians. The
                            Shakers believe in rising above all relations belonging to the flesh, and entering into
                            bonds of spiritual brotherhood and sisterhood. I am very young, both in years and in
                            privilege among this people, but this is what I have been taught to believe ; and in this
                            belief, accompanied by submission to its demands, I find salvation from sin every day. Mount

Long before I had any idea of visiting or living in the same country with the Shakers I
                            read of them, as most others do, as curious specimens of human fanaticism ; but Communism
                            was with me a far-off subject with which I had no connection. My first acquaintance witli it
                            was made at the house of a gentleman in England, who prided himself upon his progressive
                            ideas, and who held meetings every week to consider the subject, which meetings I was
                            induced, though against my wishes, to attend. The gentleman of whom I have spoken is a
                            shorthand reporter, familiar with the newspapers, and a great reader, but it always seemed
                            to me of very weak character. He was a believer in anti-vaccination, a vegetarian, and
                            applied the most rigid rules to his diet, though his tastes and appetite were evidently in a
                            contrary direction. But in spite of all his precautions, or perhaps on account of them, it
                            would be hard to imagine a more dyspeptic looking man. Perhaps in this country he would have
                            been a strong G-rahamite, for he had a mill to grind his own flour so as to get it of the
                            desired quality ; the product of which was some of the hardest, stoniest, most indigestible
                            looking biscuits that could be seen. He was, no doubt, a well-meaning man, but I can
                            scarcely ever hear or think of Communism without thinking of him, and of all the stiffness,
                            oddity, and " unsociability" which he seemed to represent. He in no ways advanced my views
                            upon that subject, and I was glad to get away from it. But though I would gladly have had
                            this subject buried it seems to have thrust itself upon my notice strangely in after years.
                            We had not been in America long before we got accidentally into a Shaker settlement, and had
                            reason for hiring a house of them. We became well acquainted with them, and they seemed well
                            pleased to have us visit them. But I soon found, to my surprise, that they looked upon us as
                            possible converts. I tried to undeceive them, so far at least as I was concerned, by
                            explaining my 5 <pb n="6" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. own belief, and finding portions
                            of Scripture contradictory to those which they brought forward. They evidently liked to talk
                            with us, however, and would often send down their carriage for us to spend an evening with
                            them in discussing the various points of their belief. These evening meetings were times of
                            intense enjoyment, for the Elder of the Family which we visited was a man of rare social
                            qualities, a man of good speaking ability, a fine story-teller, fond of argument, and well
                            posted in all the grounds of his belief, and of such a hospitable, gen- ial nature as to
                            make every one at home with him at once. These meetings imposed upon us the obligations of
                            studying the subject of Shakerism, so that we might have some reasonable objections. It is
                            easy to feel as if one knew better than to believe the principles of the Shakers to be true
                            ; but it is not so easy as one thinks to find arguments to successfully oppose them, if we
                            wish to do them jus. tice ; and so I found, when I began to consider their arguments, that
                            they had far more truth upon their side than I had thought was possible, however some of
                            these truths may have been perverted by ignorance and superstition. Although the Shakers may
                            be looked upon as one of the best examples of successful Communism, it always seemed to me
                            that Communism was with them an incidental rather than a fundamental doctrine. They did not
                            begin by teaching Communism. There seems to be no evidence of any Communistic theories in
                            the days of Ann Lee, their founder. They had a new religion, and Communism was found to be
                            the best means of presenting it. Their religion struck at the roots of family life, and left
                            them dependent upon one another. They acknowledged no husband or wife, no father or mother
                            but God ; consequently, they were all brothers and sisters to one another—united, as the
                            followers of a persecuted religion always are, with their union made still stronger by the
                            dissolution of family ties. People, who had houses and lands gave them up for the good of
                            the whole, and they all looked forward to the speedy coming of the Kingdom of Heaven on
                            earth. The establishment of Communism amongst them seems to have been only the following out
                            of the acts and wishes of the members themselves, rather than any doctrine which was forced
                            upon them ; and although they advocate Communism now, and speak of it as a better way of
                            living, they do not appear to insist upon that feature so much as they do upon certain
                            others ; and it is a fact that will be noticed by all readers on this subject, that those
                            communities never have succeeded which have started with Communistic theories for their
                            basis. The successful Communities have always had something more potent than this to keep
                            them together. It has been a bond of common faith and feeling, rather than the distribution
                            of material benefits; and this speaks well for human nature, showing that people are not
                            really so much actuated by a love of common property as by a love of common sympathies. {To

A VERY</byline><p TEIform="p">One beautiful morning in October, when nature was dressed in her chameleon robes of
                            enchantment, before the morning beams had opened upon us from the eastern horizon, or the
                            sounds of busy feet were heard, a panorama of literature, or map of letters was spread
                            before our vision ; words, names of persons, principles, habits, records of life's deeds,
                            also mock professions were spread before us, and carved, into apparently oaken tables, a
                            half inch deep. We looked at the beautiful carving, the delicate designs, the rich
                            substantial tablets and admired. A voice we heard : " Tear off the mask! for 'neath it lies
                            the actual record of life, and these inscriptions, which appear so substantial, carved in
                            oak, are a superficial cheat." We then began to remove this splendid carving in this heavy
                            oaken veneering, when there appeared a spiritual tablet of what seemed to be a table of
                            light, and on its surface which was as smooth as a sea of glass, were engraven records in
                            clean-cut letters, fine and delicate, as if engravings on steel; these recorded the true
                            history of the 6 <pb n="7" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE SHAKER MANIFESTO. children of men, the inhabitants
                            of this lower world. Here were to be read the motives that prompted life's deeds, which oft
                            times betrayed a wicked intent, to an apparently good deed, as a heaped measure, in too
                            shallow a dish ; at other times, a good motive to an apparently evil deed, as a truth told
                            in simplicity against an apparent benefactor. Lives, to the memory of which costly monuments
                            have been erected as honorary mementoes on the tablets of fame, are often by this, spiritual
                            record of truth, on the beams of light, shown to have another side, not " all glorious
                            within " like the prophetic " king's daughter," but sometimes foul with disease of gnawing
                            condemnation, the fruit of broken laws of God, relative to the development and preservation
                            of the life and loveliness of body, soul and spirit. According to this record there is a
                            widespread effort in human transactions to deceive, to make a show of solidity, beauty and
                            unreal utility, as it were a testimony or advertisement carved in oak, with elaborate and
                            enchanting designs, where the clean cut history on the naked tablet of light and truth would
                            reveal shaminess and worthlessness ! Deceit seeing honesty honorable and valuable, steals
                            her livery. The artist puts upon his handicraft productions of clay, wood or iron, an enamel
                            of bronze, silver or gold ; as deception, the cabinet maker dresses his furniture of pine or
                            whitewood with a veneering of bay wood, mahogany or rosewood ; the manufacturer dresses his
                            silks with size to give them weight and lustre ; his broadcloths in shoddy to give them
                            bulk; his paper collars with stamps of thread, imitating cloth ; his India rubber is
                            adulterated with glue and molasses; his turtle shell combs are clarified, mottled glue; his
                            leather trunk covers are scotched papers ; his deer skins are sheep's pelts; and his goat
                            skin moroccos, lamb skins. The grocer calls to his clerk on the eve of parting for prayer
                            meeting, with " John, have you sanded the sugar ? Certainly! Have you watered the raisins ?
                            To be sure ! Have you wet the tobacco and sponges ? Even so ! Have you mixed peas with the
                            coffee ? I have ! Have you put meal with the ginger? Truly. Have you mixed the teas ? Verily
                            Well, then come to prayers." Tne merchant ihen gives 11 for a dozen, 34 inches for a yard,
                            and 23 quires for a ream ; he shrinks the bale at both ends. The farmer drives up the bottom
                            of the measure and gives thus 30 quarts for a bushel, sells chalk and water for milk, puts a
                            selection of best apples or potatoes on top of the barrel, and cobble stones in the hay
                            bale, and in the beeswax cake. The chemist and druggist adulterate every thing by which
                            gains can be made. And yet these pious so-called Christian professors read their bibles
                            where God, through Moses, is made to say : " Thou shalt not commit adultery ! " Thus,
                            children from earliest memory are associated with, and often trained to deception, and learn
                            to look upon society as a cheat, and. religious pretensions as mockery. Yet these people put
                            money into brick, stone or wooden sanctuaries as though it thus purchased their salvation!
                            Men build churches Babel high, and upon their spires, towering to the misty zenith poise the
                            symbol of the Christian's cross, as if to get it as far away from the walks of life as
                            possible, and hide it so completely from the level gaze of life's visions and incidents,
                            that its very existeenc might be forgotten. They build pulpits to elevate the preacher, as
                            if to honor his word then leave the work of prayer, praise, benedictions, and the practical
                            applications of truth, farther above their life's level practice than is the preacher's
                            elevated stand above the church pews. They introduce powerful organs to tune the praises of
                            God, whose springs of tone are ofttimes touched with fingers foul with deeds at which the
                            face would blush to meet the record as graven on the clean-cut tablets of truth, while the
                            heart is jilting in jollity of worldliness, and the audience is sprinkled with multitudes of
                            the empty and defiled " temples of God," tune- less, soulless, and perchance as hardened to
                            the touches and sensibilities of Christian sympathy, as the fire-hardened clay in the walls
                            of their gaudy sanctuary. The records of evangelism number their converts by the count of
                            their spired churches and the roll of pew holders, while e'mblazoned on the inscribed and

                            that were denied with sin, as if the admonitions, "Know ye not that your bodies are the
                            temples of the living God? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy," had
                            never been introduced to their ears, and much less been felt by their stupid souls, though
                            their Bible guide lies upon their pew seats ! The Record of the Word of God filed and bound
                            up with the filthy history of worldly sinners, canonized as saints, draped in Russian calf
                            or morocco, and edges gilt with gold and glittering clasps, is displayed in pews and on the
                            pulpit's velveted desk, as if its admonitions were revered and regarded as the rule of life
                            ; while from its motley mixed record of Revealed truth of God, Egyptian Magic, hyperbolical,
                            allegory and the history of sinful men's lives, falsely labeled : "After God's own heart."

                            God's plenarily inspired word, to justify themselves by the commandments of Moses' God, in
                            Wars; in retaliations, in living in the full indulgence of fleshly lusts by desires under
                            the " permissions " not " commandments " of Paul ; in deceptions by the example of Jacob in
                            his naughty trickery to obtain from his father Esau's blessings, in justification by faith
                            without works because of Paul's denial of the necessity of the works of Jewish law—the
                            ceremonies of a dispensation imperfect, and to be done away when that which is perfect is
                            come in the Christian dispensation. In fine, while professing to confide in the utility of
                            Jacob's Ladder, reaching from earth to Heaven, representing the different dispensations of
                            God's work with men namely : the Noachian, the Mosaic, the first Christian and the second
                            Christian, being the means by which humanity may climb in development from the gross,
                            disorderly earthly condition, upward to the orders of the New Earth and New Heavens. Mankind
                            disregard God's order of progress, which has testimony and laws adapted to each stage of
                            progress, and mix up the testimonies and laws of the dispensations, and from this baby-
                            lonish mixture, take rules of life to suit their carnal desires of the present era. Were men
                            thus to misapply the laws of temperature governing the season, to agriculture, the laws
                            governing affinity or dissolution of particles in chemical processes, the laws governing
                            inertia and motion in mechanics ; the laws of therapeutics and hygiene in the healing art;
                            the world would be in chaotic confusion of desolation. True religion with the mask torn off,
                            consists not in the mere professions and adoptions of creeds of faith ; not in the
                            attendance at churches ; not in the enrollment of names on the Church Record ; neither in
                            the dead professions of faith in Jesus' mission ; nor yet upon the emblazoned epitaph of

                                water, we had and have in this Jesus Christ the pattern of a life, superior in all
                                features, to any life that preceded him; and a life that has at no time since been
                                excelled. By this baptism of Jesus by the Holy Spirit He became The Christ—became a
                                convert from Judaism to Christianity—the first Christian. We hold, that as
                                Christians—followers after this Jesus Christ—we must copy, and embrace in our lives the
                                essential features of the Christ. It is not the profession that makes us Christians; but
                                the actual possession of those powerful principles, which having first worked so
                                successfully to the salvation of Jesus Christ, and for his Resurrection" in His earthly
                                life to a standard of life far beyond the Adamic or earthy, animal, reproductive plane,
                                will save us as well, and elevate us as highly, if we will to he His true disciples. We
                                hold, that as Christians, we profess to follow Christ in life ; and that as true
                                followers we cannot walk nor act in life other than did Jesus Christ, our perfect
                                exampler. Tried and tempted in all points that we know trials and temptations, He
                                survived these with an experience that should be ours. He was a natural man ; tempted as
                                natural men are, to good and to bad; and to all temptations, were they good or bad, he
                                yet maintained and presented the higher, more spiritual, the better life. Just as other
                                natural men aretempted,so was Jesus. Tempted by marriage, tempted by desired posterity;
                                by wealth ; by the ambitions of the warrior and the applause of the world. Amid all
                                temptations worldward, He maintained a sturdy self-denial; and by this denial to self,
                                and consecration to the superior life, he has laid down for our admonition, the
                                essential features of the Christian church, than which, can no other man lay: VIRGIN
                                CELIBACY ; PEACE ; BROTHERLY EQUALITY, and UNWORLDLINESS OF LIFE. These are the
                                prevailing features of Christianity which we rear upon our standard before a gazing
                                world; and we ask the sober and thoughtful, Are not these Christian principles'? Did not
                                the Master first raise this standard? Did not the Christ thus walk in life ? Then
                                declare we to all professedly Christian people: The faithful servant CANNOT FOLLOW WHERE

                                    Very many prophecies of the olden days, among us, culminate during this year.
                                    Exceeding spiritual influences were predicted before the year's close, either among
                                    the Shakers as a people; outside of our order, or both inside and outside. May the
                                    predictions prove true, even to the arousal of a universal revival of the most
                                    effective, religious fervor. We do not want the bubbling, trivial excitements of the
                                    churches, which only quicken the heart for the time to things above earthly
                                    vanities, and finally end by stirring the baser elements of humanity — the animal,
                                    reproductive, etc.— end in courtships, marriages or something worse. But we want
                                    something that will change the whole heart, so that " a new creature " will be the
                                    regeneration ; a soul convicted and converted from " old ¦ heavens and earth" to new
                                    life, wherein old things will be done away and all life will be new, and all of God
                                    ; a new life that not only bears no resemblance to the old life, but that the latter
                                    is made by comparison, to appear beneath the exalted dignity of the converted soul.
                                    We have seen the power of God manifested in Methodist revivals, to the discarding
                                    then and there of artificial adornments and worldly paraphernalia ; and had there
                                    been a continuance of such revival, with an increase, the worldly, fleshly lives
                                    would have been cast out with the gew-gaws. But will the predictions be consummated?
                                    Are we ready ? Do we want the overturning of our little, vain worlds, upside down ?
                                    And yet if we pray : " Thy kingdom come on earth," we know that there must occur the
                                    most radical conversions, the most diametrically oppositeness of our inclinations if
                                    we do God's will — do, act, live as we think they do in heaven. Let the religious
                                    wave come; let us welcome it; lave in it, live in it, die in it unto all that is not
                                    of Christ, and that will be losing our carnal, selfish lives to find Christ life. "

                                    would express, if possible, for such a brother, its inexpressible gratitude. Some of
                                    our religious exchanges are severely criticising the conduct of one, Brother Close-
                                    fist — he who loves the Church and the Church paper, only to the extent that he can
                                    make more money out of them than they cost him. Oh, how glad The Manifesto is that
                                    it has no Brother Closefist. We feel sorry for other papers. We would present to
                                    them the opinions and conduct of our Brother Openheart. Once he was a man of the

                                    commonly considered the " respectable vices " of human life. Once upon a time of
                                    life he was first cousin, at least, to Brother Closefist. But he experienced a
                                    genuine conviction and conversion. He forsook the world, he changed the current of
                                    his ambitions ; lie discarded the vices — the nasty, unspiritual habits of the
                                    world's man He became a new creature—a Shaker—was intrusted, is intrusted with funds
                                    consecrated " to charitable and religious purposes," and is just as ambitious to
                                    help The Manifesto as Brother Closefist is to help himself. We rejoice in our
                                    relations to Brother Openheart, and hold him up as a model brother, for all who
                                    would love the Lord better than they do themselves. We have no closefist brethren—if

                                    Age of the world, to assert that you do not worship Jesus. I noticed this in your
                                    pamphlet called " Plain Talks," and I am wonderfully surprised that a man calling
                                    himself a Christian, should place his sentiment in the public print. I suppose you
                                    think He had a natural father, and therefore a bastard ; and therefore unworthy of
                                    your worship. Do you know when you make this assertion, and, of course, deny His
                                    divinity, you deny the plain teachings of God's Holy Word, and plunge the soldier's
                                    spear to the heart of the Holy Blessed Jesus ? who suffered the death of the natural
                                    and spiritual cross, thereby subduing the hosts of hell, to make it possible for you
                                    and I to be saved. I do from my heart pity your state of soul. But the kind, loving
                                    Jesus still prays, " Father forgive him, for he knows not what he is doing." Oh, may

                                    to understand pretty well what Jesus meant, when He said, " Ye cannot serve God and
                                    Mammon." How much sweeter to live the higher life ! Self abnegation is the price of
                                    spiritual joys. Swedenborg was very clear on spiritual truth, he had developed to a
                                    high plane. You argue for abstinence from the lower pleasures. I query whether
                                    abstinence is more self-denying, or better, than temperance, while in this state of
                                    existence, the soul is dependent on the body, and is not the temperate enjoyment of
                                    its pleasures conducive to our highest development ? If not, is it not better to
                                    afflict our bodily life, in all ways, that we may reap the spiritual compensation,
                                    as do the Gymnosophists and Brahminical devotees ? It seems to me that you are
                                    extremely zealous to follow the particular ways of Jesus. Of course, the heart life,
                                    the motives of Jesus, we cannot be too punctilious about, but the outward life seems
                                    of small importance. Again, if you would exactly follow His example, ought you not

                                    by His example, and by the same of those who "followed hard after Christ," to total
                                    abstinence from sexual indulgences in the reproductive sphere; being resurrected

                                it is the spirit of selfishness—the spirit which seeks its own private ends regai'dless
                                of the rights and feelings of others. Nothing too bad can be said of it, for when
                                entirely stripped of all disguises there is nothing left of it but " pure cussedness,"
                                as one might say. Not a redeeming quality can be found in it. In a word, selfishness is
                                the spirit of the devil, whose greediness acknowledges no right but the right to devour.
                                Although there are all shades of selfishness found in unregenerate man, from the subtle
                                and refined to the gross and brutal, yet the root is identical wherever discovered. The
                                pirit of selfishness is so entirely incompatible with God's generous purposes concerning
                                humanity, that it is constantly seeking, by all manner of plausible subterfuges, to hide
                                its hideous deformity from the light of advancing civilization. Yet no reflective mind
                                can fail to see that this venomous foe to human redemption is coming to judgment as
                                never before. It-would almost seem that the invisible powers of good are combining for
                                its overthrow, by exposing it to the light of day in high places. Men are quite too apt
                                to justify a little selfishness in themselves, on the ground that everybody else is
                                selfish. But that won't do. Selfishness is a sin, and no amount of philosophy can change
                                it into a virtue. When selfish deeds are seen in others they invariably look hateful and
                                mean, so that no man vyith a grain of gene- rosity in his heart can approve of them,
                                whether committed on a petty or on a gigantic scale. Selfishness may be tolerated, but
                                it cannot be justified. Mean, selfish deeds are often pardoned on the ground of
                                ignorance, moral weakness, or cowardice ; but the light of civilization is dispelling
                                ignorance, just as the light of the gospel of Christ is dispelling all excuse for sin.
                                We repeat, that selfishness is on trial; and for what ? For all the crimes and vices of
                                which man has been guilty since his seduction by the old serpent whom God pronounced "
                                more subtle than any beast of the field." The result of this trial, however, is not
                                doubtful. Selfishness has the unanimous, unqualified condemnation of heaven and earth,
                                and can have no defender excep^ in Satan and his angels. There is every indication that
                                the principality of selfishness is fleeing before the evangels of Faith and Science,
                                whose discoveries are revealing the fact that God has " made of one blood all nations of
                                men to dwell on all the face of the earth ; " and equally certain is it, that these twin
                                forces, which are doing the will of heaven, will yet prove that all men have a common
                                interest in hating iniquity and in loving righteousness ; a common interest in
                                supporting Christ as the rightful owner of all men, and as the sovereign of this world ;

                                our popular, professionally Christian churches to-day, as taught and lived by Jesus and
                                the early primitive Christiana, people would stare at it as something new; and after
                                their curiosity was satisfied, they would stone or crucify in some manner, those who
                                should insist authoritatively upon their living like Jesus and His disciples. So long as
                                nearly all denominations permit worldly practices and fleshly indulgences and
                                relationships, there can be but little difference between them ; but no sooner are these
                                dispensed with, as Jesus and His disciples did with them ; and souls asked, urged,
                                demanded to observe the self-denial of Jesus, and to copy his exceedingly moral and
                                spiritual life—to be "lifted up" above the life of the world as He was—not till then do
                                we observe " a coming out from among them, to touch not, taste not, handle not, but to
                                be separate from the world." We copy some of the thoughtful remarks of our co-worker and
                                admirer—The Harbinger of Light, Melbourne, Australia — and ask reflection upon that
                                portion of the theme that demands a superior life—a life like unto Christ's—from those
                                who profess that their peculiar denomination teaches a superior Christianity : * * *
                                There is a widespread opinion among the Free-thinking community, that the divergence
                                between the teachings of Paul and Jesus is due to the diversity of doctrine and
                                consequent disunion and discord among the so-called Christian churches of the day. In
                                this we join issue. Doctrine, dogma and forms of religion, have been the greatest
                                impediments to true religious progress in times past, and it is only of late the
                                religion of Jesus has had an opportunity to come to the fronfand be considered on its
                                merits unobscured by the creedal curtains hung about it by those whose true office is to
                                make it manifest to the world. One of the leading Presbyterian ministers in this city
                                has set a noble example by his advocacy of the spirit of Christ's teachings,
                                irrespective of the form, and in his recent lecture, " Present Troubles in the Church,"
                                indicates practical Christianity as the solution of them. It is still the ambition of
                                not only the churches, but of individuals tobring others to the same form of belief as
                                theirs and to congratulate themselves at any instance of success; but what ground have
                                they for jubilation? Is there any thing gained to the individual or to humanity, by the
                                transition from Episcopalianism to Wesleyanism, from Baptist to Independent, or from any
                                of the orthodox churches to Spiritualism ? The simple alteration of belief is without
                                virtue unless it brings with it an elevation of the moral or spiritual character of the
                                individual, and this brings to us the thought that by the sensational and 'phenomenal,
                                numbers are being urged into the ranks of Spiritualism who are unprepared to appreciate
                                and act upon its principles. There is no gain to the cause, quality is of more
                                importance than quantity. Better that our numbers should be few, and those few showing
                                by their lives the influence of their faith, than many whose social, moral and religious
                                natures exhibit no advancement from their change of faith. The mission of Spiritualism
                                is to the " Gentiles," so to speak, that is to the world without its ranks, it works
                                from within outwards, both in the individual and the body, and by presenting ethics
                                analogous to those of Christ, it does more for real Christianity than its professed
                                teachers. The diffusion of " Spiritual Truths " is not comprehended in the demonstration
                                of phenomena, and the evidences of spirit intercourse with mortals, but in the
                                dissemination of the broad gospel of Spiritualism, which comprehends all that tends to
                                harmony and progress in the individnal or the mass. Its greatest work is the
                                emancipation of men's minds from binding creeds and dogmas. Toleration and freedom of
                                thought are two of its prominent standards, and although some of its workers are

                                grand work by insisting that professors and followers of Christ ought to live sinless,
                                as did Christ. As a specimen of its teachings, and which teaching ought to awaken the
                                Christian professor to his or her proper senses, we quote the following : If man who is
                                a sincere Christian, and who believes that God has washed away his sins, sings these
                                lines : " I am all unrighteousness, False and full of sin I am," does he not thereby
                                call in question the purifying work of the Spirit in his heart, and rank himself with
                                the vilest of sinners? If the confessions which we hear from many Christians are true,
                                if they are as great sinners as they say they are, if they are really guilty of the
                                wickedness which they say they are guilty of, they ought neither to profess the
                                Christian name nor make any pretensions to religion. Sin and holiness are directly
                                contrary to each other. There is no blending of the two things, no agreement between the
                                two states. If a man is sinning daily, he is not a holy man ; if a man is holy he is not
                                daily sinning. The piety, devotion and usefulness of the church are injured by their
                                untruthful confessions of sin. They are imperceptibly and unconsciously led to think
                                less of the work of Christ than they ought to do ; they give encouragement to
                                world-loving professors to think less of the evil of sin, by making the impression that
                                religion consists in a great degree in daily confession of deprav. ity and vileness ;
                                and they also encourage some of little or-no piety to join the church.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-press" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Another story of the shakers" TEIform="index"/>ANOTHER STORY OF THE SHAKERS</head><p TEIform="p">Elsewhere may be found letters passing between E.

                                SHAKER MANIFESTO. in any statement you may make respecting the faith and principles of
                                Shakerism. In most of the standard works in public libraries, the information to be
                                obtained is unreliable. Not yet is the Shaker Order fairly represented in the great
                                republic of letters, as are the Methodist, Baptist and other popular sects, "In the just
                                by and by," Shakers will be known as they really are, whether for better or worse. Now
                                to your questions: 1. " Do the Shakers hold the doctrine of Christ's expiatory sacrifice
                                as the basis of the atonement ? And if not, what are their views'? " Questions well put.
                                We do not so hold; do not think Jesus was born the Christ; do not attach any merit to
                                the Jews for killing Jesus, nor believe any benefit accrued to mankind from their
                                causing him to be murdered or sacrificed under Roman Laws. We hold that God is Spirit,
                                Father and Mother, the primary Paternal and Maternal creative powers of this and all
                                worlds that revolve in the immensity of space. The advent of a Christ Spirit, or Angel
                                such as descended upon Jesus, after John had baptized him with water, begins to
                                resurrect souls from the process of reproduction. It did so resurrect Jesus, enabling
                                him to say and speak advisedly, " I am the resurrection." " I am the way, the truth and
                                the life." " He who seeketh to save his life shall lose it. But whoso will lose his
                                life, shall find it unto life eternal." Referring to the generative life and to the
                                Christ life. This is the substance of the whole matter. Jesus, instead of being one of
                                three Gods, was simply the first generative man who became a Shaker. All Christians are
                                Shakers, " Other sheep have I, who are not of this fold." Other nations of the earth,
                                beside the Jews, have had their Jesuses, or Saviours who were baptized by the Christ
                                Spirit, causing them to die to physical propagation, and to live to God and Christ in
                                the Spirit—Shaker lives. Hence, in India, Egypt, Ceylon, China, Peru and Mexico, Orders
                                of people arose, who held goods in common, would neither marry, nor fight, nor swear,
                                nor " use the things of this world as abusing them." They lived upon fruits cereals and
                                vegetables; would not kill any thing. And for aught we know, the same principles apply
                                to other globes than earth. These were a kind of first fruits of the final harvest of
                                the world—local millennials, foreshadowing the Great millennial we are now approaching
                                wherein " the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea."
                                The increasing intercommunication between nations in commerce, politics and education,
                                is the prelude to a universal government, when " the kingdoms of this world will become
                                the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ." 2. "Do they observe Christmas as the
                                birthday of 9m1 Lord?" (Meaning Jesus.) We have no more objection to observing his
                                birthday* than to observing the birthday of Buddah, Zoroaster, Washington or George Fox.
                                3. " What do they teach the children under their care as to the person and work of Jesus
                                Christ? " We teach them to preserve their native innocence, as Jesus did, who kept the
                                Jewish law forbidding the sin of Onan, as a deadly, destructive, social vice, that was
                                accounted so heinous as to deserve physical death. Then we teach them that having
                                refrained from sinning against their own bodies, they should pray earnestly, agonize, "
                                to enter in at the straight gate" of a Christ's baptism. Having received this, they are
                                to walk in newness of life on the earth, but not of the earth—to be not of the world as
                                respects generation, property and war, even as Jesus and His apostles were not of the
                                world. In short, we wish them to be as one said: '• As Jesus was, so are we in this
                                world." Thus, dear friend, have I endeavored to reply to your candid questions.,
                                according to the grace of God I have attained unto. Respectfully,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F. W." TEIform="persName"/>F. W.

                                large story—till he came out a full grown liar. Two boys began by battering each other,
                                till they got a-going and couldn't stop. They separated with black eyes and bloody noses
                                ! Did you hear about the young man stealing from his master's drawer ? He came from the
                                country a promising boy. But the rest of the clerks went to the theater and smoked, and
                                he thought he must do so too. He began thinking be would try it once or twice. He got
                                a-going and could not resist the temptation when he knew there was money in the drawer.
                                He got a-going—he will stop in prison. Some young men were, some years ago, in the habit
                                of meeting together in a room at the public house, to " enjoy themselves "— to drink and
                                smoke. One of them, as he was going there one evening, began to think there might be
                                danger in the way. He stopped and considered a moment, and then said to himself, " Right
                                about face !" He dropped his cigar, went back to his room and was never seen at the
                                public house again. Six of the young men followed his example. The rest got a-going, and
                                could not stop till they landed most of them in drunkard's graves. Beware, boys, of the
                                first cigar or chew of tobacco. Be sure, before you start, that you are in the right
                                way, for when you are going down hill it is hard to stop!</p></div3><div3 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Lie sticks" TEIform="index"/>A Lie Sticks</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">—A little newsboy, to sell his paper, told a lie.

                                from her ? Go away, and never stop here again, boy ! " That evening the lady was called
                                down to speak to a boy in the hall. He was very neatly dressed, and stood with his cap
                                in his hand. It was the enemy of the morning. " I came to tell you that I was not a bad
                                boy," he said: "I go to Sunday-school, and help my mother all I can. I never tell lies,
                                nor quarrel, nor say bad words, and I don't like a lady to call me names, and ask me if

                                his pony on Sunday, instead of going to church ? " " I am afraid he does : but he ought
                                not," said the lady, blushing a little. " Mother don't know I came here," said the
                                bright little rogue; "but I thought I would just come around and see what kind of folks

                                the felloes on both are commencing to rot badly. They must go to the shop to be

                                At the end of eight days the bottle should be refilled. The remedy is said to be

                                One of them was very impatient under the loss, and fretted about, it very much. The
                                other went patiently to work at once to plant a new crop. After awhile the impatient,
                                fretting man went to his neighbor. • To his surprise he found another crop of peas
                                growing finely. He wondered how this could be. " These are what I sowed while you were
                                fretting," said his neighbor. " But don't you ever fret ? " he asked. " Yes, I do ; but
                                I put it off till I have repaired the mischief that has been done." " Why then you have
                                no need to fret at all." " True," said his friend," " and that's the reason I put it
                                off."—Presbyterian. </p></div3><div3 type="farming" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Valuable manifesto hints" TEIform="index"/>Valuable manifesto hints

                            singin', jest the same as when we were young ; But there all the likeness is ended, when you
                            say that they preached, prayed, an' sung. And when we drdve up to the gateway, tears came
                            till I hardly could see, To hear the old song so familiar, " I'm glad that salvation is
                            free." But jest as we was a-startin', to partake of the heavenly grace, A man stepped up
                            quickly, demandin' a fee ere we entered the place. And though they all said that the
                            preachin' was the best that they ever had heard; And though they declared that the prayin'
                            brought blessings with every word; Though the singin' they said was exquisite, the thought
                            pierced me thro' like a sword, That the preacher got so many praises, there'd be none of

                            find fault, And the command to judge not quickly warned me that complaints had best come to
                            a halt. And jest as I was a gettin' my mind in a spiritual frame, A smilin' young preacher
                            rose sayin', "We'll proceed' to sell lots — in God's name." I thought he must say it in
                            figure, meanin' something concerning Lot's wife ; But no, to my utter amazement, he stood up
                            as big as life, And there in God's holy altar, and then upon God's holy day, He proceeded to
                            auction the lots off for whatever the people would pay. " The first lot's the best on the

                            anger, and I felt, as we rose to go, That the whip for the old money-changers might have
                            found some more work here to do. So, since we have been to camp-meetin' and seen all there
                            was to see, I think you'll agree that camp-meetin' ain't no longer for sich as we be. Though

Henry Roe, P. R. A. S. (England), sends to the London Times a new theory of the
                            weather. He claims to have determined by careful observations, covering nearly thirty years,
                            that dry and wet periods succeed one another in alternate waves of nearly equal length. Not
                            that this quality of duration is quite absolute, or that the wave of one period is exactly
                            the same fac simile as that of a corresponding period at an earlier or a later time; but
                            there is enough of regularity and uniformity about the waves to make the family likeness
                            clearly discernible to any eye that looks for it. These periods extend over three whole
                            years for each, and the following simple rules will enable any one to work out the several
                            cycles of years for himself: 1. When the number representing any given year is even and
                            exactly divisible by three, that year is the middle one of three cold and wet summers. 2.
                            When the number representing the year is odd and divisible by three, then that year is the
                            middle one of a triad of dry and hot summers. After testing by these rules the successive
                            seasons of the past twenty-seven years, and finding fact to conform to theory, Mr. Roe
                            predicts that 1881 will be the middle one in a triad of hot and dry summers. What relations

                            Otto, " that you do not drink whisky; but it grieves me that your people use so much of it."

                            communicated the reproof before he uttered it, " we Indians use a great deal of whisky, but

                            Merrimac Visitor, " that we are apt to think of Him more as a wandering priest, who, when he
                            was thirsty, turned water into wine, and when he was hungry made bread of stones, than a
                            mechanic, the carpenter of a Jewish village, busy with his saw and hammer, and seldom going
                            away from his home. As the representative of humanity, he took the condition not of the few,
                            but of the many ; and though his heart may have gone out for the rich, he had no promises to
                            give them, while his hand was ever extended to the poor, and upon the working masses were
                            his blessings showered continually. There is no character in history, throwing out all
                            considerations of his divinity, that deserves so much to be studied and loved by the
                            laboring people as that of Jesus. To them he was prophet, king and saviour ; to them he was
                            love and wisdom ; to them he was light and life. He drew near to them in their humblest
                            estate ; and he drew them near to him—to his very bosom and fondest embrace. He sat at meat
                            with them, slept in their cottages and wept over their sufferings. We can see how a rich man
                            might be infidel to the teachings of Christ, but why any poor workingman should be is
                            passing strange."</p></div2><!--
