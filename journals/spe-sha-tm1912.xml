                            OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. NO. 6.</head><p TEIform="p">In the summer of 1838, many of these singular exercises took place during the
                            hours of manual labor. Persons would be seen bowing, shaking, or making gesticulations
                            whether in the presence of the Believers or of those not members of the Community. After an
                            exhibition of a few months, this strange proceeding passed away. Another class of
                            extraordinary manifestations of the spirit was in the receiving of a great variety of
                            spiritual presents, as paper, pens, books, flowers, fruits, boxes, baskets, &amp;c,
                            &amp;c. Implements of hand labor, and even weapons of war were often brought to our
                            notice. The object of all this seemed to be for the purpose of attracting the attention to
                            something pleasant or useful, and at the same time draw the mind toward that which is
                            spiritual. It was very much after the same manner that Mother Ann worked while performing
                            her mission on the earth. She would first awaken conviction in the mind, in order to be able
                            to plant the seed of gospel truth, and to lead souls from wrong to right. Near the close of
                            the year Father Joseph Meacham and other spirits visited the Society and were very earnest
                            to lend their assistance in the renewing of gospel order, and a better understanding of the
                            life of a follower of Christ. The great number of new and beautiful songs that were received
                            through spirit influence was quite remarkable. Visionists and impressive mediums would speak
                            of the presence of the prophets, the apostles and others. Many of our own dear friends gave
                            unmistakable evidence that they were with us. So many and so varied were these gifts, and
                            withal so interesting, that we were often kept beyond the usual hour for meeting. This year
                            of 1838 was the most remarkable that had occurred in the history of the Community, of which
                            but little can be known, except by those who were interested participators in it. The new
                            year opened with a continued manifestation of new songs and with many spiritual gifts as in
                            &gt; the/ previous season. In the month of April we received word that the ministering
                            spirits would soon close their work and return to their own home. Their visits would then be
                            less frequent and the special work for which they were sent be accomplished.<pb n="266" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> The year 1839, however, was a year of spirit ministration, and
                            abounded in all the various phases that had been received at au earlier date, and were
                            communicated in a very pleasant and attractive manner. Even the service for the burial of
                            the dead was made more acceptable, by adopting a less melancholy air, and by permitting the
                            "Instruments" to take part by singing or speaking. We could not avoid participating with the
                            mourners, in the loss of a dear friend, but Believers were not called to mourn as those who
                            mourned without hope. The year 1840 opened with new spirit manifestations. While they ma\
                            have been abundant and instructive, they were, at the same time, more impressive as they
                            dwelt more essentially upon the responsibilities of life. The messages that were delivered
                            dwelt largely on the necessity of becoming pure in heart, aud living in the light which God
                            gives to his people. It was "to use the things of this world as not abusing them.'" To lay
                            aside that which was superfluous, and seek more fully the kingdom of God. Those who had been
                            Ministers and Elders to the people in the establishing of the gospel work, were still as
                            earnestly engaged for our prosperity and spiritual happiness. Fathers Wm. Lee, James
                            Whittaker, and Joseph Meacham were known through their communications, which for the work of
                            God, gave no uncertain sound. In the year 1841 the subject of food and drink received much
                            attention, and the use of swine's flesh was wholly rejected. At the same time it was thought
                            best to discontinue the se of all alc&gt;&gt;holic drinks, including cidtr. For so
                            large a family, however, but very little had been used, except for medicines for nearly
                            twenty years. Foreign tea aud coffee were also discontinued, agreeably to the advice of the
                            spirit messages. Near the close of the year these special ministrations became less
                            frequent, and the order of the spiritual work passed into another form, quite as peculiar as
                            any that had preceded it. A company of some twelve or more persons were selected by
                            direction of the spirit messengers, as speakers and singers, who were to pass through all
                            our dwellings, and indeed through all of our buildings, and manifest by testimony or through
                            the ministration of hymns and songs, the gift by which they might be impressed. This work
                            was attended with much spirit power, aud resulted in accomplishing all that might have been
                            anticipated in awakening souls to more spirituality, and in stimulating them to take better
                            care of all their temporal possessions. The whole Community shared in the blessings that
                            followed the labors of this devoted company as they visited every family aud spent many days
                            wholly absorbed in this special manifestation. This work closed on the 19th. of Dec, 1841,
                            at which time several farewell addresses were made by the spirit guides. On Dec. 24th. the
                            Believers were requested to close all manual labor at 12 M. and spend the remainder of the
                            day in meditation. Christmas, as usual was kept like the Sabbath. Another form of spirit
                            manifestation was now opened and a company of "Instruments" or mediums and singers were
                            appointed to this heavenly charge. While the former work was one of violent agitations, and
                            powerful testimonies, this came as<pb n="267" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> a still, small voice, a
                            beautiful representation of the work of Divine Wisdom. A visit of only a few moments was
                            given to the Brethren and Sisters as this company passed silently through the several
                            dwellings. On the Sabbath, the leading spirit made an address which was one of blessing and
                            love. In 1841 the manifestations increased in frequency, and a large number of messages were
                            written, having special reference to a life consecrated to God The birthday of Mother Ann
                            Lee, which occurred on the 1st. of March, was kept in loving remembrance of one who had
                            given her life to Grod, for the protection and happiness of her children. The manifestation
                            of Holy Wisdom was opened by a short address, and by words of blessing or warning to each
                            one. To meet these requirements, a special season was devoted to prayer, and a partial
                            fasting for several days. It was, indeed, a work of preparation, for the acceptance of the
                            gift of Wisdom. Our history has thus far been confined mostly to those gifts which have
                            occurred during the hours of worship. At an earlier date, it was quite different. The people
                            were full of faith, and zeal and they combined their temporal and spiritual gifts so
                            thoroughly, that meetings could be held at any hour of the day, and religious services would
                            be in operation in one part of the house while manual labor would be going on in another.
                            Some would pass into visions while engaged in their daily duties, while others would be
                            exhorting or singing. As the church advanced in order and government the temporal and
                            spiritual interests were kept more separate, so that for many years very little attention
                            was given to any manifestations except those that took place in time of worship. When the
                            great outpouring of the spirit took place in 1837, we then found that much time must be
                            consumed, and at all hours of the day, as the singing of new songs, the passing into
                            visions, and the writing of messages, demanded the attention of the Elders and frequeatly of
                            some of the Brethren and Sisters, as witnesses of this new work. The close of the year 1841
                            was remarkable for seasons of worship, in which were manifested such deep humiliation and
                            prayer. Hours and hours were spent in meditation, as being preparatory to the reception of
                            the many beautiful gifts that in the future as in the past would be poured out upon all
                            faithful souls. The seasons of religious service were very solemn, and frequently extended
                            beyond their usual time. All who were active workers in this manifestation, devoted many
                            hours to fasting and prayer. Arising at a very early hour in the morning, they sometimes met
                            for prayer service before the hour of breakfast. At this time and at the subsequent meals,
                            they abstained from all animal food, and partook sparingly of bread and water. The day was
                            filled with diverse gifts of the spirit, and these extended into a late hour of the night.
                            The year closed with this memorable record of the work ' of the spirits which had been to us
                            one of astonishment as well as of great joy. (TO BE CONTINUED.)</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The love of God cherished in the soul..." TEIform="index"/> The love of God

                            and heaven fled away, and there was no place found for them." Rev. xx., 11. SHAKERISM. The
                            great white throne is Shakerism�the Resurrection Order. In it and on it sits, rules, and
                            reigns, the Christ spirit, in judgment. Its fundamental principle is, the duality�Fatherhood
                            and Motherhood�of God. CHRIST HEAVENS. Christ heavens as the first materialization from
                            Deity. It is the fountain of prophecy to earth and to all mundane worlds and when the
                            harvest time of a world has come, a Savior appears, who is an incarnation of a Christ angel,
                            as were Jesus and Ann ; and souls are reaped or cut oflf�resurrected�from the generative,
                            propagative order ; they become Christians. DEATH AND RESURRECTION. They hate their own life
                            as a natural, reproducing, animal man or woman ; become celibates, and forsake father,
                            mother, wife and children�all generative ties ; there being in Christ neither male nor
                            female. PEACE. The counsel of peace is betwixt them both ; male and female, they become
                            equal in all forms of government, civil and ecclesiastical, in the new earth and in the new
                            heaven. SELFISHNESS. The selfish, personal property nature�mine and thine�is ignored ;
                            houses and lands are forsaken ; and community of goods is established, as a fundamental
                            principle of the new heavens ; and co-operation in the new earth. EQUALITY OF SEXES. Wars
                            will not cease to the ends of the earth, until the war-element is subdued in the individual.
                            Peace or nonresistance is therefore a fundamental principle of genuine Christianity, and of
                            the new earth, too. SALVATION. Salvation from the sins of the world pertaining to sexuality,
                            property, wars and fightings, to ambition, love of power, to eating flesh�meat�to drinking,
                            to tobacco, alcohol, and all lusts of flesh and mind. His name was called Jesus, because he
                            would save his people from their sins. LABOR. Work consecrated ; "hands to work and hearts
                            to God." All labor, from the Ministry and Elders to the children. "He who will not work,
                            neither shall he eat." AMBITION. He who would be great among you, let him gain distinction
                            by doing the most good to others. Labor is worship. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. Faith that the Christ
                            spirit has now come, the second time ; being manifested in a representative woman, Ann ; as
                            it was manifested the first time through a representative man, Jesus. They are the Cherubim.
                            The counsel of peace is between them both. The tabernacle of God is with man ; the kingdom
                            has come. The above principles are in practical operation among the people called Shakers ;
                            anJ thus is formed the white throne, upon which the spirit was seen to sit, by the
                            revelation of John. White represents the righteousness of saints ; a sinless life.<pb n="269" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE DEAD. '�And I saw the dead, small and great stand
                            before God, and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is tiie book of
                            life. Aud the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
                            according to their works." MEMORY. "The books" are the two lobes of the brain, wherein is
                            recorded, as in tablets every deed done in the body, good aud bad. "I take to witness the
                            grace of the people to come, for they shall call their sins to remembrance, and acknowledge
                            them !" JUDGMENT. As these books exist in each individual, the Christ spirit came to convict
                            them of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, and that is their day of judgment, when the
                            books are opened. CLOUDS OF HEAVEN. It is said Christ would be seen coming in the clouds of
                            heaven. The earth-cloud is formed by the aggregation of individual drops of rain ; and the
                            clouds of heaven�Shaker families, Societies�are formed in the same way. And Jude saith,
                            "Behold! The Lord cometh, with ten thousand of his saints to judge the world, and to execute
                            judgment upon all; to convict all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds,
                            and of all their hard speeches. And when the enemy should come in like a flood, the Lord
                            will lift up a standard of righteousness against him." That standard is the testimony of
                            Jesus, which Shakers live out. IMPERFECT. The testimony of Noah made not the antediluvians
                            perfect; every imagination of their hearts being evil continually. Neither did it make Noah
                            perfect, except in his generative life. He was perfect in his generations; not in getting
                            drunk. THE LAW OF MOSES. The law made not the comers thereunto perfect. The dispensation was
                            a stepping-stone, a schoolmaster; by it was a knowledge of sin. Sin is generation ; in
                            agriculture, in physiology, in food and drink, in property, in usury ; and in wars and
                            fightings with the heathen. The sins of idol worship ; and personal violence. "An eye for an
                            eye and a tooth for a tooth." FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH. Neither did that bring full salvation
                            from the sins of the world. The disciples "knew in part, prophesied in part, and saw as
                            through a glass, darkly." But, they united and groaned in spirit for that dispensation to
                            come, that would make them perfect as God is perfect. SECOND CHRISTIAN CHURCH. And I saw a
                            new heaven and a new earth ; for the first earth and the first heaven had passed away. And
                            there was no more sea. The new heaven was the kingdom of heaven which Jesus set all people
                            praying for. It has come ! NO MORE SEA. Babylon had fallen, and "the great whore that
                            sitteth upon many waters," which constitute the sea�'"peoples, and multitudes, and nations
                            and tongues," �Church and state adulterous mixtures of politics and religion�these will pass
                            away, and no place be found for them. NEW EARTH. And the white cloud, formed by resurrection
                            saints, constitutes the new heaven in which the Christ abides.<pb n="270" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> CHURCH AND STATE GOVERNMENTS,- - -Are all founded in force, and
                            maintained by fraud. The conqueror took possession by the sword, and then enacted laws by
                            which the conquests are transmitted to posterity. AMERICAN REPUBLIC. Monarchy, aristocracy,
                            primogeniture, national religions fled away, and no place was found for them in the American
                            republic. The sovereign people have universal suffrage (except women,) and elect their own
                            rulers from their own ranks. CHATTEL SLAVERY. This remained. It, too, has fled away, and uo
                            place is found for it, legally, in the United States ; where all men are said to be born
                            equal and free, possessed of inalienable rights to land, air, water, light, and heat, to
                            sustain them and allow them to pursue after happiness. BLOOD. The quasi-religious
                            governments of Christendom are all literally turned to blood. They exhaust the resources of
                            the nations, in creating and supporting armies, navies, forts, and arsenals, and
                            monitors�the munitions of war competing eternally with each other, in an endless struggle to
                            each one exceed the other, even in time of peace. Thus it is war expenses and taxes, all the
                            time ; and there is no place found for the millions of poor, landless people but in the army
                            an 1 navy, and in the poor-houses and prisons of their ruined countries. WAGES SLAVERY.
                            Food, clothing, shelter, the people must have, at aay cost, aud upon any terms, or die. They
                            are in a slavery worse than chattel slavery, except a delusive idea of freedom. The system
                            has come to its culmination ; capital and labor are at war ; where will it end ? In blood or
                            bread. In a destructive revolution ; or in restoring the robbed rights of the people back to
                            them. Then they would have land�bread� and wages. Slavery, with poverty, war, and bloodshed,
                            would flee away, just as chattel slavery fled away. ROME. Roman prisoners were made to fight
                            each other, in her immense amphitheatres, for the amusement of the people ; as did
                            gladiators and savage beasts. Sometimes thousands of the prisoners were engaged, at one
                            time, in these manoeuvres. "War is a game that kings play at." Here a republic played ut it
                            in our Civil War. In Spain, 17, 000 heretics would be burned, or otherwise destroyed, for
                            popular amusement, in their auto-de-fe exhibition of human wickedness. WAR TAXES. Every
                            nation in Christendom is being eaten up by war-taxes, to raise and maintain armies and
                            navies, to build forts, monitors, arsenals, an X in creating munitions of war. Millions of
                            the best physical men, who ought to be married men, are kept iu idleness during peace, and
                            for mutual butchery in war. It is war-taxes, all the time ; all the labor of the nations is
                            turned to blood. Is not this Babylon? PROBATION IN THE SPIRIT WORLD. The sea gave up the
                            dead which were iu it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were iu them ; and
                            they were judged every one according to their works. They were judged as were those in the
                            flesh ; but lived according to Grod in the Spiritual Resurrection. And death and hell,
                                which<pb n="271" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> Antichrist lias created, and whicli are
                            foundation stones in the temple in which the Man of Sin sits and reigns�were cast into the
                            lake of fire�the fire of truth. Jesus said, "I come to bring fire on earth'"�the first earth
                            and heaven ; "and what will I if it be already kindled?" It will burn the world up. What man
                            has created, God can destrcy ; but what God has created, man cannot destroy. Error and
                            wickedness are temporary ; truth and righteousness, immortal. The world passeth away, and
                            the lusts thereof; but the word of God abideth forever and ever. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            surpassed, the shining guide of fire and light whose radiant splendor, centuries could not

                            Annie R. Stephens. Passed from our mortal vision, Stamped with the seal of death ; Not
                            dead,�but, in homes Elysian Breathing immortal breath. "Not dead," I hear him saying, "For
                            in these realms sublime, To those who truth obeying, Death, is life's blossom time." The
                            floweret of the Summer Lies cold in Autumn's tomb ; But soon the soft May breezes Revive to
                            bud and bloom. And thus the spirit groweth Through all life's toil and pain; Its essence
                            upward goeth, To bloom in Spring again. So our beloved hath left us; Yet mourn we not in
                            grief; The angels have bereft us, To claim the ripened sheaf. Yea, ripened by the doing Of
                            deeds of godliness ; By duty's path pursuing That leads to righteousness, No good thing ever
                            dieth; And they who rise from loss, Will find earth's struggles brightened By the halo of
                            the cross. The tribute that we bring thee Our heart's affections hold; Through all thy life
                            there runneth Bright threads of living gold. No lowly one benighted, But felt thy pitying
                            love ; Each cause by justice lighted Thy voice was strong to move. No monument we rear thee,
                            No costly work of art; Thy works and life endear thee Unto each loving heart. Blest is the
                            soul that giveth Its all in sacrifice ; Not dead,�that spirit liveth In Heaven's own
                            Paradise. Not dead, but only drifted A little farther on, To where the vale is lifted In the
                            Summer Land of song. I catch the strains of gladness, Rung from the harps of gold, Released
                            from mortal sadness, What glories now unfold. 0 spirit clothed imn ortal! Yea, pure and holy
                            one, Gained is the pearly portal, Thine are the laurels won. Hearken, sweet angel voices
                            Float down from azure heights ; "Not d^ad, his soul rejoices In heaven's eternal light." Mt.

                            after the clearing up process had been accomplished, it had been sadly neglected. Weeds (bad
                            habits) had grown up where the owner had planted good seed, but had failed to keep the
                            garden clean of the weeds that were crowding out the good and useful plants. One day, as the
                            gardener was reposing overshadowed by the plaut of iudolence, he fell asleep, and in his
                            sleep an angel came to him and said, w'What hast thou doue to inherit eternal life?" The<pb n="273" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> gardener replied, ''The garden that whs given me was a
                            wilderness, and I have removed the dense growth thai nature enshrouded it with, and let in
                            the sunshine of Truth. But the angel replied. "What meatiest all these rank and poisonous
                            weeds here in the garden that was given thee to till and make clean for the Holy Spirit, so
                            that it could come and repose with thee? Sluggard, if thou would inherit eternal life shew
                            works meet for repentance." The angel then disappeared and lie awoke. Is it so, he said to
                            himself, that I am not yet accepted of the Father ; and looking up, the dark leaves of
                            indolence seemed to lull him to more ease, but he aroused and proceeded to destroy the
                            noxious plants that had prevented him from having a garden fit for the angels to dwell in.
                            But the task was a hard one and many times he almost gave up in despair ; but, though
                            unseen, the voice of the angel spake to him encouragingly, "he that overcometh shall inherit
                            all things." Encouraged he toiled through the heat of the day, and at morn and at eve until
                            he had eradicated indolence from his garden. Then the angel appeared to him and said: "Sou,
                            thou art now ready to begin thy life work ; make clean thy garden and the Father will give
                            thee thy reward. Adieu." The angel again disappeared. The gardener looking around, saw what
                            was to be done. There was envy and jealousy smothering the beautiful plant of brotherly
                            love. Revenge must be destroyed before forgiveness can shed its fragrant odor throughout the
                            garden, Avarice, and love for power and earthly gain must make room for humility. The
                            gardener saw that it would not be an easy task, but when about to faint and grow weary the
                            words of the angel would encourage him to toil on. Day by day the gardener worked with
                            energy of purpose, and the garden began to grow more beautiful, the task became less
                            burdensome for he took intense delight in the labor necessary for its improvement. But the
                            gardener was growing old, Time had repeatedly warned him by his tottering footsteps that he
                            must be diligent ere the return of the angel bearing the reward from the Father. Thus it
                            became a labor of love. Weary he again fell asleep, and the angel came to him and viewing
                            the garden, said, "Son, thou hast well done, thy garden is clean ; arise and receive thy
                            reward." The angel placed upon his head a crown of victory, and he heard the voices of the
                            redeemed singing a beautiful refrain. "My weary heart hath found a resting place, My feet no
                            longer need to roam, For in the blessedness of perfect love, I've a home, sweet home.

                                which have been rainy) for some two weeks and more. We are now engaged improving our
                                reservoir which is about one hundred and twenty feet above our buildings and gives us a
                                great deal of power; driving the machinery in the laundry, churn, iron mill for grinding
                                wheat and corn, the wood splitter and sewing machines. It supplies our barn, creamery,
                                cooling room and bath rooms with an abundance of water, and our ice houses with ice and
                                some to sell. Our improvement now, is in arranging it for raising fish, German Carps. A
                                curious improvement for vegetarians to be engaged in, and somewhat inconsistent; but no
                                more so than raising fowls and cattle for food; but we are so intimately connected to
                                the present omniverous generation that it will not do to jump out all at once, lest we
                                break our necks, and the good we would do be turned to evil. But, that most lovely of
                                all jewels will be worn yet by the spiritual people of God, and that in the near future.
                                We contemplate making another pond sonth of our reservoir for the better accommodation
                                of the fishes. Apple trees have about all been trimmed ; and as we think in the very
                                best time, just after the fruit has been gathered. I should like to see a village
                                improvement board started in our societies ; so as to cultivate in a practical way a
                                genuine public spirit. Have a union labor week, to improve and beautify the village; and
                                the roads and road sides. To cast up a highway and gather out the stones, so that family
                                could meet family without traipsing (as the Sisters call it) through the mud; or having
                                our sight hurt by noxious weeds and briers that ought to be dealt with as the tares of
                                old. Who is in favor of the village improvement boards? In kindest love D. Offord.

                                busily since last April in the making of shirts, but not like the poor, factory girls,
                                in their pent up rooms, deprived of pure, fresh air and the healthful sunlight, but in
                                our beautiful, well ventilated room, that is lighted by seven or eight large windows.
                                Here we cheerfully work, striving to do all we can for the interest of our home. Since
                                the above date we have made 11,172 shirts, and during the last four weeks we have made
                                1920. If you could see our machines run, you would not bu surprised at my statement.
                                Center Family. It is a rainy day and the atmosphere feel s like spring. I believe all
                                our crops are harvested, and preparations for winter well advanced. Looking out at one
                                window, I see our garden has been lately plowed. Looking out at others, I see apple
                                trees have recently been cut down and dug up, which have grown in their places from a
                                time antecedent to the memory of the oldest inhabitant, probably since 1780. We have not
                                more than half as many apples, I think, as we had last year� but enough to supply our
                                need comfortably. Pears have been plenty. Potatoes badly rotting. No one on the sick

Beloved Elder Henry ;�You kindly invited us to write you when we
                                closed our school. At the close of this session we provided no public entertainment,
                                believing the time spent in learning and rehearsing dialogues, recitations and
                                corresponding exercises might be more profitably employed. We think that once a year
                                quite often enough, and at the close of the first term is the pleasantest season in
                                which to entertain our friends. Those of the Brethren and Sisters who visited the school
                                during the last week, seemed pleased with the progress made by the pupils and their
                                remarks of commendation were very acceptable to both teacher and pupils. The S. S.

                                the exercises. Several of the pupils of the ''Bible Class" are very much interested in
                                searching for answers to the Scripture questions, and we think it an excellent exercise
                                for them. WiJl enclose a few of their thoughts about some of the verses of the Bible.

                                home, at North Union. On the journey I took under my charge, four horses and two
                                Holstein cattle. The journey occupied two nights and one day during which time I had no
                                opportunity of rest. A good night's rest, however, followed this hard labor and the

                            people much more than those by whom I am surrounded. You are more consistent in living up to
                            your profession. I was much interested in a paragraph contained in our ''Manifesto" of
                            August, entitled, "A Heresy Case." And I feel convinced in my own mind that some invisible
                            power has allowed that man to remain in the pulpit. For although he was tried and condemned
                            by his orthodox brethren, yet they suffered him to continue preaching, well knowing he will
                            continue to expound his own ideas.<pb n="277" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> Such a man will prove
                            a great power. For one holding such progressive sentiments and fearlessly preaching them
                            from an orthodox pulpit, will have an important weight in overthrowing false and erroneous
                            doctrines endorsed by the Church. Indeed many of the renowned preachers of our day are
                            leaning in the same direction ; the spirit world is helping them in their efforts, and as it
                            aids them, it assists you. The Shaker faith will triumph over all at last, and the glorious
                            time is not far distant. Allow me to send you a few verses which I think applies to Mother
                            Ann Lee. </p><div3 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Mother's old hymn" TEIform="index"/>MOTHER'S OLD HYMN </head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hough, Alfred J."

                                grand old hymn, Which another, whose lips are now still and cold, Sang 'mid&gt;t her
                                cares in the days of old. There was something about it, undefined, That charmed into
                                quiet the troubled mind, O'er the bleak heart breathed with a spirit bland, Like the
                                warm south wind o'er a frozen land. And crowning it all with a strange deep chord, Like
                                the throb of the heart of the blessed Lord, That shed through the fainting soul abroad,
                                A sense of the pitying love of God. The songs of the singers that fame has crowned. In
                                the flood of the years are lost and drowned, But mother's old hymn, every pause and
                                tone, With the growth of time has the sweeter grown. And it seems not out of the past to
                                come� An echo only of lips that are dumb� But down from the home of the glorified, It
                                has always come since the day she died. We know not the music which spirits hear As
                                earth is receding and Heaven draws near, But treading death's valley of shadows dim, I
                                ask but to hear my mother's hymn.</p></div3><p TEIform="p">Love to all my dear friends on the mountain.

                                expression in a very interesting and inspirational article, published in the Manifesto,
                                in the month of September. We find much satisfaction as we introduce the same
                                manifestation of spiritual interest to the many readers of our little messenger of "good
                                news," and with them, wish to extend its influence into every circle that may be formed
                                by the Believers. Through such breathings of lovingkindness, we find ourselves in
                                harmony with the spirit of good angels, and no less with the spirit of God. As simple as
                                it may be, it carries a potent influence to the heart of every honest worker in the
                                vineyard of God and makes of our Zion home, a center of interest and care, and a place
                                to which we may look with confidence and love. Through all the days of our pilgrimage
                                with those who have accepted the Cross of Christ, we should be actively at work for the
                                peace and prosperity of oar gospel relation. Engaged as they are in a mission of love
                                for humanity, in a calling of such vital interest for the promotion of practical
                                righteousness, our prayers for them should be unceasing. Less than this speedily induces
                                indifference, a morbid tendency to lukewarmness and ultimately to a state of inaction
                                and death. Mount Lebanon, during the ministration of Father Joseph Meacham and Mother
                                Lucy Wright, received the inspiration of the Parent Society, the head of the church, and
                                still occupies that sacred relation in all "the beauty of holiness." Through the
                                parental love which overshadows so many kindred communities, unbounded spiritual
                                blessings have been most liberally diffused. This has been through the ministration of
                                beautiful songs, through the exhortation of the word of God and through the willing
                                sacrifice of time and strength, day and night, and no less through the heat of summer
                                and the severity of winter. Our order has been liberally blessed with able ministers,
                                whose souls have been filled with an unflinching zeal for God and the good of humanity.
                                The first Elders have left a record for their children to emulate, over which we may
                                renew our promises of loyalty, and stimulate our zeal to do and dare in the<pb n="279" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> cause of righteousness and peace. They gave their lives to
                                God. To be able to do His will and establish, in the hearts of men, a growing interest
                                in chastity of the body and a Christ-like purity of spirit, was the life element that
                                gave them courage to work for God. In this consecrated spirit our Communities came into
                                existence, and so far as it has been made the stepping stone to more advanced truths,
                                they have enjoyed a wonderful prosperity for a long series of years, and shared in the
                                bountiful blessings of peace. In connection with this we love to include the inspired
                                words of the prophet, as he encouraged his people to remain faithful. "Behold, the
                                Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy, that it
                                cannot hear." The same consecration to-day, the same soul baptism in prayer, and the
                                same determined resolution to crucify the world will, without doubt, bring the same
                                corresponding results for God and for his people. While we with pleasure bear this
                                united testimony in remembrance, knowing that our reward of blessing comes in direct
                                ratio to the blessing that we extend to those around us, we will contend earnestly for
                                the faith, that we may rejoice in our salvation. When we say, God bless Mount Lebanon,
                                we are at the same time asking a blessing which will rest upon our several Communities
                                and make us all partakers in the one beautiful gift. It is, certainly, commendable that
                                we ask the protection of divine Providence on that which stands, so distinctly, before
                                and above us. It is the cementing bond of our gospel union, and that union which will
                                shield us from all harm in the day of adversity. Through this the whole household of
                                faith may be blest, and have the pleasant satisfaction of reaping a glorious reward
                                which the world can neither give nor take away. We also have the strength of God's
                                promise which he gave to those who should abide in his law. "No weapon that is formed
                                against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment,
                                thou shalt condemn, for this is the heritage of the servants of God, and their
                                righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. "</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">Articles published in the Manifesto must be referred to the authors for any

                                    tenets held by the several religious denominations of our land. We find the great
                                    stream of humanity emanating from the oame great Creator, governed by the same moral
                                    laws, looking back to the same examples and precedents, endowed with intellectual
                                    power by the same giver of all wisdom and knowledge, yet arriving at conclusions
                                    from their contemplation of these, which separate them so widely in some cases that
                                    the observer can scarcely trace the likeness which we naturally expect to find
                                    existing among the followers of one king, be he spiritual or temporal. There is not,
                                    perhaps, a reader of the Republican-Gazette, who has not heard of that queer sect of
                                    people, commonly known as the Shakers, but called by themselves Christian
                                    Communists. There is located in this county the largest existing community, and
                                    after a large number of visits to their village, and a somewhat close observation of
                                    their customs, the writer thought that a description dealing with their every-day
                                    life and occupation, as well as a general description of their creed, might not be
                                    without interest to your readers. They originated in England about the year 1770.
                                    They were at first an offshoot of the Friends, or Quakers ; but in their theological
                                    ideas, as well as in their practice of celibate life and in community of goods, they
                                    now differ entirely from the Friends. In 1747 some members of the Society of Friends
                                    near Manchester, Eugland, formed a distinct association, of which James and Jane
                                    Wardiey were the leaders. Of this society the parents of Ann Lee were members, and
                                    iu 1758 she became one of its adherents. For several years this little company were
                                    only remarkable for greater physical manifestations of their spiritual illumination
                                    and inspiration than most of the assemblies of Quakers, such as dancing, shouting,
                                    trembling, etc., from which their present name, Shakers. These manifestations
                                    excited the hostility of the populace, just as did the actions of early Methodists,
                                    only to a greater degree ; they were charged with violating the Sabbath, and many of
                                    the members fined and imprisoned. In 1770 Ann Lee professed to have received by
                                    special manifestation of divine light and inspiration, those revelations, in virtue
                                    of which her followers have ever since given her the name of Mother Ann, and have
                                    regarded her as a person inspired by the Christ of the female order, as Jesus was
                                    inspired by the Christ of the male order. Christ is applied by them as a generic
                                    term to the highest or innermost sphere, exterior to the deific sphere, called in
                                    the Scriptures eternity�"the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity." In 1774,
                                    under authority of a professed revelation to Mother Ann, ten of the more prominent
                                    members of the society, including Ann Lee, emigrated to America, and eight of them
                                    subsequently settled near Albany, N. Y., where they increased to quite a number. In
                                    1805 missionaries visited Ohio and Kentucky, and founded four societies in
                                    Ohio�Union Village, Watervliet,<pb n="281" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> White Water and
                                    North Union ; and two in Kentucky: Pleasant Hill and South Union ; a number of
                                    societies have since been organized in different States, some now being in a
                                    prosperous condition, others having gone down entirely and ceased operation. Now I
                                    wish more particularly to describe the community which it was my pleasure to visit.
                                    Union Village, Warren county, is located four miles east of Lebanon in one of the
                                    best farming regions of the State. The Shakers at this place own five thousand acres
                                    of slightly rolling land, any part of which would make "glad the heart" of a
                                    Pennsylvania hill-side farmer. Driving out the broad macadamized road from the
                                    beautiful town of Lebanon, the visitor first arrives at the office building, a good
                                    substantial wood structure of considerable size. Just beyond this on the same side
                                    of the road is the largest family building of the community, a building capable of
                                    accommodating near three hundred people. This house is divided through the middle by
                                    wide halls, and was erected for one family, the male members occupying one end of it
                                    and the females the other. The property is owned by the community, a certain portion
                                    being set apart for each family, the number of acres being in proportion to the size
                                    of the family. From this land, set apart for their use, each family must make enough
                                    to meet all their necessary expenses, laying by as a reserve fund all received above
                                    this. In this way they have grown very wealthy. Each family house, as the one spoken
                                    of above, contains a chapel for family worship and a council, and consulting room
                                    for the use of the elders, of whom there are four in each family, two men and two
                                    women. Besides these family elders they have a ministry composed of two brethren and
                                    two sisters, who have the oversight of from one to two societies. In this ministry
                                    is vested all power of admission aud dismissal of members. The temporalities of phi
                                    Ii family are cared for by two deaeoms-es. There are three classes of members : 1.
                                    The novitiates, who, receiving the doctrines of the Shakers, still prefer to reside
                                    with their families and manage their own temporal concerns for a time. 2. The juuior
                                    class, members of the community, but who have not relinquished their property to the
                                    society. 3. The senior class, who voluntarily aud deliberately consecrate themselves
                                    ,tnd ;ill their property to the society, never to be reclaimed by them or their
                                    legal heirs. All who retain their connection with the community are amply provided
                                    for in health, sickness and old age. Li Union Village, besides the agricultural
                                    industries which must necessarily follow the owning of so much landed property, we
                                    found an extensive broom manufactory, and a large medical laboratory, in which was
                                    prepared their remedies, which are quite extensively advertised throughout the
                                    United States. Perhaps the most interesting character in this village is Elder
                                    Charles Clapp, formerly a successful merchant of Akron, Ohio, in the early days of
                                    that city, who some forty years ago came here, leaving his home and his fortune to
                                    his family, to become a despised Shaker. Too much could not<pb n="282" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> be said in praise of this man's life. He is noted for kindness,
                                    and in fact all the virtues which go to make up the ideal Christian. In the fact
                                    that he visits his family (sons and daughters) quite frequently we have proof that
                                    conscientious motives led, and not family troubles drove, him from a happy home to
                                    this seemingly foolish life. Charles Clapp, and many others of this community, have
                                    attained very old age, he with a great many others being between 80 and 90, while
                                    quite a number have nearly reached the century mark. The village lias a school house
                                    in which the children they adopt are given good advantages for a common school
                                    education. Also a meeting house or hall. In the services there is usually an address
                                    by one of the Elders, after which they sing a hymn, then they form in a circle
                                    around a band of singers, to whose music they "go forth to the dance of them that
                                    made merry." The funerals, one of which I attended, are conducted in nearly the same
                                    manner, little reference being made to the dead ; all that is said pertaining to the
                                    living. The Shakers hold that the revelation of God is progressive ; that in the
                                    first or antediluvian period of human history, God was known only as a Great Spirit;
                                    that in the second, or Jewish period, he was revealed as the Jehovah, he, she, or
                                    dual being, male and female, the '"I am that I am ;" that Jesus, in the third cycle,
                                    made God known as Father ; and that in the last cycle, commencing with 1770, "God is
                                    revealed in the character of Mother, an eternal Mother, the bearing Spirit of all
                                    the creation of God." This is in substance the doctrine and mode of life of these
                                    almost unnatural beings as I found them. Yet notwithstanding all this, I think of
                                    the Shaker of this village it might be said: "No man ever entered his town hungry
                                    and he gave him no meat�naked and he clothed him not." Many poor, helpless women
                                    have entered the village with their famished and naked children, where they have
                                    been cherished, fed and clothed, and the children educated and raised. It is worthy
                                    of note that they are the only people on this continent, if not in the world, who
                                    have maintained successfully for a century a system of living, one of the
                                    fundamental principles of which is a community of property. In 1888 they had 18
                                    churches, 68 ministers and 2400 members throughout the United States. A. L. S.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Clarion republican-gazette" TEIform="index"/>Clarion Republican-

                                the best that the sun shines on. So unique, emphatic, and personal the Cape and its
                                towns have become to those reared here, that a Cape man ftnds nowhere else so glorious a
                                home, so full of such sweet memories. The Cape colors him all his life�the roots and
                                fibre of him. He may get beyond, but he never gets over the Cape. Make him a merchant at
                                Manilla or Calcutta, a whaler at the North Pole, a mate in Australian waters, a
                                tmllionnaire on Fifth Avenue, a farmer in Minnesota, and the Cape sticks to him still.

                                at the harbor's mouth, the spring of the boat over the bar when he came home from
                                fishing, with the wind rising on shore out of the gray night-clouds seaward, the blast
                                of the wet northeaster in the September morning when under the dripping branches he
                                picked up the windfall of golden and crimson apples ; and he will see, in dreams
                                perhaps, the trailing-arbutus among its gray mosses on the thin edge of a spring
                                snow-bank, the bubbling spring at the hill-foot near tide water, the fat, crimson roses

                                yellow dawn of an October morning across his misty moors, and the fog of the chill pond
                                among the pine trees, and above all the blue sea within its headlands, on which go the

                                Chestnut St., Philadelphia, Pa. The Journal for November is full of reliable information
                                for those who are musically inclined. In this number will be found a beautiful portrait
                                of the boy pianist, Otto Hegner, only eleven years old. The modern magazine may be taken
                                as embodying the best literature of the world, as the magazine editor pays the highest
                                prices to novelists, scientists, statesmen, soldiers, and even kings and princes, for
                                the best they can furnish in the literary line. The welledited magazine becomes an
                                educating influence in the family circle, whose importance cannot be over-estimated. The
                                children as they grow up, are attracted by its illustrations, and so come in time to
                                have a taste for reading. There is always something that is' new, something that is
                                strange, something that is interesting; and we consider that we are doing our readers a
                                positive benefit if we are instrumental in placing such a publication within their
                                reach. The proprietors believe that the Cosmopolitan has only to be examined to secure a
                                permanent subscriber. You obtain a magazine which gives you, in a year, nearly fourteen
                                hundred pages of reading matter by the ablest writers of the world, including six
                                hundred pages of illustrations that are unsurpassed in point of interest and execution.
                                Will it not pay you to send a subscription for the Cosmopolitan, immediately? Remember,
                                it is only $2.40.</p></div3><pb n="285" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/></div2>
