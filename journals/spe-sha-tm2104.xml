TEIform="persName"/> Martha J. Anderson.</byline><p TEIform="p">Our hearts abound with gratitude and praise this beautiful Sabbath ; as we walk abroad with
                            expanded vision we feel our spiritual senses quickened and our souls seem filled with the
                            rythmic harmony which pervades the Universe. The quiet, restful hue of nature's mantle,
                            formed of the blended shades of blue and yellow, signifying intellectuality and
                            spirituality, indicate harmony, and bring mind and soul in unison with the Great First
                            Cause. We exclaim, "Verily, the heavens declare his handiwork," and the earth emparadised in
                            glory speaks of his wondrous love ! What beauty we behold around us, from tiniest blade of
                            grass, to leafrobed monarchs of the forest; from lowliest flower that grows in woodland
                            shade, to pearl and ruby clusters which cradle summer's fruit. What precious symbols of
                            spiritual promise to the soul! Unfolding virtues cherish the germs of perpetual bliss. In
                            the rush of daily duties, and the all-absorbing burden of earthly cares, we pause not to
                            view the tender tracery veining every leaf and flower, or to admire the endless variety of
                            beautiful forms designed by the great Artist ; neither do we fully appreciate the rich
                            landscape pictures laid out on the broad canvas of nature, that are continually spread
                            before our eyes. A true conception of the sublime as revealed in terrestrial things helps to
                            develop the higher faculties of the soul, and brings us to a fuller consciousness that "In
                            man there is all there is in nature, he is the microcosm of the macrocosm, that is, the
                            universe in little. We all have our seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. All there
                            is in earth, sky, sea or water, there is in man." What grand possibilities yet to be
                            unfolded; what glorious states to reach, and what precious fruitage to perfect! [n this calm
                            and holy season, let us drink in the psychic life, pervading all things; the mysterious and
                            potent force which sustains the innermost soul; and while we are enjoying the present,
                            realizing the Divine Presence and blessing, let us not be unmindful that there are millions
                            of our fellow beings who have not a foot of land to dwell upon, and who can scarcely claim
                            any rights of mortal existence. Justice demands that all should have a home. Selfishness and
                            monopoly are the ghouls that prey upon society, aggrandizing the blessings God has given as
                            a free gift unto all His children. Let us help to roll forward the car of progress where
                            equity sits enthroned. Our work, our effort and our zeal must be concentrated in the home
                            that is based on righteous principles ; an asylum for the sin-sick and weary. Ours must be
                            "a city set on a hill which cannot be hid," and in the years to come, earnest, truth-loving
                            souls will flock to Mt. Zion, asking, "How hath this people prospered, ho.v have they
                            sustained an organization which is a glory and honor in the earth?" And the response will
                            be. ' 'By casting out self and sin ; by living in obedience to the laws of God on<pb n="72b" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> the higher plane." One whose chief desire was to reform the world, sadly
                            remarks, "As we turn heart-sick from one failure to another of experiments, social,
                            political, benevolent, religious, directed to getting crooked natures to live straight, and
                            observe that all fail through one cause, however variously it may work, namely the
                            selfishness of man, we ask is it possible to east out this self ? this unreasonable
                            tormentor of humanity that prevents us from living a truly human life�a life to which nature
                            points�as the only possible blessedness, in a world where everything is created for mutual
                            service and has its being only in giving? a world in which science in her latest revelation
                            of the correllation of forces seems to echo in another tongue the words, "He that loseth his
                            life shall save it unto life eternal." Let us pray in the interest of the great brotherhood
                            and sisterhood at large that the kingdom of righteousness and truth may come to all, that
                            self may be cast out, and the grand consummation of equity, equality, love and peace be
                            realized. Mount Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Review of a new book" TEIform="index"/> REVIEW OF A NEW BOOK.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="White, Anna" TEIform="persName"/> By Anna White.</byline><p TEIform="p"> "The Salem Seek" or "Reminiscences of Charles H. Foster," the widely known spiritual medium,
                            is a neatly bound volume of 156 pages. The frontispiece presents a fine likeness of the
                            medium in whose striking features strong clairvoyant powers are dearly discernible. Having
                            carefully perused its pages, we recommend it as interesting, and we believe reliable
                            testimony of spirit communications, giving most conclusive evidence that "if a man die" lie
                            shall "live again;" hence it is a work of especial value to investigators, or doubters of
                            the possibility of intelligent communication between the two worlds. Such an array of facts
                            we have never before seen presented in so small a space, or in a more agreeable manner. One
                            striking feature of this book which gives it marked identity among others treating of
                            similar topics, is the absence of that enthusiasm in its testimonials which we usually find
                            among believers in the psychic phenomena. It is largely composed of clippings from the
                            leading journals of the United States and Australia, mostly written by editors and other
                            prominent men, who were not only thorough skeptics, but who in many cases went to witness
                            the strange power accompanying the medium with a predetermination not to be convinced of
                            spirit agency. Some individuals held to this even when acknowledging that the terms "humbug,
                            trickster or juggler could express the opinions of only the most hopeless idiots;" while
                            "animal magnetism, mesmerism, mind reading" &amp;c, were equally helpless in explaining
                            the wonderful phenomena they could account for by no other agency, and which they had
                            witnessed under the strictest test conditions. On every page bare statements of facts are
                            made as viewed by non-believers, and the interested reader is left free to judge of the
                            causes of the strange occult power, and its marvelous manifestations. The author, George C.
                            Bartlett, visited our home at Mount Lebanon, Col. Co. N. Y., a short time since, and through
                            his interesting conversations and simple ingenuousness of manner, impressed us favorably as
                            to his high personal character. In friendly intercourse he mentioned that he was writing the
                            book, having been urged to the work by friends who knew that he had for years been
                            associated with this medium, and had been favored with greater opportunities than any one
                            else of witnessing his remarkable powers; and that he owed it as a duty to the public to
                            present a testimonial thereof. This, we believe, has been done with discretion and candor,
                            and with a disinterested desire to do good. Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Publishers, United States

Published in Albany, N. Y.., in 1808. No. 4. Of the first
                            appearances of the extraordinary ivork, in different parts of Kentucky, in 1800 and 1801.
                            The next general meeting was at Caneridge, seven miles from Paris. It began the 6th. of
                            August, and continued day and night about a week. The number of people collected on the
                            ground at any one time was supposed to be about twenty thousand; but it was thought a much
                            greater number were there in the course of the meeting. The encampment consisted of one
                            hundred and thirty-five wheel carriages and tents proportioned to the people. This immense
                            group included almost every character that could be named, but amidst them all, the subjects
                            of this new and strange operation, were distinguished by their flaming zeal for the
                            destruction of sin, and the deliverance of souls from its power. The various operations and
                            exercises on that occasion, were indescribable. The falling exercises were the most noted.
                            James Crawford, one of the oldest ministers in the state, and one of the foremost in the
                            work, informed me that he kept an account of the number that fell on the occasion, and
                            computed it to be about three thousand. The vast � numbers who received light on this
                            occasion, and went forth in every direction to spread it, render it impossible to pursue any
                            further the particular track of its progress. It was but a few weeks after this meeting,
                            that the same work broke out in North Carolina, by the instrumentality of some who went from
                            Caneridge to bear the testimony.* I will now take notice of the opposition which was raised
                            against the work in this first stage of it, and show some of the causes from which it
                            sprung. * One person in particular here alluded to, who went on this important mission, was
                            John Rankin, Minister of the Presbyterian church at Gasper, Logan County, Ky.; the first who
                            received the spirit of the revival in that place, and under whose ministry the extraordinary
                            work began. Since that time he has escaped from the old house of antichrist, divided against
                            itself, and with the major part of his Gasper congregation, embraced the Gospel of Christ's
                            Second Appealing.<pb n="74" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> The people among whom the revival began, were
                            generally Calvinists. Although they had been for a long time praying in words for the
                            outpouring of the spirit, and believed that God had "fore-ordained whatsoever came to pass
                            ;" yet, when it came to pass and their prayer was answered and the spirit began to flow like
                            many waters, from a cloud of witnesses, and souls were crying for mercy, and found hope and
                            comfort in the news of a Savior; they quarreled with the work, because the subjects of it
                            were not willing to adopt their creed. Those who had labored and travailed to gain some hope
                            of salvation, and had ventured their souls upon the covenant of promise, and felt the living
                            seal of eternal love ; could not, dare not preach that salvation was restricted to a certain
                            definite number; nor insinuate that any being which God had made, was, by the Creator, laid
                            under the dire necessity of being lost forever. The love of a Savior constrained them to
                            testify, that one had died for all. This truth, so essential to the first ray of hope in the
                            human breast, was like a dead fly in the ointment of the apothecary, to the Calvinist; hence
                            all this trembling, weeping and groaning under sin, rejoicing in the hope of deliverance and
                            turning from the former practice of it, sent forth a disagreeable savor. These exercises
                            would no doubt, have passed for a good work of God, had they appeared as seals to their
                            doctrine of election, imperfection and final perseverance. Everything appeared new, and
                            claimed no relation to the old bed of sand upon which they had been building; and rather
                            than quit the old foundation, they chose to reject, oppose and persecute the truth,
                            accompanied with all that evidence which many of them were obliged to acknowledge was
                            divine. Some who were inwardly opposed, at first exercised fo-rbearance, and professed a
                            measure of union with the work, in hopes that it would die away like former revivals, and
                            the people return into their old.order. As they pi received that it increased, they laid
                            aside the mask, and came out with a bold testimony against it, as a dangerous delusion. In
                            some of the churches there were days set apart for fasting and prayer, to deprecate the
                            divine displeasure, through which they supposed it was sent upon the land. These public
                            testimonies against the work, particularly by ministers, were a means of stirring up and
                            encouraging those who were openly wicked, to come forth to mock, oppose and persecute ; but
                            even such, were often unable to withstand the power, and sometimes in the very act of
                            persecuting and afflicting were struck down like men in battle. So alarming was the sight,
                            that others on foot or horseback, would try to make their escape and flee away like those
                            who are closely pursued by an. enemy in time of war, and be overtaken by the invisible
                            power, under which they would be struck down and constrained to cry out in anguish, and
                            confess their wickedness in persecuting the work of God, and warn others not to oppose it.
                            Many who were openly profane, were taken in the very act of persecuting the work, and
                                like<pb n="75" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> Saul of Tarsus, made the happy subjects and zealous promoters
                            of it; while bigotted professors, who had hissed them on, remained like the heath in the
                            desert, that seeth not when good cometh. Of the distinguishing doctrines and manner of
                            worship, among the first subjects of the revival. The first point of doctrine which
                            distinguished the subjects of the revival, was that which respected divine revelation. The
                            established opinion in the churches had been, that the Scriptures, explained according to
                            sound reason and philosophy, and this light was light sufficient to believe what we were
                            thus taught, wTas the highest evidence we could have of the truth of spiritual things. These
                            adopted a very different faith, and taught as an important truth, that the will of God was
                            made manifest to each individual who honestly sought after it, by an inward light which
                            shone into the heart, hence, they received the name of New-Lights. Those who were the
                            subjects of this inward light did not call it new light, but a renewed manifestation of that
                            which at sundry times and in divers manners had opened to those who were willmg and desirous
                            to know the truth for themselves. This inward light they denominated "the Lord," because by
                            it they were instructed, influenced and governed. They spake of seeking the Lord, finding
                            the Lord, loving the Lord, following the Lord, and offending the Lord; by all these
                            expressions was meant that inward light and revelation of the truth, by which they could see
                            things in their true colors, and find a measure of peace and consolation and a comfortable
                            hope of eternal life. This new light first broke out in the Presbyterian church, among those
                            who held the doctrines of Calvin, and therefore it is considered as more immediately
                            contrasted with that system. Those who first embraced it had also been reputed Calvinists,
                            and belonged to the Presbyterian church, among whom were several persons of distinction in
                            the ministry; of course, the existence of sentiments so very different in the same church,
                            rendered a division unavoidable. This division was gradual, and had its foundation in the
                            above principle of a direct manifestation of spiritual light from God to the soul, which was
                            superior to all the comments that natural men had ever made upon the Scriptures. This
                            division in sentiment, with its concomitant effects, drew together a vast multitude out of
                            different churches, who formed a general communion, and for a time, acceded to the doctrines
                            and manner of worship, first opened and practiced among the NewLights, a brief sketch of
                            which is as follows ;�All creeds, confessions, forms of worship and rules of government
                            invented by men, ought to be laid aside ; especially the distinguishing doctrines of Calvin.
                            That all who received the true light of the spirit in the inner man, and faithfully followed
                            it, would naturally see eye to eye and understand the things of the spirit alike, without
                            any written tenet or learned expositor. That all who received this true light, would plainly
                            see the purity of God, the depravity<pb n="76" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> of man, the necessity of a new
                            birth and a sinless life and conversation to evidence it. That God was no respecter of
                            persons, willeth the salvation of all souls, has opened a door of salvation through Christ,
                            for all, and will have all invited to enter. Such as refuse to come in, must blame
                            themselves for their own perdition. They allowed each one to worship God agreeably to his
                            own feelings, or whatever impression or consciousness of duty he was under, believing the
                            true wisdom Thich "lives through all life," to be a safer guide than human forms which can
                            only affect the outer man: hence, so wide a door was opened, and such a variety of exercises
                            were exhibited at their public meetings. All distinction of names wras laid aside, and it
                            was no matter what any one had been called before, if he stood in the present light, and
                            felt his heart glow with love to the souls of men: he was welcome to sing, pray, or call
                            sinners to repentance. Neither was there any distinction as to age, sex, color or anytking
                            of a temporary nature ; old and young, men and women, black and white, had equal privilege
                            to minister the light which they received in whatever way the spirit directed. It was
                            generally considered that such as professed to stand in the light and wrere not actively
                            engaged in some way, in time of public service were only dead weights upon the cause. No
                            one, except those who have been an eye witness, can possibly paint in their imagination the
                            striking solemnity of those occasions on which the thousands of Kentuckians were convened in
                            one vast assembly under the auspicious influence of the above faith. How striking to see
                            hundreds who never saw each other in the face before, moving uniformly into action without
                            any preconcerted plan, and each, without intruding upon another taking that part assigned
                            him by a conscious feeling, and in this manner dividing into bands over a large extent of
                            ground interspersed with tents and wagons. Some uniting their voices in the most melodious
                            songs ; others in solemn and affecting accents of prayer: some lamenting with tears their
                            lost situation or that of a wicked world ; others lying apparently in the cold embraces of
                            death: some instructing the ignorant, directing the doubtful and urging them in the day of
                            God's visitation to make sure work for eternity. Others, from some eminence, exhorting in
                            the gift of a free salvation and warning sinners to flee from the wrrath to come. The
                            surrounding forest was at the same time vocal with the cries of the distressed, sometimes to
                            the distance of half a mile in circumference. How; persons, so different in their education,
                            manners and natural dispositions, without any visible commander, could enter upon such a
                            scene and contiaue in it for days and nights in perfect harmony, has been one of the
                            greatest wonders that ever the world beheld ; and was no doubt included in the visions of
                            that man, who, falling into a trance with his eyes open, cried out, "How goodly are thy
                            tents, O Jacob ! and thy tabernacles, O Israel! as the valleys are they spread forth, as
                            gardens by the river's side;<pb n="77" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> �as the trees of lign-aloes, which the Lord
                            hath planted." The supernatural and extraordinary gifts of the spirit which were visible
                            among this people are not less worthy of notice than their distinguishing faith and manner
                            of worship; such as left no doubt of the restitution of that sacred panoply, which, together
                            with the apostolic faith, had been trodden under foot for many hundreds of years by the
                            power of antichrist. To evince this, as the faith of that people, at least, I insert a few
                            extracts from their writing's. David Purviance, in a letter dated Caneridge, March 1, 1802,
                            writes, "Some things have lately taken place among us, which I think more extraordinary than
                            any I have seen or that have been reported since the apostolic age. The case of Rachel
                            Martin, was truly miraculous. This case is illustrated by the following extract. 'Last
                            Saturday exceeded by far anything I ever saw before. Kachel Martin was struck the Thursday
                            night after you left this place : She never ate nor spoke for nine days and nights. I was
                            there when she rose and spoke; her countenance was as it were, refined [i.e. transfigured.]
                            She told me she was free from the world all that time.'

                            received too late for publication in that pamphlet. Ed.] South Union Ky., Feb. 10, 1891.
                            Dear Manifesto :�In common with the other branches of our Zion, we wish to tender our
                            tribute of affection and respect to the memory of our dear departed Elder Giles B. Avery. We
                            were greatly shocked when the sad intelligence reached us, it came so unexpectedly as we had
                            met him but a few months previous, and as far as we knew in usual health. We did not expect
                            that he would be called to a wider field of labor so soon, but we have no doubt that such is
                            the case and that it has only expanded his field of labor in the great work of redemption.
                            We mourn the loss of our departed Father in Israel; remembering his words of wisdom and
                            love, spoken to us while he was here. We feel his loss almost a personal bereavement, yet
                            our confidence is unshaken that if we will arise in the strength of our might, resolved to
                            inherit the promised land, we will not be forsaken, but will have the same power to guide
                            us, if we are true to the Older of God. This was the teaching Elder Giles labored to
                            disseminate, and we realized the -fact that his every effort was for the upbuilding of the
                            different Societies in things both spiritual and temporal. All Zion seemed to share an
                            interest in his labors and he knew no special locality, but was a laborer in God's vineyard
                            wherever it might be planted. His spiritual nature beamed forth in all his acts and words.
                            He wanted mankind saved from sin and degradation and elevated to a higher plane of purity
                            and spirituality. We trust that his memory will ever abide in our minds, and the love and
                            reverence we feel for him, remain with us, as an incentive to live as near to his example,
                            as our strength and talents may permit us. In viewing his life of usefulness and perfect
                            consecration to God, we can but exclaim in the language of the prophet in viewing the
                            primitive Israel, "Lord let me die the death of the righteous and may my last days be like
                            his." But we would not call him back to earth again if it were in our power, for he has
                            passed from death unto life, leaving a shining example of diligence and zeal in everything
                            that makes up the sum of a well-rounded Christian character. He strongly inculcated the
                            teaching Mother Ann gave to her followers when she was upon earth: "Put your hands at work,
                            and your heart toward God." His example leads us to a desire for spiritual food, that<pb n="79" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> we may live to the honor and glory of God. Farewell then loving
                            Father, may we meet you again.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Cowan, Jane" TEIform="persName"/> Jane Cowan.</byline></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Elder Henry;--In the Jan. number of the Christian Union..."

                            ponder this poem carefully, we shall find that Browning is again teaching us the necessity
                            of the communication of a new life to man before his own lower vitality can awake into that
                            power of which it is capable. In all the lower parts of his nature man fails ; he fails
                            physically, intellectually, and emotionally. Very soon his physical force wanes, his
                            intellectual vim weakens, his emotion cools. It seems as if the life in him is destined to
                            ebb away and leave him less and less than before. Wherefore this ? Because man can never
                            satisfy himself by mere strength, or mere wisdom or mere feeling. God intends him to find
                            this out. And then, in his extremity, God finds his opportunity. Saul fails through
                            self-will, doing as he likes instead of doing as God would have him. The end of it is black
                            and unrelieved melancholy. He wants to be free from divine restraint. God's preser.ee is
                            withdrawn and a starless night settles on his spirit. He wants freedom, not obedience. He
                            gets it, and when he has got it, he is in worse slavery than ever. The path of obedience
                            leads into sunshine. The path of freedom, shaking one's self clear of God, leads into
                            dungeon depths of despondency. A new and greater truth always brings the sunlight with it,
                            the selfwill in us sets itself up against the Divine will. The doubt, the fear, the unrest,
                            the despondency and melancholy of men now, as in Saul's time, have their root in want of
                            obedience to God. He gives us a place to fill; we may fill it regardful of self, and
                            regardless of him, or we may fill it as his servant. In the latter case, his spirit will be
                            with us enlightening and sustaining us ! In the former, mysteries will perplex us, doubts
                            will befog us. Regeneration, the birth from above of the soul, by the life of God entering
                            into it. This is the teaching of this great poet, and the teaching also of the Christ from
                            whose teachings he learned so much. And so we may say, as with the poet, 'All's love, but
                            all's law.' " Your gospel Sister.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Briggs, Carrie E." TEIform="persName"/> Carrie E.

                            period of travel. Some call it a period of trial, and we also admit, that it looks and feels
                            ver}7 much like that. When Zion prospers in numbers, in faith or in heavenly gifts, to a
                            true heir of life and salvation, the gospel of Christ then feels precious. In seasons of
                            severe trials, when friendship fails, when the love of many wax cold and indifferent, when
                            the faith of many seems on the decrease, these are the commotions which bring the gifted
                            cross-bearer, who gathers substance, life and faith, to the surface. When many who should be
                            supporters fall by the way, and the precious few pillars in Zion, groan and iigonize beneath
                            their burdens, these are the days of toil and meridian heat that bring out true,
                            strong-minded men and women of God, in plain day-light, before the children of Zion and the
                            host of heaven. In such days of adversity Such laboring spirits will show before all heaven,
                            their faith, hope and zeal for God, for when uncertainties thicken, they stand upon the
                            watch-tower ; when adversity heaves up like billows, to the true and strong the work of God
                            is more precious than at any other moment. Such souls will be willing to stand at any
                            position and cheerfully perform any labor and make any sacrifice to support the woik on
                            which the salvation of the yvorld depends. In these days of overturning and upheaving of
                            reforms and transforms that sweep onward like a mighty freshet, producing a commotion which
                            is felt even to the center of Zion, we are thankful to stand as tried supporters and
                            co-workers together with our gospel relation. In these periods of every kind of
                            communication, called gospel faith over the earth, we are thankful to be numbered as
                            supporters of that true saving faith once delivered to the saints. We believe in the
                            promises, that another manifestation will open upon Zion. When the spirit of Christ in a
                            greater fulness rolls in upon us the spirit of God will surely set fire to Zion, an,d in
                            that period, nothing will escape the burning but the true faith and what has honestly and
                            fpirit^i.lly grown out of it. We were promised again and again, by the inspired world that
                            when the Believers, our parents in God passed away, that just such a period would be upon
                            us. And the same promise repeatedly declared, that at the end of our days of humiliation,
                            Zion would arise, put on her garments of beauty and holiness and step in to the rescue, and
                            save many precious souls. All the true children of Mother Ann are experiencing one part of
                            these promises, patiently and severely. Zion is tried, afflicted and sifted, many think
                            quite sufficiently, to prove the prediction doubly true. It is stated, that Father Joseph
                            Meacham saw the seven travels of Zion, in a gift of revelation and a united prayer goes up,
                            that our Zion will not have much further to sojourn before she arrives a$ the end of the
                            first travel; and with strength, power and numbers begins<pb n="81" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> to enter the
                            second travel brighter and more glorious. In this cheering promise we confidently trust,
                            patiently laboring and waiting to receive the fulfillment. The apostle Peter when predicting
                            the day of the Lord, uses this remarkable language: "But the day of the Lord will come as a
                            thief in the night. The heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt
                            with fervent heat. The heavens being on fire shall be dissolved."�2 Pet. iii., 10-13. From
                            the days of Martin Luther, every step in the process of tearing down the old religions or
                            heavens has been started suddenly and as unexpectedly as the visit of a thief. Luther raised
                            the cry against popish indulgences, and God was in the voice. It was at the instant when
                            Antichrist was slumbering, and kingdoms were prepared to hear; and when that voice was
                            uttered, all the powers of earth and hell could not stop the word of this thief-like
                            messenger. Every remarkable overturn in the theological world, for the last two centuries,
                            has started in a subtle and sudden manner. Unexpected has, been every rent that has been
                            made in the temple of Anti-christ since, down to the days of the Lebanon revival, which
                            prepared Father Joseph Meacham and his associates. The New Lebanon revival was sudden and
                            powerful, and deep in its work of preparation. As its fires died down, when the subjects
                            were humbled and filled with painful anxiety to receive it, the testimony of Ann Lee that
                            had raised her above the earth, entered that body of revivalists as suddenly and
                            unexpectedly as a thief in the watches of midnight. So it was at the far West. The western
                            fires had died down; they had been prepared by manifestations from their best seers, to look
                            for Christ's messengers to meet them in the form of mediators. In that manner they received
                            Christ, and planted their branches of his kingdom. But the heavenly messengers suddenly
                            appeared in their midst, and the word of life reached them as suddenly and silently as a
                            robber seizes his plunder in the shades of darkness. Our own inspired work, so remarkable,
                            was ushered in with scarcely a prophet or seer to predict its coming. That mighty work
                            though in part rudimental, gave us warning of the present outside, developing, preparatory
                            work, and of the many scenes through which we are now passing. Though imperfect as a whole,
                            it was as perfect a work as we could bring out; and friendly, heavenly messengers sounded it
                            through our camps as a remarkable prophecy for the future. When spirit voices predicted the
                            outside work, few really believed it; but it opened in its season, and has almost spread
                            from the rising to the setting sun. The mediums who began the work were two young persons.
                            One of them we have seen, and with much feeling, heard her relate the singular opening
                            revelations then given. These infant mediums were directed to give a very striking test,
                            dated ahead, well calculated to excite mortality ; and when it was expected, it brought out
                                hundreds<pb n="82" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> of carriages, and thousands of observers, who spread the
                            news in every direction. This outside, rudimental work, as unreliable as it was, and as
                            crude as it may appear to us, has done more to create a terrific outcry against the old
                            heavens and false religion than any advent that ever preceded it, in this or any other age.
                            It has run silently to and fro in the earth, and beyond all doubt the fire of truth is in
                            it, for it has caused the theological fossils and old heavenly elements to begin to melt
                            before it with fervent heat, much like the declaration of the ancient prophet, "The
                            mountains would melt down at the presence of the Lord." So great has been the overturn, that
                            it has caused a trembling among every religious body in the land, not excepting the Shakers.
                            "Nevertheless, every true Believer of unshaken faith, according to his (Christ's) promise,
                            looks for an enlargement of the new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteousness."�2
                            Pet. iii., 13. Another opening at the end of days and times, has been confidently predicted.
                            Judging by the past, those declarations must be fulfilled. The next edition, we cannot
                            doubt, will be silent and in a manner unlooked-for. It will deeply concern Believers and the
                            more advanced minds not of- our Order, and a fire must certainly be kindled that will burn
                            up many things among us and them. Our faith is fixed and settled in the progress of God's
                            work. We cannot advance and enlarge as a body, without the power of God to chastise us and
                            humble us, and to enlarge and purify. Judging by that unerring rule of Jesus, the signs of
                            the times, the fire kindled in and out of Zion will burn brighter and grow hotter, till it
                            does the work more effectually in the next step of progress. Many thousands now see clearly
                            that subjects of the work in great numbers are gathering our ideas of God, Christ, heaven,
                            the judgment, resurrection life, Community and a probation hereafter. While this light is
                            silently stealing through the host like a thief in the night, Believers complain that there
                            is no conviction abroad. But common philosophy teaches ; when God pours out his spirit to
                            commence a deeper work in these enlightened minds, his spirit can kindle a fire in the
                            elements of truth which they are now gathering, that will start a spirit of conviction as
                            much hotter than in former days, as fire is hotter than the burning summer heat. Therefore,
                            our work is in the present, and our unshaken hope is in the future. We must perform our
                            daily toils, building when we can build, and blessing all that we can bless, believing that
                            all will work for the best, and that Zion's children will surely see beautiful days.

                            the Manifesto and derive benefit therefrom. There are many writers and contributors, who
                            have committed their missives to your little sheet, and we hope that<pb n="83" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>
                            the "bread they cast on the waters," may return to them with an increase of an hundred fold.
                            Much has been written of the "law of kindness," and it is an inexhaustible theme, like a
                            fountain, the more drawn from it, the more may be drawn from it. "Woman's Mission," has
                            attracted much attention from the Sisterhood, and we bid the writer "God speed." True
                            Politeness adds much to the charm of a home, among Believers, or elsewhere, and as it costs
                            so little, it should not be a scarce commodity, with us. How much more pleasant life would
                            be if in place of angry words we could give the "retort courteous." But alas for human
                            nature, the case at times seems almost hopeless. We were all grieved to hear of the demise
                            of our beloved Elder Giles. May his successor, Elder Joseph, be enabled to do much good and
                            bring many to know the truth, as proclaimed by the living witnesses of "The Second
                            Appearing." Truly, "the harvest is great and the laborers few;" yet we know the promise is
                            only to those who are faithful and endure to the end. We wish you success with our little

                            the beneficent grace and care of our great Creator. Not a single soul of this vast universe
                            could exist independent of the care of the all-wise Father. In the earth is found that which
                            is converted into food for the sustenance of the natural life. God in wisdom made the worhl
                            and the greatest and most wonderful of his works, is mankind. How curiously, how wonderfully
                            are we made ! We certainly were born to be happy, but alas! how often do we hear those
                            around us complaining how hard the way of life is. I am convinced by my experience in this
                            life, that life is just what we make it. We are apt to allow our lives to be influenced by
                            the failings and short-comings of others. The noble mind will soar above the petty trials
                            and temptations of every-day life, will seek to look beyond self. As the natural body is
                            supported by the food nature produces, so the spiritual part is fed from the fountains of
                            heaven, ministered to us in the blessed testimonies of our beloved gospel parents both in
                            and out of the body. For the growth of the soul it must constantly be fed or it becomes weak
                            and puny just as the body would without natural food for its support. The natural is a type
                            of the spiritual. It often seems easier to live a natural life ; a life of ease and

                                and re-read, and in serious meditation pondered this living experience of the good
                                prophet of Israel. It was no new discovery that had just awakened in his mind, and made
                                him the inspired messenger of so necessary a communication. The demand for this
                                persistent force was in the world on the day that man was able to accept an advanced
                                step in the truths of the natural or spiritual world. The early history of the human
                                race is one of rules and laws to establish in the mind the necessity of a personal
                                discipline for the peace and protection of Society. The prophet in his work of
                                reformation was doing only as his fathers had done before him, bat his work may have
                                moved so slowly toward the anticipated goal, while at times he suffered such
                                unlooked-for reverses, that in his earnestness and faithfulness to elevate the mind of
                                man, he at last came to this conclusion : If anything is to be accomplished for God or
                                humanity, it must be a work in which there is no faltering and no reserved or expressed
                                doubts. The apostle, wTas so assured on this point that he could not avoid warning his
                                Brethren of the unpleasant state. "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways."
                                Such a person has not as yet received these lessons of instruction which are sent from
                                God, into a pure and honest heart. As is the work of the teacher among his pupils, in
                                the rudiments of an education, so it must be with the work of a moral or spiritual
                                teacher while working for the advancement of his class. It is from day to day and from
                                year to year, "Line upon line and precept upon precept," until the process of remolding
                                the mind has become so perfected that it cannot fail to meet with a reciprocal response.
                                When a teacher is so fortunate as to observe the impress of "wisdom from above" stamped
                                upon the mind, and<pb n="85" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> a steadfastness in tlie way of welldoing
                                manifested through word and deed, then in all the "beauty of holiness" descends a crown
                                of hope, and for a season, witii an overflow of charity towaixl man, Iranian nature does
                                not seem to be so very bad. Ameliorating conditions have arisen and we resume our work
                                with renewed pleasure. We accept in all confidence the promised assurance and again
                                enter upon the work, which ( ame through the mission of Jesus,� "Peace on earth,
                                good-will to man." It is with this spirit of anticipated success that all our work for
                                God should be commenced, and then continued to the very end. To work under the shadow of
                                a doubt, or with seeming indifference, is like working in the dark. Some good may be
                                accomplished but the results will be far from satisfactory. God's prophets were untiring
                                in their efforts to establish the work of morality among the Jews, and to bring the mind
                                to the necessity of strict justice, in all their dealings among1 men, and their reward
                                came through the consciousness of having been faithful in their sacred mission. Every
                                teacher who has met with even an ordinary measure of success, has been obliged to adopt
                                the precise course that was laid out by the prophets, and with earnest persistence
                                present "line upon line, here a little and there a ltttle," till the whole work was
                                accomplished. The great Teacher who could lay down his life as an example for others to
                                lay down their lives for the good of mankind, has left this indelible impression, "Peace

                                brings us the work of loving hands, sacred to the memory of our worthy Elder Giles. His
                                Autobiography together with the touching mementos of his many friends. It was a
                                beautiful thought to thus coinbine the two. His early resolutions to devote himself to
                                the Shaker life, his entire consecration of time and talents to its cause are so well
                                authenticated by the "cloud of witnesses" at his departure, that the pamphlet seems like
                                a string of pearls well clasped. And since, "The lives of great men all remind us, We
                                can make our lives sublime." it is as you wrote us; this Memorial will be one of our
                                best missionaries. Happiness cannot be bought at halfprice, neither can the full
                                satisfaction of our life be reached without the entire de<pb n="86" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> nial of
                                self and selfish interests. But it needs the willing co-operation of every member in
                                Community to make it a success. Also a careful, prayful, watchful spirit that we may
                                have that "wisdom which is from above, first pure then peaceable." The living months
                                have come to us again, and impress us strongly to "look up through nature to nature's
                                God." As we cast our eyes over the landscape just now we see that the frosts of winter,
                                and the stormy blasts have destroyed the verdure of the past summer. The earth is sere
                                and brown. But what will the sunshine and showers do for it? O beautiful lesson to
                                learn! The life principle is hidden beneath and within this seeming ruin, and ere long
                                the perennials will bud and blossom the annuals will be replanted, and it will soon be
                                verdure and freshness everywhere. Can we not go and do likewise? Though the inevitable
                                vicissitudes of earth-life everywhere may destroy many cherished plans; though our
                                fondest hopes may fail ere fruition; yet the perennial principle of truth within us is
                                ever ready to blossom into life when awakened by the rays of the sun of righteousness;
                                while new resolves and works meet for our daily needs, must like the annuals be "resown
                                with worthier seed," and fitted to the toils of our day. We had an unexpected display of
                                lightning on the evening of Feb. 28; though at the time it was quite cold and snowy.
                                Winter lightning is said to show "that there is solid weather behind" and it proved true
                                this time, for the first week in March has the coldest record of our quite severe
                                winter. A. J. C. North. Family. Mar. 16, 1891. Beloved Elder Henry:�I received a nice
                                roll of music for which I return the hearty thanks of all the singers. The
                                autobiographies arrived to-day and they look very nice and give universal satisfaction.
                                I thought you might have such a flood of matter connected with the autobiographies, that
                                I would not add to the overflowing vessel. We have had some very cold weather and a
                                great deal of rain. The first week in March I gave our new boilers a thorough test as to
                                the economy compared with stoves. The coal was very carefully weighed and it took just
                                twenty pounds of coal for each joom per day. I took a great deal of pains that all
                                should be warm and all the complaint I heard was, too hot. Nothing special moving,
                                either in the physical or spiritual elements in these quarters. Our labors are mostly
                                directed to raising the money to pay the taxes and hired men. Fishes are not caught very
                                often in our waters that have the wherewith-all in their mouths to pay tribute to
                                Caesar. So we must toil on, pray on. In kindest love, D.

                                snow are plenty, but we are having a few warm days, and the snow and ice may disappear.
                                The South family have been putting in a hot water heater to warm their sewing room, and
                                it has proved to be a complete success. This is much better than a coal stove as it
                                warms the room more evenly. Believing that cleanliness comes next to godliness, they
                                have fitted up a new bath-room with all modern improvements. There seems to be some
                                rivalry, to see which family will have the best care and present the best appearance.
                                This is a move in the right direction. The Second family have made some improvements in
                                the cooking of food for the stock. They have introduced a boiler for heating the water
                                and also for steaming the food. They also have a silo, and of course the butter which
                                they make must be number one. The gardeners at the Church are sow86<pb n="87" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>

Deab Editor:�This morning the thermometer stands five deg. below zero,
                                with two feet of snow on the ground. What a contrast with several past years. Last year
                                we had what we called four days of good sleighing. This year over one hundred will tell
                                the story. Last year we made out to fill our ice house with ice five inches thick and
                                that of a poor quality. It is now full of ice twelve inches thick and of the very best
                                quality. Last year our Sister society at Shirley did not ha,ve the privilege of getting
                                any ice, and were obliged to sell their milk, but this year they have filled their house
                                with the very best of ice. The deep snow this morning has forced us to stop sawing our
                                wood, which we had thought to finish in some three days. Men and teams must go out on
                                the highways as the drifts have made the roads impassable. We are adding a few necessary
                                improvements to the comforts of life, as the purse may warrant. A radiator has been put
                                into the dining-room to use up a little more of the surplus steam. The Sisters have
                                concluded that it was more beneficial to health to have the floor of the ironing-room
                                made of wood instead of cement, and the apparatus for ironing has been removed to a room
                                above the basement. I think this is an item of importance that should be brought before
                                the people, more than it now is. If experience is worth more than theory, then I think
                                those who have had a thorough trial of cement floors, may have liberty to speak. It is
                                one of the most unwise things that can be done, to improve on the old style of laundry
                                labor, to have a cement floor through the hope of saving a little in the wear and tear

                                faithfully care for that part of our domestic life. The constant complaint of cold feet
                                is only the stepping<pb n="88" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> stone to something worse. If the feet are cold
                                we just raise the temperature of the room to *75 or 80 degrees, and this makes the heat
                                so oppressive to the head and lungs, that we are glad to open a door and get a breath of
                                fresh air. The result of this sudden change with the head so heated and the feet
                                uncomfortably cold, is often disasterous to the system. It is a decided mistake to make
                                a cement floor for a laundry with the idea of having less expense. The floor made of
                                wood may not be quite so durable, but in its use the injury to the health is decidedly
                                less. A.

                                pleasure in recommending the use of honey for the cure of weak lungs and sore throats;

                                just a bit tardy in reaching us; it must have been quite an addition in the printers'
                                department, but the genuine satisfaction enjoyed by many kindred souls in its perusal,
                                and the conviction it should carry to earth's seeking, sorrowing children, we hope may
                                bless and fully compensate your worthy efforts. May it not only serve to keep green his
                                memory, but also perpetuate in others, yet with us in body, his Christ-like spirit and
                                example. Do not think us "fault-finders," because we mention the late arrival of our
                                little messenger, not at all, it is like this: some of us have kindled our zeal anew, in
                                the line of Bible questions which it furnishes, so if we have only one Sabbath to
                                "Search the Scriptures," concordance etc., we might be a little late too, had we not
                                some ancient worthy to help untie the Gordian knot; at present writing, our zeal is very
                                commendable, and if it does not prove as our good Br. Chase Allard often said of our
                                zeal in worship, "like a shaving fire," it will be of real benefit. There is not very
                                much we can say this time, and it is little matter, the months recede so rapidly;
                                evidently we have not struck the exact key to produce a real "Home Note," but yet, if

                            have been an example to us for many years, and been anxious through faithfulness to have us

                                    course, can ever be regarded as an evil. Neither can it be destitute of advantages
                                    and enjoyments, if one lives in obedience to the laws of one's being. Cicero tells
                                    us in his discourse "De Senectute" written nearly a hundred years before Christ,
                                    that "only those who have no resources of happiness within themselves are uneasy in
                                    any stage of life, and that this is peculiarly the case with respect to old age."<pb n="90" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> It cannot be denied that it is commonly regarded a misfortune
                                    to grow old, nor is there any lack of reasons for this belief. Solomon calls old age
                                    "the evil days, when we shall say we have no pleasure in them." Milton sat in the
                                    sun, "old and, blind," afflicted and deserted, unloved and unlovely. Dr. Johnson
                                    declared that "old age had brought him naught but decrepitude." Carlyle's sad and
                                    stern life deepened into a cheerless, starless evening, and went out in a night of
                                    gloom. If we had no other examples of old age but such ate these, we might accept as
                                    true the poet's utterance, that "the good die first While they, whose hearts are dry
                                    as summer dust, Burn to the socket." But beautiful illustrations of contented and
                                    charming old age, abound in history, and glorify life to-day. Cicero said, "I have
                                    well-nigh finished the race, and perceive in myself with much satisfaction, a
                                    ripeness for death. I look on my departure not as being driven from the world, but
                                    as leaving an inn." Dr. Arnold says, "Old age is the holy place of life, the chapel
                                    of ease from weary labor." Another calls it, "The Sabbath of a life-time�the rest
                                    that precedes the rest that remains." Gladstone, Oliver Wendell Holmes and John G.
                                    Whittier are living illustrations of an old age which is a glorious consummation of
                                    a true, useful and unselfish life. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
                                    reap," and the old age of any person, man or woman, will be the result of the life
                                    he has lived. The whole record of our lives is laid up within us. What we are at
                                    fifty, sixty, and upward, is what we have been previous to fifty and sixty. If then
                                    we would have a happy and lovely old age, we must prepare for it, as whatever the
                                    old age may be, it is the certain result of a life-time. There must be a physical
                                    preparation for it, for good health is a great pre-requisite to happy and useful
                                    living. To drop into habits of eating and drinking, of dressing or living, that
                                    injure the body, and impair the health, is to sin against ourselves, and with those
                                    we are associated. For sick people form a part of the waste and burden of daily
                                    life, they hold down the brakes on the progress of friends and kindred, they add to
                                    the weight of the mill-stone hung about their neck. No virtue is more excellent in
                                    an old person than cheerfulness, and old age without it is "a Lapland winter without
                                    a sun." But it is a trait of character, requiring cultivation, for there is much in
                                    life that militates against it. Fretfulness and despondency are very common faults
                                    of persons who have got beyond their youth. "The world would be better and
                                    brighter," says Sir John Lubbock "if people were taught the duty of being happy, as
                                    well as the happiness of doing our duty. For to be happy ourselves is a most
                                    effectual contribution to the happiness of others." To have constant occupation to
                                    the end of life is a great help to cheerfulness, as well as a great blessing. "I
                                    have lived long enough" said Dr. Adam Clarke, "to learn that the secret of happiness
                                    is never to allow one's energies to stagnate." Bodily and mental decay are both
                                    retarded, even in old age, by the constant but not excessive exercise of our powers.
                                    Michael Angleo at the age of eighty-three wrote exquisite sonnets, and made
                                    drawings, plans, and models for use, in architecture and sculpture. Handel at
                                    seventyfive, produced oratorios and anthems. Hayden composed "The Creation" at
                                    sixty-five, and at seventy-seven, was moved to tears of joy, by its harmonies when
                                    he heard it performed at a concert. Linnaeus was still a devoted botanist at
                                    seventyseven, and exclaimed, "I am happier in my work than the King of Persia!"
                                    Humboldt kept young to ninety in scientific studies, and in publishing the results
                                    of his investigations. Mary Somerville, Caroline Herschel, and Maria Mitchel, ceased
                                    not from their labors though the dusty years lengthened behind them, and they halted
                                    only when the gate of death swung outward for their exit from life. But to wTork and
                                    to live only for one's self, will by no means promote one's happiness. On the
                                    contrary, it is a fruitful<pb n="91" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> source of intensest misery. The
                                    secret of many a joyless life, which has gone out in bitterness, suicide or
                                    insanity, may be found in the selfishness which dominated it from its beginning to
                                    its close. Only that work which is done wisely and lovingly for others is rewarded
                                    with perennial joy. For that is to live in love, which is to live in God. It is to
                                    work for God, since He has identified Himself with even the least of his children.
                                    And to live in love is to live in everlasting youth. Whoever shall enter into old
                                    age by this royal road, whether men or women, will find the last of life, the very
                                    best of life. The service they can render to the young, of both sexes, will be
                                    invaluable, and will be about the same in both cases. Having learned the lessons,
                                    and mastered the tasks assigned to this first school of the soul, while awaiting
                                    their promotion to nobler teachers and grander studies, they can help the beginners,
                                    who in the glamour of youth are overborne by unconquered passion and appetite. They
                                    can demonstrate that they do not lament the days that are gone, and the sensual
                                    pleasures that have departed, because better days and larger joys have succeeded
                                    them. And like the poet Whittier, they can reason from blessing's seen, of greater,
                                    out of sight, and so enkindle in the youthful soul, aspirations for a grander
                                    to-morrow than we have to-day, which it shall help to bring in. The young prize
                                    personal charms above their worth, and have not learned that the highest type of
                                    beauty comes from within, and is not dependent on fleeting youth. Those who have
                                    grown old in love with all God's children, and in loyalty to every duty, can teach
                                    them how a beautiful soul can glorify a face that age has faded and look out
                                    cheerily through eyes whose lustre it has dimmed. When the antecedent life has not
                                    been misused or wasted, there comes with increasing years, an abiding conviction
                                    that death is but a circumstance in a life that is unbroken, and that the soul
                                    survives the change unharmed. And as friends drop away, one by one, and cease from
                                    the earth, the certainty grows clearer that they have not ceased to live, and what
                                    is called death, is but transition. Can there be a nobler object-lesson to the young
                                    than the calm sereneness of the aged, who at the close of a good life, await their
                                    inevitable turn to pass out into "that other chamber of the King, larger than this
                                    and lovlier." Fortunate is the young man before whose instructed eyes stands so
                                    helpful and beautiful a presence! And happy is the maiden on Avhom descends the

                                    It is an old story, and, as it can possibly have no local application, this is a
                                    good time to retell it. It is told of the famous author of the famous tract entitled
                                    "Come to Jesus," who was something of a controversialist as well as eloquent pleader
                                    for souls. He was at one time engaged in a theological dispute with some reverend
                                    opponent, and grew more than usually heated during the controversy. At last he sat
                                    down and wrote an answer to some publication of his opponent's, an answer bristling
                                    with sarcasm and invective, an answer sharp and cutting as a razor, an answer he
                                    felt sure his opponent would wince under as if he had received a succession of
                                    rapier thrusts. Reading it to a friend before sending it for publication he asked:
                                    "What do you think of it?" "It is a masterpiece of invective," was the reply. "You

                                    thought of a title," answered the clergyman. "Can you suggest one?" "Well," came the
                                    response, slowly and thoughtfully, "how would it do to call it, 'Go to the Devil, by

                                    continually sounds in our ears, and never ceases. We cannot solve the mysteries of
                                    life, we cannot answer the questions that every day clamor for reply, but we can and
                                    we must "trust that somehow, good will be the final end of ill," and that trust is
                                    our only way out. Instead of bewailing the present, of anticipating trouble in the

                                    the duty of the present, and living one day, one moment, at a time. We may gather
                                    hope from past deliverances, and confidence from a firm and abiding faith in the

                                contradicts a statement made in Isaiah, fortieth chapter and fourth verse. "Every valley
                                shall be exalted, and every mountain and bill shall be made low; and the crooked shall
                                be made straight; and the rough places plain." Mount Lebanon returns this answer which is
                                found in Eccl. i., 15: "That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is
                                wanting cannot be numbered." This was the accepted answer of the whole class which
                                numbers more than thirty pupils. Canterbury returns the same answer from twelve pupils.
                                Enfield, N. H. returns the same from thirteen pupils. It is remarkable that all have
                                sent in the same answer. This decision is unanimous, and the Bible students are worthy
                                of many thanks. As the answer was the same as that received with the question, it need

                                be governed by force. A child should never be struck in anger. A box on the ear may
                                rupture the membrane that forms the drum, and cause permanent deafness. A hasty blow may
                                do mischief that years of repentance cannot undo. Punishment is for discipline, not for
                                revenge. It is to teach the child to avoid evil and to do right. It never should be a
                                vent for the angry passions of the mother. Love, patience and firmness are the
                                instruments she must use to mold her child's character. Punishment is a means to an end,
                                let her pray for grace to use it wisely.</p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Franklin's practicality" TEIform="index"/> FRANKLIN'S PRACTICALITY.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">In his new discovery, Franklin immediately saw the means for producing
                                        something "of use to mankind,'" which, as he had written to Collinson in April,
                                        1740, he was "chagrined a little'' that he had hitherto been unable to do. His
                                        speedy invention of the lightning-rod gave to the world the only apparatus
                                        directly applicable to the service of man that has ever yet been devised for
                                        utilizing or control ling any of the forms of electricity known to Franklin and
                                        his contemporaries. In this haste of the philosopher to make his j discovery
                                        serve a practical end, we recogI nize the man, Franklin,�the man who exhibited
                                        in so many ways the characteristics of a later time.�the nineteenth century
                                        American. Scientist and engineer, literary man and journalist, philosopher and
                                        man of affairs, Franklin was by nature what society and the growth of the great
                                        newspapers, and the stimulating rewards of the patent system make so many of his
                                        successors. Franklin's discussions of the single fluid theory of electricity and
                                        his whole writing upon the subject of his electrical labors show that he
                                        possessed in a, large degree the scientific mind. But he also had the inventive
                                        faculty and the will to exercise it. The natural union of these attributes is
                                        not so common as might seem to one of our generation. The modern way of life
                                        tempts every scientific searcher to turn his laboratory into a workshop, just as
                                        the allurements of journalism tempt the majority of the poets and historians
                                        away from their natural callings.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl">From "The Early History of Electricity in America," by George Herbert

THE   MANIFESTO.
The Book Trust Knocked Out,
A CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
Some six months ago we began the publication of our l-eprint of the famous Encyclopaedia Britannica in 25 Volumes, which
we issued at $1.50 per volume. The price
of the English edition always has been
and still is 88.00 per volume, and the
Scribner edition $5.00 per volume in the
cheapest binding.
That the public appreciate so great a
bargain is shown by the fact that over
half a million volumes of this reprint have
been sold in less than six months.
This elegant new edition we still offer
at the same price, $1.50 jw volume. This
is the greatest bargain ever known in books.
Better still, we will deliver the set complete on small easy payments, to suit the
convenience of customers.
Remember this is not an abridgement,
but the great Edinburgh ninth edition,
reproduced page for page, with important articles on American subjects rewritten to date by eminent American authors,
and new maps, later and better than in
any other edition.
Special Offer.�We claim that our reprint compares favorably with the high
priced editions in every respect, and in
respect to maps, and strength and beauty
of bindings is superior to them. In order
that this claim may be tested by a personal inspection we make the following proposition: We will furnish volume I. at
60 cts.�a fraction of actual cost�if sent
by express. Add 40 cts. postage if wanted
by mail. Amount paid for Volume I. will
be credited on price of set when ordered.
