                            Believers in 1816. Rewritten by Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> This was the commencement of that great work which they had been waiting to see and which
                            soon after filled the neighboring country with anxiety and alarm. Enquiries were made and
                            people began to visit the Church from different places, particularly from New Lebanon. When
                            they came to see Mother Ann and the Elders, they were filled with wonder and admiration at
                            the gifts and operations which they were under, and the clear and pointed plainness of the
                            testimony against all sin. The gifts of the holy spirit were evidently among the Believers,
                            and these they manifested in their daily lives and conversation. During the season of
                            religious devotion they were blessed with manifold gifts, each in its time and order. Some
                            were in the making of exhortations, or shaking, singing, prophesying, or speaking as the
                            spirit givefch utterance. The people asked Mother Ann and the Elders, why they maintained
                            such a singular faith and manner of living. The Elders replied, "We have been laboring for
                            years in the work of regeneration, and have actually risen with Christ and travel with him
                            in the resurrection." People.�"If you have attained to that of God, which we have not, we
                            should be glad to share with you, for Wa CONTENTS.<pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> want to find the best
                            way to be saved from that which is wrong. " Elders.�"If you are ever saved through Christ,
                            it must be by walking as he walked, and if you have committed sins, you must confess them to
                            those witnesses in whom Christ has taken up his abode." People.�"We have had the power of
                            God upon us and received light and conviction, and have felt great tribulation for our sins:
                            after which we have felt great love and releasement, and we think we were converted and born
                            oi God. Is not this the Christ?" Elders.�"The gifts and calling of God are given to souls in
                            nature's darkness, not because they have repented, but they are intended to lead souls to
                            repentance." People.�"What is repentance?" Elders.�"To cease committing sin is the only
                            repentance which God accepts, and this no one can do short of making an honest and faithful
                            confession of all the sins he has committed in his whole life, to the chosen witnesses of
                            God. " People.�"It is God, alone, that can forgive sins ; where then is the necessity of
                            confessing them to man?" Elders.�"God has established that order for all souls who have
                            committed sin, that they must confess their sins before his chosen witnesses, as will be
                            seen by the Mosaic law, and the case of Achan before Joshua. The baptism of John when the
                            people came and confessed their sins and shoAved their deeds. All souls that commit sin are
                            lost from God, and cannot know God. They that know God as he is, do not commit sin, for it
                            is eternal life to knoAv God, and Jesus Christ whom he has sent." " But those that commit
                            sin are bound in death, and are not able to come to God, without help. When they come to
                            Christ's witnesses and honestly confess their sins, they find a relation to those witnesses,
                            that gives them a relation to Christ and in this sense, these witnesses become mediators
                            between Christ and lost souls. " People.�" Are you perfect? Do you live without sin?"
                            Elders.�" The power of God revealed in this day, does enable souls to cease from sin, and
                            Ave have received that power ; we have actually left off the committing of sin, that we may
                            live in daily obedience to the will of God. " People.�" Solomon ivas called a wise man, and
                            he said, 'There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, aud sinneth not.'"
                            Elders.�"Solomon Avas under the law of sin, and it is evident that he committed sin. He did
                            not know Christ, for Christ had not then been revealed. Whatsoever the Law saith, it saith
                            to them that are under the law, but when Christ came, those that believed and obeyed him,
                            ceased from sin. Those that are in Christ are not under the law of sin, because they do not
                            commit sin ; therefore there is no laAv that can either justify or condemn them, but the law
                            of Christ. Christ has delivered them from the law of sin, and given them the law of
                            righteousness and made them able to Avalk in it. They that commit sin are always in danger
                            of the judgment of God." " If we should be overcome and commit sin, our case Avould be
                            deplorable, because we have tasted of the good word of God, and received of the powers ot"
                                S8<pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> the world to come : therefore if we should fall away it would be
                            impossible for us to be renewed again to repeutanee." First Interviews, of Different
                            Individuals with Mother Ann and the Elders. The extraordinary intelligence which was
                            circulated concerning this strange religion and the wonderful spirit that attended the
                            subjects of it, drew many disceruing and inquiring minds to search into the truth of these
                            things. Many inquiries were made, from time to time, by these individuals, during their
                            interviews with Mother Ann and the Elders. Joseph Meacham and Calvin Ilarlow were among the
                            first that visited the little Church for the purpose of becoming better informed in regard
                            to the religious belief of the order. After many extended conversations, as well as critical
                            inquiries on the several doctrinal points which made this people so marked in their lives,
                            and so different from the other Christian denominations, these two visitors became convinced
                            that the work was more in accordance with the gospel of Chri?t than any with which they had
                            formerly been acquainted. The Elders, very kindly, gave plain and quite satisfactory answers
                            to all the inquiries that were made. Among other subjects this was presented to Mother Ann,
                            by Joseph Meacham. "St. Paul says,"�'Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is
                            not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also
                            saith the law. And if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home, for it
                            is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.' "But you not only speak, but seem to be an
                            Elder in your church. How do you reconcile this with the Apostles doctrine ?" Mother Ann
                            replied, "The order of man in the natural creation is a figure of the order of God in the
                            spiritual creation. As the order of nature requires the co-operation of the man and the
                            woman, so when they stand in their proper place, the man is the first, and the woman the
                            second in the government of the family. He is the father and she is the mother, and all the
                            children must be subject to the parents. " "When the man has departed from the home, the
                            right of government belongs to the woman, so is the family of Christ." In this reply, Joseph
                            and Calvin saw clearly that the new creation could not be perfect, in its order, without a
                            father and a mother. As the natural cieation was the offspring of natural parents, so the
                            spiritual creation must be the offspring of spiritual parents. Joseph having received from
                            Mother Ann an established and well grounded faith, set out with his whole heart to obey the
                            testimony. After the decease of Mother Ann and the Elders he was chosen as the senior Elder
                            and soon after began the organization of the several churches or societies, that the people
                            might enjoy the privileges of a life in a community and be better able to live in harmony
                            with the gospel of our divine Teacher, Christ. Elder Joseph was unwearied and remarkably
                            faithful in all th.3 duties that fell to his charge, and left nothing unfinished that was
                            for the peace and prosperity of the sacred cause.

                            relative to the nature of the soul, and the reality of Spiritual things, are drifting into
                            Agnosticism� The doctrine that the existence of God can neither be asserted nor denied�also
                            of future existence of the human soul. In this inquiry we do not characterize religion as a
                            mere profession of some one of the three hundred Creeds of denominations calling themselves
                            Christian, but of such a faith in God, the Creator of the Universe in which we have our
                            being, and in those revelations of His laws of righteousness to man, as requires and prompts
                            the Believer to a cheerful and willing obedience to the same, as the only source of true
                            happiness to the human family; consequently -resulting in the Believer living a pure, true,
                            good life, as judged by comparison with the laws thus revealed from our Creator; thus
                            consecrating his services to do God's will, as the purchase of blessings to himself and
                            fellow man. But what is this Godly character we should take for a guide ? The Agnostic tells
                            us, that, " when we define this Theos- �God, we limit Him to the extent of our own
                            capacities and faculties. " But the Agnostic does not tell us how the capacities and
                            faculties of one individual or one class of individuals, tribe, or nation, as uncivilized,
                            civilized, enlightened and religious, come to possess almost infinitely higher capacities,
                            enabling them to elevate the character of their idea of God than those of other individuals,
                            tribes, or nations ; for he denies all knowledge of God by revelation! He says "All
                            knowledge and supposition of the Absolute are none other than the image of ourselves, and
                            our thoughts, projected and magnified in the dim twilight of the vast." How, then, are we to
                            account for the vast difference between the Fetich's idea of God�some immense object of
                            sense, as a great mountain, a mighty river, a tremendous rock, a wonderful tree, a terrible
                            animal and the true Christian's idea of God�a Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother. If no
                            revelation from God, how are we to account for the immense difference of the sense of right
                            and wrong, between the cannibal tribes, who, for untold ages have believed it right to kill
                            a man for the purpose of eating him, and those peoples who feel and believe it to be wrong
                            and wicked, to kill a man under any circumstances, and wrong to injure his person or
                            property ; or, needlessly to pain any living being ? Tracing human history backward, we
                            observe, that, through some source, and, by some means, superior ideas of the God character
                            have appeared, from one period to another, suddenly, or, as it were, spasmodically, and,
                            through some individual agency, and not as a gradual development of the whole people of a
                            tribe, nation, or community ; but, producing such tribal or national development. How are we
                            to account for this, except by the admission of an All wise, Superior Intelligence, whom we
                            may justly call God? And, by revelations from this God to such individuals as mediators
                            between God, and these mediators fellow men?<pb n="101" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> If no absolute and
                            Sovereign Power, as God, exists, no Intelligence higher than man, how are we to account for
                            the multitudinous superhuman manifestations of power operating upon certain portions of the
                            human race from time to time, in all ages of history, of which we have authentic and
                            reliable records ? True, there have been prodigies of human ability who have performed most
                            wonderful and astounding feats; but, coincident with these phases of human experience there
                            have been manifestations of some power entirely beyond the limits of the human capacity
                            manifested through human prodigies, and, in the entire absence of human agency! Evidences of
                            superhuman power, in all ages of human history are numberless. Whence their origin if there
                            be no God? 'Tis done! The evident manifestations of an Absolute Existence and power by whom
                            man has being, and, to him, as the Creature of this Absolute Power, is delegated a limited
                            portion of this power, are as numberless as the sands of the seashore ! It is man's portion,
                            being thereby taught, to listen, obey, and adore ! It is not necessary to abstract our
                            entire conceptions of God from nature's manifestations-, God's Works / in order to have. a
                            religious veneration for the Deity ; neither is it necessary to make a God of Jesus, as old
                            as his Father, and older than his Mother, in order to become-i a "religious"�A Christian !
                            There is all difference between theological Creedism, and true Christian Religion !
                            Infidelity�Disbelief in God, and rejection of religion, is the recoil of human reason
                            against mysterious, usphilosophical creed dogmatism ! It is by the heart, quite as much as
                            by the intellect that the soul is united to God and Heaven ! The Syllogisms in the arguments
                            of the Agnostics, by which they negative the conclusions of their own philosophy, result in
                            a contradiction of human experiences the revelations of the knowledge of which are as
                            absolute as the periodical incidents of day and night. It is not a difficult thing to frame
                            verbal theorems so contradictory, as, apparently, to astound philosophy itself; but, these
                            apparent aphorisms do not present acceptable apodixis .' What experience verifies we do not
                            care if verbal philosophy denies! In logic it can be proved that this side of the river is
                            the other side ; but, reason tells us it is still this side, just the same. There is an
                            intuitive sense in all human beings that inspires the idea of God. "All history tells of
                            man's effort to bring God near," thus Idolatry. And, "At last we see what human progress
                            means, it means throwing off the brute inheritance through ages of struggle. " And, however
                            God may be panoplied with attributes by the unenlightened ideas of humanity, yet, the
                            history of human developments declares revelations from God, though Agnostics, and
                            agnosticism maj not be able to acknowledge them! Ability, and the consequent accountsability
                            have been vouchsafed to mankind in different degrees, and, these have not been the
                            incidental characteristics of race, clime, or country, but, exotic productions, brought from
                            superior spheres. And, " The present uncertainty" manifest by Agnosticism "is not to
                            endure." There will be "some fresh word of power for each age. " Re-<pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>

                            soul of man loves its behests, and glorifies its possessors ! God be praised ! lleligion is
                            the vital fountain of virtue. It is the founder of civilization and refinement; it is the
                            institutor, the protector and defender of the natural rights of man. It is the
                            enfranchisement of will ; the liberator of conscience ; it is the arbiter between judgment
                            and mercy ; the discerner of merits and demerits, and the dispenser of forgiveness under the
                            Divine law of love. Without religion�genuine, that manifests love to God above by love to
                            man below, the human family slink back into chaotic darkness, instituting social conditions
                            where might is law, and right is unknown, where selfish desire and animal greed prompts the
                            courses of life, and demoralization and desolation devastate the plane of human existence,
                            where love is twined to lust, and the beastly nature of man knows no bounds but those of
                            superior brute force ; where the finer feelings of angelic love and tenderness are submerged
                            by lawless passions, and where the pleadings of the soul are silenced by the fulminating
                            impulses of the brutal nature of man. To abandon the religious element in man is to deny the
                            existence of God ; to reject all accountability in man to any authority ; to institute
                            unlimited war, bloodshed, contention and strife, to let loose the dogs of pandemonium.
                            Multitudinous are the charges of wickedness, injustice, contention and strife, murder and
                            desolation against religion, (so called,) but, this is not against true religion, but
                            servile creedism of human origin, and, as opposed to true religion, as fire to water ; this
                            has been the adoption of a child of hell into the family relation, as tutor and guide, to
                            blind the eyes of the worldly wise and eat up the peace of the enlisted soldier under the
                            banner of human creed these set wide the distance between the temples and altars of human
                            worshipers of differing professors and denominations, and build the walls of churches that
                            separate souls, who, otherwise led by true religion had mingled soul to soul in a heavenly
                            and angelic alliance. Buddha said "�The religious man only is good. And what is goodness?
                            First, and foremost, it is the agreement of the will with the conscience. A man who devotes
                            himself to religion, is like one who takes a lighted torch to a dark house; the darkness is
                            dissipated. " "In reflection, in life, in conversation, in study, I never forget the supreme
                            end, religion. " " Truth is to be sought with a mind purified from the passions of the body.
                            Having overcome evil things thou shalt experience the union of the immortal God, with the
                            mortal man.'' u Man is perfected by conversing with God, which he can only do when he
                            abstains from evil, and strives to imitate the Divine nature. Second, by doing good to
                            others. Third, by turning from the absorption of material things." "� True religion helps
                            persons who possess it to amputate from the body, in some degree disease ; from the soul
                            indifference to one's self and others good ; from the senses injurious pleasures and
                            luxuries ; from a household discord, and establishes peace, and union of the spirit. But,
                            the present era appears to be fraught with a restless effort to extri-<pb n="103" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/>10g cate the race of man from the obligations, restraints, sacrifices and blessings of
                            religion. An effort to disprove the existence of a God as man's Creator, and, as a
                            consequence, to deny the possibility of any knowledge of duty, or accountability by the
                            possession of ability or the dictum of revelation. This is not strange ; it is the
                            ligitimate fruit of false, and human theology, which reason, and revelation teach man to
                            reject. But, the theories of agnosticism would man an evolution from a protoplasm,� an
                            accident of nature, or matter, and matter an accident, or incident of the primamateria ;
                            and, so far as this philosophy reveals, the primamateria; an incident of something lighter,
                            and less luminous than moonshine ! But, a living soul cannot afford to do without God and
                            religion. True religion is redemption from barbarism ; it is the all powerful panoply of God
                            committed to man to resist the assaults of all those evil passions that are the resources
                            from whence all curses flow to man. It is the light that shines on the pathway of heaven ;
                            it is the price that purchases heaven's blessings, and the royal benediction, " For it is
                            your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom of Heaven." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            way was to be opened, in which " wayfaringmen, though fools, shall not err therein. " This
                            way is before us ; and to walk in it is simply to be faithful in all the demands,
                            concatenations and walks of life, so far as we have a revelation of the principles of truth
                            and right. As the evidence of a thing confirms its existence, so faith is established, the
                            soul is convicted and conscience demands respect thereto, followed by an obligatory
                            obedience to the knowledge of light received. In its embrace, not only our acts and words
                            are evolved, but our habits, our manners and very thoughts must be brought into subserviency
                            to principles that tolerate nothing other than angelic perfection. We are not justified in
                            human frailties, simply because we are human ; indeed we are to become as gods, indued with
                            a power akin to almighty, to be able to fulfill the destined mission of man. Man is subject
                            to many annoyances. He is not infrequently baffled in the execution of the best and wisest
                            of plans and prevented the performance of acts, on which hang the laws of health, the means
                            of the support of life, of prosperity financially, of measures for acquiring knowledge upon
                            subjects vital to manhood, to character and even the destiny of souls. And here comes in the
                            demands for the patience of saints. Under such circumstances, the right of self-defense, of
                            proper and legitimate dignity and securing religious liberty and Christian protection, would
                            present its claims as justice and as a binding force of moral duty, when to fulfill
                            Christian obligation, there existed but feeble power to maintain the Christ spirit. How true
                            the testimony,�"Strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and few there be
                            who find it!" With the knowledge of this fact, the professed Christian can but feel the
                            importance of steps the most careful and well directed, of action the most measured and
                            purpose the most fixed and resolute, lest in some unguarded hour, some moment of temptation
                            or trial, he makes a false move ; consequently his vision becomes obscure, and thus he loses
                            the path which leads to deliverance. We should comprehend that the grand object of the
                            creation of man is lost, unless eternal life, the acme of human labor, the end of human
                            existence is found ; and may it be remembered, this is never obtained, only as it is sought,
                            and which is sure to be acquired, if our physical, moral and spiritual obligations are
                            faithfully regarded. Hence a life in Christ generates godly fear, which is a restraint upon
                            every species of vice, an inhibition of any and every act of defilement, and every color and
                            shade of iniquity ; it is a protest to every habit, manner, word or act, that is
                            uncultivated or gross, and death to every phase of life of a sensual or worldly character.
                            Hence to every well developed and intelligent mind, it is self-evident our mission is
                            perfect obedience to known light, and true submission to every revelation of truth, to the
                            slaying and destruction of every idol and selfish passion of the heart. Enfield, N. H. </p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sow good works..." TEIform="index"/>Sow good works...

                            New Year." Another milestone in life's journey is reached. We start upon a new cycle of
                            time. Shall we not try to make some one's way smoother or birdens a little lighter, or life
                            brighter or braver? Sometimes cheering, encouraging words do more good than we have any idea
                            of; or the " word spoken in due season," leading to just the thoughts we need, but which had
                            not come to us unaided, and which lead us on to the true source of help. As the old year has
                            passed, I think over what it has been and what the coming one may be with many conflicting
                            emotions. It is so natural to long to know what our path willbe, and to reach out in vain
                            endeavor to grasp something of the future. But we can only leave it in God's hands, trusting
                            and praying Him to fit us for its duties, to guide us into straight paths, and to " work in
                            us the good pleasure of His will. " I look back into the year just passed, recalling its
                            various victories and failures, its joys and delights, and its disappointments, andsorrows ;
                            and I look forward resolving to do better and to be better in the year that is to come. My
                            heart is full of hope, and I have made many strong resolutions. Out of the fullness of my
                            loving thought of you and your gospel companions, and my good wishes for you all, I will
                            say, may all the blessings that you have desired for me, be blessed to your own hearts and
                            lives.

                                    ? Dwells God in temples such as that below, And is it there He doth his glory show ?
                                    That fane was reared by human toil and skill, Its decorations speak of human pride,
                                    Which seeks with outward show the mind to till And thus its own deformity to1 hide.
                                    Ou that gilt altar, beautiful, but cold, Appears no other sacrifice than gold. Is

                                    Appears within that consecrated place, Or in the labored manuscript is found. The
                                    burdened soul that seeks relief in prayer, Repeats in vain the forms of worship
                                    there;. But listen to the notes of sacred (?) song, That from behind a crimson

                                    plaintive cadence dies. The measured tones that through that temple ring Proclaim
                                    the praise of�those that play and sing! Behold upon that turret, lifted high, The
                                    cross of Jesus, glittering in the sun, To tell the world that once there came to die
                                    For man a poor, despised and lowly one! Contrast his life of poverty and woe With
                                    all the pomp that fills the house below! "Tis not by building fanes that reach to
                                    heaven, That man is saved and God is glorified, Nor can the sins of any be forgiven
                                    Till they have overcome their selfish pride; For what but pride would rear the cross
                                    in air Which on their shoulders men disdain to bear? " God dwelleth not in temples
                                    made with hands, " Nor takes delight in studied forms of prayer, But where the human
                                    soul with love expands, His spirit finds a ready temple there; And men should praise

                            his companions, in age, at a time, when considerable attention was being given to the study
                            of Letter writing; at the close of a school taught by Bro. Seth Wells, of Mt, Lebanon, N. Y.
                            We publish the article for its own merits, and for the pleasure it may confer upon many of
                            Bro. David's friends. Shaker Village, N. H. Mar. 1833. Beloved Companions ;- -Having been
                            called to associate with you in your literary productions for a few weeks past, and as the
                            time has nearly closed which has been allotted us for the present, to improve in penmanship
                            and in the writing of letters, you will naturally expect something from me on the eve of our
                            departure. Such a variety of sentiments and subjects, press upon my mind, that I hardly know
                            upon which theme to touch ; yet I cannot consistently refrain from saying a few words ou two
                            very serious and important matters ; although I do not aspire to an elaborate discussion or
                            rhetorical explanation of either ; but simply to express my own views. At the close of Br.
                            Seth's school here, he spared no pains to impress upon our minds and inculcate in our
                            hearts, the necessity of obedience to gospel principles. His remarks were such as should
                            excite our warmest admiration. To me they have afforded much consolation. If we receive
                            them, as we ought, and award them the attention they deserve, much good we shall derive
                            therefrom. There is another heavenly virtue, embodied in our sacred structure, to which I
                            would call your particular attention ; viz. Union. By this is our compact linked together ;
                            and the whole Church of Christ is based upon this foundation. Many, within my knowledge,
                            have undertaken to get along in their own way, to be out of union, considering the principle
                            of minor importance. I have always noticed the failure of such individ-.<pb n="107" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> uals to become true members of the Church of Christ. While those who have entered by the
                            straight gate, carefully yielding obedience and maintaining a*gospel union, have always
                            found blessing and prosperity. We ought, as a people to be united, to be peacemakers, to
                            cultivate union with each other in all things. Never let any hard feelings, or disunion
                            arise among ourselves, but be kind one to another; and above all should we yield obedience
                            to those placed as Elders and leaders in the Church of Christ. As young Brethren and Sisters
                            let us show them that courtesy, attention and respect, becoming our age, and their
                            situation. We are amenable to them ; and they are responsible agents in our behalf, and are
                            amenable to a power that is above us all. Union and harmony must prevail among all the
                            members of this consecrated compact, else it cannot exist. Are we aspiring for places of
                            care and responsibility ? Let us remember that we are first to become as clay in the hands
                            of the potter ; willing to be molded and fitted to any shape or pattern, which will render
                            the most acceptable service in the House of God. We must walk in the Way of God as our souls
                            have been blest to understand it. Let our enlightened consciences be our guide. Let us
                            consider how short and transient are the things of time compared to Eternity ; and what
                            shall we be advantaged though we may gain the whole world and lose our own souls ? None of
                            us regret the little progress which we have made heavenward ; but feel thankful for the
                            measure of justification which we realize. Let us press onward for the prize. We all know
                            where we can do the most good, and be the most serviceable and an honor to ourselves in the
                            gospel. 1 have been so situated in life as to be placed in contact with all classes of
                            people, and have had perhaps, severer trials of my faith than any of you. I have been
                            offered all the alluring pleasures and indulgencies that this world can give, if I would
                            retract my purpose and abandon my faith. Every temptation has been presented that could
                            impede my progress and overshadow my soul; but I have always been determined to be honest
                            and upright; and feel thankful that I have not been swayed nor enticed. All the flattering
                            prospects the world can present, are but temporary, and compared to the nobler purpose of
                            the selfdenying Christian, are but a phantom. Our gospel home affords us every blessing ;
                            not among the least of these is that of an approving conscience. We have had a peculiar
                            privilege, the past winter to gain information We have felt the union and approval of the
                            Ministry, Elders, and our older Brethren and Sisters. We have received at their hands ihe
                            most valuable instructions and wisest counsels. They have spared no pains to instill into
                            our minds and to implant in our souls the principles of the gospel. They now look to us, as
                            heirs apparent, to their inheritance ; and hope to feel a dependence on us that the gospel
                            transmitted to us may be handed down to our posterity, in its original purity. They feel
                            greatly interested in our prosperity and welfare. We see them dropping away, one by one,
                            like shocks of corn fully ripe. Ere long they will all be gone leaving us and our
                            successors, as stewards in the household of faith. On our faithfulness and obedience depend
                            our justification.<pb n="108" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>Are we prepared to take upon ourselves the important
                            trusts which ere long must be committed to the rising generation? Is our faith planted in
                            the right soil? Are we confident that the world can never overcome us? Shall it be said of
                            us that yet another class must come in and take our birthrights? Shall we not all unite and
                            be upright and faithful? Or shall one or two of us be left to bear the burdens alone? I
                            cannot believe this for within reach of my voice, are quite a number of young companions
                            endowed with faculties, which, if rightly improved will do honor to the gospel. My dear
                            companions, this is probably the last time, we shall convene together, at present, for
                            instruction. I therefore embrace the privilege to ask for your prayers in my behalf that I
                            may yet be saved. As we separate take with you my most fervent prayer for your welfare for I
                            sincerely desire your happiness and prosperity ; and trust that when the Summer is past and

                            interesting. " GrO mend your ways. " " Cease to do evil learn to do well." "Execute
                            righteous judgment between man and man." "The great need of the present religious situation

                            cannot be taken away. It did not originate in experience, but is founded on an awful and

                            practical propositions, so as to right wrongs and establish justice now. And bend themselves
                            to the tafek of uplifting the moral condition of humanity. " Please to accept our thanks for
                            these timely utterances. Without doubt the time is at hand to begin " to finish
                            trausgression, to naake an end of sin, and to bring an everlasting righteousness." The whole
                            scope of the Old Testament is to these ends. Indeed an analysis of that book, is "Do no harm
                            to yourself. Do no harm to others." In other words, personally, keep hygienic law. Socially,
                            keep moral law. If a man is intemperate he is also immoral. These laws are inseparable.
                            Practical goodness from divine motives, is religion, and rests on the observance of said
                            laws, as a house does on its foundations. Hence the necessity for the awful, and
                            transcendent sanction you have placed before us. These laws as formulated in the scriptures
                            are as applicable to-day as when first given. The sanitary and financial laws of that code
                            are now imperatively needed. It is a significant fact, that that measure of obedience to
                            hygienic law which your people have carried down with them through the ages, has given them
                            a superiority wherever they have sojourned. And has also enabled them more successfully to
                            resist disease, contagious and epidemic, than the so-called Christians. If the people of
                            your city would but imitate the orderly Jews who live among them, and abstain from the
                            products of the dairy when flesh meats are oti the<pb n="109" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> table, they would
                            have clearer heads, be better men and women, and also save themselves from much ill health,
                            and from nine tenths of the doctor's bills they now pay. The amount of food saved thereby,
                            wTould suffice to give a good dinner every day to every destitute person within the city's
                            limits. The non-observance of hygienic law by the populations called Christian, is evidence
                            that they are of heathen origin ; for "The diseases of Egypt cleave unto them " as do their
                            habits. Most certainly their "speculative religion" has not saved them from sin nor from
                            disease ; nor enabled them to bring in a present, much less an everlasting righteousness.
                            Most assuredly the religion " of the better day" will fulfill these requirements. On every
                            hand there are signs that the elements of a new era are at work. And your present word to
                            the public, may be considered inspired. "Ye are gods to whom the word of God came. " To do
                            good to others at the expense of self, is to be divine. This kind of divinity will be the
                            corner stone of the Temple of the future. Standing in that divinity�in the afflatus that
                            gave the law, and inspired the Prophets ; both can be fulfilled, but not otherwise. Man
                            being dual in his emotional life is capable of so standing, he can die to the lower and live
                            in his higher life. Even as the lower life in men and women, has brought forth the world as
                            it is, so also will the higher life when in operation, bring forth an order of social life
                            which can enter into, and abide within the Holy of HoJies. Live the higher life to-day, let
                            it be a fixed fact, and the Law and the Prophets are fulfilled. Should all who are thus
                            minded, unite their energies and their interests in uplifting humanity, most surely no good
                            thing will be with-held from them. Praying that your words may not return unto you void, I
                            have the happiness to be respectfully your friend, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Fraser, D." TEIform="persName"/>D.

                            and understood the nature of it, my mind was forcibly struck with doctrines which, though
                            new and strange, appeared so consistent with truth and reason, and so much in harmony with
                            the testimony of Jesus Christ and his apostles. Their testimony was, that Christ had come
                            'the second time, without sin unto salvation ; " that they had come as God's witnesses to
                            the people, and were sent to teach the way of salvation ; that all sin and every kind of
                            iniquity was condemned ; that they had obtained power over sin ; that the call of God to the
                            people was, to confess all their sins to God, in the presence of his witnesses, and to
                            forsake them forever. They also taught the necessity of confessing sin, and of hating and
                            crucifying the carnal nature of the flesh, as the only means by which souls could enter in
                            at the strait gate, and walk in the narrow way that leads to eternal life. All this appeared
                            reasonable and right to me : for I did not believe that any one could follow Christ in the
                            regeneration, while living in ?ny known sin. But my natural feelings, at that time, were
                            very far from yielding obedience to this work. I presume I never should have been one of
                            this despised and persecuted people,<pb n="110" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> called Shakers, if I could have
                            found any other way, short of this humiliating way of the cross, in which I could have felt
                            any real hope of acceptance with God. But I confess I could see no way of salvation, only in
                            obedience to the cross. Many of the people who lived near me had embraced this testimony,
                            and set out in this way, more than three years, before I confessed my sins. I frequently
                            attended their meetings, and their worship appeared very solemn a:id heavenly to me. I felt
                            more and more affected with my case : for I knew that I was a sinner, and expected, if I
                            should continue in my sins, that I must be lost from God. In the summer of 1783, Mother Ann
                            and the Elders tarried a short time at the house of Samuel Fitch, in Richmond, where I
                            attended their meetings. Elder James Whittaker spoke, and opened the gospel in such a
                            feeling and powerful manner, that it made the tears flow freely from my eyes. From this
                            time, I believed, without a doubt, that this was the only way of eternal life ; and I have
                            never had a doubt of it, from that day to this. But although I was fully convinced what my
                            duty was ; yet the cross was in the way. I saw evidently that life and death were set before
                            me, and that I must renounce all carnal pleasures, or lose my soul. When I came to weigh the
                            matter seriously, I could not consent to sacrifice my soul for the purpose of building up
                            the flesh. I therefore came to a full determination to confess my sins, and forsake them
                            forever. Accordingly, in August, 1788, I went to Daniel Goodrich, Sen. who was a leader
                            among the people, and confessed my sins before him. Soon after this, I went to see Mother
                            and the Elders, at Watervliet, and was received with great kindness and charity. After
                            tarrying several days, being convinced with what I had heard and seen, and feeling an
                            increase of the work of God in my own scul, I returned home in peace. I soon went a second
                            time, and had much opportunity with Mother and the Elders, which I esteemed as a great
                            privilege. In both of these visits, I was greatly satisfied with the godly example which was
                            manifested in all their words and works. Their feelings seemed wholly devoted to do the will
                            of God. I moved, to Watervliet late in the fall or beginning of winter, and lived there more
                            than three years. I was daily conversant with Mother and the Elders, and was there when
                            Elder William and Mother Ann deceased. Their testimony against all sin was piercing and
                            powerful, and they appeared to live fully up to their profession and testimony. They seemed
                            to spare no pains to make the Brethren and Sisters comfortable, both in things spiritual and
                            temporal ; and they were ever free and liberal in extending charity to the poor and needy.
                            Their meekness and humility was manifest in all their conversation and deportment. I have
                            often seen them weep, and thank God for the gospel, with the most heart-feeling sensibility.
                            I received from time to time, many precious spiritual gifts of God from them, and was made
                            joyful in God's house of prayer. All manner of evil was spoken against them, before ever I
                            set out to obey the gospel, by a persecuting generation, but I did not believe their evil
                            reports ; nor have I ever believed any of them since. Notwithstanding the base charges of
                            their slanderers to the contrary, I can The<pb n="111" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> testify that Mother and
                            the Elders were very temperate in eating and drinking. I can bear witness that Mother and
                            the Elders taught the only way of eternal life ; and that they faithfully walked in it
                            themselves. In obedience to their instructions, I have obtained power over all sin, in my
                            knowledge, and can see my way clear to the mansions of eternal rest; and I have no doubt
                            that I shall continue in this sin-killing work until I find complete victory over the least
                            and last remains of a carnal nature. Hancock, Mass. 1827.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Charity" TEIform="index"/>CHARITY

                                slaughtered lamb as an offering to his God, people have been "�getting religion."
                                Whatever else he might have done, that act was an evidence that he had Ci got religion."
                                Even at the present day religion is obtained, many times, by offerings no less earthly
                                than the one brought forward by the son of Adam. It is not uncommon to hear the subject
                                discussed with about the same interest as one would have in the ordinary affairs of
                                business, and taken up or deferred to suit the convenience of the times. Bible reading,
                                church going and hymn singing have been considered the most propitious avenues through
                                which to reach this peculiar qualification. A formal declaration of some creedal
                                ceremony or belief and the whole work is consummated and religion is obtained. Some
                                persons talk of "getting religion" as they do of buying and selling cattle. Its value
                                rises and falls, agreeably to the demand. One day in seven is set apart as being
                                essentially necessary for the religious development of the mind, and for the recitation
                                of long, formal prayers. Jt is the display of churchal attainments rather than an
                                incentive to the work of righteousness. The Rev. Samuel Jones, the southern evangelist,
                                does not hesitate to inform the people that some of the worst enemies of God's word are
                                tho?e who occupy the pulpit, and in that assertion, as broad and as uncalled for as it
                                may be, it has a marked agreement with one of the scathing rebukes made by Jesus. " Woe
                                unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom of heaven
                                against men. You neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to
                                go in." Matt. xxiii : 13. This style of religion may do for one class of people, but it
                                does not impress the mind with a very high, moral tone. Its tendency is strongly toward
                                the world, in which selfishness occupies a prominent place. It was not so with Jesus. He
                                was enthusiastic on the subject of the kingdom of God. To him this was the kingdom of
                                righteousness. A place where people did that which was right. He prayed that the kingdom
                                might be with his disciples, even within them. They had thought of it as a distant city
                                into which the Christian will march to the music of the harp, and to the waving of palm
                                branches. Jesus gave his disciples to understand that while they were moving toward the
                                kingdom of God that kingdom was coming toward them, and finally the two would be one,
                                and that union, was religion. A major general of the army may may, TERMS.<pb n="113" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> have religion even while ordering the destruction of life and property
                                anc while making thousands of his fellow men to endure a miserable existence. He is a
                                member of the church militant and its prayers and psalms have securec him a place in
                                that kingdom over which they may have a dominant right. But this would hardly stand by
                                the side of that doctrine which we have learned from the Teacher. What does he say ?
                                "Blessed are the pep.cemakers for they shall be called the children of God, " and by
                                this it would seem that the children of God or those who accepted the religion of Jesus
                                were to be known as peacemakers. All the acts of his life gave abundant evidence that
                                the establishment of this divine quality of the mind was an essential feature of his
                                sacred mission. With Jesus, the getting of religion was to get into a merciful frame of
                                mind. The selfish, dominant spirit that so thoroughly ruled in the hearts of the
                                children of this world, could not be permitted to enter within the boundaries of the
                                kingdom of God. Jesus was not only generous to an especial friend, but he gave his whole
                                life for the benefit and spiritual blessing of his fellow man, those who would be his
                                disciples must follow his example. In his discourse the Gentiles were brought forward as
                                the representatives of a selfish class who speculated and contended about their articles
                                of diet and no less about the wearing of their garments. Religion with them consisted
                                largely in the observance of some rules that had reference to food or clothing. The
                                religion of Jesus moved in another channel and observing the strong inclination that
                                occupied the minds of his disciples on the subject, he very wisely remarked, ''Be not
                                over anxious about what you shall eat, or what you shall drink or about the garments
                                that you shall wear. It is better to seek first the kingdom of God and his
                                righteousness." Learn to do right, agreeably to the best light that God gives and the
                                religion of Jesus, or the heavenly home will not be far from us. Jesus manifested very
                                little interest in the religious ceremonies of the Jewish Church. He could heal the sick
                                on the Sabbath or provide food for the sustenance of his disciples, and considered
                                himself as doing quite right, although the Pharisees strongly objected. With them,
                                Sunday was holy. Fires were not to be built, and of course no food could be cooked, and
                                if a person was so unfortunate as to be taken sic-k on the Sabba'h, the physician was
                                not to be called till the next day. Jesus made religion a practical righteousness. The
                                welfare of man stood first. If he was sick, he should be healed. If he was hungry, he
                                should provide food. If he was cold, he should build a fire. All this was a reasonable
                                service for the protection of the body, and the maintenance of health, that the owner
                                might be better able to govern the influences and passions of his own mind and then have
                                more of humanity with which to serve God.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary </head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How to disinfect clothing and sick rooms" TEIform="index"/> How to Disinfect Clothing and

                                        which shall be harmless has been sought for, but, as yet without avail. The

                            this he must be continually engaged, if he would be strengthened in the inner man, and make
                            real progress towards perfection. An humble knowledge of thyself therefore, is a more
                            certain way of leading thee to God, than the most profound investigations to science. Purity
                            of conscience, and holiness of life, must ever be preferred before it; but because men are
                            more solicitous to learn much, than to live well, they fall into error, and receive little

By what authority are believers in Christ's Second Appearing
                            required to live lives of virgin celibacy? We answer. By the highest authority known among
                            men! God has declared that he will have a pure people on the earth, whose hands are not
                            stained with blood ; whose lives are consecrated to God ; whose time and talents are devoted
                            to the upbuilding of his Zion on earth. He will have such a people in this day, or he will
                            have none at all. He will accept nothing short of this�sacrifice; because, "Now is come
                            salvation and strength, the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ, " and all
                            excuse on account of the weakness of the flesh is taken away from Believers in this day,
                            whose lives and character are clearly set forth in the apocalypse. " And I looked, and lo, a
                            Lamb stood on the Mount of Zion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his
                            Father's name written in their foreheads." Rev. xiv : 24. "These are they which follow the
                            Lamb whithersoever he goeth." These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits
                            unto God and the Lamb ; and in their mouth was found no guile; for they were without fault
                            before the throne of God." Rev. xiv; 1, 4, 5. " For the accuser of our brethren is cast
                            down, which accused them before our God day and night; and they overcamehim, (i.e. the
                            accuser,�a false lying spirit,) by the blood of the Lamb, and by the wrord of their
                            testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death. " Rev. xii; 10, 11. That
                            is,�their own carnal lives, which they freely lay down, for the sake of a higher and a
                            greater life. It is not enough for Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, to live the life
                            of Christ, which is the blood of the Lamb ; but they feel it their indispensable duty, on
                            all proper occasions, to add thereto, the word of their testimony, for they find in it, a
                            powerful auxiliary, in overcoming the world in themselves, and often times the power of God
                            goes with their testimony, and the whole assembly feel its power. " Stand ye fast 0 my soul!
                            Fight for the victory, Keep thy sword forever drawn, Against the old deceiver; Never flinch
                            at the cross, Yield to no temptation, Count all earthly things but dross, To gain complete
                            salvation." If the number named, an hundred forty and four thousand, being the first fruits
                            unto God and the Lamb, what must the number be in the general harvest of souls, at the end
                            of a thousand years, �f Christ's reign upon earth?� We apprehend there is more danger of the
                            world coming to an end, in consequence of its inhabitants living in constant and perpetual
                            violation of the laws of reproduction of the human race, than we have of their following the
                            example of Christ in living lives of virgin celibacy. As free agents we can choose which
                            ever we will, and then abide by the choice we have made. It is asserted on good authority
                            that the earth is under a curse from one end to the other ; if this be so, I can see noway
                            it can be redeemed from that curse, only in obeying the gospel of Christ's Second Appearing.
                            " Now is come salvation and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his
                            Christ." Rev. xii: 10.

                                        beware of stagnant doctrines and dead theologies. Prophetic were the words of
                                        John Eobinson to the Pilgrim Fathers : ' I am persuaded of the Lord that he hath
                                        more truth to break out of Ins Scriptures. ' Theology must learn to change her
                                        line voluntarily and by her insight, and not be forced to do so only when the
                                        strangling grasp of science or criticism is at her throat. And above all,
                                        America must show to the world the true ideal of national righteousness. You
                                        are, or soon will be, the greatest in strength, the most affluent in wealth, of
                                        all the nations of the world. Why? Mainly, I believe, because your fathers
                                        feared God. God has said, ' Him that honors me I will honor.' Will America dare
                                        to spurn the low degrees by which she did ascend? I believe she will be
                                        preserved from these perils by the memories of the dead and by the virtues of
                                        the living. I believe she will justify to humanity her majestic faith in man. I
                                        believe it is for these objects that God has given her the atmosphere and

                            beautiful sayings of our Savior, was evidently not intended for the mass of mankind, but for
                            those who would be the disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ; to the children of the
                            resurrection, and to those having an aspiration above the plane of nature. " The children of
                            this world marry and are given in marriage. " 1 his class who have accepted no higher
                            mission should devote themselves faithfully for the best good of their families, and are in
                            no wise justified in shirking this responsibility under any condition whatever. Those who
                            would follow Christ in the regeneration upon whom the end of the world must come, if they
                            can comprehend his mission to become the Savior of souls, they are then under the obligation
                            and requirement to forsake all lie did. No man can be divided in his affections and effect
                            any good purpose. Whatever a man loves best, for that object will he give his first and best
                            thought, and other interests will be secondary. Love is the motive power of the Christian,
                            which wills all his undertakings. The truest test of love for any person is a willingness to
                            serve and please him. "If ye love me ye will keep my commandments. " We would not suppose
                            that our Savior demanded any special consideration for himself; it would not compare with
                            his character of self-forwetfulness. The pure, sinless testimony of full separation from the
                            world is what he lived and preached. This was his life. Some months ago we had the pleasure
                            of meeting a man the father of two lovely daughters. We thought he was fully ripe for the "
                            harvest work" as he seemed to comprehend the life of Christ in its entire separation from
                            the world. Yet when the test came, Can you live it? we grieve to say he was unwilling to
                            make the sacrifice, Why? Because his darling daughters were his idols and more to him than
                            all the world beside, yea, more than his or their salvation. Now, this man must have been a
                            good father and his example worthy of emulation for those who have a home on the " earth
                            plane ;" but those called to live a spiritual life which is the Christ life, find these
                            earthly ties impede their march heavenward, inasmuch as they absorb the love and affection
                            which should be given to God. " Strait is the gate and narrow the way which leadeth unto

                            Society of Shakers, in Mount Lebanon, Columbia County, New York, U. S. A. And, also, that of
                            Public Preacher; my name has been widely circulated. Many times, to my great annoyance, I am
                            spoken of as the " head or Leader " of the whole Shaker Order, which is composed of
                            seventeen societies. Probably, one reason for this undesired personal prominence has been
                            the fact, that I have written for over fifty newspapers and mpgazines ; and that many times
                            the articles have been extensively copied by other publications ; also, I am the author of
                            several books and pamphlets and tracts; &amp;c. The result is, as above stated, that I
                            am frequently referred to as being the Leader of the American Shakers ; when in reality, I
                            am only one among many leaders, some of whom are my Official superiors. Hereafter, if public
                            writers will please bear this in mind, and think and speak of me accordingly, it will save
                            me from many an unpleasant sensation and I shall be thereby much obliged. Doctrinal Matters.
                            Again, a book has been published called " Shaker Theology; " and, at Canterbury, Shaker
                            Village, N. H. a paper is published entitled " The Manifesto." If in any of my
                            communications to the public I have, or may hereafter, express doctrinal views differing
                            from, or at variance with the present theology of the above named publications; I desire the
                            readers to consider them as either heretical, or as expressing the increasing light of the
                            Church; just as they feel impressed. In either case, I wish it distinctly understood that
                            the responsibility rests entirely upon the writer, whom the press have so often favorably
                            noticed, and uniformly so kindly entreated. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                    Messrs. Lord & Thomas, ot Chicago, the well-known and popular Advertising Agents are about
                    to move into new quarters, which are so spacious, so elegant, and so original and novel in their
                    appointments, that they deserve more than a passing notice. The building. Nos. 45, 47 and 49
                    Randolph St., between State and Wrabash Avc is at once the most striking in appearance and the most
                    elegant, in Chicago; built of sandstone. it is 70 by 174 feet, practically fire proof, and lighted
                    on four sides. Three large elevators and two spacious stairways, give abundant facilities for
                    passengers and freight. Messrs. Lord & Thomas will occupy the entire third floor, giving
                    them a superficial area of nearly 12,000 square feet. This beautifully lighted room is unbroken by
                    partitions, save a private office in one corner, thus bringing the entire working force of about
                    sixty clerks into one spacious room, certainly the largest office of any advertising agency in the
                    country, if not the largest business office of .any kind on the continent. The various departments
                    are so arranged that the work passes along with almost mechanical regularity. While the entire
                    appointments are elegant, the filing department is arranged on an entirely new principle, which
                    amounts to an important invention. Heretofore Advertising Agents have filed their Newspapers in
                    wood,en pigeon holes, which not only excluded the light, but caught and retained the dust, and thus
                    proved a nuisance. The new filing department of Messrs. Lord & Thomas is made entirely of
                    wire work; a separate compartment is made for each Newspaper, Magazine and Periodical in the U. S.
                    and Canada, about 14,000 in all. The various sections are suspended from the ceiling, and hang clear
                    of the floor, leaving a space under each one so that the entire floor can be swept. Space will not
                    permit us to describe this important improvement in detail. The principles upon which it is
                    constructed will be covered by letters patent. The National Wire and Iron Co., of Detroit, Michigan,
                    have been awarded the contract of the work, and are rapidly pushing it forward to completion. Our
                    friends who wish to see a copy of our paper when in Chicago, can always find it on file at the
                    Agency of Messrs. Lord & Thomas. Miss Frances E. Willard has selected some Gospel and
                    Temperance songs, familiar tunes, 200 copies of which will be sent to any church or Sunday school.
                    Address the Publisher, Mrs. Laura G. Fixen, Albert Lea. Minn., enclosing 20 cents for postage. LEY'S

                    fireside Friend Publishing Co, of Xew Carlisle, O. certainly deserves the praise of every Sunday
                    School worker. They have just completed a lurge edition of their new Sunday School Song ijook,
                    Sabbath Bells, published both in round note* and character, these books they are distributing
                    largely to the poor Sunday School Children of America, free of charge. Any Minister, Superintendent
                    or Sunday School worker who will state about how many pupils they have in their school, also the
                    number of poor, and enclosing ten cents in silver will receive a handsome copy of the book with full
                    particulars regradmg their free distribution. This is a rare opportunity, do not delay writing to
                    them at once. A UNIQUE CYCLOPEDIA. An extreme!)7 valuable Cyclopedii, and of very great popular
                    interest is Alden's (Cyclopedia of Universal Literature, Volume II. ot which is just published.
                    Xovel in plan, and novel in form, at once beautiful and convenient, and at a price low even compared
                    with Mr. Alden's always low prices this volume gives in its nearly 500 pages biographical sketches
                    of one hundred and eleven prominent authors, with characteristic selections from their writings. The
                    following authors, among others, appear in this volume : Audubon, St.. Augustine, D'Auvergne, Bacon,
                    Balzac, Bancroft, Banim, Bar-* bauld, Beaumont, Beecher (several of the name,) Bentham, Bion,
                    Bjornson, Black (William,) Blackstone, Blessington (Countess of.) and Boccaccio; thus representing
                    nearly all ages and all nations even in this volume�American, English, French, German, Italian,
                    Greek, Latin, Swedish, Portugese, Scotch, Dutch, Irish, Norwegian, and Danish authors�from the
                    period 280 B.C. to a.d. 1886. The literary and mechanical workmanship are both of a high order. The
                    work is really one that ought to find a place in every home library; it offers a fund of
                    entertainment and instruction that will prove well nigh inexhaustible. The price, only 60 cents a
                    volume, makes its possession possible even to nearly every school-boy. The work is published also in
                    Parts of 160 pages each (exchangeable at any time for bound volumes,) which are sent post-paid for
                    15 cents each, Every reader of this notice ought to get at least a specimen Part for examination.
