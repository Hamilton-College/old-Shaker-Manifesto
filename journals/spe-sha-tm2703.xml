Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> A SOCIETY or Community of Shakers, is a religious body for the promotion of the spiritual
                            interests of the Brethren and Sisters. Its government is through rules and regulations that
                            are consistent with reason, with the free agency of man and with the gospel of Jesus, the
                            Christ. For its foundation, it has the principles of godliness. This includes a separation
                            from the spirit of the world, and the dedication of the body and soul to God. Jesus has
                            said, "Ye are not of the world, even as I am not of the world." "My kingdom is not of this
                            world." It presents the spirit of peace and teaches us that Christians can not fight with
                            carnal weapons, in the destruction of human life. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
                            shall be called the children of God." Human governments are the governments of this world,
                            in which we find all the elements of selfishness as well as of strife and contention, and we
                            have learned that these can not operate in harmony with the pure spirit of Christ. "Blessed
                            are the pure in heart, for they shall see God," hence, the great care which should be
                            exercised in keeping honest and unspotted from the world. Through this, the whole man is
                            brought under a discipline which shall have regard to the words he speaks, to the daily
                            actions of life, and even to the very thoughts. <pb n="34" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> "We are not called,"
                            says the apostle, "unto uncleanm'ss, but unto holiness, without which no man can see the
                            Lord." As the mission of the Christ spirit is for the cleansing and salvation of the soul,
                            we learn from the Scriptures and from experience, that an honest confession of all sin to
                            God, in the presence of his witnesses, is a saving grace. "He that covereth his sins shall
                            not prosper," is quite universally understood, as well as by the word of the good apostle,
                            "11 we confe&amp;s our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
                            cleanse us from all unrighteousness." To be wholly cleansed from ail unrighteousness, should
                            be the earnest prayer of the soul, as by this work of purification, we are made heirs of the
                            promist inheritance. With this dedication, we accept the order which Jesus introduced among
                            his disciples, and which was more freely and fully carried into practical operation by his
                            faithful followers, at the time of the pentecostal feast. Jesus and the twelve disciples,
                            were the first persons that ever formed a spiritual order, which was actualized in their
                            lives, as the principle of United Inheritance, or in other words, a Community of consecrated
                            Interest. "Go sell all thou hast, give it to the poor, then come and follow me," was the
                            spirit of the first church. As an encouragement to those who would forsake all that belongs
                            to a private, selfish interest for the kingdom of heaven's sake, Jesus promist an abundance
                            in this world, and in the world to come, Eternal Life. By these promises and through this
                            hope, we are enabled to consecrate our lives to the religious and social interests of the
                            Community.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="General rules" TEIform="index"/> GENERAL RULES.</head><p TEIform="p"> 1. A person uniting with a Community of Believers, must act freely and voluntarily. It
                            requires but a moment's reflection to impress this fact upon the mind of the reader.
                            Whatever is done, must be with a free-will for the benefit of the Society, and for the
                            mutual protection of each other. We could not wish any one to enter into the relation of our
                            Order, unless he considered it a privilege to accept the system of government which has been
                            establisht for the peace and prosperity of the members. 2. An explicit statement of the
                            faith and principles will be made to the enquirer, as we prefer to have all persons receive
                            a correct representation of the general management of the Community. Too much care can not
                            be exercised in this respect. No information is intentionally withheld from those who
                            solicit a fellowship with the Order, and <pb n="35" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> should an instance occur that
                            admission into the Society has been obtained before the rules and regulations were fully
                            understood, it must be attributed to the kick of enquiry. 3. We should not wish to exclude
                            any class from fellowship with the Society that can give satisfactory evidence that they
                            wish to become peacemakers, pure in heart, and followers of Christ in the regeneration. 4.
                            The Society can not become responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to their
                            initiation into the Community ; nor after they become members, unless by agreement. 5. Any
                            person becoming a member, must rectify all wrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims.
                            We should prefer that every person would cancel his just debts, and live honorably and
                            honestly within his income, and should give this advice to every one who contemplates a
                            fellowship with our Society. 6. Probationary members ma}7 retain the lawful ownership of
                            their property, but the interest accruing from said property, will be devoted to the benefit
                            of the family in which they reside, until by their own free-will, and the consent of the
                            Trustees, they shall consecrate it to the support of the Society. 7. No believing husband or
                            wife should separate from an unbelieving partner, except by mutual agreement; unless the
                            conduct of the unbeliever be such as to warrant a separation, by the laws of God and man.
                            The husband or wife who has abandoned his or her companion, otherwise than as stated above,
                            can not be received into communion with the Society. If we were to deviate from this
                            salutary rule, in regard to the admission of members who have accepted the marital
                            obligations, we should undoubtedly become peace-breakers instead of peace-makers. It is not
                            our right to trespass upon the laws of the State, but we leave the parties to act according
                            to the dictates of conscience. 8. Parents that enter the Society, having in charge one or
                            more children, will be expected to conform to the rules and regulations of the family they
                            enter. The general management of their children must be arranged by the officers of the
                            Society. 0. Children are not taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except by the
                            request or agreement of those who have the lawful right, together with the consent of the
                            child. 10. It is expected that children admitted into the Society, will receive an education
                            suitable for the general management of business. 11. In the government of the Society, no
                            corporal punishment is approved nor any external violence exercised on any rational person
                            who has come to years of understanding. If the law of love and kindness fails to work a
                            reformation in the minds of either children or adults, it is very questionable if any
                            corporal punishment could effect it. If a child can not be persuaded through kindness, it
                                <pb n="36" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> should be the duty of the Society to see that he is returned to the
                            care of his parents or guardians. 12. A private correspondence with persons either in or out
                            of the Society, is not admissible, as it will readily be seen that evil minded persons could
                            seriously injure the Community.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In memorium" TEIform="index"/> IN MEMORIUM.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Clark, Nancy" TEIform="persName"/> By Nancy Clark.</byline><p TEIform="p"> They say that Sister Emily is dead, That to the bright galaxy of earth's departed saints,
                            Her stainless soul has fled. And tho the saddening news gives bitter pain, We feel our loss
                            to be her well establisht gain, For none with worthier zeal from day to day Has borne the
                            duties of our self-denying way. With willing hands and meek obedient will In humbleness of
                            heart, she sought Her mission here to fill, Nor paused to murmur by the way But faithfully
                            performed the work appointed for the day. Nor did she stoop to pain's overmastering power
                            But met with fortitude the last, soul-trying hourConscious of having left no work undone She
                            met death's chilling tide With strong unshaken faith In Christ her counselor and guide.
                            Through pastures green and by faith's tranquil stream She walked with him from earthly ways
                            aside. And when the dark, dark vale she came to tread She leaned upon his staff and knew no
                            cringing dread. No more her lithesome form shall greet our eye, No more her cheery voice
                            fall on our ear, But when the evening's soft gray curtain drops about the earth Her hallowed
                            soul will hover near And by its shadowy presence give sustaining power To those whose
                            strength to bear is waning; And by that strength we'll from the ashes rise And bear our
                            burdens uncomplaining.

                            would come to God, must first believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them who
                            diligently seek Him. Faith is sometimes said to be belief, trust. It is that and much more.
                            It is spiritual sight. It is the spiritual eye of the soul. <pb n="38" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> Animals of
                            the cat family are born with their eyes so fast closed, that they do not get them opened for
                            several days. So souls are blind and ignorant of spiritual things till that faith which is
                            spiritual sight is bestowed on them by the gift of God. The natural, animal man receiveth
                            not the spiritual things of God because they are foolishness to him ; neither can h ' kno v
                            them, for they are spiritually discerned. He that is spiritual, s'earcheth all things, even
                            the deeps of God, bat himself is discerned by none but those who are spiritual, like him.
                            The unspiritual can know almost nothing about God and the great world of causes which lies
                            beneath this world of effects. He knows nothing but effects. The visible world is the world
                            of effects. The unseen world which builds and beautifies it with light and living forms, is
                            the world of causes, and God is the Great First Cause of all. It may be clearly understood
                            from these remarks, that unbelief, or disbelief in spiritual things is spiritual blindness,
                            and that very one who makes a boast of unbelief in a spiritual worldï¿½in a life hereafterï¿½who
                            does not believe in spiritual gifts and manifestations,ï¿½we say such an one displays
                            ignorance, narrow-mindedness and folly, before all intelligent people who know these things
                            to be so. It is equivalent to boasting that one does not know how to read or write, and
                            pluming himself upon his voluntary ignorance when he has had an equal opportunity to learn,
                            with those who do know. But he threw it away on trifles. It is as if one blind should boast
                            of his inability to see, after refusing the aid that would enable him to see. The boast is
                            proof that he regards belief as voluntary, for if the will had no control over belief, there
                            would be no ground for the boast, nor for praise or blame in the matter. People are endowed
                            by nature with different powers or degrees of beliefï¿½but that is no reason why some should
                            refuse to believe that which is true. It is the state of the heart, desire, or affection
                            that determines belief. If the heart is pure and upright, it is ever ready to receive the
                            good. It turns ever toward the good and drinks it in as the thirsty drink water, or as
                            living forms absorb food to grow. If the heart be perverse or corrupt, it will reject the
                            good which interferes with its worldly, perverse, and sensual attractions. This is why
                            Father James taught that unbelief in the truthï¿½in the word of God spoken by his messengers,
                            is a damning sin. And those who sow unbelief, as opposed to the teachings of the gospel of
                            Christ will reap ji double condemnation; perhaps ten or a hundred fold, according to the
                            injury done to others. It will come back with all the increase to block the path of the
                            Sower, when he begins to retrace his steps toward heaven. O then purify your hearts ye who
                            would forsake tne wilderness of this world,ï¿½ye who would shun the paths of sin and folly,ï¿½ye
                            who would become the children of God and of a heavenly Parentage,ï¿½ye who would become sons
                            and daughters of Eternal Wisdom, whose ways are ways of pleas- <pb n="39" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> antness
                            and ail her paths are peace-,ï¿½ye who would become self-conquerors and rise triumphant over
                            sin and sorrow and delusive snares of the world, to quaff never ending glories and joys of
                            the redeemed in heaven. O seek this pearl of great price, this gift of faith. Yea, search
                            for it as for hidden treasures. Wrestle for it in prayer, resolve every day and hour to obey
                            the light as it comes to you. Persevere till you can say in truth, that you know God
                            lives,ï¿½and that He has revealed his law and commandments of Eternal life, love and goodness
                            to his servants who have sought him with singleness of heart and purpose that would not be
                            denied, nor put off with a counterfeit. People are differently endowed naturally, and are
                            not to be blamed for what they inherit of excess or deficiency if they will improve all
                            opportunities to cultivate those good faculties in which they are deficient. Every one has
                            the germ of every faculty possest by every other being, and there can be no excuse for not
                            cultivating and strengthening those faculties that are weak, when the knowledge is given us.
                            If the heart is pure, it will certainly have the desire that will inspire efforts in that
                            direction. Unbelief never accomplisht anything good or great. It never accomplisht anything
                            but the destruction of the unbeliever. All the best people of the world in all ages, all who
                            are honored for their good deeds have been believers in the unseen Powers and ministering
                            spirits who move and guide those who will seek their aid. They have been people of faith in
                            God and in Revelation. Even the great in a natural sense have been so, because of their
                            faith in the unseen and the strength they derived from thence. As soon as you begin to put
                            forth a persistent effort to obtain this faith those conditions begin to form and to grow by
                            the continued desire and effort, that will ultimate in producing in our souls a revelation
                            and birth of the Christ Spirit. When you have received this revelation, you will know it. It

                                17 C. G. Heed. North Family. Feb. 1897. Through a drizzling rain we again went to the
                                Church to attend meeting. Our meetings there are always fraught with a living
                                inspiration. We realize that we have indeed "One Lord, one faith and one baptism" and
                                feel the bonds of union strengthened in sustaining our precious cause. Our family
                                gatherings also abound with food for spiritual, intellectual and social needs. In
                                temporal affairs we have nothing unusual to report. Duties incident to the season are
                                carried along by willing hands and devoted hearts. When prime apples are taken over
                                mountain roads and delivered at $1.00 per. bbl. straw and oClier farm produce at
                                corresponding rates, it is quite easy for us to understand the apparent cause of the
                                thousands of mortgaged or deserted farms. Many students of Political Economy agree that
                                the real cause lies in those vast systems of monopoly which will be impossible when the
                                land, like air and sunlight, shall become the birthright of the people. May not the same
                                necessities which will compel the masses to co-operate for mutual blessing, also urge
                                those within our Order to take measures for a breader communism and fuller manifestation
                                of Christian brotherhood? As a people are we not suffering from a narrow-mindedness and
                                lack of spiritual faith in many among us who are not developt to an appreciation of the
                                spirit of our founders or a capacity to grasp the principles and work understanding^ for
                                their increase? We exist not as a sect, an institution or a community, but as a Church;
                                therefore the sources of our life must be spiritual. With the injunction to "Seek first
                                the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness" was given the promise that "all other
                                things should be added." Have we ever yet suffered any lack in the latter when we had
                                been faithful in the former? God is just and his laws are unchanging. Catherine

                                attain. Many times circumstances make it impossible as regards our material life for
                                success to come, but in the spiritual realm the forces that operate and are dominant
                                there, move with a, reliableness <pb n="41" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> which leaves no place for doubt
                                as to the final result, and while viewing it in this light it is pleasant to note the
                                interest which is growing to present advanced truths; those that pertain especially to
                                the evolvement of the Divine life and to have them unmixt as far as possible with
                                creedal forms which reflect the development of the medium through which they are given.

                                angels, impressing us witli thoughts and desires, many times beyond our normal
                                comprehension, we believe. While perusing the Feb. Manifesto and noting the harmony of
                                thought that pervaded it, we were imprest to say, Blessed are our gospel kindred!
                                whether in the sunshine or walking through the valley or the shadow, we will fear no
                                evil, for we are compast about by those spiritual forces that to the honest soul are a
                                wall of protection. We are blest with health to perform our daily duties for which we
                                render thanksgiving. While our aged Brethren and Sisters are preparing to lay their
                                earthly burdens down it is joy to know that they have a blessed heritage who have grown
                                up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The winter up to present date Feb. 4th,
                                has given us but very little snow, not enough for good sledding and now we are thinking
                                how soon the time will come when preparations will be made to cultivate the soil. We can
                                welcome the beautiful spring with its birds and flowers.

                                winter weather. Mercury has fallen twenty below zero, and snow enough to afford good
                                sledding for our hired help to draw logs from the surrounding hills to the amount of

                                humanity of things good and pure. Even the fine frost lace-work interwoven in the
                                branches of the trees and shrubs remind us of God's creative power, also of the powers

                                of Elder Giles in Elder Calvin's last note. Our spirit friends an 1 those of earth's
                                inhabitants who have become spiritually illuminated know that before the brilliant
                                curtain of human artificiality, life is dramatized in phases not real and pure. And
                                should not professing Christians be as "Battle Axes?" with voice, examples and pen, to
                                cut away the evil that good may grow? Ah! if we would keep our sight upon the beautiful
                                rain-bow of promise that spans' our life, "Lo, I am with you always," life's duties
                                would be less irksome, and the halo of Christ's spiritual presence would prove
                                sufficient strength to sustain through all burden and trial. Aye, if every soul burdened
                                with grief Would seek in social communion relief, There would be less ingratitude and

                                weather during the latter part of January. During the cold weather, we put up a supply
                                of five inch ice for the summer. Since last spring we have put a line of two and a half

                                high it gives a good pressure, so we have a plenty of water for house use as-well as a

                            have over other people's lives! O the power of the sin that you have done years and years
                            ago. It is awful to think of it. I think there is hardly anything more terrible to the human
                            thought than thisï¿½the picture of a man who, having sinned years and years ago, in a way that
                            involved other souls in his sin, and then having repented of his sin, and undertaken another
                            life, knows certainly that the power,ï¿½the consequence of that sin, is going on outside of
                            his reach; beyond even his ken and knowledge. He can not touch it. You wronged a soul ten
                            years ago. You taught a boy how to tell his first mercantile lie; you degraded the early
                            standard of his youth. What has become of that boy to-day? You may have repented. He has
                            passed out of your sight. He has gone years and years ago. Somewhere in this great
                            multitudinous mass of humanity, he is sinning and sinning, and re-duplicating and extending
                            the sin that you did. You touched the faith of some believing soul years ago with some
                            miserable sneer of yours; with some cynical and skeptical disparagement of God, and of the
                            man who is the utterance of God upon the earth. You taught the soul that was enthusiastic to
                            be full of skepticism and doubt. You wronged one years ago and his life has gone out from
                            your life; you can not begin to tell where. You have repented of your sin,ï¿½you have bowed
                            yourself, it may be, in dust and ashes. You have entered upon a new life. You are pure
                            to-day. But where is the skeptical soul? Where is the ruined one whom you sent forth into
                            the world out of the shadow of your sin years ago? You can not touch that life. You do not
                            know where it is. No step of yours, quickened with all your earnestness can pursue it. No
                            contrition of yours can draw back its consequences. It makes life awful to the man who has
                            ever sinned, who has ever wronged or hurt another life because of this sin, and no sin ever
                            was done, that did not hurt another life. I know the mercy of our God, that while He has put
                            us into each other's power to a fearful extent, He never will let any soul absolutely go to
                            everlasting ruin for another's sin; and so I dare to see the love of God pursuing that lost
                            soul, where you can not pursue it. But that dots not lift the shadow from your heart, or
                            ctase to make you tremble, when you think of how your sin has outgrown itself, and is
                            running far, far away, where you can never follow it. Thank God, the other side is true, as
                            well. Thank God, that when a man does a bit of service, however little it may be, of that
                            too, he can never trace the consequences. Thank God, that that which in some better
                            momentï¿½in some nobler inspiration, you did ten years ago to make your brother's faith a
                            little stronger, to let your shop boy confirm and not doubt the confidence in man which he
                            had brought into his business, to establish the purity of a soul instead of staining or
                            shaking it, that in this quick, electric atmosphere in which we live, that t.)o runs forth.
                            Do not say in your terror, "I will do nothing." You must do something. Only let Christ tell
                            youï¿½let Christ tell you that there is nothing that a man rests upon as lie looks back upon
                            it when it has sunk into the past, with any satisfaction, except some service to his fellow
                            man, some strengthening and helping of a human soul God-ward.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Evening star Bible class. Held December 20, 1896" TEIform="index"/> EVENING STAR BIBLE

                            "Christ." A report of the lesson of Dec. 13th was given. Memory exercises were next repeated
                            consisting of bracket verses, nail heads, teaching practical thoughts, etc. The lesson story
                            perused was upon the Birth of Christ. Textï¿½"And the Angel said unto them, Fear not; for
                            behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people."ï¿½Luke ii., 10.
                            This great joy was the birth of a Savior, who was ushered into the world for the redemption
                            of mankind. Jesus was born in the days of Herod, in Bethlehem, and a manger was his cradle.
                            Yet, strange enough, no enquiries after him; even Herod, only enquiring when he became
                            alarmed for his throne. Herod was the son of Antipater, and had obtained the Kingdom from
                            the Komans to whom Palestine was now subject. He was called "Herod the Great," because of
                            his splendid talents, and we might say, because of his splendid(?) sins! He was so afraid
                            that Jesus was the lookt for Messiah, and would take the throne that he ordered all the
                            infants killed, to make sure of his own safety as King. But this did not secure him, for
                            God's plan can not be overthrown by man. Jesus is King to-day. No one need feel so poor, so
                            young, or so outcast but they can find in him a Father and a Friend. Therefore let us draw
                            near to him, follow his footsteps, in the uplifting element of meekness, purity and love. We
                            then listened to a piece from one of the pupils, giving her ideas of the lesson and how we
                            could learn to follow his beautiful example. After the closing song, we parted, each feeling

                                    engage anybody in a sober and earnest conversation! People like to talk well enough,
                                    and will talk without ceasing on the most trilling subjects. They are ready to
                                    gossip, to entertain each other with the small talk of society, but it is rare in

                                    of their special lines of business. They avoid the trouble of a real intellectual
                                    grapple with any of the great problems of life. They do not want to be burdened with

                            existed so powerful as the Hittites are declared to have been, profane history would surely
                            have referred to its existence; and as there is not the least mention of such a people by
                            secular historians, the Bible record is purely a fabrication. Archaeology has, however,
                            settled the matter. The Hittites are described on the monuments, and skepti- <pb n="46" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> cism is forced to acknowledge the Biblical references. Christians, who have
                            put the promises of God to the test, have no need to seek confirmation of their faith in the
                            historical evidences, as they have the "Witness within." But as infidelity is widely
                            propagated, it is the duty of every believer to familiarize himself with the subject of
                            Christian evidences, and theieby be prepared to confute unbelief. Of prophecy and the proof
                            of its fulfillment afforded by archaeology, no evidence could be stronger. The present state
                            of many Oriental lands as brought to light by the antiquarian, marvelously proves the truth
                            of prophecy and the inspiration of the Scriptures. H. L. Hastings, the anti-infidel writer
                            and publisher of Boston, tells us in his essay on "The Inspiration of the Bible," of a
                            skeptic to whom he gave a copy of a work on prophecy and which resulted in his conversion.
                            Mr. Hastings well knows how to deal with infidelity and after years of acquaintance with
                            infidel methods he declares that altlio error is widely circulated by unbelievers, and
                            therefore does harm to the ignorant, yet infidelity makes as much impression on the truth as
                            peas would fired against Gibralter. Let us all familiarize ourselves with the argument for
                            Christianity and show skepticism that unbelief is founded either on ignorance of, or enmity
                            to the truth. The following, from one of H. L. Hastings' tracts, may well be given in
                            conclusion ;ï¿½ "Lord Shaftesbury tells of two sailors, cast away on a cannibal island, who
                            were in great fear; but while creeping cautiously around the island they came upon a cabin.
                            There was no one there, but on venturing inside they found a Bible. That book banisht all
                            their fears." "Every one knows that where this book has influence it makes things safe. Why
                            is this? If it were a bad book, we should expect to find it in the hands of the worst men.
                            In New York there is a kind of rogues' museum,ï¿½a place where they have all kinds of
                            skeleton-keys, jimmies, brass knuckles, dirks, pistols and implements of mischief, which
                            they have taken away from roughs and criminals. Do you suppose there is a single New
                            Testament in the whole lot? Why hot? If it were a bad book you would expect a rogue to have
                            a revolver in one pocket, and a New Testament tucked away in another. There was a quarrel
                            the other night, and a man used aï¿½Bible? No! it was a bottle! Where the Bible bears sway,
                            quarrels do not come.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="You never can tell" TEIform="index"/> YOU NEVER CAN TELL.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> [Contributed by Eldress Lois Wentworth ] You never can tell when you send a word

                                if I am not acting on the principle, "Assume the truth of evolution and then go head."
                                This is exactly what I am doing. I have no desire to persuade Christians to become
                                evolutionists; I desire to show evolutionists that they can be Christians. My aim is not
                                at all scientific; it is purely religious. The object of the series might be stated in a
                                sentence thus: Assuming evolution to be true, it does not weaken, it strengthens,
                                Christian faith. We accept the testimony of the experts when they have reached a
                                conclusion. This is my first reason for being an evolutionist. Practically all
                                scientists, I believe absolutely all biologists, are evolutionists They have proved
                                themselves careful, painstaking, assiduous students of life. I assume the correctness of
                                their conclusion. I have, indeed, studied somewhat the writings of Darwin, Huxley,
                                Haeckel, Tyndall, and the later epitomes of Le Conte, Drummond and Tyler, and have read
                                something of the criticisms on the other sideï¿½enough to see that the hypothesis of
                                evolution has a groundwork of fact and reason. But I accept evolution, as a statement of
                                the process of physical life, not from a personal scientific investigation, which I have
                                not the training to conduct, but upon the substantially unanimous testimony of those who
                                have such training. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Ladies' home journal" TEIform="index"/>The Ladies' Home

                                Journal has been so pronounced that three additional ones will be given. These are
                                likely to prove the most interesting of all that General Harrison has written, in the
                                sense that they will be more personal. His first paper will show what "A Day with the
                                President at His Desk" means giving glimpses of the President in his private office. His
                                second article will deal with "The Social Life of the President," which will cover the
                                President's obligatory social duties and ..his part in great State functions. The last
                                article will go into the President's domestic life and portray "The Domestic Side of the
                                White House." All these articles will be specially illustrated. This will be the first
                                time that an ex-President of the United States has ever written of his office and of his
                                home. The articles will all appear in early issues of The Ladies' Home Journal.
                                everything is illustrated. The opening paper is a sketch of "Life in Russia," by Sophie
