NO. 2.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hampton, Oliver C." TEIform="persName"/>OLIVER C. HAMPTON.</byline><p TEIform="p"> I have very seriously thought over iMs solemn theme of what is termed among Believers, "the
                            visible Order of God," and so well am I convinced of its inexorable verity, that I am
                            willing to stake my eternal salvation on the practical issue of the premises and conclusion
                            enunciated in my first article. I know of persons and not a few either, who, to be sure, are
                            ready to object to the theories therein contained on the score of the annihilation of their
                            individuality. They say, " If man is to subject himself in all things to this organized
                            power in others, he is no longer an individual independent structure, but merely a helpless
                            wheel in another machine. " We would reply to this, 1st. "Was he ever anything else?" Not
                            he, indeed. Who does not know that " God never made an independent man, 'Twould mar the
                            beauty (logic) of the general plan." 2nd. Suppose it should embarrass and restrain his lusts
                            and appetites and force him to even very seriously shorten sail on his directly selfish
                            impulses and bring him into the discipline, and gradually the love, of doing good to others
                            instead of the worship of the worse than worthless idol of what he is pleased to call his
                            individual, independent self. This very self-abnegation will increase his happiness and
                            spiritual elevation and glory a million fold. Again, I am convinced that there is no
                            independent individuality except the infinite Love and Wisdom�even our eternal Father and
                            Mother. All the rest of us, finite creatures are bound AN<pb n="50" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> together in
                            the bundle of life and though differentiated by personalities, we are and forever shall be
                            dependent on each other and our interests cannot be separated in time nor eternitv. And the
                            nature of that dependence being, and resting upon the logical exponeDt of our dear Bro. Paul
                            (" the less being blest of the better,") we are only left the alternative of kicking against
                            the goads of our logical, as well as emotional convictions, or of accepting the better way
                            and taking sanctuary under the benignant shadow and protection, of this sublime "Visible
                            Order of Heaven," an order as before stated, permeating all worlds and all heavens
                            throughout the Universe even " Though sordid selfishness should flee dismayed And plunge
                            headlong to its infernal shade. " In this visible representation of "God manifested in the
                            flesh," dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily inasmuch as the dual character of
                            Deity is found therein, by which as parents, the greater, nourish, comfort and protect the
                            less (their spiritual offspring) and in whom as divine representatives are contained all the
                            spiritual medicine necessary for the healing of the nations. I have through the unmerited
                            munificence of these our Father and Mother enjoyed and fully proven, the divine efficacy of
                            this sublime Order for more than sixty three years, and can say, " I know of the doctrine
                            that it is true having never failed in a single instance in my allegiance to this sacred
                            Order, nor in unequivocal obedience to its salutary requirements. I have had thorny paths of
                            affliction to travel and "through much tribulation to enter this kingdom of Heaven," but the
                            abounding love and wisdom, charity and forbearance of this all sustaining Shekiua, has ever
                            been to me, as a pillar of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, to guide me safely
                            through all the sorrows and dangers of this rudimental life. My observation as well as my
                            actual experience go to confirm me in the solidness of this foundation for eternal life.
                            Scores and scores of times have I been released from intense sufferings and been filled full
                            of consolation and peace by going to this sacred tribunal and freely unbosoming my inward
                            temptations, afflictions and even agonies, and this releasement has often been so sudden and
                            spontaneous as to seem even miraculous. On the other hand where I have seen the kindly
                            efforts of this visible Order repulsed and resisted and an organized rebellion set up
                            against it, I have seen without a single exception the disaster and spiritual ruin of the
                            recalcitrant party or parties. I recollect in the long ago, a man who drew a third part of
                            the stars of heaven as it were after him to the earth, from their cosy home of repose and
                            tranquillity in these upper heavens of obedience to the visible order of Christ's
                            pentecostal church re-established by our blessed Mother. He may not have foreseen the full
                            consequences that were to follow, the gray and gloomy cinders of desolation that were to
                            appear in his wake, the silent ruin he would have to be responsible for. But his rebellion
                            swept the church for a time as with the besom of destruction. After leading many astray
                            beyond recall, he himself apostatized and separated from the Society, but the promises he
                            made his followers were never realized. Only ruin and sorrow were experienced by himself and
                            all his party.<pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> I walked the streets of Cleveland for hours listening to
                            the ingenious arguments of another individual in opposition to the great truth of "God
                            manifested in the flesh" through Christ and Mother and their successors. I said all I could
                            to dissuade him from his purposes which were evidently subversive of the sacred order of the
                            church. He, however, persisted, and he and his adherents long since separated in a body from
                            the Church hoping and expecting to form an organization excelling in perfection even "the
                            pattern shown in the mount." They soon, however, leavened back into the isolated selfishness
                            of the world and stand today as another solemn proof that '' No weapon formed against the
                            visible order established by the Christ of the universe can prosper" even that " Kingdom set
                            up upon the earth by the God of heaven which shall never have an end. " I have written these
                            things in sincerity and out of love and kind solicitude for all who are sin- sick, sorrowful
                            and desolate, and wish to come into closer communion with, and enjoy the consolations of a
                            sweet atonement with God and peace and good will to all their fellow travelers in time. All
                            the interest and object I have left on this earth is to do what good I can toward the sin
                            stricken and sorrowful in elevating them to regions of peace and contentment such as the
                            true church and life of Jesus the Christ is able to bestow upon them. I pray they may give
                            these thoughts a candid examination and then a severe test of their truth by "being doers of
                            the work" and I will insure a very happy result from this practical experiment. Union

TEIform="persName"/>MATILDA J. TATTERTON.</byline><p TEIform="p">Prayer is the sincere breathing of the soul to God, and is not confined to language. It is
                            the means through which the soul seeks the blessing and protection of God and kind guardian
                            angels. What an example of faith in prayer, taught by our Savior when surrounded by cruel
                            enemies. "Father, forgive them, for they not what they do." It is the true spirit of prayer
                            that leads us to approach the All-wise "Not as I will, but as thou wilt." Until we can feel
                            this spirit of perfect resignation we have not learned how to pray. It is a humiliating but
                            a soul exalting gift a shield against temptation. Jesus often retired alone to the mountain,
                            where no eye could see, no ear could hear, no sympathizing spirit respond, and poured t
                            forth the anguish of his soul unto God, for strength to drink the bitter cup. One of the
                            greatest hindrances to our spiritual growth is the lack of perfect honesty in our approaches
                            to God. We draw near with our lips when our hearts are far off. When we learn to be
                            thoroughly honest in our prayers, realizing the mockery of mere lip service to Him who
                            searches the heart, we shall no longer complain that our prayers remain unanswered. How true
                            the words,� " By prayer we oft prevail, When mortal strength [doth fail, And bring to our
                            aid Heaven's power; Whate'er our toil and care By watchfulness and prayer We've an anchor, a
                            safe-guard each hour." As a little child looks to a father for strength, and yearns for the
                            tender embraces of a loving mother, so does the soul in need, bow to the universal Father
                            and Mother, God, for strength to<pb n="52" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> hold, wisdom to direct, and for that
                            charity, love, and care, which only the baptism of the Holy Spirit can impart. Through
                            prayer we are enabled to find access to God. It fills the soul of the seeker after
                            righteousness with a satisfaction no words can express. When we consider our dependence upon
                            a supreme guidance, we pray earnestly and unceasingly to be preserved from all evil. The
                            more spiritually enlightened the soul, the more prayerfully interested concerning the things
                            of God. Prayer is indeed the Christian's armor, a never failing source of strength and
                            encouragement. Canterbury, N.

                            come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh." Matt, xviii., 7. The sin of
                            intemperance, is one of the world's offences, which can never be eradicated, until those
                            claiming to be Christians, at least, are in possession of the spirit which enabled St. Paul
                            to say, "Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world
                            standeth, lest I make my brother to offend." 1 Cor. viii., 18. The act, or condition,
                            occasioning the offence may not be sinful, in and of itself, that is, in its effects upon
                            the perpetrator of the act. Those, upon whose lives, the blighting effects of intemperance
                            have never fallen, may taste the wine cup without serious injury to themselves; but to the
                            companions, with whom they are associated, some of whom may have inherited the almost

                            which, the characters of many become hopelessly shipwrecked. Intentionally unkind, or
                            thoughtless words, personal habits, and selfish considerations of whatever name or nature,
                            which would cause a weaker brother to offend, should be brought into obedience to the
                            perfect law of Christ, the author of the new commandment. His followers love each other,
                            with that love which enables a man to lay down his (selfish) life for the good of his
                            friends. Canterbury, N.

                            compass, and a settled design in view, will determine the port for which he wishes to steer,
                            before he leaves the harbor. Or if perchance he lose his chart and compass, and should be in
                            danger of perishing amid the sands and breakers of an unknown coast, he would doubtless
                            accept the first aid that offered a hope of rescue�and be glad to receive any clear and
                            certain knowledge of a safe course to a port of peace and security, where the fruits and
                            blessings of industry abound. In either case, after forming a purpose, founded upon
                            knowledge and conviction, reaching forward to the goal of desire, and drawing inspiration
                            from thence to prompt straight forward action, then no change in the scene, no illusive
                            aspect of sea, earth or sky, no coaxing, threats, enticement nor wearisomeness, nor danger,
                            nor hardship can turn him from his course, Avhile cleaving to his purpose. "The race is
                            great and the ideal fair, but the multitude are whiffling and unsure, while the hero is
                            immovably centered there." As the science of numbers is worked out by the application of a
                            few simple figures that a child may learn,�whose fixed values must be adhered to in all
                            calculations, from the least sum in addition to the solution of the most abstruse
                            mathematical problems, else the results will be null and void : so in the conduct of life,
                            the same virtues that adorn a child, truthfulness, steadfastness, fidelity to trust,
                            simplicity, kindness, purity of heart, teachableness, carefulness, obedience to convictions
                            and a suitable reverence or respect for superiors, are equally necessary to beautify and
                            perfect the character in all grades of intelligence, and spheres of action, from the lowest
                            to the highest walks in life. The simplest rules of moral discipline, and the strictest
                            principles of virtue and integrity are ubiquitous in their power and obligations, and are
                            unchangeable in their nature and effects, and without them, no human life can be a genuine
                            success�but with them incorporated in the character and conduct, man is sure to achieve the
                            high destiny for which he was created. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. </p></div2><div2 type="none" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Adversity flattereth no man" TEIform="index"/>Adversity flattereth no man

                            and having a semblance of purity outside; he could see their desire to appear well before
                            men, while their hearts were full of hypocrisy and deceit. They were like many professed
                            Christians in this day, who have an appearance of piety, but who do not possess any of the
                            real substance of a religious life. Christ also said: "Take heed that ye do not your alms
                            before men to be seen of them, " Matt., vi, 1, which implies that we are to improve every

                            merely a profession of religion and has not the real substance; when temptations and trials

                            Inconsequence of this, the leaders and Elders of the church considered me as a suitable
                            candidate, and well prepared to become a church member. Accordingly I was taken into the
                            Congregational church at Providence, R. I. where I then lived, being in the nineteenth year
                            of my age. I continued a member of that church for several years, and with respect to what
                            was there required of me, I walked "blameless and without rebuke," or even a gentle
                            admonition, until I embraced the gospel of my present faith ; then indeed, altheugh they
                            could bring no moral accusation against me, I was quickly excommunicated from the church.
                            But while I was in this good standing with them, instead of growing and increasing in the
                            knowledge of the Lord, I daily increased in pride and arrogancy ; the natural propensities
                            of my mind were more inclined to evil than ever ; snd still I was called a good Christian,
                            and a wholesome church member. Alas ! how aptly may the words �f the prophet be applied to
                            such ! " This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips
                            ; but their heart is far from me." Matt, xv., 8. I finally began to feel uneasy and troubled
                            in my mind. I saw that all was not well with me ; my poor soul lay at stake. I coxild often
                            feel a sense that God was calling upon me to come out from among them. But how should I come
                            out ? I knew no way out; and of all the sons and daughters of the church to which I
                            belonged, there was not one that was able to lead me out. It was then I cried to God, and
                            prayed for deliverance ; and earnestly entreated that I might find a people that served him
                            in righteousness and truth ; for I fully believed there was such a people somewhere ; but 1
                            knew not where to find them. It was not long before I received the answer to my prayers. In
                            the summer of 1780, the joyful news of peace and salvation came to my ears ; and the way was
                            open and free for all, or as<pb n="55" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> many as were willing to confess and forsake
                            their sins. By hearing the report, I received a measure of faith, and believed it to be the
                            work of God ; but I knew it not. The following year, in March, I visited the people called
                            Shakers, at New Lebanon, N. Y. being then in the twenty-fourth year of my age. Having become
                            fully convinced that they were the people of God, I came forward and confessed my sins, with
                            a full determination to forsake them forever. I sincerely confessed them to God before his
                            witnesses, and felt my mind greatly released from the weight and burden I had long been
                            under. And through the mercy and goodness of God, I was able to feel a sense of the light
                            and manifestation of Christ in his second appearing, through Mother Ann Lee ; and by the
                            revelation of God in my own soul, I can bear witness to the truth of her testimony. I know
                            by my own experience, that she was able to show to lost souls the root and foundation of
                            sin, and the cause of their loss from God ; and to show the way whereby they might travel
                            out of their loss. As I Avas favored with many privileges with Mother and the Elders that
                            stood with her, I feel it my duty and privilege to testify the things that I have seen and
                            heard. 1 have been with her in times of persecution, and have witnessed her sufferings ; and
                            had she been a wicked woman, I certainly should have discovered it, and should not have
                            followed her, for I had made my escape and fled from such like people, to find a better
                            sort. I wTas not disappointed, nor mistaken in the change. I had sufficient opportunity to
                            know that the charges alleged against Mother Ann were false. I can also bear witness that
                            she not only maintained a sharp and powerful testimony against wickedness of every kind ;
                            but she supported her testimony by her godly example in all things. She was every way
                            faithful to teach and admonish the people to good works, and to keep the fear of God in all
                            their goings forth, in all things, both spiritual and temporal. Mother Ann was a pattern of
                            righteousness and virtue which I feel confident was never excelled among women ; and her
                            pure and heavenly example, which is well worthy of the attention and serious consideration
                            of all, like a true pillar of light, is still increasing and abounding in all her faithful
                            children. According to the measure of my faith and obedience to Mother Ann's testimony, I
                            have been protected from the snares of Satan, and the evil propensities of a lost nature :
                            so that I am enabled to keep a conscience void of offence toward God and all men. Although I
                            have passed through many scenes of tribulation ; yet I have always found comfort and peace
                            in the gospel. I have been blest with faithful and kind Elders, Brethren and Sisters, who
                            are dear to me as my own life, and with whom I can worship God in spirit. In addition to
                            these things, I have been blessed with many heavenly visions, and have enjoyed many precious
                            manifestations of the power and goodness of God. These heavenly gifts and divine
                            manifestations, I very well know, are too far above the power of nature to gain the credit
                            of an un'believing world ; but to me thej feel like the bread of life ; they have fed and
                            refreshed my soul from time to time, and more than forty-five years, by which means I
                                have<pb n="56" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> been nourished and supported, strengthened and comforted. Why
                            then should I not know from whence good cometh? and why should I not bear testimony-of these
                            things? Yea, why should I not thank God always, that he has called me by the everlasting
                            gospel, to be a partaker of so great a salvation ? I rejoice that there is still an
                            administration of the same spirit of truth, and a continual succession of the same Christian
                            example maintained in the Church. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            mete it shall be measured to you again." I believe that upon this scripture rests the
                            problem of the Christian's life ; which for ages has rested under the vale of spurious
                            sectarianism and which they have tried to work out through their narrow,contracted ideas of
                            Christ. How often by a hasty judgment we judge falsely. What breaks the union or wounds the
                            feelings like false judgment? With the same lips do we praise God and curse our brother. Can
                            this be right? Let the unruly tongue be brought under control by curb bit, and by gospel
                            discipline and our heaven on earth has begun. False judgment always leads to deceit and lies
                            for almost invariably the accuser has passed his judgment behind the back of the accused not
                            having moral courage of character to come up arid say�brother have we not been friends long
                            enough to speak of a fault to each other without offence ; I perceive you do so and so and
                            it is very disagreeable to me and the company with whom we associate. Who could help giving
                            respect to such an admonition and do better ! But not so with false judgment. According to
                            their own carnal reasoning, we are measured, judged and weighed in their balance of false
                            justice and found wanting in the spirit of Christ. All this done without even a witness on
                            our side to save our characters from total destruction. Now what more shall we say of this
                            Apollyon? the Giant Despair of the Christian's happiness, who seeks opportunities to find
                            some flaw, or pickup some old bone that once a true friend has thrown away into the mud and
                            filth where it belongs and commence gnawing to see if there is not a little meat left to
                            satiate their cravings. And not satisfied with satiating their own hunger, they hunt up a
                            bosom friend and let them have a part. "Judge not that ye be not judged. " How in unison
                            this chimes with the leading maxim of the true Christian "Do unto others as ye would have
                            them do to you." But we are not through yet with false judgment. While the heavy batteries
                            of truth are sending their heavy shot don't let us miss the mark. An ugly old mule balking
                            at every turn of the road and going only when urged forward by the smart of the lash.
                            Selfwilled, independent, always ready to hug self when the fire of gospel truth is turned
                            upon the enemy's works, and then where and how do we find the poor miserable coward ;
                            fleeing before his enemy and with wide open eyes looking behind for fear of being shot in
                            the back. "And with what measure ye mete it <pb n="57" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> shall be measured to you
                            again." Let us who are young beware of this traitorous enemy it will prove untrue in every
                            case. With a jealous eye it looks upon its brother or sister to see wrong in every motive
                            and action. It has severed many tender cords of friendship which might have remained strong.
                            It was the club that struck down one of the first images of God upon earth and it remains
                            the accuser of the brethren and should be cast out. The gospel has given us liberty of
                            conscience and liberty of speech, and this above every other earthly prize my soul covets;
                            and shall I shun the warfare that will bring freedom to our ranks? I esteem no sacrifice too
                            great for the graces of the gospel, no conflict with the powers of evil too severe for the
                            redemption of my spirit from an earthly worldly life into the angelic.

                            that by obedience to godly principles we become beautified and adorned with the graces of
                            simplicity, truth, and purity, I thought to make a few remarks, which I hope may lead to the
                            encouragement of the younger part of my Brethren and Sisters, who have had but a short
                            privilege in living among the people of God in this day of Christ's second appearing. I have
                            learned by a lengthy exuerience in God's holy Zion .on earth, that the maxim is certainly
                            correct, "If we want to be happy we must make others happy. " It is written, 1 Peter iii.,
                            10. "For he that will love life and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and
                            his lips that they speak no guile. " "If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect
                                man."<pb n="58" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> James, iii., 2. " He will send his angels to gather out of
                            his kingdom all that offend and them that do iniquity. " Matt. xiii., 41It is a true saying,
                            a good Believer will never give, nor take offence. Our blessed Mother Ann's testimony was ;
                            " Never speak to or reprove any one in excitement, or passion, for if you do, you put into
                            him ten times more a spirit of evil, than you take from him. " "Brethren if a man be
                            overtaken with a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of
                            meekness. " Gal vi., 1. " Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. " Matt,
                            v., 5. " And a meek and lowly spirit is precious in the sight of God. '' " The wolf shall
                            dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young
                            lion and fatling together, and a little child shall lead them." Isa. xi., 6. This is an
                            allegory, representing the different characters and dispositions of men, and declaring, that
                            all leaders among the people of God must be innocent and harmless, kind and lovely, as
                            generally all little children are. I have become fully convinced, that the grace of God has
                            a great deal to do with our travel on this mundane sphere. Our Savior taught us to . pray in
                            the Lord's prayer. " Leave us not in temptation. " We must infer from this, that God may
                            leave us in temptation or not, just as he sees fit. " God resisteth the proud, but giveth
                            his grace to the humble. " It is therefore plain and evident that nothing short of a spirit
                            of meekness and humility, charity and love, will cause the grace of God to be extended to
                            us, for it is explicitly required to love Him with all our soul, heart, mind and strength,
                            and our neighbor as ourselves. These principles can only be carried out by doing all the
                            good we possibly can do, temporally as well as spiritually, never harbor the least enmity,
                            against any one, no matter how much we might have been abused, always to do good for evil,
                            and manifest a spirit of love and charity. " Charity is not easily provoked, beareth all
                            things, endureth all things. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three, but the
                            greatest of these is charity. " 1 Cor. xiii., 5, 13. Chastity, meekness, humility and
                            obedience are going hand to hand with charity. Therefore, it is obvious, that all who carry
                            out and live uj) to these requirements, are under the special blessing, favor and protection
                            of God, and have a foretaste of heaven, or the world to come, whilst living here on earth.
                            The wisdom that is from above is first chaste (a gny in Greek�pure is not correct.) In the
                            German version it is translated chaste; for although purity and chastity belong together,
                            the proper definition of these words are a little different, as for instance water, or air,
                            could not properly be termed chaste. This shows, that those who are in possession of divine
                            wisdom, must be above all things, first chaste, peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated,
                            full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocrisy, and the fruit of
                            righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. " Blessed are the peacemakers, for
                            they shall be called the children of God. " Matt, v., 6. Jesus was the prince of peace, not
                            a warrior, f&gt;&gt;r he said; " He that takes the sword shall perish by the sword.
                            " Can it not be seen by this that, '' Darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the
                            people; " for do not all sects and denominations in the world, with only a few exceptions,
                            go to war and butcher one another? Where is the peaceable kingdom of God to be found, where
                            they live together as Brethren and Sisters in the bonds of love and union, and have all
                            things in common, except among good Believers, who crucify the flesh with its affections and
                            lusts, and live righteously, godly and soberly? "Whosoever will save his (carnal) life shall
                            lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel shall save it. " Mark,
                            viii., 85. Peter began to say unto him, "Lo we have left all and have followed thee. " Mark,
                            x., 28. This is an incontrovertible evidence that he left his wife and she became a sister,
                            for Jesus answered and said; " Verily I say unto you, there is no man that has left house,
                            or brethren and sisters, or father or mother, or wife or children or lands, for my sake and
                            the gospels, but he shall receive a hundred fold now in this time, houses, and brethren and
                            sisters, mothers and children and lands with persecution, and in the world to come eternal
                            life." Very few of our friends perhaps have noticed<pb n="59" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> that the word wife
                            is omitted in the reward and persecution fills out her place ! Now I can testify to all men,
                            that I have received an hundred fold, all that Jesus has promised, and the heavenly Father
                            declared, that he would withhold no good thing from those that would love and serve him. The
                            blessings of God, and a conscience void of offence to all men, is a greater reward to the
                            faithful and honest soul, than all the treasures that this world can afford, for " Heaven is
                            within. " It is more a condition than a location. Who of all my dear Brethren and Sisters
                            will therefore be so unwise, as to sell their precious birthright for a mess of pottage,
                            like Esau, to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, and lose that glorious reward, of
                            which we read, that " No eye has seen, no ear heard, neither has it entered the heart of
                            man, what God has promised to them that love and serve him? " "No cross, no crown !" The
                            cross has to be faithfully borne to the end, so that when we have ended our time of
                            probation in this mundane sphere, we can with confidence expect a glorious reception in the
                            spheres of bliss, with those cheerful words of our Savior, " Welcome good and faithful
                            servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. " I have written the foregoing from pure love
                            to my younger Brethren and Sisters, and hope to God, that all may come to the knowledge of
                            truth and be saved, With regard to the happiness and welfare of all my fellow mortals, I
                            truly remain your friend and well wisher.

                            confinement. As I cast my eyes about I am struck by the beautiful scenery. Grand hills !
                            with their bare tops so recently covered with a robe of snow. Trees of wonderful growth and
                            beauty. Everywhere magnificent trees ! " Whose mighty arms : Stretch forth to shield from
                            penetrating glare When o'er the hills the sun with sick'ning heat [air, Sends down its beams
                            that scorch the Summer Proud in their bearings, lofty in their height!" Below the hills in
                            view I trace a little brook bubbling over the pebbles, speeding on right joyously to join
                            its brothers and sisters in the great ocean. It seems to be afraid of any floating driftwood
                            that might obstruct its progress. This reminds me that there may be driftwood in my way,
                            that would retard my progress heavenward and the question arises, am I carefully striving to
                            remove the driftwood and press on to that rich prize I have in view? Ah ! 1 fear there are
                            many times when the driftwood has nearly blocked up the way and it seemed impossible to push
                            it aside but with the help of my Parents in heaven and faithful guardians on earth I have
                            been able thus far to remove all obstacles. I feel grateful to those who have in any way
                            aided me on my journey. In God we have trusted, and will ever depend upon his strong arm of
                            love and tender kindness. Though erring and weak we still receive from His hand bountiful
                            blessings and we can but realize we are under his especial care ; yet we have not been
                            without feeling his chastening rod. Many times we have drank the bitter cup of affliction,
                            and not longhas it been since we were boAved in deepest sorrow. We much mourned the loss of
                            our good father Elder Otis Sawyer and may the remembrance of him who laid down his life for
                            the cause be fresh in our<pb n="60" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> minds, while we strive at all times to follow
                            his good and pure example. As we bow beneath the rod we say "Whom the Lord loveth He
                            chasteneth. " Still we will trust though we are led in the valleys of affliction or on the
                            mountains of prosperity, for in Him we find our joy, our strength, our hope and our peace.
                            With these thoughts ever in view I believe I shall be able to avoid the driftwood and sail
                            on the clear brimming river till I at last shall reach that place in the house of many
                            mansions, which those who have gone before me are preparing, and the glory that is awaiting
                            me, I shall feel as though I would not have missed it had the way been doubly long and the
                            driftwood more abundant. So I will still remember that: "In God we trust. " West Gloucester,

                            Life's setting sun soon changed to night! Some had not heard that he was ill Before his
                            mortal form was still. We'll see no more his smiling face, A vacancy now fills its place.
                            Where oft his busy feet have trod His form will rest beneath the sod. "Tis well with him,

                            in it, if it is faithfully performed, there will be a crown beyond, that our Heavenly Father
                            will surely bestow upon every humble Christian worker. Canterbury, N.

                                    talking, Never mind, never mind and don't stop, What if the low rounds are crowded,
                                    There is always room at the top. Our country needs Websters and Lincolns Longfellows
                                    Greeleys and Grants ; Some of our young men will be such, If only we give them a
                                    chance. Do you think that Webster would faltered, At aught which idlers might drop?
                                    No ! No ! he ever kept climbing Till he reached his place at the top. In this life
                                    those only are leaders, Who have that indomitable " pluck, " Which people everywhere
                                    worship. And say " what a fellow for luck. " But luck has naught to do with it It is
                                    this�work, work, never stop; If you only have heart in your labor, You will surely
                                    come out at the top. Work, work from dawn until evening. Improve every moment of
                                    time ; Don't stay on life's lower flooring, But onward and upward e'er climb. If
                                    some one does feel above you, Don't let this your endeavors stop; For if they do
                                    practice off-showing And have of fine airs a large stock, They'll find e'er they die
                                    I am thinking, It is brains which find room at the top. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Western Plowman" TEIform="index"/>The Western Plowman.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="science" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sunlight" TEIform="index"/> SUNLIGHT.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anderson, Martha J."

                            plants, lack vitality and strength, and lose the bloom of health, because they do not have
                            sunshine enough to generate nerve force, and keep the blood in proper circulation. It is
                            caloric that creates steam, and keeps the machinery of the human system in motion. Light,
                            heat and electricity, are the sun's- potent forces, powerful for good, when rightly applied,
                            for the production of energy throughout the vast arcana of nature. The food that builds up
                            and sustains our physical structure is brought to perfection under these very elements ; and
                            by their action the atmosphere we<pb n="62" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> breathe is purified, changed and kept
                            in motion. And as the universe is dependent on the sun for all its life and beauty ; so are
                            mankind equally indebted to the same source for bodily development and perfection. Then all
                            ye who are suffering from the ills that humanity are heirs to ; shake off the shackles of
                            indifference, and deem it your duty and privilege to bow before the rising sun, in
                            recognition of his benign influence ; to admit its cheerful rays in chamber, shop and
                            sitting room ; let no habitable place be deprived of its magnetic charm, while its glorious
                            light rounds out the precious hours of day. And never forget, when it has ran its course,
                            and the last lingering rays paint earth and sky with beauty, to thank the good Father and
                            Mother for this greatest of earthly blessings. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            and Practice�Spiritual Guidance� Modes of Life�Practical Keligion, Ok a recent tramp through
                            the Berkshire Hills I veered out of my track for fifteen or twenty miles to call on the
                            Shakers at Mount Lebanon, N. Y., the headquarters of the sect. It was a bright, cool Autumn
                            morning when I strode out of Lee, and the church bells were ringing as I passed through
                            Lenox. Dudes with English clothes and single barrelled eye glasses were dawdling through the
                            streets, and important looking persons were speeding down the elm shaded avenues in
                            glittering coupes, driven by coachmen in livery. People go to the country to cut that sort
                            of figure ! An easy walk across the mountains, rich in panoply of gold and crimson, took me
                            to the village of Hancock, which is occupied almost entirely by Shakers, and there I paused
                            for lunch. What was set before me is here set down : Cold beef, Potato cake, White bread,
                            Apple pie, Brown bread, Milk, Butter, Pickles, Boiled rice, Cream cheese, Baked beans,
                            Cottage cheese, Blackberry jam, Cake, Blackberry pie, Doughnuts, And the bill was twenty
                            five cents ! I reproduce this bill of fare because it is characteristic of the Shaker
                            cuisine. The cooking is worthy of Delmonico's though the habitues of that restaurant might
                            regard it as limited in scope. For breakfast and dinner, however, eggs, tea, coffee and all
                            the fruits and vegetables of the season are added. The elder to whom I was referred as
                            capable of yielding information respecting the modes of life of his peculiar people, shook
                            his head when I began to ply him with questions, and said that he would not talk with me on
                            the Sabbath, but would do so on any week day. Time being precious I took the road again,
                            crossed the State line and was shortly at the head of a long, curving street, descending
                            into a lovely valley, bordered by large three and four story buildings, some of stone and
                            some of wood, that a stranger might suppose were factories or Summer hotels. This was Mount
                            Lebanon, and the buildings were the residences of the communities, or "families" as they are
                            called. Not a face was seen at the windows, not a man, woman or child was in the street.
                            Sabbath repose was over all. But as I passed the large meeting house services were under
                            way. At intervals I heard a loud and joyous song, and through the windows could see the
                            circle of worshipers as they half marched, half danced about the singers. The music was
                            singularly bright and inspiring, well defined in melody, simple in harmonic arrangement and
                            possessed of notable spontaneity and spirit. It was sung by a choir of voices as sweet as
                            any that one will find in our city churches, and the voices were not less sweet than hearty.
                            There is but one public service on Sunday in this church and as I was too late for it I
                            Cogged down the silent street to the house oc <pb n="63" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> cupiedbythe "north
                            family," where lives Elder Frederic Evans, most noted of the apostles of Shakerism. He is a
                            tall, grave, quiet man, on the shady side of middle life, dressed in the simple and sensible
                            garb of his associates and suggesting, when furnished with cloak and staff and wide brimmed
                            hat, one of the pilgrims who colonized New England. Such serious, earnest, thoughtful men
                            must the Puritans have been ; such simple, prayerful lives must they have lived. Conducting
                            me through the stone nagged lower hall of the building and across a garden where a fountain
                            of pure water bubbled among beds of richly colored flowers, he entered a building in the
                            rear and waved me into a room plainly furnished and of absolute cleanliness. There was a
                            table laden with books in it, several chairs and a stove, and opening from it a smaller room
                            with two beds and surrounded with a row of hooks for clothing. "Is it true, " I asked, "that
                            the Shakers are decreasing? " " Yea, " replied the Elder, " but only in proportion as other
                            sects are decreasing. Great religious movements occur in cycles or in periods. Just now the
                            forces acting on religion are centrifugal; by and by they will be centripetal. Each great
                            period carries us farther onward and higher up. We are learning all the time. Take
                            liberalism in religion. Universalism is permeating the orthodox churches, for the prophecy
                            that death and hell shall be destroyed is true. The Shakers held that doctrine of old, and
                            prophecies run parallel to law. We are spiritualists, and believe in the active work of
                            spirits after death. Jesus did not establish His church until He had been executed. Nay, we
                            do not take the Bible literally, for much of it is allegorical. The spirit of it is what we
                            look upon as the essential part. The true Bible is all Bible�ours, the Koran, the Talmud,
                            the Bhagvat, the Zend Avesta�the moral guides ot all peoples gathered into one. We look on
                            the Bible as a book of the morals, philosophy, history and science, pretty bad science�of
                            the Jews. Our souls used to be tired within us when the world's people came here and talked
                            and argued about three Gods in one and the atonement and all those old orthodox ideas.
                            Shakerism combines science, religion and inspiration; it is practical religion. We live as
                            families, each member doing his share of work, all mutually helpful; we discountenance war,
                            we do not go to law, we are celibates, monks and nuns without bolts and bars, we own all
                            tilings in common except the clothes we wear ; we do not vote, we use only yea and nay for
                            affirmative and negative, we aim to be just to all men, we do not swear, we are simple in
                            our lives, we eat but little flesh and none of the flesh of swine, and we keep our buildings
                            and persons clean. " " You think that celibacy should be generally practiced? In that case
                            the world would be speedily depopulated, would it not?" " We think all mankind should be
                            divided into two classes: Shakers and Quakers. We believe marriage necessary, but for the
                            continuance of the race only. All men and women cannot be Shakers, nor do we wish them to
                            be. The Quakers have returned to the original state of the church; they aim at honesty and
                            simplicity; they furnish the world with no paupers or ciiminals, and though they practice
                            marriage it is such marriage as can be sanctioned. The Shakers have spiritualized the Quaker
                            doctrines and have re-established the system of communism that was in vogue in the Church of
                            Jerusalem which lasted 300 years. The priests of that church were celibates u1 til the
                            fifteenth Gentile bishop introduced marriage. With marriage came private property ; with
                            private property came wrangling; with wrangling came war. Our communism is merely the
                            communism of the time of Moses. Private property in land is of recent date. It is a
                            pernicious thing. Henry George has been inspired to contest it. It is outrageous that one
                            man�that man, perhaps, a foreign aristocrat�should absorb thousands and even millions of
                            acres to himself, as is the case in the Western territories. If the Brooklyn Eagle were to
                            establish itself on the broad basis of land nationalization or limitation, it would become
                            the mightiest force for truth in this land. "</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="A little wrong done to another..." TEIform="index"/>A little wrong done to another...

                                fullness of his soul is what every Christian man and woman should be able to say in
                                reference to their own course through life, "We know that we are of God;" and we do not
                                distrust his knowledge in regard to the remaining part of the sentence, " and the whole
                                world lieth in wickedness. " On this point we have no doubt to express. To be in Christ
                                was to be alive, while those not in Christ were dead. To be in Christ was to be in
                                spiritual light, in the resurrection ; and those not in Christ were in darkness, in
                                their sins. There can be no place for vacillation in the mind that expects to rise
                                victorious over the world. To halt and make calculations, or to look back to catch the
                                last sight of what we have left behind, is attended with fearful risks. A most
                                remarkable case of this kind occurred in the early history of mankind, so says the good
                                book. It was the last view of the dear old city while it was in flames. Jesus has not
                                failed to make use of a corresponding warning. He evidently found human nature about the
                                same in Jerusalem and Galilee as Lot and the angels found it in the city of Sodom. It
                                was a strong inclination to maintain an interest in the old inheritance ; a strong
                                desire to know of the success of those whom we left in the company of the ungodly. With
                                a wonderful exactness these same conditions are repeated from generation to generation.
                                The disciples could not avoid being more or less surrounded by this bewildering state of
                                the mind, during their service of ministration to the people, and under this pressure
                                John gave utterance to the inspirational text,�"We know we are of God." This was the
                                morning of a new day, the beginning of a new creation. It was the dispensation of light,
                                and if there had been any light in the past it was at the present time, of but little
                                use. This may not be considered quite as liberal as we would like to have it in this
                                more advanced age, and a little modification might soften the conditions. The spirit of
                                evolution is in the air. The wise ones of the earth are making astounding revelations
                                and then as confidently enlarging on their predictions of the future. How successful
                                they may be in their demonstrations must be determined by the results. It certainly can
                                do no harm to anticipate better days for the race. The need is impera'ive. With this
                                will come a better quality of spiritual attainments, and a more glorious church of
                                Christ on the earth. Possibly the time may never be when all will be so gifted as to see
                                eye to eye on this subject, any more than it is seen <pb n="65" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> at present,
                                on the subject of morality or of Christianity. It would not be a very difficult work to
                                examine our hearts and from this determine the position that we occupy. If we could

                                strong evidence that the dawn of the millennium was near at hand. The simplicity of the
                                Christian life must commend itself to every one, as there can be no mysterious
                                conditions to effect it. It is the light of God that shines into the soul and cannot
                                possibly be confined to any one person or place, but agreeably to the testimony, it is a
                                light to all men. Goodness is godliness, and this examination will soon determine
                                whether our life is spent iu doing good to our fellow man, and making this earth a

                                class do not stop and spend their lives over a system of questionable theology, which
                                grows darker and darker the deeper it is penetrated. Life to them is a life in God,
                                hopeful, prayerful and full of good works. We may boast of the light in which we live
                                and yet we are not, even at this date, so far removed from the dark ages but that
                                thousands may be found who dwell with more intense interest on some mystic system of
                                theology for salvation, than they do on a life of practical righteousness. A word, a
                                syllable or even the addition or suppression of a letter may determine, in their minds,
                                the future happiness or misery of the soul. If any thing can be found in this that will
                                in the least render assistance in helping one on the road to righteousness, it may have
                                accomplished a good result. This however, is better, "To live soberly, righteously and

                            existence during the last fifteen years. Its head-quarters are at the historic fortress town
                            of Bender, in the neighboring government of Bessarabia, and its strange name is due to the
                            fact that its members�all of the peasant class�dig a grave in the floor (which is of dried
                            earth) of their habitations, or else in their gardens, and lie therein until overcome by
                            lmnger; in order, as they say, to commune with God, confess to him their sins, and examine
                            their past life. To enable them the better to do this the grave is covered with a wooden
                            box-like lid or canopy, having a door in it for ingress and egress, so that they lie in the
                            grave as in a coffin, and were it not for small apertures in the top part of it they would
                            run the risk of being suffocated. When the grave or "nest" is in the garden it is thickly
                            surrounded with bushes for the sake of greater privacy, and guarded by a savage watch dog to
                            prevent curious or impertinent people going near it. These sectarians pretend that in their
                            ecstatic moments, and when suffering extreme hunger, they see saints and devils, and some of
                            them are subject to hallucinations. Another peculiarity of the members of this sect is that
                            they hold as little conversation as possible with other people, or, in fact, with each
                            other; so that the kind of life which they endeavor to lead is akin to that of uncloistered
                            monks.�Day Star. The above representation of a new<pb n="66" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> religious sect, is
                            indeed, very peculiar. Possibly they may be exactly as here represented, and if so, they
                            only form one more order of the great and singular religious world. Should this new system
                            make its converts better able to practice the self-denial of which Jesus speaks, and to
                            establish in their homes a growing, practical righteousness, then most assuredly, they will
                            have attained to an honorable and worthy position. In the lukewarm state of the religious
                            world of today, where almost everything that pertains to this life is placed in advance of
                            the cross of Christ, where selfishness dominates and the poor arc cast out, it is not
                            strange that new orders should arise and entertain the belief that they are called of God.
                            And why not? Religious ''names and sects and parties" from the days of righteous Abel down
                            to the present date have been claiming recognition on the earth. It is a wonderful page in
                            the history of man, and to the thousands, a page that cannot be harmonized in their minds
                            with the principle of righteousness. As strange as it may seem, many of these religionists
                            have been more bloodthirsty than were the savages of North America. The zeal which they
                            manifested for their God was to increase their own selfishness and to dominate over the
                            souls and bodies of other men. Since the days of Jesus, the Prince of peace principles, this
                            selfish and cruel spirit has been called anti-christian, as being opposed to the loving
                            kindness which Jesus manifested for the children of this world. "All things, therefore,
                            whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them." This has
                            been laid aside, many times a.s not being a convenient rule by which to act. Fortunately for
                            us who walk upon the earth today, the civil arm of the government has obliged the Christians
                            to live more peacefully, and we may hope that these godly people of Russia may be privileged
                            to dig holes in the ground, and if they choose, sit in them and pray and sing psalms.
                            Prophets and teachers m-iy yet come from their ranks and preach a righteousness that will
                            condemn the world. We wish them all the peace and happiness their new order of life may

                                        common forms of disease. For example, a 'cold'�What is it? How is it produced,
                                        and in what does it consist? It is easy to say a cold is a chill. A chill of
                                        what part of the organism? We know by daily experience that the body as a whole,
                                        or any of its parts, may be reduced to a considerably lower temperature than
                                        will suffice to give a man a cold if the so-called chill be inflicted upon the
                                        surface suddenly. Is it, then, the suddenness of a reduction of temperature that
                                        causes the cold? It would be strange if it were so, because few of the most
                                        susceptible of mortals would take cold from simply handling a piece of cold
                                        metal or accidental contact with ice. The truth would seem to be, that what we
                                        call coldtaking is the result of an impression on the nerves to reduce the vital
                                        energy of nervecenters presiding over the functions in special organs. If this
                                        be the fact, it is easy to see why nature has provided the stimulus of a strong
                                        fit of sneezing to rouse the dormant centers, and enable them at once to resume
                                        work and avoid evil consequences. This explains why the worst effects of a cold
                                        do not, as a rule, follow up a " chill" which ex<pb n="67" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> cites much
                                        sneezing. Shivering is a less effective convulsion to restore the paralyzed
                                        nervous energy, but, in a lower degree, it may answer the same purpose. The
                                        shivering that results from the effect of a poison of the nervous centers is a
                                        totally different matter. We speak only of the quick muscular agitation and
                                        teeth chattering which occur whenever the body is exposed to cold, and evil
                                        results do not ensue. It follows, from what we have said, that the natural
                                        indication to ward off the effects of a chill is to restore the vital energy of
                                        the nerve centers, and there is no more potent influence by which to attain this
                                        object than a strong and sustained effort of the will. The man who resolves not

                                defer the kind look, or the gentle word, and instead of making those around us happy,
                                and having our own pathway fraught with blessing, we cause our friends and teachers much
                                anxiety through our carelessness, and neglect of duty. Sometimes a kind word may cause
                                an erring child to take a new step in the right, or perhaps develop new ideas of a
                                religious life, while the careless words too often spoken, may cause years of sorrow.
                                While we thiuk of all these things, let us resolve within ourselves to guard our lips
                                more closely, that the sins of a careless life may not be ours to bring sorrow in the
                                coming years. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Clark, Mary M." TEIform="persName"/>Mary M. Clark. Enfield, N.

                                        with good thoughts and right suggestions. But we took up our pen to commend the

                                Calendars has been fully established, and we have here something entirely new, in the
                                form of a Phrenological Calendar. It consists of a Pictorial, Symbolical, Phrenological
                                Head about 6 by 10 inches, beautifully lithographed in colors, on heavy card-board,
                                which is cut out in the shape of a head and face. A key to the Phrenological faculties
                                and a full Calendar for the year are conveniently attached to it. " We know whereof we
                                speak " when we say, that in the recent flood of attractive novelties there has been
                                nothing offered to the public equal, in actual value and proportional price, to this
                                very unique Calendar. It is an educator. Each day the peculiarities of ftiends will be
                                studied out, and the reasons why they are or are not "thus and so" will be discovered, a

                                Calendar, although about one-half the size of the original, is sold at the low price of
                                ten cents, an amount merely intended to cover the cost of publishing. This may be sent

                                within the reach of all, a familiarity with its contents will constitute a liberal
                                education to a degree that can be claimed for few other works in existence. Dr. Lossing,
                                the eminent historian and author, says of it: " I am strongly impressed with the great
                                intrinsic value of the work as a popular educator in a high department of learning. The
                                plan is admirable. Combining as it does a personal knowledge of an author with specimens
                                of his or her best literal-} productions, gives it an inestimable power for good among
                                the people." The work is being publishedjin parts of 160 pages each paper covers, at the
                                price of 15 cents, also in very handsome cloth-bound volumes, gilt tops, 480 pages for

                                    can possess, and everybody should cultivate them, especially young people. They are
                                    something money cannot purchase, for there is only one way of obtaining them, and
                                    that is by habitual practice. We know a good mother who used to say : "Always use
                                    good manners at home, and then when you go among strangers you need never be
                                    alarmed, for it will be perfectly natural to be polite and respectful. " This is
                                    true, and we have always thought that the best and easiest way to do anything right
                                    was to get into the habit of doing it right. Hardly anything is of more consequence
                                    than good manners and politeness in a boy or girl. They render those who possess
                                    them favorites with their relations or friends, and prepossess strangers towards
                                    them. Politeness costs nothing, and at the same time is of the greatest value.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I know of a deacon who made his fortune..."

                                    if the Bible were true at all. It is shust like takin' tagoot speerit out of ta
                                    pottle an' fillin' it wi' water. There's little pith in that. I'm told that he says
                                    that Jonah was an emblem of evil, and the whale was a publichoos, whaur Jonah was
                                    taken in, when, after three days, they had stripped everything off the sailor, they
                                    cast him out. It is most awfu'. Not but I'll deny there is deeficulties. It has
                                    always been a deeficulty to me hoo five men ate, or could eat three thousand loaves.
                                    I canna eat more nor ane at a time mysel, put it was that perhaps that was the
                                    meeracle. " " And did you, in all your travels, " said another, joining the attack,
                                    to the first who had been a sailor, "ever see a whale wad tak' in a man in sic a
                                    manner? That's a question the minister has often put to me, so it's c lear he
                                    doesn't believe in it. " "No, I never did! put maype the whales in Jonah's time were
                                    pigger than noo. But' onyway, I wish you to tak' the lesson the minister gied to
                                    John Farquhar, wha was aye asking him hard questions like the whale, and things like
                                    it " "What was that?" " ' Weel,' says he, 'if you had a goot pit o&gt; peef put
                                    down pefore ye when ye was hungry, its not on the pones ye would pegin first.
                                    There's fine, juicy, sappy things in the Bible, an' it would be better to be feedin'
                                    on them than to be worrying over dry bones like the whale. "�Scottish American.
                                    "What did the Puritans come to this country for?" asked a Massachusetts teacher of
                                    his class. " To worship in their own way, and make other people do the same,'' was
                                    the reply. �Sunday-schoolteacher: "Why did not the lions touch Daniel? " American

                                    " 'Cos they were British lions ! " What they fight tor.�The writer of the satirical
                                    pamphlet " John Bull and His Isle" has the following; The French fight for glory,
                                    the Germans for a living, the Russians to divert the attention of the people from
                                    home affairs : but John Bull is a reasonable, moral, and reflecting character. He
                                    fights to promote trade, to maintain peace and order on the face of the earth, and
                                    the good of mankind in general. If he conquers a nation it is to improve its
                                    condition in this world and secure its welfare in the next; a highly moral aim, as
                                    you perceive. " Give me your territory and I will give you the bible !" Exchange is

                                    Boy�"Dunno." Tourist�"Don't know? What! lived here all your life and don't knew the

                                    for his text the words: " These that have turned the world upside down are come
                                    hither also, " and presented his thoughts in the following order : "1st, The world
                                    is the wrong side up. 2ndv It must be turned the right side down. 3rd, We are the
                                    men that can do it." A story is told of a Protestant bishop in Atlanta, Georgia. He
                                    recently addressed a large assembly of Sunday school children, and wound up by
                                    asking in a very paternal and condescending way: "Now, is there a-a-n- y little boy
                                    or a-a-n-y little girl who would like to ask me a question?" After a pause, he
                                    repeated the question : "Is there a-a-n-y little boy or a-a-n-v little girl who
                                    would like to ask me a question?" A little shrill voice called out: "Please, sir,
                                    why did the angels walk up and down Jacob's ladder when th^y all had wings?" "Oh!
                                    ah, yes, I see," said the bishop, "and now, is there a-a-n y little boy or a-a-n-y
                                    little girl who would like to answer little Mary's question?" He prayeth best, who
                                    loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made
