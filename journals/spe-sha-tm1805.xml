                            C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Re-written by Henry C. Blinn. Mother Ann and the Elders carried before Eleazur
                            Grant. She was treated cruelly, and driven from Uew Lebanon. Mother Ann and the Elders
                            reached New Lebanon, Sept. 2, 1783. The day following, a mob began to collect before the
                            rising of the sun, and surrounded the house. Many of the enemies of the cross of Christ in
                            New Lebanon had learned of the arrival of the Believers, and were watching for the first
                            opportunity to express their malicious rage, on the return of the Elders to this town. The
                            mob consisted of two companies. One was directed by N. Fitch, captain of militia, the other
                            by T. Tanner, also a captain of militia. Others distinguished themselves and appeared much
                            more open in their abuse than the real leaders of the mob. Presenting a warrant, they seized
                            George Darrow and David Meacham, and charged them with having abused the daughter of David
                            Meacham. This criminal act was chosen to cover the real object, which was to get these two
                            men from the house, and have them placed in confinement. This would prevent them from
                            assisting Mother Ann and the Elders, who were stopping at the same place. They knew that the
                            mob would have much more power to act if the Brethren were not present, as David was a man
                            of great fortitude and influence, and George was the owner of the house. These two Brethren
                            were taken before a justice of Peace, Eleazur Grant, for trial, while David Darrow and
                            Richard Spier were left in care of the dwelling. David and Richard informed the mob of their
                            authority to protect the house, and expostulated with them upon the unlawfulness of their
                            conduct. These evil-doers felt no disposition to parley about the matter, as they were
                            determined on violence, without regard to law or justice. The Believers collected as fast as
                            the mob did, and went into the dwelling which was soon filled. The building had three doors
                            leading from the several rooms into the street or yard, and these were all guarded by the
                            Believers. The mob commenced their acts of violence by attempting to force a passage into
                            all the doors, at once. The Brethren forbid their entrance and again<pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> urged the unlawfulness of such proceedings, but in vain. Their conduct
                            was like ravenous wolves. They seized the Brethren, one after another, and dragged some of
                            them from the house, by their hair, with the most savage violence. Richard Spires was forced
                            three times from a door and thrown forcibly upon the ground, while others were caught up by
                            several of these savages and pitched head foremost, with great violence, into the yard, or
                            into pools of water. By this treatment their clothes were often much defaced or sadly torn.
                            After a conflict of about twenty minutes the mob obtained an entrance into the house. Mother
                            Ann and some of the Sisters were in one of the back rooms, iri*to which place these cruel
                            men attempted to enter. Several Brethren stood guard at the door, but after a severe
                            struggle the mob succeeded in breaking down the partition between the rooms, and seizing
                            Mother Ann, dragged her, in a shameful manner, through the house and threw her headlong into
                            a carriage. Two Sisters who followed her, however, succeeded in getting into the same
                            carriage. Eliab Harlow acted as their guide. They had not driven more than three or four
                            rods, when some one cut off the reins. Eliab then led the horse a short distance, when the
                            mob surrounded the carriage, and beating him off, guided the horse themselves, and drove
                            furiously to the residence of the justice, Eleazur Grant. A young man was heard to remark,
                            "These people have a power that we know nothing about. It is the power of God that carries
                            that woman along in such a manner." He then invited Prudence Hammond to ride with him, as
                            she was walking by the side of the carriage. Mother Ann cautioned Prudence not to be
                            enticed, but to maintain her faith, and endure to the end. While crossing a narrow bridge
                            upon the side of a steep bill, some reckless creatures from the body of the mob, attempted
                            to upset the carriage, but were prevented by o'je of the Brethren. The man who was the most
                            active in this business, fell down the precipice and received some slight injuries. The same
                            man attempted to pull Elder James Whittaker from his horse, among the rocks by the road
                            side. One of the Brethren, instantly caught Elder James and partially saved him from the
                            fall, which proved so severe as to fracture three of his ribs. It was with great difficulty
                            that he was able to proceed on his journey. The distance from the residence of George Darrow
                            to that of Eleazur Grant was one and one half mile, and during the whole of this journey,
                            the mob strove to keep the Believers back, by beating mid abusing them, but were not able to
                            effect their purpose. Mother Ann was very roughly forced into the house of Eleazur Grant and
                            her clothes badly torn, much to her own discomfort and sorrow. Elder James was strongly
                            persuaded to enter a complaint against Thomas Law for his abusive treatment to the
                            Believers, while on the journey, but was dissuaded by Mother Ann who counseled him to labor
                            to be comfortable and peaceable. The trial of George Darrow and David Meacham, occupied
                            several hours. The complaint which originated in malice and was prosecuted through envy,
                            ended in a sham or mock trial, and was evidently designed to cover greater deeds of
                            persecution and personal abuse.<pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> When justice Grant had
                            disposed of this case, he had Mother Ann brought before him and called upon her to hear the
                            indictment: but instead of attending to the false accusations brought against her by her
                            enemies, and which it was in vain to counterplead before a mob tribunal, and before an
                            unjust judge whose only object was to persecute the Believers, she reproved him for sitting
                            as a magistrate and suffering such riotous mobs to abuse innocent people, contrary to the 1
                            ,w, without attempting to suppress them. The Justice, unable to bear this reproof, ordered
                            his constable to take Mother Ann to a new house, which he was then building and put her
                            under keepers. Three men, in a very abusive manner led her to the new place of
                        confinement.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="What is life?" TEIform="index"/>WHAT IS LIFE?</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Perkins, Abraham" TEIform="persName"/>Abraham Perkins.</byline><p TEIform="p">This is a problem easily solved. Life is simply what we make it. To every
                            individual, it is that in which he has the greatest element, that to which he gives his
                            powers for support. He who conscientiously lives to the principles of truth and honesty as
                            he comprehends those principles, he whose motto and purpose is purity of heart is near to
                            God ; his life is saintly and holiness unto the Lord will be written upon all his
                            possessions ; even upon the bells of his horses and upon his pots and vessels for domestic
                            use, holiness unto the Lord will be inscribed. Not only the heart and every faculty of soul
                            and body are consecrated, but all that he claims of earth is dedicated unto the Lord, to be
                            used only in support of the principles which give birth to true righteousness. Hence to that
                            individual, life becomes Christian ; it is the resurrection, the Christ life. That soul has
                            received the baptism of the Heavens, becomes a subject of the Kingdom and joint heir with
                            Christ. By his influence, society is blest and the world is made better from his existence
                            iu it. Again ; he who seeks life on the animal plane, who gives support to that which
                            excites natural appetites and passions, that which merely gives pleasure or satisfaction for
                            the present or for time, such life is animal; no higher in the scale of creation than that
                            of the beasts that perish. Yea, his rank is even lower than that of the brute which has
                            respect to the law of nature, while the natural man ignores it. The life of such a man is a
                            blank ; he had better never been born ; his doom is execration ; and as his life helps to
                            lower all within the radius of his influence, he is a curse to humanity. From the throne of
                            God the fiat has gone forth, that man shall be judged according to the deeds done in th3
                            body. Judgment rests there. Thus it remains for man, as a free agent, to choose what his
                            life shall be ; and then without crying the burden of the Lord, accept the reward of his
                            labors as an act of justice. Enfield, N.

                            neglecting the same, and of rewards for obedience. I will now say something of his duty to
                            his fellow man ; Christ has put it in few words; "As ye would that men should do unto you,
                            do ye also to them likewise." This includes the whole duty of man to man ; but more may be
                            added of man's duty to God through his agency. Now in obedience to Christ I will be free to
                            speak not only to those without the fold but also to those within, who if they will, may
                            take it as a voice from<pb n="101" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> beyond the crystal river, as there
                            shall be as liftle of self in it as though I were on the other side; well knowing that every
                            honest soul who loves truth more than self, will be thankful to have any error corrected ;
                            all such will say: " Hew to the line let the chips fly which way they may." I will remark
                            that any person who writes on any subject which contains nothing but assumption and
                            conclusion, should know that he has proved nothing ; as no two postulates can prove anything
                            without a middle premise ; for instance we may say truly, that Jesus was the son of man, and
                            Christ was the son of God, with these two postulates nothing is learned or proven. It rather
                            beclouds the idea of who was and is the Christ, when by a middle premise il is made clear,
                            that the two are the same, and also who was and is the Christ. All lexicographers and all
                            persons agree, that the anointed means the Christ or the Messiah and that the man Jesus was
                            the Anointed, and consequently the Christ, which is proved as follows:� 1st. Sumption. Jesus
                            the son of man was and is the anointed. 2nd. Sumption. The anointed was and is the Christ
                            the son of G-od. Ergo. Jesus the son of man was and is the Christ the son of God. The
                            premise admitted, the conclusion is irresistible ; add to this, which is in itself
                            indisputable, we have the word from God that Jesus is his Beloved Son, and of Jesus that he
                            was the son of man, and was the Christ the sou of God ; also that of his apostles. Peter
                            declares that Jesus was the Christ, the son of the living God, the truth of which I have
                            demonstrated; and he also truly testified that God anointed him with the Holy Ghost and with
                            power. Acts x., 38. "And this Jesus whom I preach to you is Christ," Acts xvii., 3, and John
                            testifies that those who deny it are falsifiers. But in order to disparage his Messiahship
                            it is affirmed, without any show of reason, that God sent a second or third class angel to
                            anoint Jesus, and this, right in face of the fact, that God was present, and heard Jesus'
                            confession through John, who stood in God's order for that purpose, and there and then
                            proclaimed to John and to the world: "this (Jesus) is my beloved son in whom I am well
                            pleased." Thus Jesus who was the son of man, became the son of God, and his Christ or
                            Messiah. There is no possible way for this to be controverted. Then can it seem reasonable,
                            that God being present and well pleased with his Son, should send to the North Star or to
                            some remote part of space, for a second class angel to come and anoint him ? Not at all; the
                            idea is nothing but a chimera or idle fancy, for which proof is impossible. It is further
                            asserted that the time would come when we should " travel away from all Bibles." I will here
                            say that the Bible itself and all history has shown, that when any nation or people have
                            thrown the Bible aside with the law and the prophets as unworthy of thought, the curse of
                            God has followed them and when they returned to it, God's blessing came to them ; and when
                            Believers travel away from him who was the light of the world, and from his recorded word
                            which was from God, they will forfeit God's blessing and walk in darkness. It is further
                            stated by a teacher, that,<pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> he does not see why we are
                            bound to follow Christ any more than Christ was bound to follow Moses ; this is darkness to
                            be felt. 1 could see this in early years. The reason is plain enough; Christ was uot the
                            re-appearance of Moses, Moses was the type, Christ the antitype. Moses the shadow, Christ
                            the substance; the substance cannot follow the shadow. John the Baptist was the
                            re-appearance of Elias, whose commission was to turn the hearts of the people to the Mosaic
                            law from which they had backslidden. Christ's was to introduce to the world a higher law,
                            which would abrogate the necessity of the Mosaic, and raise mankind above all its demands,
                            and introduce God's spiritual law, and lay the foundation of his New Heavens and New Earth,
                            wherein righteousness should dwell. 'I his is reason enough why Christ and his followers
                            need not look to the Mosaic law for anything; they not being under the law ; and now that we
                            are blest with his second appearing we become his disciples by following him and walking as
                            he walked, we have not gotten something above Christ as Christ had above Moses, but the
                            re-appearance of the same thing, the same life and requirements ; were it something else, we
                            could not be called his followers, and have been preaching a false doctrine for the last
                            hundred years or more ; but we rightfully claim to be his followers, because we live the
                            life that he did. He has come as predicted ; as a thief in the night and in having his life,
                            we have the substance, and having the substance, need not the shadow ; and all is required
                            now that he ever did or can require of mortals, and all is given that could be were he here
                            in person ; heuce the material is unnecessary, and being unnecessary, can never take place
                            on earth. So I would say to Second Adventists and all others, cease to look up to the sky
                            for the shadow which you will never see since the substance is already here. Then let all
                            cease to look without and look within for, "Know ye not your own selves how that Jesus
                            Christ is iu you except ye be reprobates." 2 Cor. xiii., 5. And if he is within us, what
                            more can we ask, what more can we desire? All who look beyond him for something nearer to
                            God than he was, look in vain. Let us reach the point to which he attained before trying to
                            reach a higher or better condition. I feel safe in saying: the man never lived on earth and
                            never will who was, or will be more fully in the bosom of the Father than he was, nor more
                            ooe with Him. He is "the light of the world and all who follow him shall not walk in
                            darkness." His recorded word, which is the word of God will ever be a light to the world ;
                            but some deny that the Bible contains God's word. If a letter written by a man contains his
                            word, a book can contain the same, or can contain the word of God. If Christ spake the
                            truth, it is futile to deny it. He said the words he spake were not his, but were given him
                            of God ; then they were God's words. The case logically stands thus : 1st. Sumption. Christ
                            spake God's word. 2nd. Sumption. This word is recorded in a Book. Ergo. This Book contains
                            God's word. It is simple in any one to attempt to<pb n="103" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> resist
                            the conclusion, and it would seem for any one to dispute the fact that the Bible contains
                            God's word is simply to get clear of what it enjoins. Christ with his recorded word is the
                            foundation on which his church is built, and any one coming into it must first determine
                            whether it is of God or the work of man. That it is of God became evident to me in early
                            life, and I have observed from that day to this that the simple child-like obedieut soul was
                            always blest and prospered, while the reverse o( this always attended the self-willed and
                            disobedient. It was so in the type and it is, and will be the same in the antitype. When the
                            spirit through the Ministry feel a gift in any direction, intellect from no quarter should
                            interfere to change it. When this takes place it drops from God to man. It is then intellect
                            against intellect, the stronger carrying the day. In God's little army no person should ever
                            select a position or propose a gift for himself or herself, this would be from the.
                            intellect and no gift of God can originate in and come from the intellect; because intellect
                            when it is not directed by the spirit is always selfish and God cannot bless any selfish
                            thing. All that is partial or selfish is ungodly. Every gift of God is spiritual and comes
                            from Him through the spirit. Should a gift from the head appear unreasonable ; in obedience
                            we will be blest. It may be asked; suppose the Ministry should be moved by the intellect?
                            The responsibility rests with them and they may suffer, but the obedient will be blest.
                            This, in my own personal experience, has been thoroughly proven. Now, do not forget that
                            this voice is from beyond the river ; for my soul is as thoroughly absorbed in the well
                            being of all the camps of Israel as though body and spirit were already separated. We should
                            not forget that Christ's kingdom is a pure Theocracv, a government of God, while Democracy
                            is a government of man. The former is spiritual, the latter intellectual. The first belongs
                            exclusively to the upper floor, the other to the lower, and every vote cast in the upper, is
                            so much Democracy where it does not belong, making a hybrid, a mixture, that God cannot
                            bless. There can be no votes cast in a pure Theocracy ; all within the fold are free to make
                            their minds known to the order before them, then let the responsibility rest where it
                            belongs and be content. A great many communities have tried the experiment of mixing and
                            failed, and this will be the case of all who follow that course; all voting takes the power
                            from God and gives it to man ; takes it from the head and gives it to the heels. Now can you
                            pardon me for saying a word of my own earth life experience ? After becoming convinced that
                            this was God's kingdom and work in my youth, I never afterwards questioned any gift felt
                            best for me, nor hesitated to obey ; whether ordered to the rear or front, nor never laid
                            out a gift for myself, aad no odds how dark it seemed to my intellectual understanding, I
                            put my trust in God and gave my spirit, my intellect and faculties in child-like obedience
                            to the call, and was always blest of God, far beyond my expectation, both spiritually and
                            temporally, yea more than I could feel myself worthy of: thus realizing that it is the
                            obedient that shall eat the good of the land, not the diso-<pb n="104" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> bedient. I have never known any one to be either blest or prospered within the fold who
                            refused obedience to God's appointed order, and so continued. As it was in the type so it is
                            in the antitype. A small pebble slew Goliath who was defying the armies of Israel. King
                            David's beloved son who turned against his father, lost his life hanging to the limb of a
                            tree by the hair of his head, and so it was all through the type. Victory to the obedient
                            and defeat, mortification and disgrace was the reward of the disobedient. Thus we see in all
                            ages-of the world, that it is passion supported by intellect which has led astray. It cares
                            for the body and not for the soul. When Christ says take no thought for the body, intellect
                            says take first thought for the body ; when the spirit should absorb, if not the whole, the
                            first attention, then the body will be God-directed and all things necessary will be added.
                            1 am now asked : which is it, spirit or intellect that enables you to speak and write as you
                            do? Aus : Both, when self has no part in it, the spirit tells me what to say and write ; the
                            intellect tells me how to word it, to make it plain to others. Every syllogism, all logic is
                            intellectual, but good in its place ; thus we see that the offices of both are distinct all
                            the way through life. We are inclined to forget that all prosperity depends on God'�
                            blessing. Sometimeintellect will say, when adversity comes ; "Take the world easy, don't be
                            troubled, let it alone, if it is God's work He will take care of it, there's no use of
                            worrying about it, and then hit down unconcernedly and wait for God to do their duty for
                            them. Such are the ones that come in for the loaves and fishes, and bodily ease and
                            ".omforts, and unless they become quickened into life by the spirit, will sooner or later
                            fall away. It is not to be expected that God would prepare a place for such to come and
                            waste their time away in luxury, idleness and ease, and feast on his bounties. He calls
                            souls into his vineyard, where, in obedience to his order, they may "put their hands to work
                            and give their hearts to God ; receive their penny and save their suuls. Notwithstanding my
                            agreement with Philosophy that the attribute of matter is extension, and that of spirit is
                            thought, and that matter of itself cannot think ; it still seems evident that iutellect is a
                            material faculty; were it spiritual it would not antagonize the spirit. One thing is
                            certain, neither Philosophy nor Revelation has yet made known how we think. 1 unite with the
                            philosopher who said: "I adore the God by whom I think without knowing how I think." But
                            intellect is a pliant tool and seems to be as necessary to the sinner as the saint, to the
                            robber and murderer as to the detective and hangman. Passion makes a demand for some
                            gratification, the spirit objects, but intellect, reasons, excuses and tells how to obtain
                            it, thus antagonizing and grieving the spirit and leading the soul away from God to
                            unutterable ruin. It would seem that the brain has the faculty to think, as the ear has to
                            hear or the eye to see. Passion desires the eye to see what it should not, the spirit
                            objects, but intellect tells where and how the lust of the eye may be gratified, and so of
                            all other lusts. Thus being uncontrolled by spirit and united with passion it has caused all
                            the blunders of the world. Its reasoning caused the expul-<pb n="105" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> sioa frotn the Garden of Eden; and Aarou to make the golden calf; and the Israelites to
                            reject and cast away the Mosaic law and be scattered as shfiep without a Shepherd ; and King
                            David to do as he did with the llittite ; and Judas to betray the Savior ; and Peter to deny
                            him ; and the Jews to crucify him etc., etc. So let not God's Zion in this day be caught in
                            the same suare, but all be " Moved by the spirit of the Lord, And quickened by his holy
                            word." That God may hot only be in every act, but every thought of life, which will insure
                            his perpetual blessing on his people. But many seem so careless and indifferent as not to be
                            able to distinguish intellect from spirit; when we should ask ourselves aud each other in
                            all things : Is this of the intellect or spirit, and correct ourselves accordingly. I will
                            now say in closing that I feel myself somewhat as did the Apostle when he said; "Though I
                            preach the gospel I have nothing whereof to boast; for necessity is laid upon me. Yea woe
                            unto me if I preach not the gospel;" of Christ, which alone can save the world." 1 Cor. ix.,
                            16.

                            useless. A true and living faith, could not fail to bring forth corresponding works ;
                            because it would so influence the mind, that its outward manifestations would be in
                            accordance therewith, and it would be wholly unnecessary to inquire of the faith of such an
                            one, for their daily deportment would reveal it; whether it was to serve God. and to
                            overcome the power of evil in themselves ; or whether it was to give their best affections
                            and all their faculties to the service of the world. Whichever course they take, their faith
                            is clearly exhibited by the line of conduct they pursue. In this progressive age of the
                            world, while an ever increasing light reveals our inner life, more and more, exposing every
                            hidingplace of the adversary, and opening in a clearer vision (he perfect principles of the
                            gospel of salvation by a daily cross, should we bring forth the fruits of holiness, in our
                            lives and actions ; thereby glorifying God, by showing our likeness to Him. The Apostle says
                            furthermore "with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession
                            is made unto salvation," thus showing that it was not enough to have a right faith, based on
                            a firm and solid foundation ; but it must be carried into practice, by an honest confession
                            of all in the life, that was contrary thereto. It makes very little difference what we
                            believe, while it remains a mere passive belief, aud is never actualized in our life, for we
                            are told that the devils believe and tremble. In our life, we show our faith by our works,
                            by pursuing those measures which wTe have reason to believe will bring about the desired
                            result. The farmer sowo his seed in the spring-time in the full expectation of reaping an
                            abundant harvest, and thus in every department of life. Every one may have a belief in
                            something ; it may be, in the eternal principles of truth aud goodness, virtue and<pb n="106" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> religion ; but of what avail is it, if it does not lead
                            to a purer life, to higher aspirations, to nobler motives, and to a course of conduct
                            diametrically opposed to that which they would naturally lead ; or, they may, on the other
                            hand, from a lack of a conviction deep enough, or from force of circumstances or policy, or
                            some other motive, act directly contrary to that belief. In either case, their faith is
                            dead, beiog alone, without corresponding works to quicken it into life and action; and
                            therefore can never prove a saving and vitalizing power to the soul. This is what, we as
                            Believers are endeavoring to carry out; to make practical our religion, even in the smallest
                            minutiae of life ; showing our holy faith, by bringing forth the works of righteousness.

                            think can be explaiued to the satisfaction of those who wish to live a worldly life. A
                            worldly life is not a Christian life, by any means. Now, the question rests just here,�Which
                            do we choose to follow, Adam or Christ? To serve God or Mammon ? To deny ourselves of all
                            low, selfish gratifications and pursuits, or follow our own inclinations and cravings ? We
                            cannot serve both. We shall hate the one and love the other, or hold to one and despise the
                            other. If we love the world and hold to it, then let us go and live as the world should live
                            ; live honorably, be faithful in the service of Mammon, but do not call it Christianity. If
                            we choose to be Christians, let us come away from worldly practices and live as did Jesus.
                            Do we not know by that holy faith which is in us that a chaste life is most acceptable to
                            God? But, says one, How will we get along without generation ? How will the earth be peopled
                            ? Why, this is easy enough. Let those who have a call to help people the earth, do their
                            duty, according to the laws of generation, that when they are through with the generative
                            order, they may come into the work of regeneration and be born anew into higher elements.
                            Then, as they have previously been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, the true riches may
                            be trusted to their care. The natural order is proper for each class of creatures, to bring
                            forth its own likeness, but there is a higher sphere for man and woman, as intelligent
                            beings. It was intended that they should be brought forth by natural laws like other
                            animals, into animal life, but the spirit must progress upward. The spirit is immortal and
                            cannot be satisfied with material pleasures. Its aspirations are for a life superior and
                            angelic. Its love cannot be confined to earthly objects, only for a time ; it must soar away
                            into higher scenes. Partial love is Hot enduring. It may do in the absence of true love and
                            it may be, and doubtless is, better than no love. There is a universal love, an impartial
                            love, that worketh no ill to any one, that has no lust, or envy, or malice. A love that is
                            free and equal to all; a love that is founded upon principle, that never will desert the
                            needy ; not emotional, does not proceed from<pb n="107" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> passional
                            sources. A love that is ever kind, that sttives to befriend even an enemy if there be any.
                            Such is the love of good Believers in Christ. This love will bear cultivation. There is
                            nothing vile, neither shame nor darkness about it. This love satisfies the soul and will
                            accompany it beyond the tomb. It is the bond of union which unites pure spirits together,
                            and its links are coupled in that endless chain which reaches from heaven to earth where
                            aucrels hold a place, and all the faithful are joined to God their Creator. Watervliet, N.

                            of thought I came across the following list of short words which some linguist presents to
                            us affirming that the name of God is spelled in four letters only, in nearly every language
                            spoken. For example he says :� "� In Latin we have Oeus" " French Dieu " Greek " " Theos "
                            Hebrew Adin " German Gott " Scandinavian " " Odin " Swedish Codd " Syrian Adad " Persian
                            &amp;yi*a " Tartar " " Idga " Spanish Dias " East Indian " "J Esgi " Turkish " " Addi "
                            Egyptian Zent " Japanese Zain " Peruvian Lima " Wallachian " " Zene Now if to this list we
                            append the uames of some of the attributes of Deity it will readily be perceived that most
                            words implying goodness or greatness in the truest sense are generally composed of few
                            letters. Our Divine Teacher we know was wont to dictate his most vital lessons of truth to
                            his listeners of simply constructed sentences in words of one syllable only. Here is one
                            example�'� I am the way, the truth, and the life" another� "Why callest thou me good?"
                            uThere is none good save one and that is God. " The words way, truth, life and many others
                            from the same source viz., love, joy, peace, each present to our thought an idea of Infinity
                            and the primal principles upon which heaven itself is founded. Further, the names of all
                            great and grand objects in nature are presented to us in terms the most brief. For example
                            the sun, moon, stars, sky, sea, ice, snow, frost, dew, rain, hail and wind, are each<pb n="108" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> symbols of a mighty and stupendous power. Word pictures
                            are they, conveying to the imagination, as well as to the external senses scenes the most
                            vivid, inspiring, vast. Does not the word sun at once suggest boundlessness of light and
                            heat? the moon, splendor ; the sky, the stars, immeasurable distance�the sea,vastness, the
                            ice, piles of crystal light, the frost, the dew, unlimited surface, the rain, the snow,
                            bounty, while hail and wind and storm serve to remind us, that there is a power before which
                            our human strength is weakness, our finite wisdom, folly. Therefore, from the facts which we
                            have been considering, may we not infer that Brevity is not only the soul of wit, but the
                            culmination of strength in expressions of thought by means of language. At this point, a
                            practical hint for my benefit seems to flow from the point of the pen, and reads thus "Any
                            truth scientific or religious, conveyed in a pithy, concise manner, is oftenest welcomed by
                            editors in general, and oftenest read and longest retained in the memory of the reading
                            public. " With this fact, in full view, I must conclude my plea for brevity.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Stickney, Aseneth C."

It not
                            only implies the mere passively submitting to wrong; but also to return good for evil. To
                            suffer wrong rather than do wrong in itself is not enough. The practical Christian should
                            also be philosophical, reasoning from cause to effect; then he would see that resisting evil
                            with evil only increases the difficulty to be overcome ; and that two wrongs will not make
                            one right. He should evince a spirit of aggressiveness if the word may be used in this
                            sense, and whenever opportunity offers and also to seek opportunities for doing good. How
                            many national and individual disputes might have been settled amiably and the principle of
                            love and good will toward man practically illustrated if both contending parties had been
                            anxious to arrive at the truth, and willing to view the other side as impartially as they
                            were determined to vindicate their own. The old adage that one cannot quarrel alone was
                            brought to my mind while conversing with an advocate of war as a means of settling national
                            disputes. He asked this question in referring to our late (un) civil war, "What would have
                            become of our country if the North had maintained the position that you Shakers do, and
                            refused to rise in arms to save our countrvfrom dismemberment?' I replied firstly, that if
                            the contending parties had been actuated by Christian principles, the causes that led to the
                            war would not have existed. And secondly, that as one party cannot quarrel alone, and the
                            North had refused to resort to war, peaceful means would have been found to remove the cause
                            of contention, and the sacrifice of human beings to the God of War, and the untold misery
                            and suffering entailed upon the survivors would have been avoided. This style of reasoning
                            may seem foolish to the soul under the influence of the lower law, but to those that are
                            striving to obey the higher law, and are earnestly praying and laboring for the<pb n="109" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> fulfillment of that heavenly condition, '�Thy Kingdom come, thy
                            will be done on earth as it is done in Heaven," cannot but look with sorrow upon the wealth
                            and inventive power of the human mind that is used in developing weapons of destruction.
                            When, " Were half the power that nils the world with terror, Were half the wealth bestowed
                            on camps and courts, Given to redeem the human mind from error; There were no need of
                            arsenals or forts. " Sonyea, N.

                            Of time, touching the responsive harp-chords Within, and, blending with the tenderest
                            Sympathies of our hearts make divinest Harmonies. What thought consoling, that he, Our great
                            Teacher in the school of Christ, Suffered and sorrowed as we; was touched with The feelings
                            of all our infirmities. Not the command" Stand off I am holier Than thou," draws men to seek
                            the life divine, But the persuasive, attractive force of Love, which says,�" If I be lifted
                            up I Will draw all men unto me;" yea love is The mighty lever that is to uplift Humanity to
                            higher conditions ; Love is the penetrative power, that will Reveal the God-life within. The
                            lightnings Flash, the thunders roar are grand exhibitions Of nature's power; but how unlike
                            the sun; Its magnetic rays melt the avalanche And sends it coursing down the hill-side to
                            Refresh the vales below; how it breaks the Icy chains of winter, and bids earth put On her
                            beautiful garments and come forth In the glorious resurrection of spring. So the love of
                            God, exemplified in That full-orbed soul, the lowly Nazarene, That could weep with those
                            that sorrowed, comes to Us in the fullness of its Christ like power. With pitying tenderness
                            it melts the Obdurate heart and bids it " Go and sin No more;" with refulgent brightness it
                            lights The dim pathway of life, to the dark abyss Of death, with the consolation of hope And
                            immortality; and shines like a Flood of glory over the pearly gates Of Paradise. Jesus wept;
                            oh words most Precious! How like a ray of light they pierce The sophistries of our minds,
                            revealing The power of a great soul: how like a touch From angel fingers they impress us
                            with The height, depth and breadth of infinite love. O Beautiful Spirit! let not earth dwarf
                            Our souls from the exalted knowledge of Thy perfected glory; but come down to Us, descend
                            upon us in the form of A dove; infill our souls with thy holy Unction, that we may be as
                            ministering Angels; open the flood-gates of our hearts Till the measureless tide of sympathy
                            Flows out to all, that we may weep with those That sorrow; let thy impress be the seal Of
                            our discipleship; link us in that Great chain of universal fraternity; And bind us with thy

                            instructive and meritorious work in the main, says "Shakerism proves the imbecility of
                            attempting to inaugurate in the earthly present. a system of asceticism which only belongs
                            to our condition as pure spirits in the future." This fling comes with ill-<pb n="111" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> grace from one who claims to be a messenger of spiritual light,
                            to lead people to higher plains of action and true knowledge, and when she comes to see its
                            real bearing, 1 doubt not but she will wish it canceled. In the first place, it is not true
                            unless to those who stand aloof like the eontemners of spiritualism, and treat with disdaiu
                            that which they refuse to understand, or to take the trouble to investigate. In the second
                            place, it has the character of a stumbling block in the path of all travelers seeking iinal
                            attainments in the highest excellence. And by whom was this "' system of asceticism "
                            inaugurated but by that Divine Wisdom and Almighty Power, of which E. tl. B. claims to be in
                            some degree the medial instrument, and says on page 226, kt Our- part is to keep our lamps
                            trimmed and burning, and wait for the coming of the Heavenly Bridegroom whose name is�Divine
                            Order." It is true that mortals co-operated with the Almighty Power and Wisdom, and so they
                            did in the introduction to mankind of modern spiritualism, ^lse neither could have
                            b&gt;&gt;en established among men to stay. And the Wisdom which inaugurates, also
                            proclaims that it is ''the comiug of the Ueaveuly Bridegroom" iu union with the Heavenly
                            Bride, both of which are required to complete the Divine Order, and lay the fouudation on
                            earth for its never ending increase, as really as it requires two, a male and -a female, to
                            complete the earthly order, which in its original uucorrupted state, was typical of the
                            heavenly and Divine. That it should be inaugurated and continue sustained for more than a
                            century unrecognized and opposed in the midst of people who profess to wait for it with
                            lodging desire, is rather a "miracle" of power and wisdom quite the reverse of imbecility.
                            The imbecility of inaugurating here a system of asceticism which u belongs to our condition
                            as pure spirits in the future," is certainly far from proved to those who by conforming to
                            it, are enabled to overcome a carnal life within, which is ever at war with the spiritual,
                            and to purify the heart from those desires and practices which would otherwise unfit them to
                            dwell in the society of the wise, purified, ascended and harmonious intelligences inhabiting
                            exalted spirit spheres. Spiritualism in its propagative, proselyting character, with its
                            mediums and teachers going out from a free state and carrying with them the seeds of natural
                            liberty, is a pulverizer of human creeds and superstition, and destroyer of systems which
                            bind the conscience and limit man's spiritual development�is a levelor of conditions and
                            promoter of human brotherhood, and prepares the way for the Divine Order to expand. It may
                            be likened to Jacob's ladder, let down from the Divine Order in the heavens, and extending
                            through ail grades of reasoning intelligence to the lowest intellectual capacity. The seed
                            and substance of spiritualism is truth, which we welcome, while rejecting tbs chaff. Mt.

                                peace and righteousness, the predominating part. It is not sufficient that he make a
                                profession of sanctity above that o his neighbors or becomes the earnest advocate for a
                                special formula ot prayer. That may be all very well in its place to help fill up the
                                days and years of our pilgrimage, but its real worth cannot be rated very highly in the
                                cultivation of good, or in the eradicating of evil influences. Righteousness is
                                essentially the work demanded of all who name the name of Christ. This may never be
                                confined within the boundaries of any human system, let that be temporal or spiritual;
                                but it finds its legitimate sphere in all the life of man. It grows and flourishes, in
                                its beauty of holiness, in the rendering of email obligations, carefully, faithfully and
                                honestly, as well as in those of more importance. In the making of a basket, no less
                                than in the building of a house ; in the cultivation of a few vegetables, no less than
                                in the cultivation of the Public Gardens. Sometimes these lesser duties have been cast
                                aside as of secondary importance and an uudue anxiety manifested to reach after the
                                affairs of greater magnitude, with the unwarranted hope of superior benefits, to both
                                body and mind. The hope, however, is illusive. Whoever wins the race, must move along,
                                step by step, till he reaches the goal. Let us bear in remembrance the lesson of the
                                divine Teacher, so necessary to our success. " Thou hast been faithful over a few things
                                I will make thee ruler over many," and, If therefore, ye have not been faithful in the
                                unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches ? This lesson so
                                simple and yet so fraught with wisdom, covers our journey through life and will
                                accompany us into the City of our God. Our anticipation of the true riches should be an
                                incentive through which to become established on a good and permanent foundation. To the
                                growing mind of youth, as to those of more mature age, this lesson of faithfulness has a
                                direct application. It is in the heart of the virtuous youth, that the germs of purity
                                of spirit, chastity of body and integrity in every duty, finds a congenial resting
                                place, which will at a future date develop into a child of God, and into a preacher of
                                righteousness. Other precious ministrations from able teachers come readily to our aid
                                    as<pb n="113" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> we dwell with increasing pleasure upon the
                                Christian's duty. Let us ask ourselves the same question that occupied the mind of the
                                apostle James, as he illustrated to his hearers the impossibility of following two
                                masters, God and mammon: or " to be carnally minded" which i; is death," and at the same
                                time attempt "to be spiritually minded," which " is life and peace." " Can the fig tree,
                                my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet." The
                                Apostle brought out a lesson in this illustration that every one can'readily comprehend,
                                and by which he may compare his own life. It would be extremely foolish for any one to
                                attempt to obtain figs from a grape vine, and equally as foolish to think that the
                                fruits of righteousness will be found in a life of unrighteousness. God's word is one of
                                mercy and yet of strict justice. Childhood, youth and mature age are alike confronted
                                with this irrevocable law. ;t Whatsoever a man soweth that also shall he reap." To this
                                decree there is no palliation. Even though the " sentence against an evil work is not
                                executed speedily," in all cases, it must assuredly come, for whatsoever a man soweth
                                that also shall he reap. Having this fact so clearly presented to us, as it is by the
                                minister of God, the apostle, is there not an imperative duty ever present with the true
                                disciple, to make his own life harmonize with the life of Christ? Indeed, it should be
                                his meat and his drink to work earnestly and faithfully in the interest of other souls,
                                that they may be harvested from the elements of the world and induced to enter into the
                                kingdom of God on the earth.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Notice" TEIform="index"/>NOTICE.</head><p TEIform="p">Will those having copies of "The Shaker," for the years 1876, 1877; and of "The

It compromises both appearance and
                                        vitality. A stooping figure is not only a familiar expression of weakness or old
                                        age, but is, when caused by careless habits, a direct cause of contracted chest
                                        and defective breathing. Unless you rid yourself of this crook while at school,
                                        you will probably go bent to the grave. There is one good way to cure it.
                                        Shoulder-braces will not help. One needs, not an artificial substitute, but some
                                        means to develop the muscles whose duty it is to hold the head and shoulders
                                        erect. I know of but one bull's eye shut. It is to carry a weight on the head. A
                                        sheep-skin or other strong bag filled with twenty or more pounds of sand is a
                                        good weight. When engaged in your morning studies, either before or after
                                        breakfast, put this bag of sand on the head, hold your head erect, draw your
                                        chin close to your neck, and walk slowly about the room, coming back, if you
                                        please, every minute or two to your book, or carrying the book as you walk. The
                                        muscles, whose duty it is to hold head and shoulders erect are hit, not with
                                        scattering shot, but with a rifle ball. The bones of the spine and
                                        intervertebral substance will soon accommodate themselves to the new attitude.
                                        One year of daily practice with the bag, half an hour morning and evening, will
                                        give you a noble carriage, without interfering a moment with your studies. It

                                        be followed safely by all persons. Health depends largely upon the diet Some
                                        people cannot eat newly baked bread: others cannot eat it when stale. Much fresh
                                        meat, with some constitutions, induces fulness of the head and a feverish state
                                        of the system, because it makes blood too fast. It should therefore be
                                        discarded, and a litrtle salt meat or fish, if the appetite craves it, with
                                        fresh fruit and vegetables, will be found, probably, to be just what the system
                                        requires. In truth, with health, as in many other things, each person must be a
                                        law unto himself. In acute or intricate cases, physicians are necessary, but in
                                        many minor matters they cannot decide. It is true that what is "one man's meat
                                        may be another's poison," and a little poisoning, now and then, seems
                                        indispensable to teach us our individual physical, as well as mental
                                        idiosyncrasies. Experience thus gained, if not carried to such an excess as to
                                        prove too severe a schoolmaster, will be of more value through life than all the
                                        doctors in Christendom� with all respect be it spoken�besides saving many a long
                                        bill at the drug store. Children should be taught at an early period in life to
                                        avoid the use of condiments. Their food should be plentiful, but simple. Many a
                                        mother will give her very young children rich food�pastry, cake and sauces and
                                        condiments of the most indigestible or fiery kind�and tell you her children are
                                        healthy, and nothing hurts them. Perhaps the injury is not apparent at first,
                                        but it will not be long before headaches, indigestion of the most serious
                                        character, dyspepsia, fixed for life, disproves the truth of her opinions.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Hall's journal of health" TEIform="index"/>Hall's Journal of

                            soul. His gaunt form, hollow cheek, sunken eye, and angularity of features, are the
                            expression of his mentality. His head is broad in the region of acquisitiveness and
                            secretiveness, and slopes backward in the upper frontal dome, where benevolence should nobly
                            rise, as if to look forward to the sphei'e oi' its duties and activities in the great world
                            of need. I had almost said that reverence was quite deficient, but one thing he venerates,
                            and that is gold ; it is his God, idealized and worshiped iu the form of dollars, as truly
                            as was the molten calf of the ancient Israelites. As a child, he was selfish and
                            accumulative in disposition, and all through his long life, the one thought has haunted his
                            waking and sleeping hours, that of hoarding money. Every cent has been eagerly grasped and
                            grudgingly parted with, even for the barest necessities of existence. He shivered in rags,
                                while<pb n="115" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> secretly gloating over heaps of shining metal,
                            which he counted again and again, and laid away in obscure hiding places of the miserable
                            dwelling which he inhabits ; ever wary and suspicious lest covetous eyes should discover the
                            place of his treasure. And so he has lived, warped in mind and soul; fruitless in every good
                            virtue, that makes life beautiful, and mankind happj ; for he never had a generous thought
                            toward another, (if we judge by his deeds ;) never extended the hand of charity to the needy
                            and unfortunate, never blessed his own soul by blessing others. And when he goes the way of
                            all mortality, he will undoubtedly feel as did the selfish woman, when the physician told
                            her that her time of dissolution was near. "What, die and leave my gold, my precious
                            treasure ? never ! and she expired with a death grasp on all she could hold in her hands. So
                            he w 1 deeply lament that he must leave it all behind, the accumulation of a life time, to
                            be scattered by lavish hands ; that which he might have used in blessing the needy and
                            enlarging his own soul. It is indeed his only treasure, for he has garnered none in the
                            world to which he teuds. He will find no bright flowers that have blossomed from kindly
                            deeds ; no sweet fountains that have welled up from heartsprings of goodness ; no happy
                            mansion reared of the white stones of truth chiseled and polished by untiring service in the
                            good of humanity. He lacks all these adornments in his immortal home, because his earth life
                            has not been spent aright. Loug years may elapse after he has doffed the mortal, before he
                            awakes to a consciousness that there is something better to live aud strive for, not until
                            then will he begin to rise superior to barren surroundings, and through suffering and
                            repentance, seek to tread those nobler walks, where happified and exalted spirits fulfill
                            their unselfish mission of continual service to others. But it is far better to begin that
                            labor here, so that we may look back with satisfaction on our earthly career. Not the riches
                            we have left behind, but the treasures we have sent before, will recommend us to the society
                            of the good and just. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            silent it speaks with a force that cannot be unheeded by those who come within the range of
                            its influence. The name of Jesus may be extolled from the Pulpit iu words of surpassing
                            eloquence which are listened to by thousands of appreciative hearers ; but let the most
                            humble disciple oi Christ manifest holiness, by obeying the principles which constitute the
                            Christ life ; truly learning of the Teacher to be meek and lowly in heart and he wields an
                            influence for Christ which all the eloquence and wisdom of this world cannot equal. Best of
                            all sermons is the one of a holy life ; indeed without it all other preaching is useless and
                            vain. The possessor of a spotless life and name, void of offence toward G-od and man is in
                            possession of the true riches ; and to such the blessing of heaven comes in soul refreshing
                            showers, as the dew and rain to the thirsty earth ; distilling joys that are enduring
                            because descending from the wellsprings on high. Blessed beyond all other considerations or
                            attainments is the influence of a holy life. Canterbury, N.

                            the common on-going of domestic and social life which deserves nothing but to be instantly
                            and forever forgotten. Yet it is equally amazing how large a class seem to have no other
                            business but to repeat and perpetuate these very things. That is the vocation of gossips, an
                            order of society that perpetrates more mischief than all the combined plagues of Egypt
                            together. You may have noticed how many speeches there are which become mischievous only by
                            being heard a second time; and what an army of both sexes are sworn to see to it, that the

                                life," a crown more valuable than all the jeweled ones of earth. There is no promise of
                                reward without faithfulness. " It is only those who are faithful in a few things who
                                will be faithful over many things; only those who do their duty in every-day and trivial
                                matters who will fulfill them on greater occasions." By doing little things well, you
                                will be trusted with more important ones. ."Well begun is well half done." Life is made
                                up of little things, and they seem such very small things; but who can tell for how much
                                they may count in the end? Attention to little duties just as scru pulously as to great
                                ones, must be the practice. Present duties well performed insure real happiness. There
                                is an opportunity given you to perform every duty, and it is only by daily and hourly
                                devotedness that you can progress heavenward. For every departure from duty you have to
                                pay in suffering. There is so much comprised in being faithful. You must "put your hands
                                to work and give your hearts to God," and a reward will be yours according to your
                                merits. It requires energy and courage to be faithful at all times, even though you have
                                started with every strong resolution. Often you grow careless and are drawn aside by
                                sinful pleasures, which if indulged in become hindrances to self-denying work. Sometimes
                                your feet grow weary and your hearts faint, and you finally feel tempted to give up the
                                struggle for the promised crown. A crown of life is too valuable to lose. You should
                                have faith in the cross-bearing work and then devote your best energies to it, if you
                                would succeed. You should trust in God for help and guidance, and let no evil influence
                                lead you astray. You must have the courage to stand firm in trials and opposition,
                                turning neither to the right nor the left. The Christian's crown "is a joy forever."
                                Spare no pains to win it. You must win the crown before you ivear it; win it by
                                selfdenying struggles. No crown without the cross. Master self. Be steadfast, true.
                                Confront difficulties with patience and perseverance. Neglect no duty and never be
                                discouraged. " Let your polar star be duty and your motto truth and right " Soon may end
                                your earthly labors. Too soon for duties left undone. With face heavenward discarding
                                all wrong, be faithful in duty while active and strong.

                                        to know then? First, to be true, to be genuine. No education is worth any thing
                                        that does not include this. A man had better not know how to read, he had better
                                        never learn a letter in the alphabet, and be true and genuine in intention, in

                                        in life. Above all things, teach the boy that truth is more than riches, more
                                        than culture, more than earthly power or position.. Second, to be pure in
                                        thought, language, and life, pure in mind and both . x\n impure man, young or
                                        old, poisoning society where he moves with indecent ,-t:&gt;r-kv- and impure
                                        example, is amoral ulcer, a plague ^pot, a leper, who ought to he treated as the
                                        lepers of old, who were banished from society, and compelled to cry "Unclean, "
                                        as a warning to save others from the pestilence. Third, to be unselfish, to care
                                        for the feelings and comforts of others; to be generous, noble, and manly. This
                                        will include a genuine reverence for the aged and things sacred. Fourth, to be
                                        self-reliant and self-helpful, even from childhood; to be indu trious always,
                                        and self-supporting at the earliest proper age. Teach them that all honest works
                                        are honorable, and that an idle, useless life of indolence in others is
                                        disgraceful. When a boy has learned these four things, when he has made these

The extremely high prices at
which the IXL inks have been sold
ever since their introduction into

their use to the most critical or what

reduce the prices as to make them
accessible to the masses.
The Violet and Red are recommended above all other inks for

.from 5 to 50 times less solid matter than the best of other fountain
inks in general use.
It may seemincreditable that any
ink used in fountain pens actually
contains as much solid matter in one
gallon as can be obtained by evaporating the water from 50 gallons
of the IXL Violet or Red. And
yet the fact may be easily demonstrated by any one. This explains
why 9 out of 10 of all Fountain Pens
ever sold have been abandoned as
useless, or have done interior
service.

POLITICAL PULL
Is a rather uncertain thing to depend upon as a
basis for obtaining the necessaries of life. With the
frequent changes of party somebody is sure to get
left, so that on the whole any man of brains and
ability is really fortunate if, by missing a fat public
job, he is compelled to take up some such business
as an agency for Dr. Foote's "Plain Home Talk,"
which is sure to be a good paying business as long
as he will devote himself to it. A really popular
medical book such as " Plain Home Talk" sells at
all times and in all places, and often the best ground
for an agency is that which has already been plowed
over once or twice by an agent. There is room for
all who will apply to the Murray Hill Publishing

HUMAN   NATURE.
If you are interested in the study of Human'Nature and Character, and the
Improvement of yourself and others in any way, we would like to call your attention
to the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, a well-known magazine
which has been published for fifty years, and is devoted to all that will improve men
Mentally, Morally, or Physicdlly. It is the only magazine of its kind published in
this country, and in every way the most important.
The specialty of PORTRAITS of distinguished, or notorious persons, 
with studies of their character and sketches of their lives, which has always been a marked
and attractive feature of the Journal, will still lead the host of good things prepared
for the reader.
No one can study themselves or others anc? not be greatly benefited by the
results, and therefore no one can afford not to read the Journal. A knowledge ot
Human Nature would enable us to understand ourselves and others and to avoid
many of the disappointments in life.
