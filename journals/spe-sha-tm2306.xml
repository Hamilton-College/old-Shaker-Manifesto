A journey to the Land of Canaan.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Gates, Benjamin" TEIform="persName"/>Benjamin Gates.</byline><p TEIform="p">Having been many times kindly invited to visit the little band of Canaanites, I determined to
                            set aside the duties that had heretofore prevented me and go to them. April 2nd, 1893, was
                            selected as being the best time to make said visit; accordingly at nine o'clock on Sabbath
                            morning I left Mt. Lebanon Church Office for that purpose. After a short drive of about
                            three miles I arrived at the home of our dear friends, feeling quite weary and sore from the
                            jolting over rough roads, that were filled in many places with drifts of snow and cakes of
                            ice. As I approached their dwelling I heard beautiful singing. The family had just commenced
                            their Sabbath morning meeting, and the whole house and door-yard sounded and resounded with
                            the strains of their heavenly songs such as I have seldom or never heard before. After a
                            short rest in the reception room, Br. George Clark conducted me into the meeting room. There
                            my eyes beheld thirty-four angels in mortal form�lovely consecrated souls who had
                            congregated for the purpose of worshiping God, also an innumerable company of angel visitors
                            from the immortal laud. Br. Jonathan Wood, Edward Fowler, Daniel Sizer and many others were
                            recognized by the spiritual visionists. During the meeting heaven's best gifts descended
                            freely, and each member had something to offer to add to the edification and blessing of all
                            assembled. An intermission followed in which we enjoyed an abundant and wholesome repast,
                            together with a short introduction to each Sister and Brother. Again we gathered in the
                            Chapel for a social visit. One hour and a half was most agreeably spent in listening to the
                            reading of original articles, hearing the lovely songs of Zion and in pleasant conversation.
                            We were delighted with the children's recitations which were not only interesting but very
                            instructive. Even the smallest children had committed to memory an amusing anecdote or an
                            item of history all calculated to* add cheer and pleasantry to each moment. I realized what
                            it was to sit in heavenly places and to feel the joy of heaven. What more could any soul
                            desire ?<pb n="130" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 180 THE MANIFESTO. It was with reluctanc? thtit I parted with

                            compelli d to obey, but often, yea often I have remembered that heavenly meeting. It was
                            indeed one of the loveliest and greenest spots upon which I have ever rested in all my

Viewed from the
                            mount of spiritual exaltation, the perturbations and apparent retrogressive movements of
                            hiir man society are but the ebullitions of the surface. The mighty current of life in its
                            entirety is moving onward and upward. If it were possible to be otherwise, then the hopes
                            and ambitions of the individual soul for better conditions would be futile, a false light, a
                            hollow mockery to the promptings of the higher life; and the struggle for advancement would
                            be a striving against fate. But not so. The fiat has gone forth, "Let there be light." To
                            the student of history in reviewing the conditions of life ever since the dawn of historic
                            time, the advance has been slow, but permanent. Where darkness once brooded upon the face of
                            the waters in both a material and spiritual sense, now the illumination of positive
                            knowledge on questions pertaining to the life of man lighten up the dark chambers and render
                            the problem of life easier of solution. We see many incongruities, false conditions that
                            exist in our modern, social life, and at times are inclined to become pessimistic, but when
                            compared with centuries past, they show a marked increase on the line of permanent
                            advancement. "Upward the course of empire must take its way." No antagonistic forces will
                            for a moment be recognized, as its ultimate destiny is marked out, and that is, eternal
                            progression. The feelings of the philanthropist are touched and deeply grieved at man's
                            inhumanity towards man, but what of the time when those feelings were unknown to the race?
                            The fact of their being felt is proof positive that man is on the ascending scale. Yea, the
                            brotherhood of man is coming. So courage, comrades! "I see a light, a light on the distant
                            horizon, its rays illumine the path of the pure and betoken the coming morning." Those
                            glorified souls that the revelator saw, while in vision he viewed the progressive work of
                            redemption, that had come up out of deep waters of tribulation, is typical of the ultimate
                            destiny of the race. Is there a sane person that to-day would be willing, if it were
                            possible, to go back and live in even the best society four hundred years ago? The time
                            between now and then is so short that comparisons can be drawn. At present the physical
                            forces in nature are being grappled with a firm and determined spirit; and the injunction is
                            being literally obeyed, to "go forth and subdue the earth." When the work of physical
                            subjection has been in a lai'ge measure accomplished and the earthly elements are<pb n="131" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 131 moving in concord with the divine spirit in the race, then
                            the unfolding of the spiritual part will advance with increased rapidity. Among all the vast
                            material that has accumulated through research into the antiquity of the race that is
                            clouded with doubt and uncertainty, two facts stand out prominently and in bold relief,
                            entirely removed from the realm of questionable ideas. First, the fact that through the most
                            careful and painstaking geological investigations, the race of genus homo has existed on
                            this planet for a time so remote that it is difficult if not impossible to compute the time
                            in years. Second, that the start was very low in the scale, so low that the most degraded
                            specimens of the race at present can not be compared with them. But the inspiration for
                            advancement was there though latent, and was slowly but surely through tribulation asserting
                            its right to move upward. And who can grasp the idea or comprehend the possibilities in
                            store for future generations? The superiority over the present will be as the transcendent
                            beauty of the noonday sun eclipses the reflected light of the moon. Oh that we could all
                            have our spiritual sight opened as the young man did while with the prophet on the mount and
                            realize that they that are for us, are more than those against us; and tnat every one who
                            lives the truth and is striving with an honest heart for the advancement of the brother and
                            sisterhood of the race, is surrounded by the hosts of heaven, and holy angels of light and
                            power are hourly ministering to their needs. The advancement has been in cycles or the
                            rising of sub-races to appoint when their vital forces were exhausted, and they apparently
                            receded or were absorbed in younger and more vigorous ones, they in turn conserving what had
                            been gained and advancing onwai'd and so upward to the present time. Shakers, N.

                            : "he died and slept with his fathers." This stated not only the fact that their bodies were
                            deposited in the tomb of their ancestors, but also the view entertained in those early days
                            of the nature of death; it was regarded as a sleep, an endless repose. The ide'a of the
                            immortality of the human soul was then<pb n="132" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 132 THE MANIFESTO. almost
                            unknown. Job asked the question : "If a man die shall he live again?" By means of reasoning,
                            the exercise of hope and faith, and the inner light that came to him, he could answer that
                            question in the affirmative. But not till the coming of Jesus Christ was the future life
                            fully revealed. After the crucifixion he appeared again and again to his people and gave
                            indisputable evidence that death had no power over him, that the grave could not hold him.
                            This was the direct confirmation of his teachings and prophecies. "Because I live ye shall
                            live also. I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am you may also be. I am in the
                            Father, the Father is in me, and I in you." Here we see the fulness of the redemption
                            revealed, which is the complete union of1 the soul through Christ the mediator, with God the
                            Father and Creator of all. This blessed consummation is the final destiny of those who have
                            entered into eternal life here in this world, by faith and prayer and sincere repentance.
                            "He who will confess me before men, him will I confess before my Father ; he who denies me
                            before men, him will I deny before my Father." Some visible act, some evidence of a desire
                            for a better walk of life and conduct than the merely natural, is required. "If a soul lift
                            but its little finger it will finally be saved," said Mother Ann. There are people among
                            savages and heathen who have never heard of Christ, and who are yet merciful, honest,
                            truthful and pure above the standard of their nation; they follow the inner light and are
                            accordingly accepted. But much more is expected of those who have heard the gospel message ;
                            for to whom much is given, of him much is required. And still the fact remains that however
                            earnest a man may be to become righteous in all respects he will fall and fail many times.
                            The record of the lives of the best of the human race, and our own experience among those
                            whom we honor, trust, and look up to as examples to be followed, prove that there is no such
                            thing as moral and spiritual perfection iu the mortal state. Lawgivers and prophets, saints
                            and apostles, to whose devotion the world is so greatly indebted, all failed at times to
                            live up to what they preached and taught. Look at Peter. Jesus was about to leave the world,
                            but told him he could not yet follow him. "Why can't I follow thee now?" says Peter; "I will
                            lay down my life for thee." Before morning this enthusiastic man three times disclaimed all
                            knowledge and acquaintance with Jesus. Such erratic conduct is not uncommon. No man,,
                            however good and correct his conduct has been, is fitted to enter after death at once into
                            full communion with God. There is a further work to be done. Like a plant that is removed to
                            a more congenial soil for growth and expansion, is the soul whose germ of spirit has
                            unfolded into some degree of life on earth. There are, no doubt, dead souls who never get
                            beyond the grave; who have refused to accept Christ under whatever name or in whatever form
                            he approached. Let us hope that there are not many.<pb n="133" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 133
                            While it is utterly unscriptural to conceive an endless state of torment for unrepentant
                            sinners, it is equally irrational to think that all, no matter what their lives have been,
                            will be saved and live. Immortality is conditional. Jesus Christ came to bring eternal life;
                            he imparted the knowledge that leads to it. He is the Savior still. For, were men to be
                            judged by Divine Justice only, all would be condemned; no soul could live. But Divine Love,
                            represented by Jesus, interposes the plea of mercy; for he was man himself; he knew what was
                            in man. Then the soul is given another opportunity ; the law of life and death is placed
                            before it again, and removed from the fetters of the body, no longer subject to the
                            attractions of worldly pleasures, the evil influences of sin and corruption in society, of
                            hypocrisy in the church, it may obtain the gift of eternal life. This is progress. The souls
                            of men entering spirit life are just what they were in earth life ; death has not changed
                            them ; the character and individual propensities are the same. But, released from the burden
                            of clay, the sensibilities and perceptions must necessarily be finer, regret for past
                            transgressions must be keener, remorse on account of slighted opportunities more acute, the
                            suffering and agony which all genuine progress involves, must be more intense. Hence the
                            supreme importance of using the knowledge which the gospel of Christ imparts aright. Guided
                            by its spirit earth life becomes most successful, affords the highest contentment and
                            accomplishes the greatest good ; although this is a mystery .unapprehended by the natural
                            mind. Death becomes a mere transition ; the new life opens as a new day, without shock or
                            terror. What is more reasonable than to suppose that our departed brother has been met by
                            friends, Believers, whom he has known and loved; that they have made him welcome to a place
                            among them; that they know the needs of his soul and are able to supply them ; that they
                            will endeavor to lead him, surely and gently, to higher planes of thinking and living! I
                            believe that this will be the case with him; I hope that every soul may find true friends
                            and helpers in the world to come; I pray that it may be so with me. West Piitsfleld,

                            are, and whither we are drifting? Do we realize our condition? Are we aware of the danger
                            that lies before us if we continue our present course? Are we not on the brink of a
                            dangerous precipice, caused by doubt, infidelity, disbelief, lukewarmness, ease and personal
                            comfort? Are we not satisfied to let present conditions remain, so long as we are not
                            disturbed, and left alone in our ease, and even go so far as to say, What is it to me? If
                            the Lord has begun a work that He can not carry out, are we to blame? Be careful, be not
                            deceived, God will not always be mocked by men. Brethren and Sisters, the time has come for
                            us to look our condition square in the face. Our ranks are depleting; the aged are few that
                            are left, and these will soon be called to the spirit land, and who will fill the vacuum?
                            Who will stand in the gap? Confession is good for the soul. We may as well confess our
                            Community faults. If it is good for one soul it is good for all, and our first step toward
                            restoration. When did Zion flourish? When she obeyed the laws and orders that were given for
                            her protection and safety, both temporally and spiritually. When did Zion begin to wane?
                            WThen she began to disobey these laws and orders, and by degrees to enter the vortex of
                            Babylonish ideas and beliefs as well as unbeliefs of our day and time, and this babel of
                            ideas and doctrines has<pb n="135" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 135 caused the question, What
                            are our principles, what is our faith and belief? It may seem well to the carnal mind, to
                            roam in the flowery realms of doubt and disbelief, and frame a model Zion after Satan's
                            likeness and image, where the flesh and spirit can join hands and throw aside the statutes
                            given by Christ and Mother, as unnecessary in this day of progression and progressive ideas,
                            and thereby go to heaven on flowery beds of ease. Be not deceived, this is the same spirit
                            that said to Adam and Eve, "Thou shalt not surely die:" that tempted Christ, when he offered
                            him all the kingdoms, that drove Mother Ann out of England and persecuted her while here.
                            Beloved Brethren and Sisters, the time has come to clear the deck and prepare for action. We
                            have come to the time and place, when the still small voice has become so feeble that it can
                            not be heard. Unbelief, doubt, lukewarmness, indifference and brazen defiance to the laws
                            and orders given for our protection, like Goliath of old, defy not. only the laws and
                            statutes, but the very anointed. Where is the David that has the courage to come forth and
                            slay this monster of self-conceit that defies the laws and orders given for Zion's
                            protection, safety and travel? Come forth ye watchmen on the walls of Mount Zion, and in
                            thunder tones proclaim, the day of thy restoration has come O Zion, and thy deliverance is
                            near at hand. Confess and repent, should be our motto. Come to the rescue every valiant
                            volunteer in Zion, and join the army of the Lord and help slay this defiant Goliath, he has
                            become strong with his lies and deceit and would even deceive the very elect. Stand not mute
                            nor dumb, ye indwellers of Zion. "Cry aloud, spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet, say
                            unto Zion, thy God reigneth." Let none cry peace while this destructive spirit remains. "Let
                            the dead bury their dead," was the voice of him who is our standard-bearer. Let us kindle
                            anew the fires of our forefathers, that the doubters who dare not go, but hate to stay, who
                            have become sin hardened by not obeying their faith and conviction, or those who are only
                            looking for the loaves and the fishes, or the vultures, who are hovering around expecting
                            Zion's overthrow, may be burned and destroyed in the unquenchable fire of the gospel, with
                            those infidelic doctrines that have been a curse to Zion. Awake! we have had enough of this
                            lukewarm milk and water testimony, that lets us remain in our sins, in ease and
                            indifference, which does not bring conviction for wrong nor salvation from sin. It is time
                            for us to draw a line of demarkation between the flesh and the spirit, between him that
                            serveth God, and him that serveth sin. Delay is dangerous as as well as destructive. We must
                            come back, confess and repent of our sins, if we expect Zion to flourish and her people to
                            travel and have restored the gifts and power of God. We have gone astray, we have desired
                            the flesh pots of our day, and like ancient Israel, we are dying with the quails of
                            infidelity, disunion, disbelief and all the other disorders that follow the train, between
                            our teeth. Be not deceived, God is not mocked, whatsoever we sow, that shall we reap. Let us
                            rebuild the broken walls as did the ancients rebuild the temple, with a trowel in one hand
                            and a sword in the other. Let us bear in mind the words of one of our songs: "Then why, O
                            why thus doubting stand Indwellers of thy courts? Gird on the armor of the Lord, And in his
                            strength go forth And meet with glittering sword in hand The foes that 'gainst thee move,
                            And in the name of Zion's God, Victorious thou shalt prove." Let Zion's banner float to the
                            breeze, let the inscription upon it be "ISTo Surrender," but follow our standard-bearers,
                            Christ and Mother. Let our battle cry be the deliverance of Zion from the curses of Babylon
                            and a restoration of her power and glory. SluiJcers, AT.

                            realize this truth, and also, that for the refining of the spirit, true Christian culture is
                            requisite. With this the language will always correspond, as it is an index pointing to the
                            interior life. A physiognomist can discern the condition of the mind by the expression of
                            the face; so can the degree of spiritual attainment be recognized by the conversation. If
                            low and coarse it will be expressive of grossness and impurity; if sad and regretful, of
                            disappointment and depression of spirit, but if bright and cheerful, kind and forbearing,
                            chaste and gentle, then it will bespeak the hopefulness, generosity and purity of the heart.
                            It is said that "death and life are in the power of the tongue." We can never recall the
                            spoken word, nor estimate how far its influence may extend for good or ill, therefore we can
                            not too closely guard the motives and impulses of the heart. Impure thoughts, envy, jealousy
                            or any of those ignoble sentiments springing from the lower selfhood should be banished at
                            first approach, for if fostered, how soon the finer feelings will be set aside while the
                            soul unconsciously gathers to itself the elements that nourish this lower life, and the

As
                            we know but very little about the whales of the Bible, and still less about Jonah, we will
                            take the testimony of the worldly wise men on this subject, and if we do not get into a
                            whale they may get us into a muddle. In the book of Jonah it is said, Now the Lord had
                            prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. Jonah i., 17. While in the New Testament it
                            reads, For Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly. Matt, xii., 40. "Much
                            criticism has been expended on the Scripture account of Jonah being swallowed by a large
                            fish." One writer says "we might as well doubt all other miracles in Scripture as to doubt
                            this. There is no question of hard or easy, natural or unnatural, probable or improbable, in
                            regard to a real miracle." Smith's Die. If it is a miracle, then it makes no difference
                            whether it says the whale s wallowed Jonah or Jonah swallowed the whale. God is able bj a
                            miracle to do either. It is said that the word which is translated whale, could as well be
                            translated sea monster, or serpent or dragon or seal. Parldmrst however, says, that the fish
                            was not of the whale kind, but of the shark kind. Another writer says, The word translated
                            whale in the New Testament, signifies a great fish and nothing more. B. Diet. As this
                            becomes one of the disputed passages over which but little or no light can be cast to prove
                            satisfactory, all readers must be left to guess their own solution. It is worth noticing
                            that the "fish" of Jonah is found five or six times in paintings in the Roman catacombs
                            assigned to the first two centuries, and that it is distinctly a dragon. Brit. Ency. Bishop
                            Jebb thinks that Jonah was lodged in the back part of the whale's mouth, while G. C. Anton
                            endeavored to solve the difficulty by supposing that just as the prophet was thrown into the
                            water, the dead carcass of some large fish floated by, into the belly of which he contrived
                            to get, and that thus he was drifted to the shore! One writer thinks that Jonah was taken
                            prisoner on his journey to Nineveh, and retained there for three days. Nineveh was presided
                            over by the fish god, to whom was paid divine honors, and it was this fish god, or great
                            fish that swallowed Jonah or retained him, as a prisoner, in the city. The writer in Smith's
                            Dictionary accepts the whole story as a miracle and says. "The authority of Jesus on this
                            subject is just as good as it is on any other, and if we reject his sanctions and
                            interpretations of the Old Testament we reject his whole mission. He then informs us that,
                            some think this story was taken from the one referring to Hercules, who "sword in hand
                            leaped into the throat of a sea monster, and for three days and three nights maintained a
                            tremendous conflict in the monster's bowels, from which he at length emerged, victorious and
                            unharmed." Rev. Wm. Houghton says that the fish which swallowed Jonah "must have been a
                            large specimen of the White Shark which sometimes attains to the length of thirty feet; and
                            several writers testify that this great fish has been known to swallow men whole, and in one
                            was found the body of a man in military armor. And to make this more probable one writer
                            says that a whole horse has been found in the belly of a White shark.<pb n="138" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/>
                            138 THE MANIFESTO. We hope the fact may be established that Jonah did actually enjoy that
                            wonderful sea voyage, for the space of three days! After working so hard for the big fish
                            and the fisherman, the Rev. writer could not let Jonah return pleasantly to his home, but
                            adds�"At best, Jonah was a poor, distressed hypochondriac, easily discouraged and easily
                            elated."</p></div2><div2 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Averting sunday sickness" TEIform="index"/>AVERTING SUNDAY SICKNESS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">It can hardly be questioned that with the average person, young or old, there is
                                    a greater liability to that measure of sickness which will keep one at home on
                                    Sunday than on any other day of the week. Men will succumb to a Sunday sickness who
                                    would battle against it on a week-day. Women will find it dangerous to leave their
                                    homes on Sunday in weather that they would resolutely brave for a day's shopping or
                                    concert attending. And children who can be out of doors all of Saturday, are often
                                    too indisposed to attend Sunday-school on the day following. In the Sunday-school of
                                    the Washington Street Congregational Church at Toledo, Ohio, a prescription for one
                                    type of Sunday sickness has been proposed, which is worthy of consideration
                                    elsewhere. In "The Helper," a monthly paper issued by that Sunday-school, the facts
                                    in the premises are given as herewith:� Where are those 161 scholars? What 161
                                    scholars? We will show you:� Average enrollment for past quarter 603 Average
                                    attendance " " " 442 The difference 161 In other words, 161 of our members are
                                    absent from the school every Sunday. They surely are not all out of the city! It
                                    does not seem probable that 161 of us could be sick every Sunday for a whole
                                    quarter, but, strange as it seems, it is true. It is a fearful malady that has
                                    broken out among us, and it requires very prompt and heroic treatment. We do not run
                                    a "free dispensary," but out of "pure love for the patients" we prescribe the
                                    following Unfailing Remedy. On Sunday morning, rise at six; use plenty of cold water
                                    on the face; eat a plain, hearty breakfast. Then mix and take internally a dose
                                    composed of equal parts of the following ingredients, namely: Will. Push. Energy.
                                    Determination. Self-respect. Respect for God's day. Respect for God's house. A
                                    desire to be somebody. Stir well, add a little love just to make it sweet. Repeat
                                    the dose every three minutes till Sunday-school time, unless relief comes sooner. If
                                    the day is stormy an external application of over-shoes, rubber coats, and umbrellas
                                    will be beneficial. We shall confidently look for many wonderful cures among our 161

                            statement: "If we begin our survey with the lowest and end with the highest strata of
                            Society, � it is my belief we shall find that gormandizing is the main end and object for
                            which people live.' Speaking of many who pursue philosophy science, and even schemes of
                            philanthropy he says: "They merely dabble in these matters in the intervals of their real
                            occupations, between lunch and dinner, when their stomachs are full and they can not .begin
                            to gorge anew." It is to be hoped that Count Tolstoi is taking quite too gloomy a view of
                            present-day human nature; but beyond doubt most people think far too much of eating and
                            drinking. We think it would be well for the world if such abstemiousness as Count Tolstoi's
                            were the rule rather than the exception. He eschews both flesh-meat and intoxicating drinks,
                            and lives in all respects in the utmost simplicity, and spends all his energy in the service
                            of the people. "A glutton," says the Count, "is powerless to do battle with his sloth, and
                            he who is both gluttonous and slothful is powerless to check his fleshly lusts." And he lays
                            down this principle that "the more a man gives to others, and the less he requires for
                            himself, the better he is; the less he confers upon others and the more he exacts for
                            himself, the worse he is."</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Only three steps" TEIform="index"/>ONLY THREE STEPS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">A leaened divine one day accosted a simple-hearted Christian busy in his daily

                                thought of being or of doing something above and beyond the present, and that swells our
                                hearts with emotion as we hold them in contemplation. It gives tone to our daily
                                prayers, inspires us with zeal to sing the praises of the God of our salvation and
                                increases our testimony in the work of redemption, by the absorbing of new life and by
                                the making of us as new creatures in Christ Jesus. Our Christian work urges us to put
                                off that which belongs to a lower degree, which belongs to the relations of the Adamic
                                life and to put on those new and spiritual relations which lead more directly to the
                                kingdom of God. We may denominate this as a work of inspiration, or as a new revelation
                                for the souls of men, and indeed, in its life-work, it can be no lessAwakened to the
                                interest of this gospel mission, the Revelator pens his gift of inspiration on the
                                subject and shows what may be received at the hand of God by the earnest, self-denying
                                worker in the cross of Christ. "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
                                raiment." And he passes from degree to degree in his spiritual ministration till he
                                enumerates for the overcomer a fulness in the wonderful blessings of God's love. A white
                                garment or a garment of this special order may not have been coveted by some classes, as
                                a purple robe was the much desired prize of rich men, and this was a part of the
                                inheritance of those who dwelt in the great and powerful city of Babylon. White was the
                                symbol of righteousness, and for this treasure the disciple would endure all things. It
                                was the exchanging of a worldlyworn garment for one that was pure and unspotted. Other

                                which made the faithful Believer doubly anxious to maintain his position by the side of
                                the cross. His name was to be engraven in a white stone and written in God's book of
                                remembrance, from the day that he had turned his face toward the Holy City. It was a new
                                name and belonged to the new kingdom. There is no doubt but that it was written as are
                                our names to-day,�for an eternity. Here is where "Hope keeps the heart alive," through
                                the anticipated security of that name in the Lamb's Book of Life. It is no wonder that
                                the breath of inspiration, sings in the fulness of its eloquence,� "O that these names
                                may be written where the hand of man can not defile them." Then comes the assurance
                                resting on faithful obedience to that light which has so wonderfully beautified our
                                path. "I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life." It may require the
                                positiveness of a Job to declare the position we have taken, as he declares,�I know that
                                my Redeemer liveth ; and we should be able to say with as little hesitancy, I know that
                                my name is written in God's kingdom. We should be assured of this fact, because we have
                                turned from darkness unto light;�because we have left the life of the worldly-minded and
                                have entered a life of righteousness and peace. Leaving the world ! What a powerful
                                significance this has to the Christian. "I pray not," said Jesus, "that thou shouldst
                                take them out of the world," away from mankind, "but that thou shouldst keep them from
                                the evil,"�from the relations that make the life of the world. Jesus could not
                                consistently pray against his own work, and his work was constantly among men, to lead
                                them on toward God's kingdom. The world, the cities and villages are the harvest fields,
                                and they are already white and ripened for the reapers. While the Believers are to be
                                separated from the sins of the world and from all that defiles the spirit of a Christian
                                worker, their great mission is among men as spiritual teachers of the resurrection
                                order. Inasmuch as they fail to make this of the first importance, they fail to meet the
                                object of their special call from the ranks of the world. It is not that we should
                                interfere with the form of government under which we live ; but our duty is to be loyal,
                                law-abiding citizens, allowing the civil rulers the privilege of managing their own
                                business, while we attend to the spiritual mission of Jesus the Christ. This agrees with
                                the words of our spiritual teacher, Mother Ann Lee, and on which we may do well to
                                meditate, lest our zeal to build upon a wrong foundation may bring us to untimely
                                    sorrow.<pb n="142" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 142 THE MANIFESTO. "In addressing an assembly she
                                spoke as follows :�You may think that you will yet subdue and overcome the nations of
                                the earth ; but you are mistaken; they have that work to do themselves. They will build
                                up ; but God will pull down, until they can build no more, but vou will have nothing to
                                do with it." That Mother Ann's words are as essential for our guidance and protection,
                                as they were for our gospel fathers and mothers, there can not be the least doubt. Our
                                mission is clearly defined. God has given us a light for our path, a testimony for our
                                safe-guard, and the sword of truth by which to conquer sdn in our own hearts. Let us
                                awake to the duties of our day and to the, work of God among men.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">In this we wish to extend our kindest thanks to all who are interested in the writing of

                                one, when life's inevitable changes disturbed her daily routine; and closer still would
                                be our comparison, for to-day we would wonder if this is the same world we lived on a
                                week ago. "Then we could only say, The earth's a field of mud,� The sky's a waterspout."
                                Now the sky is guiltless of a cloud, and a new life seems infused into all creation.
                                Sowers and planters are out in earnest, it being the first opportunity to work the soil
                                this spring; and they know of a truth that "If we sow no seed in Spring, we shall look
                                in vain for Autumn fruits." "The seasons come and go, to teach men gratitude," and what
                                numberless other lessons we learn by their ceaseless routine. We plant and sow to the
                                best of our ability, hoping and trusting that the harvest may be sure; but ere the
                                fruition of our hopes, we know not what element of nature will come as a destroyer, or
                                who may be the reapers of what we have sown. If in material things we are so trusting,
                                ought we not thus to toil for the inner life? We may often fail to reap where we have
                                sown, but would it not seem sadder still, to fail of a harvest, because we had not sown.
                                On the 19-20 ult. eastern New York experienced the wildest storm known in this locality
                                for years. It was not a cyclone which comes and goes before you are aware, but wind,
                                sleet and rain which lasted twenty-four hours; the last twelve being the worst, during
                                which time even our large brick building shook. But when we came to learn of barns being
                                blown down, horses, cattle and sheep killed, houses unroofed, etc., in the towns about
                                us, we were again reminded, how cosily we were located among the hills; for though we
                                thought the wind terrific, it did not assist the Brethren in the least, to remove an
                                unsightly shed by the tannery, which a pressure of work still keeps standing. So though
                                our village is so located that we must climb or descend a hill to reach it, we have our
                                advantages, and as we look at the beautiful pictured landscape about us, we are glad of
                                the sunny days in life, which cause us to forget the storm. Amelia J. Calver. Center

                                asparagus, it has grown nearly or quite twelve inches to-day. Trees are very late in
                                blooming, not a blossom to be seen as yet; the buds are about ready to burst and in a
                                few days, probably the trees will be in full bloom. I was about to say, health of family
                                pretty good, but on second thought am sorry to say, several are on the invalid corps; we
                                hope this beautiful weather will bring us all health and strength. We are glad to hear

                                not mean willfully to neglect any duty, great or small, and we believe it is our duty,
                                as it is our interest and our pleasure to fill our little medium of gospel intercourse,

                                proclaiming the testimony with firmness and confidence, are full of thankfulness for
                                what the gospel has done for us, are keeping good gospel union, and are happy and

                                spreading a knowledge of our faith, and opened a very interesting correspondence with a
                                few. We have not lost hope of gathering some. In any case the effort will not be lost.
                                Some good will be done. We believe it is our duty to try to gather and save souls. We
                                must be alive and active. We do not intend to stagnate. It is our duty to preach the
                                gospel, keep the faith, live the life, and be content to leave the issue with the Author
                                of our being and of our faith. The season being so late makes us exceptionally busy just
                                now. We have been cleaning up premises generally, as we love to have temporal as well as
                                spiritual things in good gospel order. Sisters are as busy as bees, house-cleaning,
                                raking lawn and grass plots, laying out flower beds, etc., and this year they have
                                offered to relieve the Brethren of the care of one of the strawberry beds. Thank God for
                                good zealous Sisters! Brethren are short handed, and the question arose, Shall we hire
                                an extra hand? We decided to hire no more help, but plant and sow only what we could
                                care for with our present help. This is a wise decision. Work for the season has just
                                been laid out and the gift of the Elders is to have everybody interested and make every
                                one comfortable. To this end we have just adopted the plan of rising, for this season of
                                the year, at five a. m., breakfasting at six, doing such chores as are possible in the
                                meantime. The milking to be done alter breakfast. We have been in the habit of rising at
                                4-30 a. m. and milking before breakfast, but it has frequently been a hurrying time to
                                get through and in the house in time for breakfast. We hope the new arrangement will
                                enable us to commence the day more pleasantly for all. May 12th, just commenced putting

                                concerned? is a hard question to answer. Surely, if we write for Home Notes we must
                                write of home and home surroundings, whatever they may be; and as the weather, if fair
                                and pleasant or the opposite, has an influence on home and individuals, so will the
                                weather always come in for a share of attention; and as we write from Maine to Kentucky,
                                it gives us a chance to see the extremes of the elements. We at present have an
                                abundance of rain, and though the grass is green, warm weather is yet afar off. It is a
                                poor time to get in crops. Still we were fortunate enough to sow all our oats in April.
                                Have planted a few early potatoes, peas, &amp;c. in the garden for family vise. We
                                are always sorry to chronicle illness, while we feel it is a sin to be sick, especially
                                when we are well. If that be the case we shall have to confess, and try to get well. We
                                have had many cases of La Grippe in our Society, and a few cases of measles. We hope and
                                trust all will get well and none of the cases prove fatal. Let us so live that when our

                                THE MANIFESTO. 145 North Family. May, 1893. In recording Home Notes for the month, the
                                very pleasant one is remembered of receiving as a present for our library, a copy of
                                Canon Farrar's "Life of Christ," from our dear friend, J. G. Toepper of Washington, D.
                                C. It is an illustrated work of seven hundred and sixty-five pages, and will be a
                                companion to Munkacsy's "Christ before Pilate," of which we have a very fine copy three
                                feet by two mounted and placed in the entrance hall of our home at the north. We can
                                affirm by personal knowledge that the efforts of those here who minister the testimony
                                of the higher life in our meetings for spiritual communion are successful. We have been
                                greatly blest by the outpourings of the spirit that we have felt in those seasons,
                                proving conclusively that there are those here who have come up through ^leep
                                tribulation and are in truth virgin souls. La Grippe has been placing its grip upon some

Deak Editor:�So much to interest, instruct, and fill our minds with high and
                                holy thoughts do we find on the pages of each issue of your excellent publication, that
                                we can not fail to realize our obligation to respond occasionally to the call for Home
                                Notes. May came to us in a tearful mood and continued to weep almost incessantly the
                                first week of her sojourn here, but now she is radiant with smiles and appears in her
                                true colors. Vegetation is full of life, and the earth is donning her robe of emerald
                                green. Our live stock consisting of one hundred and fifty head of cattle and fifteen
                                horses, have nearly consumed our large supply of hay�there will be only about twenty
                                tons remaining. In some former seasons there have been seventyfive or a hundred tons to
                                carry over. Water-pipes, that Rip Van Winkle like, went to sleep last Decenber, have
                                awakened, and so far as ascertained are mostly in sound condition. Considering the
                                backwardness of the season,'farm work is progressing finely. Fire wood is mostly
                                prepared for another year, lumber sawed and put in condition for seasoning. Some repairs
                                are being made; at the office the walls and woodwork of each hall have been given a new
                                coat of paint, which brightens and improves their appearance wonderfully. The brick
                                dwelling is being renovated by the aid of paint and varnish. The kitchen and all rooms
                                in the basement, with some others, are being thus renewed. The floor has been relaid in
                                the large dining room, making it seem more cosy and pleasant when the family meet there,
                                which is one thousand and ninety-five times a year. Notwithstanding all this pressure of
                                home cares and responsibilities, Br. Ira is also conducting repairs at the grist mill.
                                New steel beams are being put in the basement to support the weighty machinery, in place
                                of the large timbers which have done service there the past twenty-nine years, and had
                                begun to decay. A new brick blacksmith's shop is to bo erected over there the present
                                season, on the corner where the old wooden shop now stands, and is to be 30x50 feet and
                                roofed with slate. School opened for the summer term on the 24th ult. with a lower

                                patient work. "No pruning, no fruit; no battle, no victory; no cross, no crown." No
                                difficulties too great to be conquered. No danger in the path where Jesus leads. If we
                                would shun sin, we must shun all that leads to sin. There is no better way to bear our
                                own trials and afflictions than in trying to give comfort and joy to others. Sometimes a
                                word of warning, caution or entreaty saves a soul from spiritual ruin and death. We must
                                wear in eternity what we weave in time. Where purity is, a quiet spirit dwells. It is
                                best to lay out some course of religious reading that will give us food for thought and
                                serious reflection. We must feed the soul as well as the body, or we shall fail to reach
                                the heavenly abode for which we are striving. * * * * If we have choice poultry we
                                should give them choice treatment. So long as the poultry must be confined the greater
                                part of the time, they should be fed regularly three times a day. When poultry get no
                                attention they soon get so that they are not worth looking after. When breeding fowls
                                for profit, we should breed what the market demands. The profits in poultry, as in
                                everything else, depend to a great extent on proper management. Daniel Orcutt. South
                                Family. May, 1893. Sow in the morn thy seed, At eve hold not thy hand; To doubt and fear
                                give thou no heed, Broadcast it o'er the land. Thou knowest not which may thrive, The
                                late or early sown, God keeps the precious germ alive, When and wherever strown. We are
                                promised seed-time and harvest although at the present time the cold, wet weather does
                                not give promise of an early spring, yet we believe our toil will not be in vain. The
                                garden vegetables which were planted two weeks ago are peeping out of the soil. Peas are
                                doing well in spite of the cold winds and rains of the past week. On the 6th inst., a
                                white frost appeared, however we think the buds on the fruit trees which are nearly in
                                bloom will not be damaged by it. A life experience fails to recall a season in which the
                                cherry trees did not bloom by the 6th of May. Apple trees are usually in full bloom by
                                the first week in May, but this year seems to be that May will be deferred until June
                                1st, when a great change will take place in the weather. Early potatoes usually planted
                                by the 20th of April, are this year only just about ready to go into the ground. Can any
                                one remember an equally late Spring? This being the year for us to expect a supply of
                                apples we are quite hopeful, as last year they were few, and very poor. Grass fields are
                                looking well, and the beautiful shade of green that meets the eye on every hand is
                                delightful to behold. Our meadows are quite well supplied with water just now, as small
                                lakes are visible everywhere. The house-cleaning department are desiring more sunshine
                                for their accommodation, as their work is much retarded by such cold winds and pouring
                                rains, but patience and perseverance willovercome all obstacles, and house renovating
                                will be accomplished sometime. �Health, the greatest blessing we can desire, now
                                prevails with our family, thanks to the giver of every good and perfect gift. Maria

I indokse the worthy sentiments of our good and worthy Elder Isaac Anstatt.
                                The harvest is great and the laborers few, and this calls for a strong faith and a
                                greater testimony. In days long gone by it was this strong faith and trust in an
                                Almighty Power, that doeth all things well, that drew souls by the power of faith and
                                conviction to see and to know the principles of truth. The Believers in Christ's Second
                                Appearing became a strong power among mankind, and the blessings of heaven rested upon
                                them, and the gifts of the<pb n="147" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 147 spirit were the food
                                that fed the immortal part. O that this same faith may be revived and the same trust in
                                prayer bring again those Pentecostal days, when strong and powerful minds will be
                                gathered to the faith. I envy no quality of mind, nor genius, power, wit or fancy, as I
                                do a strong religious faith in the true principles of righteousness. Faith is an
                                emanation from God and is manifest through the moral and spiritual faculties. Faith like
                                love casteth out fear. It is faith that says, "Our Father who art in heaven, Thy will be
                                done on earth." O that our eyes may be open to see and to know the worth of this strong
                                and noble faith. What peace of mind it will bring,�what consolation it will bestow. It
                                will bring to us the same increase that it did to our fathers. Spring is with us. Our

                                especially so for us who profess to follow Christ in the full regeneration. We, Brethren
                                and Sisters, are called to a much greater soul work than we are apt to realize. Every
                                member of the household residing within the walls of our Zion home, should at the
                                present time especially look well to the foundation on which he stands, and upon which
                                he is building. Unless the fruits of our daily lives are such as will merit the blessing
                                of God we shall sooner or later be branded as unprofitable servants. Mother Ann, Father
                                William, Father James, and all the other honored witnesses of God's last dispensation,
                                proclaimed on the housetops that we as a people are called to build up a spiritual
                                temple, in whose hearts God might come and dwell. There is no comparison between a
                                beautiful home with conveniences for all possible material comfort without spiritual
                                life, and the humblest dwelling where peace, harmony, and the love of God reigns, and
                                where whole-souled selfabnegation excludes every vestige of selfishness. That we may all
                                be induced to weigh ourselves in the gospel balances, making up light weights before we
                                are weighed in those balances by God and found wanting, is my earnest and wrestling
                                prayer. Our spring work has begun by vigorously taking hold of plow handles in our
                                gardens. We are also beginning to think of our Hamamelis business for the season, and of
                                our spring medicine Sarsaparilla. In this connection we refer to a recent pleasing
                                incident; viz., the arrival at our office from the last Mechanics' Fair held at Boston
                                of a beautifully executed Diploma, awarded us for the general excellence and utility of
                                our handiwork, exhibited last fall at the fair. On reading the discriminating tribute of
                                the judges of the fair we were induced to look up with some degree of interest a
                                previous Diploma which was awarded us by the judges and committee of chemicals of the
                                Mechanics' Fair held in Boston in 1847, for our Compound Concentrated Sarsaparilla,
                                prepared by our late much esteemed brother, Dr. Corbett. I ought to say that this

                                lingers and spring is nowhere. Now, at this date, May 12, summer is here, with
                                thermometer at 110 deg. However, our weathers are so very freaky, it may all be what one
                                little one styled a ' 'pop'' by the time it is printed, and we be left to wonder if the
                                tiny life germs of the vegetable kingdom can possibly develop in such cold, uncongenial
                                environments. Under these and similar conditions, the promise that "Seed-time and
                                harvest shall never fail," is our star of hope. Two hundred feet of rubber hose have
                                been in use to convey water where pipes were frozen in dairy, kitchens, and toilet
                                rooms. Some have thawed voluntarily since the advent of a warmer atmosphere, so those
                                who are expecting to dig more or less this summer, to lay more tubing, will be grateful
                                for so much assistance from the elements. The maple syrup harvest proved an average one
                                and very nice. We have broken our record for good health which prevailed through the
                                cold season. Nearly every one has participated, to some degree, in a disease which has
                                made sneezing and coughing continually heard in the land; weak knees, aching muscles,
                                and a general feeling of collapse, lias been the complaint. If the same amount of union
                                could only be as apparent in a good cause, we might see the effect of concerted action,
                                to our profit. A deal of kindness and patience was shown by those who cared for the
                                afflicted. "Angels in the way," are all such, as really as when life's little day hath
                                ebbed out, and we meet for the last memorial meeting to speak good words. Why do we not
                                speak them now, and why do words that censure find utterance, so much more easily than
                                those that commend? This is a subject worth studying, for we all want to bear good
                                tidings, as messengers of love in God's house, and there is ample chance for all,
                                however cramped by circumstances, if we bear in memory the following comforting lines.
                                "A smile can glorify a clay, A word new hope impart; The least disciple need not say I
                                have no alms to give away, If love be in the heart." Mary Ella BriggS. North Family.

                                that we had more varied and interesting items to line into our meagre compilation of
                                home doings; variety of topics being the spice of social intercourse, as are a variety
                                of subjects the relishable spice of literature, but with the grand truth ever before us,
                                '"A contented mind is the richest of gifts," and having passed triumphantly through the
                                severe winter without any serious results either to person or property, we have abundant
                                reasons for expressing thankfulness to both seen and unseen powers of protective good;
                                living with such cheering realities we believe can but be conducive to mature good
                                results. All nature gives ample evidence of growth, ever new, yet ever of the same basic
                                life-giving elements; and from its voluminous life we can cull many a lesson teaching us
                                to do likewise, pass from sameness into newness of growth, of progressive thought.<pb n="149" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 149 "Ever changing, ever aiming Toward a higher,
                                better life; lnver learning, ever earning, Is the good Believer's strife." Practical
                                faith in a regenerative Divinity, prompts personal effort to benefit our fellow beings
                                by continual works of righteousness ; thus finite minds blend in unison with the
                                Infinite. Having a year's supply of wood housed and our maple harvest over, lands are
                                being prepared for the receiving of grains and vegetables. Our winter Dairy has been
                                quite satisfactory, supplying us with an abundance of butter and cream for home use,
                                besides furnishing some two hundred pounds of butter for sale. Each faithful worker in
                                the Lord's vineyard shares our best love and good wishes. George H. Baxter.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sabbathday Lake" TEIform="index"/>Sabbathday Lake.</head><p TEIform="p">May, 1893. As I take up the pen preparatory to writing notes for our beautiful little
                                messenger, I pause and think; what is there to write about? and the good responds. "Why
                                not enumerate some of the many blessings which we are daily sharing? Surely goodness and
                                mercy have followed us all the days of our lives or since dwelling in the house of God
                                with the faithful followers of Jesus the Christ. We realize in the fullest sense the
                                hundred-fold blessing as we look upon the faces of dearly loved fathers and mothers,
                                sisters and brothers, and do not feel that we have lost anything in separating ourselves
                                from natural ties. We often sing the beautiful refrain: "O, I thank God for you, my
                                brethren and sisters, My soul overflows with the love I can't express. For you I've
                                forsaken all kindred ties the dearest; Through you I've the promise, full recompense to
                                share; And where you go, I'll go, your people are my people, Your God shall be my God
                                and your interest my care." It seems good to look upon the sparkling waters of
                                Sabbathday Lake once more after the long time it has been so quietly enclosed in ice,
                                which left the 4th inst. Br. Pliny says the loons came in the next day after the ice
                                left. Just now ploughing and some planting is being done but it is still cold and the
                                ground too wet for much farming. Sisters have not done much on their flower gardens
                                except to sow the Sweet Peas. If we venture out, the wind rises and the rain comes
                                pelting down, thus ending fur the time being all out of door exercises, but we are
                                hoping soon to have brighter days. The summer term of school is already in progress.

                                so few sunny days is very discouraging to those who work on the farm and garden; but it
                                may be better by and by, and so we will hope on and do the best we can. Our good
                                Brother, George Clark, is laying nearly a mile of pipe to improve and increase our water
                                facilities; but the rainy weather retards the progress of the business very much by
                                rendering it almost impossible to get the digging done. Our energetic Sisters have
                                raised over a thousand tomato plants in the hou�e which they have transferred to the
                                hot-bed and they are growing vigorously. On the 2nd inst. they set out one thousand
                                strawberry plants and hope next year to gather a rich supply of luscious fruit. The
                                Brethren and boys have busily improved all the pleasant days setting out pear, plum and
                                cherry trees and raspberry bushes, in addition to the many duties common to the season.
                                On the night of the 4th we had a very heavy rain storm, accompanied with high winds and
                                hail making the prospect look rather dubious for a plentiful harvest; were it not for

                                thankful. While we read and bear of so many who have had their homes and property
                                destroyed by storms, we have been greatly blest, having experienced no damages by the
                                fury of the elements, but continue to abide in our happy home safely protected, not
                                alone from storms, but also from the contaminating influences of a sinful world living
                                in the enjoyment of true freedom so far as we live in accordance with and are obedient
                                to gospel principles. We are also thankful that in this present evil generation, liberty
                                of conscience is vouchsafed to us, and pray from the depths of our souls that the wily
                                oppressor may not be permitted ever to usurp power in this country and thus deprive
                                honest, earnest hearts of that most sacred of human rights, liberty of conscience. May
                                the power and Spirit of truth and righteousness so actuate and strengthen the noble and
                                brave as to enable them to maintain with all vigilance the cause of freedom, and

We have not yet planted one hill of corn on account of rain, rain, rain. But
                                if we are favored with a warm, dry, late fall, there is time enough yet for a crop of
                                corn. *� School is still in session. I like to write Home Notes because I feel a little
                                relief from the surveillance of conventional propriety which haunts me when writing on
                                more abstruse subjects. We have three quite intelligent inquirers here at present, and
                                may they conclude to sell all and "buy that field." Everything that can grow without
                                being planted is fresh and green, and as we raise many cattle and horses for sale, our
                                pastures are in a very propitious condition, which is a thing to be thankful for, amid a
                                thousand other blessings which we are daily and hourly in receipt of. We are trying to
                                insist on more cleanliness in regard to houses, floors, stairs, steps, walks and
                                dooryards. As to the person, it ought to be a matter of supererogation to insist on
                                cleanliness in that, to any one called to purity of life as Believers all are. I am
                                going to plant a little Okra (Abelmoschus Esculentus) and when ripe mix it half and half
                                with store coffee to see if it will be about as good and half as dear as the genuine
                                article. We would do better to quit the coffee altogether, but "all men can not receive
                                this saying." So in this as in most other things, as we can not rise perpendicularly, we
                                have to move up to better conditions on an inclined plane. Our good Sisters, Eldress
                                Clymena Miner, Eldress Temperance Devan, and Sister Kebecca Armstrong are on a short
                                visit to Watervliet, Ohio. Elder Lafayette Parker and Br. George Bushman are here from
                                Whitewater on a short visit. Eldress Adaline Wells expects to return with them to her
                                former home, after spending many years at Watervliet as first in care; afterwards at
                                Union Village as a member of the board of Ministry, then Eldress of the South family,
                                and lastly, as first in care at Pleasant Hill for two or three years. All these offices
                                of burden and care she has occupied with the utmost fidelity and efficiency, and now we
                                think she has earned a period of rest from these arduous toils and cares. Sheep shearing
                                will soon be in order, and the continual wet weather is like to push all our spring and
                                summer work up into a heap. But we will have to thank God it is no worse and do the best
                                we can with it. We are always glad to receive the Manifesto, and it seems to lose
                                nothing of its wonted interest and entertainment as well as spiritual edification. Some
                                weeks ago we had a visit, heard a lecture, and enjoyed quite a protracted conversation
                                with Dr. Cyrus Teed, shepherd of the Koreshan church. We were highly interested in all
                                he had to say. He seems to be wide awake and full of spiritual zeal. Whether he will be
                                able fully to assimilate with Believers in all things,<pb n="151" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                                MANIFESTO. lol especially in non-essentials, time alone will determine. But what if he
                                does not? Jesus's disciples found certain persons casting out devils not in his name and
                                forbade them, but Jesus said, Let them go ahead, and so I say. Now when are we going to
                                have that meeting spoken of by Elder Louis Basting to formulate our bed-rock principles
                                and set forth our system of ethics and spiritual whereabouts in the definite and
                                specific manner required in this remarkable era of universal evolution and progress in
                                all things. Principles are eternal, they must not, can not alter. But forms are as
                                evanescent as the tinted cloud of sunset. Every single step in invention, discovery,
                                science, reform in whatever direction necessitates a new form in which to express
                                itself. And let us not hang reverently upon the neck of conservatism and superstition
                                forever, for "when ,later there's less time to play the fool." O. C.

                                Columbian Exposition, is open to the world. The "World's Columbian Exposition
                                Illustrated," authentic organ of the Fair, established Feb. 1891, has kept pace with the
                                great enterprise. This is shown by the complete and excellent "Opening Souvenir Number,"
                                the May issue of this Magazine. As an illustrated work, the May issue far surpasses any
                                previous number. It has a specially designed lithographed cover em. blematical of the
                                occasion. Among the more prominent illustrations are the Frontispiece "Senor Dupuy de
                                Lome," Commissioner General from Spain to the Exposition; Full page illustrations of
                                "Opening Ceremonies," "Horticultural Domes," "View on the Lagoon," "Silver Statue of
                                Montana," "Miss Ada Rehan," "Great Terminal Station," "Locomotive Samson," "Will of
                                Queen Isabella." Other illustrations are "President Cleveland," "Series of Tickets,"
                                "United States Big Gun," "Japanese Screen," "Dedication of Japanese Ho-o-den Palace,"
                                "Death of Queen Isabella,') "Columbus Quadrega," "Cathedral Chimes'' and "Cleopatra's
                                Needle," from Crystal Cave; "Spanish building," "Spanish Pavilions in Manufactures and
                                Agricultural buildings," "Sweden's building," and a colored Centre Piece showing the
                                entire Exposition and Uncle Sam welcoming the nations. Among the leading articles are,
                                "A Columbian Institute,'1 ''The Happy Day Has Come," "The Triumph of Centuries," "Hail
                                the Opening of the World's Columbian Exposition," "Accommodations at the Fair,"
                                "Official Programme," "Auditor Ackerman's Report," "Terminal Railway Station," "A
                                California Woman's Work," "Montana's Statue of Justice," "Crystal Cave at the Fair,"
                                "Among the State buildings" and many others of interest. This number is the richest yet
                                published, and as this is the only publication entirely devoted to the Exposition
                                interests, while answering for a complete guide, the entire issues will form an
                                Authentic History of the World's Columbian Exposition. Every person should have a copy
                                of this issue. The publishers want reliable agents in each town. Sample copy of Opening

                                prominent places in its columns. The first character in this current issue is one that
                                just now is a centre of public interest�Paderewski the pianist, who is "done in black
                                and white" from a personal interview, with two admirable portraits. "Spain" is described
                                and illustrated in the very interesting series of "Race Studies," by Dr. Oswald. A
                                gentleman of some. prominence in Chicago, Mr. Chalkley Hambleton, is sketched among the
                                phrenological worthies. Prof. Nelson Sizer discusses the Ministry in his series on Human
                                Pursuits and illustrates it happily. Governor Matthews, of Indiana, is written up by one
                                who evidently knows him. Those who are really interested in domestic life and true
                                social development will read "Let Them Alone" and "The Doctrine of Paternal Authority,"
                                both articles by well known writers. In the Health section good advice is given with
                                respect to the prevention of cholera and what to do in poison emergencies. A brief note
                                on the use of Hypnotism will attract attention, as it gives a double view of the
                                subject. The variety of notes relating to Anthropology is unusually considerable and the
                                same can be . said of the Editorial departments, the latter containing another
                                installment, the thirteenth of the valuable series of papers on moral education. The

THE STORY OF A NOVEL.
Mr. Howklls' latest novel, "The Coast of
Bohemia," now running through the pages of
The Ladies' Home Journal, was written in four
different States. Mr. Ilowells began the novel at his father's home in Ohio last .May; con
tinned it in Boston in June; took it to-the
mountains of New Hampshire during the
summer and "worked at it; brought it to New
York and wrote a number of chapters there in
October; took it back again to Ohio in November, and finally finished it in New York last
December. And yet, despite all these changes of places of writing, the novel turns out
really to be the brightest piece of work that
Howeils has done for a long time.
