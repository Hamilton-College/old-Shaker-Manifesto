THE   MANIFESTO.
Word and Works for May opens with an
interesting story of the Heavens and has in
addition to the usual illustrations of the planetary system, a beautiful and enlarged, representation of the planet Saturn. The curious
rings that encircle that \Nonderful globe, and
also the eight attendant moons will be studied
with great pleasure. It is no wonder that so
many people love to believe that heaven is located on this planet. After closing all busi.
ness relations on the earth, it would be just
nice to sail around Saturn on her beautiful
rings, for some few thousands of years. And
after we have expatiated so freely on the
beauties of our one moon, and then to be
transported to a world when we can have no
less than eight, well, to say the least it must
be just lovely. The good Dr. says we must
look out for the first fifteen days of May; there
may be violent storms on the sea and on the
land, but even with these predictions we will
not be frightened, but quietly turn to the Query Corner and see what the readers are asking
Questions about this month.

Israel's Messiah by H. L. Hastings, 47 Cornhill, Boston, Mass.
A fund of information can be obtained from
these books that are published in the interest
of the Christian church. Although they are
called anti-Infidel, yet any Infidel and no less
the majority of Christians will be much better
informed in regard to ancient and modern history, by a careful perusal of these pages. The
theological feature of the work is not of so
much consequence to the general reader, but
to be assured that so good a man as Jesus of
Nazareth once walked upon this earth and
taught lessons of righteousness to rich and
poor alike, makes this little book a valuable
treasure.
Human Nature for May presents a very interesting, illustrated article on the change
that was made in the character of a young
man through his knowledge of Phrenology.
This article is well worth a careful perusal
for those who wish to improve the health of
body and mind. The whole paper can be
studied to profit. A sample copy can be obtained for five cents. Prof. A. Haddock, San
Francisco, Cal.
ARBUTUS.
Under the snow, under the snow,
The leaves of the trailing arbutus grow;
Toiling the earth that loves them nigh,
But hoping to some day see the sky.
Under the snow, under the snow,
The flowers of the trailing arbutus glow;
E'en in the dark their duty done,
But hoping to some day kiss the sun.

What is Spiritualism? You can best learn
if you are an investigator, by reading a Reliable Spiritualist paper, one that is free from
bigotry and does not condone fraud in any
guise. Such a journal is The Medium, a bright
and interesting 8-page weekly, published at
Los Angeles, Cal. The only Spiritual paper
on this coast. Only 50 cents a year, Sent two
months on trial for 10 cts silver. Address

April Journal has reached number four of the
Science of Life by T. V. Gifford, M. D. Those
interested in a life of health in this world,
would be better informed on this subject
if they should read these articles.
"What we know and what we don't know
about Vaccination," gives very extended information on the subject; and the story of
the wicked city in England that will not accept vaccination, will please many readers.
The Journal has also many interesting articles on subjects belonging to the health and
happiness of the home and of the individual.

The Pulpit for April presents a series of
six sermons preached by Rev. J. E. Lanceley
of Brampton, Canada.
The Sermons are Why? When? Who? How?
What? and Whither? As no special denomination is mentioned, the Preacher of course
belongs to the People and his message is to
the people. The good words of J. E. Lanceley can now be read by the members of all the
churches and be known as a friend of humanity .
"How Sundaj is spent, and how to spend it"
is a sermon by Rev. Wallace Nutting. His
story of the Sabbath is wonderfully strange.
He illustrates a city of 40,000 inhabitants.
From the large number he estimates that
10,000 may be in the churches, 15,000 may be
drinking at home or on a visit to the saloons,
and 15,000 spending the Sunday in reading or
visiting or as their inclinations suggest.

The Phrenological Journal for May has
an illustrated article of the great Bankei, Mr.
Henry (lews. It is said to be from a personal
examination by Edgar C. Beall, M. D. A
presentation like this must prove very pleasant to Mr. Clews and to his many friends as
Dr. Beall has marked for him nearly all that
is good in the head of a man. Even a Puritanic church member would be in honor to accompany so good a man to the Celestial City .
In an article by C T. Parks we are informed
that there is Character in the eyes. Six illustrations with six recognized types will readily inform us to which we may belong. As the
position of the eyes will be hard to change we
must accept the judgment of public opinion.
The Principles of Phrenology by Prof. N. L.

                            enlightened by the illumination of science, by the experience of age, and all the immense
                            mass of information to be obtained from books in the middle of the nineteenth century should
                            not see the signs of the times, when it seems as if everything on earth and in heaven
                            proclaims the fact that light is bursting from the Spirit world in almost a perpetual blaze.
                            We insist upon it that intelligent men of the age examine and judge for themselves. If they
                            look over the state of the world since the middle of the last century, they will find in
                            this examination a wonderful and astonishing era in the world's calendar. A movement
                            revolutionizing the whole social, moral and religious world, upheaved in the aggregate and
                            staggering under combined effects of the moving phalanx stih1 going on. Now to what cause is
                            this universal movement to be ascribed? Notice the stir almost simultaneous through the
                            moral and religious world in regard to intemperance, the testimony against it springing up
                            in Europe and America, spreading far and wide through all orders, sects and denominations.
                            Observe the exertions of manly and liberal minds on the subject of slavery; with what a
                            noble and dignified front they have breasted the appalling wrath of almost half a nation
                            battling against them. The combined darkness of ignorance, interest and obstinacy arrayed
                            against the majesty of human rights and human liberty in all the slave-holding states, and

                            THE MANIFESTO. its are interested in perpetuating the evil. See the influence of a few quiet
                            unassuming men on the important subject of war. Half of the civilized world are now
                            convinced of its impropriety and converted to the sentiment of peace, and many who are still
                            under the influence of ancient prejudices in its favor are standing up boldly in defense of
                            peace principles. See also the humane influence exerted in many states, and in some of them
                            almost in every county, to benefit the condition of the helpless, poor and aged, instead of
                            selling them every year to be kept and maintained by the lowest bidder. They are now
                            provided for at the expense of the government, and generally are treated as human beings,
                            worthy of commiseration. The invention of the steam engine and its application to the
                            various purposes of life; carrying commerce almost to the farthest verge of the green earth
                            ; spinning our cotton; drawing water for mechanical purposes ; printing thousands and
                            thousands of books, papers and pamphlets ; reaping grain ; mowing and raking hay, etc., etc.
                            Lastly, time and space almost annihilated by the telegraphic wires. But how is it that
                            within the short space of eighty or ninety years the minds of men should so universally
                            revolt at the idea of the civil and ecclesiastical tyranny to which they used so quietly and
                            tamely to submit. Whence has been derived the astonishing acuteness and intellectual
                            sagacity by which these surprising inventions have been produced and from what source has
                            been derived the almost universally received feeling which now exists among men of learning
                            in regard to the propriety of a social compact of human interests as may be seen in the many
                            attempts to institute communities and connected associations. I can not doubt that all this
                            mighty revolution in mind, all these salutary and glorious improvements in the civil, moral
                            and intellectual world have been produced by the infusion of light from the Spirit world
                            into the minds of men fitted and prepared, by the hand of Providence, for the reception and
                            elucidation of these revelations for the good of the human family. From the hour in which
                            the unwearied mind of Columbus found no rest, until it was wafted by the winds to America,
                            and brought to view a new world, a spiritual influence from the upper world was constantly
                            urging him on and on until the end was answered and the grand object in view was fully
                            attained. And all along down through the annals of time, while the master spirits of the
                            intellectual powers of mind were exhibited in that constellation of great men who flourished
                            in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It was from the foundation thus laid by these
                            pioneers in human progress, as the human mind was just emerging out of the long, dark night
                            of apostacy, that the germ of civil liberty had its rise, and finally terminated in
                            establishing permanent principles under the constitution of the United States. (To be

                            OUR Sister Johanna Freeborn whose earthly existence terminated March 31, was sixty-two years
                            of age, and has been with our people about ten years. She has always manifested a quiet,
                            amiable disposition, ready and willing at all times to do whatever duty required. She has
                            gained the affection of her companions, the respect of all, and can say with the Psalmist,
                            "The Lord is my Shepherd I shall not want yea, though I walk through the valley of the
                            shadow of death, 1 will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they
                            comfort me." We have every reason to believe it is well with her. Prentice says, "O! could I
                            snatch the eagle's plumes And soar to that bright world above Which God's own holy light
                            illumes With glories of eternal love, How gladly every lingering tie That binds me down to
                            earth I' d sever . And leave for that blest home on high This hollow-hearted world forever."
                            The living can always be benefited by every such occasion as this to-day. To renew our vows
                            to be more faithful in our duties, more consecrated to the cause committed to our care, to
                            keep constantly before us, the solemn truth that life is short at best and our abode here is
                            but temporary to discipline and fit us for our final and eternal home. "Our lives are
                            rivers, gliding free To that unfathomed boundless sea, The silent grave. Thither all earthly
                            pomp and boast, Roll, to be swallowed up and lost In one dark wave." And shall we not meet
                            our friends and fellow pilgrims in that home beyond the grave? I believe we will, when we
                            have exchanged mortality, for immortality. The devoted Greek in "Ion" when about to yield up
                            his life was asked, Shall we meet again? replied,"I have asked the question of the hills
                            that look eternal, of the clear streams that flow forever, of the stars, among whose field
                            of azure my raised spirit has walked in glory; all are dumb. But as I gaze on the living
                            face. I feel there is something in the love that mantles through its beauty that can not
                            perish,We shall meet again." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            questions of the day. What she desired offended nature gave, And with that gift, the doom to
                            be a slave, Until the light of gospel truth should shine Into her servile heart, with power
                            Divine; Until, in all the strength of Jachin, she Should rise and slay her deadly enemy;

                            drew nigh. He knew that the body, alone, could be buried, While his spirit so happy and
                            free, Would soar to the mansions of heavenly glory, Where joy and rejoicing would be. He has
                            met with the loved ones who've gone on before, Their welcome, methinks I can hear, "O come
                            dearest brother, we've longed for thy presence, Thy home and thy treasure are here." "A
                            crown of bright glory awaits thy sure coming, And robes of pure white will adorn Thy spirit
                            made pure through deep tribulation, As thou hast the burden and crosses well borne." Our
                            father, so loving, so kind and so gentle, Has past from our sight here below; But he will

                            unyielding in duty, No matter though foes oft opprest; He took for his guidance the will of
                            "Our Father," And silently past into rest. The aged well know of his justice and mercy, The
                            young, ah ! how much they will miss Their father and friend, their earthly protector, Who
                            shared in their sorrows or bliss. Thy life, precious Elder, will be as a pilot To guide us
                            along the lone way, Thy example of purity, virtue and truth, Will be a sure guide from this
                            day. Though storms may arise and foes oft oppress us, And sad seems the journey below ;
                            We'll think of thy zeal and patiently bear it, As on to thy home we may go. Our Elder's not

                            Equality shall be comrades. Walt Whitman. IN the history of men and nations, every great
                            step forward and upward is marked by an awakening of the human consciousness to higher and
                            larger realization of truth and its demands on character and conduct. Involution of the
                            Divine Spirit from above ever accompanies the evolution of material forms and conditions
                            from beneath. We are drawn as well as pushed onward, and every advance brings us not only
                            supremacy over the lower, but also strength and stimulus for fresh effort and still further
                            endeavor. To the awakened and advancing soul, there are always more worlds to conquer. First
                            in a single individual, thence rapidly spreading to hundreds and thousands, a new light
                            shines forth, revealing at once the beauty of the higher, further ground, and the
                            comparative depth and darkness of the lower path by which we have climbed. The Shakers
                            believe that there has always been, is now, and will continue unto the end (if end there
                            shall be,) a divine force intelligently working in humanity to accomplish divine ends. Some
                            special manifestation of this ever flowing God-force has marked the beginning of every great
                            advance in human history. Abraham, Moses and Jesus, mark three distinct progressive cycles
                            of revelation, each summing up the Law and the Prophets of all preceding dispensations and
                            calling for the fulfillment of "every jot and tittle" of the old law in spirit and in truth,
                            while at the same time revealing, in the new light of the latter day, new and higher
                            standards of right, which all who could perceive were summoned to strive towards, if they
                            would truly live. Shakerism, in each of these cycles of the working of the divine afflatus,
                            sees steadily enlarging preparation for the advent among men of human society organically
                            divine. "The Christ Spirit," to the Shakers, means the Spirit of Truth, and while its
                            openings into, and operations upon and through, <pb n="96" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 96 THE MANIFESTO.
                            Abraham, Moses and Jesus are believed to be especially connected and to have near and direct
                            bearing on the evolution of humanity in the Western world, it is as fully recognized that
                            the inspiration of such leaders in the East as Buddah, Krishna and Confucius, were similarly
                            appearances of the Christ Spirit, having special reference to the special needs created by
                            Oriental conditions and lines of development. That at bottom Truth is one, in all times and
                            among all nations, is an axiom of universal acceptance among the Brethren and Sisters of the
                            United Society of Believers in Christ, commonly called "Shakers." A fourth cycle of divine
                            illumination, it is held, was opened in the person of Ann Lee. In a very large and very true
                            sense, Ann Lee, the founder of Shakerism, may be considered the pioneer New Woman. Nearly a
                            century before our women pioneers lifted up their voices for woman's political emancipation,
                            this Manchester blacksmith's daughterthis woman of the people began a valiant battle for
                            woman's moral emancipation. As the revolt of Luther sowed the seeds of American independence
                            aud the French Revolution, so the revolt of this simple and fearless daughter of God, this
                            AngloSaxon Joan of Arc, against woman's moral slavery sowed the seed which the closing years
                            of this century sees ripening into a recognition of woman's true place beside her brother in
                            every field of human effort and advance. When Ann Lee proclaimed the gospel of purity, she
                            inaugurated the first really great woman movement. Her conception of the woman movement,
                            however, was much larger than that of some of its later apostles. With the clearness of
                            vision of a great mother soul, Ann Lee from the first perceived that the true woman movement
                            must not be a sex but a race movement. She instinctively recognized the truth Walt Whitman
                            sings : "Unfolded out of the folds of the woman, man comes unfolded, as is always to come
                            unfolded." So the truth she proclaimed and preached is the truth that shall make men freemen
                            male and female, without regard to sex, race, color, creed or existing condition of
                            servitude. The millennium which Shakerism has in large degree realized, and to the fuller
                            realization of which its history and its teachings point the way, is a social organism in
                            which love shall be the supreme law, and the greatest good of every individual sought and
                            found, as it can only be found, in the greatest good of the social organism, to be attained
                            through absolutely unselfish unity of purpose and interest finding expression in highly
                            organized, intelligent and harmonious unity of action. It is only a truism to say that every
                            human advance has been marked by a breaking of old bonds and the attaining of greater and
                            greater freedom. In Tennyson's dedication To the Queen, he pointed out the chief distinction
                            of Victoria's reign when he wrote : <pb n="97" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 97 "And statesmen
                            at her council met Who knew the seasons when to take Occasion by the hand and make The
                            bounds of freedom wider yet." The successive steps in our growth and progress in art,
                            science, religion, philosophy and government, may as a rule, be traced to movements often
                            small in their beginnings, but gathering force and momentum as they grow, and finally moving
                            on over all obstacles and opposition by the irresistible force of truth. (To be
                        continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="Section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Correspondence" TEIform="index"/>Correspondence.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear Friend;--'Life is real..."

                                of Life, come to mind at this time, and I am impressed to write them. It seems to me
                                that a good, firm, strong faith in the immortality of the sonl is essential to the
                                happiness of our present lives. Never have I felt the land of spirits so near, never
                                have I felt so close a joining to those wrho have gone on before us, as at the present
                                time. The Shaker life is in a great measure calculated to develop the spiritual and
                                prepare souls for the work of higher spheres. This is indeed a holy and a pure gospel,
                                evidencing by its fruits that it is of the Christ Spirit. In your last letter you
                                express much the same feeling which I entertained for some time before coming here. You
                                say you "would be glad to find your place in the world of usefulness, and that you feel
                                like a stranger in a strange land." I remember how I longed to find some people with
                                whom I could share the joys and burdens of life; above all I longed to find some cause
                                worthy of my best effort's. Eureka ! (I have found it.) Indeed everyday that I pass here
                                only increases my desire and determination to make this cause mine, to make myself
                                worthy of so good and true a companionship. Life is now full of good things, not without
                                its rough places to be sure, but so different from the lives of those who have no hope.
                                I feel quite an interest in your travel of soul, for so I must consider your present
                                condition, and would be glad to extend a helping hand or do what is <pb n="98" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 98 THE MANIFESTO. best toward bringing you to a state of rest and peace. Do you not
                                think it would be well for you to investigate our life ? There is room among us for
                                every one who will come with a sincere desire for truth. Our gospel is no respector of
                                persons, all are on a common footing, equality is one of our cardinal principles. This
                                means quite a good deal, and I do not believe that any people can successfully establish
                                a community home except on a religious basis. The spiritual gift must be uppermost, or
                                the people perish. In our life there is a cross to be borne against the carnal nature
                                which we all have inherited, but once the separation from the world is made, and a real
                                gift for the work is obtained, life becomes indeed a blessing. Our life also is
                                necessarily a busy one as we have the material to maintain by hon est industry, but all
                                things are made easy to those who have understanding faith. The real beauty in our home
                                is that we are continually surrounded by those, who like ourselves are earnestly
                                striving for the higher life, ever ready to sustain us in every good and noble effort.
                                The only way for one to know the worth of this faith is to stop theorizing and come and
                                live it. The world is full of theory concerning the Christian life with but few who are
                                earnestly striving to put its principles into practice. I believe that nothing short of
                                the genuine practical life, as taught and lived by the lowly Nazarene, will bring
                                contentment to any in this sphere and everlasting joy to the soul in future states of
                                existence. You say you are troubled with the "blues." That is on account of your
                                solitary life perhaps, and I know the companionship of those who have much faith and
                                hope is a sure cure for that disease. Think the matter over and if you come to any
                                decision, let me know. I have no knowledge of the Colorado Co-operative Colony, but am
                                convinced that all such enterprises have in the past proved futile when established on a
                                purely material basis. Our people know from experience how hard it is to overcome the
                                selfishness of human nature so far as to admit of a successful co-operative or
                                communistic effort. As before stated, nothing but the true spirit of love and
                                forbearance founded upon a life of absolute purity will hold together any Community.

                                of humanity and advancing civilization. Today we know that all things that tend toward
                                the bettering of self-hood, or the advancement of society, are of God; and numberless
                                are the influences that work for our general good. Good literature, exhortations and
                                prayers, are three great forces effectual in the degree that they inspire to moral
                                activity and good works. Shingle sawing and gardening, combined with the usual invasion
                                of housecleaning are now in full operation, demanding consecrated hand service from
                                willing laborers. As willing hands make light work, so genuine heart goodr/ess is
                                productive of results that bespeak a living christliness, by which human life is brought
                                into rapport with the attributes of God. God, the beauty, wisdom and power, That governs
                                this world of ours; Evolves the crude ore into the flue; Makes life sparkle of the

As we look around us we are led to think of the wonderous changes two short
                                months can make. Fields that when we last called at the "Home Corner," were but white,
                                frozen plains, are now teeming with verdure. The trees have exchanged their white
                                garments for graceful and attractive suits of many colors. The birds have once more
                                joined usT and the twittering of the sparrows, the chirping of the friendly robin, the
                                piping of the bluebird and sweet melodies of the oriole, are heard from trees and
                                hedges. It is indeed a pleasant change. As the season for obtaining maple sap arrived, a
                                season which has generally failed to receive a celebration in our locality, our young
                                brother, Kudolph Kirsten became anxious to obtain some of the sweets, and in spite of
                                many prophecies of failure, tapped fifty trees, and for two weeks obtained from them a
                                good supply of excellently flavored sap, which after being duly subjected to the
                                necessary boi ing and purifying, gave as a result about twenty gallons of syrup. Elder
                                Louis, who has been spending a month at Florida, we were glad to welcome in our home
                                once more, and we listened with interest to his description of the "Flowery Land," which
                                has ever held forth so many inducements to the stranger, since the days when the search
                                for the "Spring of Immortal Youth,'" was instigated. Housecleaning is nearly completed.
                                For several weeks the fever raged, each day finding some new place for an attack, and so
                                continued until all places to locate itself were nearly exhausted when it moderated, and
                                is now in a quiet state of convalescence. Brother Ira, who though constantly employed
                                with many duties still is ever ready to do an act of kindness, has furnished us a long
                                hose which will easily carry water to every flower garden on the lawn, thus making the

We are being favored with some nice showers these times which is a blessing we
                                have had to do without, for quite a long time. But Ohio can safely take the blame to
                                herself for her scarcity of showers of rain during the last several years, for the good
                                Lord and Father of us all, had provided a grand and sublime system of irrigation for his
                                Ohio children, and it remained in active and successful operation for a great many
                                years. At last the worship of Mammon, became the all absorbing interest of the
                                inhabitants of our beautiful state. The Father had previously erected thousands and
                                thousands of pumps of the most elegant structure <pb n="102" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 102 THE

                                consisted of beautiful trees scattered all over the land, from end to end of our
                                beautiful state, ome of these irrigating machines were so efficient, that 1000 of them
                                would carry into the atmosphere in one year, 7,000,000 tons of water. All this beautiful
                                machinery of the Lord's planting, has been ruthlessly torn away, so we are now, and have
                                been for several years, suffering for our lust and greed of the Almighty dollar, and we
                                are so blindly infatuated by this sordid Moloch of selfishness, that we are making no
                                provision for anything better by passing forestry laws for the piotection of what few

                                to her original moisture and fertility. History assures us, that millions of acres of
                                land in Persia and China, once fertile as the garden of Eden, are now weird wastes of
                                sand, on which not one spear of grass can be found and all from the ruthless destruction
                                of the forests with which they were formerly clothed. Well! I suppose we must learn by
                                what we suffer. Egypt and Algiers are rainless regions, but since the French have
                                occupied the latter, they have sunk Artesian wells, and set out hundreds and thousands
                                of trees, now they have several fine showers in a season and expect to entirely restore
                                the country to a rich standard of fertility in process of time. Well! we are all well
                                and things are going at about their usual rate and the times are rather barren of
                                incident. During the last winter a good deal of repairing has been done also painting
                                and whitewashing. We have a grand prospect of fruit, if the frost will only let it

Louisa M. Alcott is said to reveal herself in
a most interesting way in a number of letters
(written to five little girls) which are to appear in the April Ladies'1 Home Journal. These
letters were written during the busiest period
of Miss Alcott's life, anil present a pen picture of the author drawn by her own master
hand. In these she talks with singular frankness of herself, her work, her aims, her home,
her spiritual belief, and of the influence that
directed her to literature. She never saw any
of her five correspondents, but their youthful
frankness, intense interest in all her writings,
and their love for the author and for the char
acters of her creations, impelled her to turn
aside from her work and cares to find diversion in chats with sujh eagerly enthusiastic,
admiring and sympathetic friends. Miss Alcott's first letter is dated 1872, and the others
were written at intervals up to within a short
time of her death.
