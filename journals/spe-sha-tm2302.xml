                            was born May 2, 1804. This fulness of years has been conscientiously and consecratedly
                            devoted to God according to the best of his understanding, comprehension and ability. He

                            journey beyond the boundaries of time, and had actually gone, as he had often sung, "to
                            explore the land of souls," some kind friends at the Central Society, gave us immediate
                            notice, with an invitation to be present during the funeral service. All the Ministry and
                            Elders of the Eastern Societies, received a corresponding word. As the funeral was to be
                            held on Sunday trie 13th of Nov., and the telegram not having been received till Saturday
                            the 12th, it gave us a very limited time to arrange for so long a journey, and be able to
                            reach a station not many miles distant from the Society of Mt. Lebanon. In a conference held
                            at 6-30 a. m. on the morning of the 12th, it was proposed for Elder Henry C. Blinn, Elder
                            Nicholas A. Briggs, Eldress Joanna J. Kaime and Eldress Eliza A. Stratton, to represent the
                            Society of Canterbury, at the funeral of Elder Daniel. A journey of twelve miles over bad
                            roads consumed several hours, and we were obliged to take the afternoon train from the city
                            of Concord. From delays at Nashua and Worcester, we did not reach the city of Pittsfield,
                            Mass., till 11-45 p. m. As our arrival had been anticipated by Br. Ira Lawson, (although on
                            an earlier train,) a coach was in waiting for us, and we were soon before the doors of the
                            American Hotel, where we received the kindest of attention. At an early hour on Sabbath
                            morning we were notified that Br. Levi Shaw, who was on his way to Mt. Lebanon, had invited
                            us to ride with him to the Village. A nice carriage, a beautiful span of horses and a
                            careful driver were at the door of the Hotel, FEBRUARY, 1893.<pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 26 THE MANIFESTO. which were sent for Br. Levi by the dear friends of the North family,
                            with an invitation for us to accompany him. Quietly we wended our way, in the stillness of
                            the Sabbath morning, till we reached the village of Hancock, where we met two or three kind
                            friends and exchanged heart-felt salutations. Our journey over the mountain was all that one
                            might desire at this season of the year, and the best term to use in speaking of it is,
                            "awfully grand." At 9-15 we reached the Trustees' Office, at the Church, and were met with a
                            warm and cordial welcome from hands and hearts of our dear gospel friends. We breakfasted at
                            0-30 and soon after were introduced to tho^e friends who had arrived at an earlier date.

                            entertained at the Novitiate Order and the others at the Church family. During our visit in
                            Mt. Lebanon we spent one half day among the dear friends at the North family, and as usual,
                            the term closed quite too soon. A brief visit was enjoyed with lovingfriends, at the Church,
                            and the same with those of the Center, Second and South families. We highly appreciated our
                            privilege as in the presence of our beautiful, gospel relation we saw the impress of the
                            word of God as it came through the ministration of our blessed Mother, Ann Lee. On Wednesday
                            morning Elder Daniel Offord gave us safe conduct over the mountain, and we then learned that
                            all the other invited friends had left the village one or two days in advance of us. We
                            spent, by invitation, a few hours with our loving, gospel friends in Hancock, and in the p.

                            through the rain, and over that mountainous road, enlisted for him our deepest sympathy, and
                            gospel love.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Blinn, Henry C." TEIform="persName"/>Henry C.

                            morning at six o'clock the 13th gf November, in the �9th year of his age. He was born in
                            South Union, Logan Co., Ky., May 7, 1804 and came to Mt. Lebanon, when only ten years of
                            age. Since grown to manhood he has filled many places of care and trust, in the Society of
                            Believers where he early found his home. For the last thirty years he has officiated as
                            senior Elder in the order of Ministry and was a spiritual director of all the Societies of
                            Believers. On Sunday afternoon of the 15th inst. at two o'clock, the funeral services were
                            held in the Mt. Lebanon, meeting-house. A large assemblage of Believers was present, not
                            only from the parent Society, but representatives from seven of the eastern Communities,
                            whose presence and assistance greatly added to the interest of the services. The Mt. Lebanon
                            Ministry with whom Elder Daniel Boler had been associated, until within a few months of his
                            demise, came from Watervliet, N. Y., to participate in the last duties conferred upon our
                            beloved father in Israel. Though age and infirmity had somewhat weakened the stalwart frame
                            and dimmed the bright intellect; yet before the vision of all, rose the great soul, "so true
                            in word and tried in deed," the lustre of whose character time could not dim, neither could
                            age warp the dignity and grace of unblemished manhood. In the realization of his benign and
                            glorified presence there came from the hearts and lips of his noble sons and daughters whom
                            he had counseled and guided in wisdom through all the years of his ministration, words of
                            truthful eulogy. Elder Joseph Holden addressed the audience with appropriate remarks
                            relative to the last tribute and duties to be paid to the deceased, and then said :�"I
                            kindly welcome our gospel friends who have come from the several Communities, to bear us
                            company on this peculiar occasion. I am impressed with the great love and gratitude which
                            are for the blessing of association with upright souls who are faithfully bearing the cross
                            and walking the straight way of self-denial in humility of spirit. I have ever felt the
                            divine unction that rested upon our beloved gospel father, which enabled him to be a
                            minister of good gifts to souls, and it is my desire that the same gift may still rest upon
                            our Zion. I pray that I may be clothed with the same spirit of anointing. With a heart full
                            of welcome for all we shall wish for the freedom of the spirit to rest upon every speaker."
                            How true these words,� "Did we not witness in the life of tliee, Immortal prophecy? [steps
                            trod And feel when with tliee that thy footAn everlasting road ? '' An appropriate hymn was
                            then rendered by the singers, entitled the "Harvest Reward." "Hushed are the strivings of
                            nature, Calm and serene the new day; A loved one has crossed the dark river, Borne from
                            earth's sorrows away.<pb n="28" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. Strong as the oak in
                            its planting, Vernal in spring-tide of youth, So was thy shadow of blessing, Broad and
                            expansive in truth. Eighteousness throned in thy temple, Filled it with glory and grace, Led
                            thee in strait paths of duty; Honored thy calling and place. Zion, thy interest and
                            treasure, Brings a love offering, free; And with a sweet song of welcome, Angels are waiting

                            crown of thy merit, Eich thy harvest reward." Eldress Harriet Bullard who has been a member,
                            for several years of the order of Ministry, in company with Elder Daniel Boler, made a few
                            remarks. She dwelt upon the great interest that Elder Daniel felt in sustaining the cause,
                            and his anxiety that Believers should keep a separation from the world and build upon the
                            sure foundation laid in Zion. "Our gospel father possessed a gift of wisdom and was
                            eminently just: he always spoke the truth in plainness and could meet and adjust
                            difficulties with calmness of spirit, because he had carefully subdued his own spirit. He
                            never swerved from principle to meet individual favor ; but gospel order was yea and amen,
                            and though often, seemingly, stern in correction, he bore with him the fatherly spirit, and
                            a desire not to hurt 'the oil and the wine' in any individual." Eldress Augusta Stone, the
                            companion of Eldress Harriet, said, "I have lived from infancy in the Church family at Mt.
                            Lebanon, and have known our good father more than forty years. Integrity and uprightness
                            were marked features in his life, while the spirit of consecration was characteristic in all
                            that claimed his attention. Elder Daniel had a correct idea of equality. He did not want any
                            indulgence or extra attention, in the supplying of his physical needs, because of his age or
                            position. We have, dear Brethren and Sisters, left for us the bright example of a true
                            Christian character." The hymn entitled, "Happy Change" was then sung. How happy the
                            immortal mind That rests beneath Jehovah's wings, Who sweet employment there can find,
                            Without the help of earthly things. When such shall lay their bodies by, And from their
                            manual labor cease, They'll find a band of angels nigh, To guard them safe to realms of
                            peace. 0 may I know and prize my day, My span of time, how swift it rolls! 1 soon must leave
                            this mortal clay, And then explore the land of souls. Elder Calvin Gr. Reed, of Mt. Lebanon
                            then spoke, "1 have shared an intimate acquaintance with beloved Elder Daniel Boler, for
                            more than sixty years and always found him strong and unwavering in the gospel cause, as is
                            expressed in the verse, "Strong as the oak in its planting, Vernal in spring-tide of youth,
                            So was thy shadow of blessing Broad and expansive in truth." "The breadth of his love and
                            sympathies was not measured by an earthly standard : his interest was universal for
                            Believers and he prized his union and relation to true Brethren and Sisters everywhere. His
                            gift of blessing was broad and expansive, for he 28<pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 29 lived only to do good and to plant in the souls of others, a love for truth
                            and righteousness. Elder Timothy Rayson, of M8. Lebanon, read a poem that was written for
                            the occasion, by Sister Amelia J. Calver. He supplemented this with a few remarks relative
                            to the long life of usefulness that was crowned with glory and honor. He has left a record
                            and example that we all may emulate, reaching, through faithfulness, the same glorious
                            victory and blessed reward." We felt while we were singing the simple song, "While all of
                            Mother's children meet within her mansions fair," that the heavenly hosts drew near and many
                            of the ancients of the city joined in the sweet music. The song was so full and strong that
                            the whole house was filled. Elder Frederick W. Evans, of Mt. Lebanon, made affectionate
                            reference to beloved Elder Daniel, and then said, �"I want to thank our good Brother, James
                            Little, for his very kind care of Elder Daniel, during his term of sickness. Br. James is a
                            young Believer, and has entered the Community in advanced years, but he well merits the love
                            and blessing and appreciation of all the Brethren and Sisters for his faithfulness." Elder
                            Frederick then referred to some of his own experience as a reformer, and contrasted the
                            difference between the present and past; said he, "I brought gold and silver into the
                            Community, which were the truths pertaining to physiology and hygiene. When the Societies
                            were organized, the people brought with them all the habits of the old Egyptian state, and
                            they had not the light nor the power to change. The first cycle did its work in laying the
                            foundation of the kingdom of heaven, and I hope that in the next cycle of progress, we may
                            see great advancement." "I have an affectionate regard for our beloved Elder Daniel. He
                            always exercised a very kindly interest toward me, and was always charitable and consistent,
                            even though we might not always be able to see eye to eye on all subjects that were under
                            discussion." We were glad to have with us the saintly presence of our aged Brother, Elder
                            Albert Battles of the Ministry of Hancock and Enfield, and to hear his sincere testimony of
                            truth. His love and practice of righteousness found full accord with the life and teachings
                            of our worthy father, with whom he had many years of acquaintance. He said, Elder Daniel's
                            wisdom and judgment were known and valued and he prayed that all would adhere to gospel
                            principles as Elder Daniel had done that we might be blessed and prospered. Elder John
                            Whiteley, of the Ministry of Harvard and Shirley, Mass., then remarked,�"I know I can not do
                            justice to my feelings on this occasion, though I have known Elder Daniel many years and
                            always to love and revere him as a wise counselor; as a remarkably strong defender of
                            righteousness and justice on all occasions where he was called to act. One whom it was safe
                            to follow, but it is with great pleasure that I am able to be here and add my testimony of
                            love and respect to the departed. I also am<pb n="30" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 30 THE
                            MANIFESTO. happy to meet so many whom I believe have come with the same feeling. I am
                            especially glad to see so many young people in the assembly and know from experience that
                            they could not do better to secure happiness in time and eternity than to pattern after the
                            lovely example set us by our departed father and friend, Elder Daniel Boler. I will make it
                            my labor the few remaining days, months or years that may be allotted to me, and hope all
                            present may feel it their duty and privilege to do the same. I have brought kindly greetings
                            of love and sympathy from gospel relation at Harvard and Shirley, and hope all may receive
                            them." Elder John B. Vance of the Ministry of Alfred and Gloucester, Me., said :�"It gives
                            me great pleasure to meet so many Believers though the occasion brings serious reflections.
                            We mourn not as the world mourned when the ripened fruit was gathered, but �would rather
                            sing the 'Harvest Reward.' " "In reflecting upon the character of our beloved father, the
                            words of the Psalmist came to mind, 'Mark the perfect man and behold the upright, for the
                            end of that man is peace.' I thought that King David had such a man in his mind as Elder
                            Daniel, if one existed in that day. I suppose there were those at that time who lived up to
                            their knowledge of the truth and in so living found justification. But with increasing light
                            and knowledge the standard is lifted higher, bringing new duties, new crosses and a higher
                            degree of perfection from the days of the Psalmist, to this day." "We hear much about
                            reforms and progression but we may be assured every step in advance compelling us to leave
                            something behind, brings its crosses. If we do not find this, but greater indulgences called
                            for, that is retrogression." He spoke of how much Elder Daniel was respected and loved in
                            the Societies outside of his Mt. Lebanon home by those now living, and the saints gone on
                            before, naming Elder Otis Sawyer, Elder Elijah Myrick and Elder Harvey L. Eads, whose
                            voices, if we could hear them, would unite with ours in singing the praises of our beloved
                            father. "Who shall say a more perfect man ever lived ? " Turning to the young people, he
                            said "You aie considering what your future lives shall be. Are you ambitious? What nobler
                            ambition can be yours than to strive to become like Elder Daniel Holer? The aged are fast
                            passing away and your duty is to prepare yourselves to take up their burdens. People who
                            have no sympathy with our manner of living, seeing the aged passing away, and but few coming
                            to take their places, wag their heads and say, 'The Shakers are running out and soon the
                            places that knew them will know them no more ? ' I have heard this story for fifty years,
                            but we still live. Truth is eternal and any person or people building upon that foundation
                            can not fail." Eldkk Abraham Perkins of Enfield, N. H., who bears the weight of eightyfive
                            years with grace and dignity, added his testimony to the virtuous and noble manhood of him
                            whom he claimed as a spiritual father, counselor and<pb n="31" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE

                            time lie hud received great good, his love, faith and hope, were strengthened and increased
                            by intercourse with gospel kindred. He acknowledged the Christ Anointing that rested upon
                            the ministerial order, and he hoped that the spiritual gift would sustain it. Elder Henry C.
                            Blink, of Canterbury, N. H., remarked;� "It is a great privilege to be invited to enter the
                            house of the Lord, and on such an occasion as this, although embodying the sad remembrance
                            of a final farewell to a dear friend and Elder; it becomes a privilege of the deepest
                            interest. We have not met to mourn without hope, but rather in commemoration of a
                            translation into a higher sphere of action, and to bear witness of the blessedness of the
                            consecrated life of a good man and of one who was universally loved and respected." 1'Elder
                            Daniel has faithfully closed his labors on the earth, and has been blessed to live to a full
                            fruition of days, before the final farewell. In harmony with the inspired writer we may well
                            say, 'Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord, for from henceforth, they shall rest from
                            their labors, and their works do follow them.' While this season is a witness of our love
                            and affection for our beloved Elder Daniel, it is more directly for the benefit of those who
                            are present, and are the active workers of to-day." "The great progress which has been made
                            since the organization of our Communal homes should encourage us to move on with an
                            increasing zeal. It is God's light that shines so beautifully, above and around us. Let us
                            abide in this light and as we pass through the different degrees of religious experience,
                            carefully preserve the gift of our union. If the increasing light opens before us new
                            avenues and an order of life more in harmony with that light, let us receive the truth and
                            step forward upon this new ground. We need not fear the increasing selfdenial, nor the power
                            which brings to us the salvation of either soul or body." "If Mother Ann and the little
                            company with her were able to hold fast the everlasting gospel of truth, amidst all the
                            trials and persecutions, and physical deprivations, how much greater zeal and devoted
                            interest should we manifest who are blessed with beautiful homes and the combined strength
                            of so many faithful souls who form our Societies of to-day." ' 'Upon the beloved Ministry
                            who are present with us, we ask the blessing of God, and that more than the mantle of Elijah
                            may fall upon them, to aid them in the ministration of blessing and love to all who have
                            accepted the gospel testimony of Mother Ann." Eldress Joanna J. Kaime of the Ministry of
                            Canterbury and Enfield, N. H., united in the giving of love and remarked:� "I heartily
                            respond to the beautiful and truthful sentiments that have been expressed. Elder Daniel
                            Boler was my ideal of a noble and true man. In the gift of spiritual ministration, in which
                            he stood he was more than man, he was God-man ; the divine spirit was uppermost in
                            ministering to those who felt the need of salvation from the sins<pb n="32" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 32 THE MANIFESTO. of the world and from the errors and imperfections of
                            the natural man and woman. We have great cause of rejoicing in our union and spiritual
                            relation." Eldress Eliza A. Stratton said that Elder Daniel's life was a light to the
                            Christian traveler; those who have been favored to know his life through daily association,
                            sharing an appreciation of the same, never need stumble for the absence of an ever present
                            light to their feet There are those present better acquainted with the good father than mtmy
                            of us at Canterbury, yet the much good that we have gathered and cherished by his frequent
                            visits will remain choice as a beacon light marking the way on our Christian journey. Elder
                            George Wilccx of Enfield, Conn., said:�"1 feel deeply the importance of living up to that
                            faith that has always proved a 'savor of life unto life.' Elder Daniel I'oler was a
                            consecrated soul, full of the spirit of humility, lie never boasted of his gifts or merits,
                            but was content to do the will of God and perform every duty assigned him with
                            conscientiousness and in the interest of Zion. 1 pray that the same spirit may be over all
                            of us and that we may love and bless our gospel relation." Such sincerity, earnestness and
                            loving expression coming from a truly honest soul, could but touch every heart. Elder
                            Nicholas A. Brings, was the next speaker. "It does not become me to say much on such an
                            occasion, but I am reminded that the many left at home on the hills of Canterbury, and who
                            would be much pleased to be here 13-day, would wish me to say for them : We loved Elder
                            Daniel and we know he loved us. He has said that he did, and he was a man of truth, and
                            besides he has proved it by very many labors in our behalf. May we not confidently hope that
                            the spirit of our dear father, like that fabled bird of old, will rise and live again to
                            bless our efforts, and help us in our times of great need?" "As I look upon these hoary
                            heads before me, these leaders in Zion, these fathers in Israel, and think that a few short
                            years will see them all joined to Elder Daniel in his spirit home, I am led to inquire most
                            anxiously how will their places be filled ? Who will assume their responsibilities and bear
                            the heavy burdens so long and so nobly borne by them ? The solving- of this question is of
                            immense importance to our Society to-day." "Another subject claims our attention,�the Union
                            of Believers, than which none is more worthy of anxious consideration. Upon this hangs our
                            destiny. Our Very existence as a people depends upon it. ]n the first place we must
                            acknowledge Mt. Lebanon to be our Center of Union. In our Eastern homes we have been taught
                            from early childhood to look here as to our spiritual Mecca, from whence flows gifts of
                            blessing and gospel increase. This is right. May it continue is my earnest prayer, and to
                            this end I will contribute strong, personal effort, and whatever influence I am able to
                            command." Eldek Hiram C. Baker of Enfield, N. H., remarked :�"I esteem it a priv-<pb n="33" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFES TO. ilege at this time to meet my gospel kindred
                            assembled to pay our respects, the last we can render, to Elder Daniel Boler, our dear
                            father and friend, whose life has been faithfully given in Christian service for the
                            salvation of s-oul* " " I o be numb, red with the righteous, so many devotedly engaged in

                            realize to be to me the grateest of blessings. With you, I pledge myself to be true to the
                            cause in faithfully maintaining its principles as our father has done." Elder Louis Basting
                            of Hancock, Mass., said:�"It is not strange that I should feel somewhat diffident to address
                            an audience like the one before me, when so many whose age and experience so far exceed
                            mine, have preceded me. But I can say that every word spoken in praise of Elder Daniel's
                            life and character has my full union and support. ' It has been my good fortune to meet our
                            departed leader a number of times, and several interviews were deeply impressive. The words
                            of solemn counsel and wisdom then received will abide with me while life and consciousness
                            exist. I am glad to know that he is released from suffering, that he has been called home to
                            rest from his labors and to enjoy the reward he has earned for himself. Surely it is well
                            with him. I have no doubt that he has met Elder Giles, and others who were his fellow
                            laborers here, in joy and glory. I think his reception to spirit life must have been
                            somewhat like as England's great poet describes it,�a poet but recently passed away, whose
                            verses belong to the whole world, because they speak to the human heart:" "The great
                            Intelligences fair That range above our mortal state, In circle round the blessed gate,
                            lleceivedand gave him welcome there; And led him thro' the blissful climes, And showed him
                            in the fountain fresh All knowledge that the sons of flesh Shall gather in the cycled
                            times." "This implies not only a state of felicity, but also increased knowledge. We can not
                            obtain all knowledge in this life ; much is hidden from mortal sight that will appear in the
                            life to come. God in his infinite wisdom h:is placed us in this world for a wise purpose ;
                            he has revealed himself through a Savior whose life and teachings ai\^ before us as an
                            infallible guide to final and full redemption. Elder Daniel's influence for good has been
                            felt in the remotest bounds of Zion. 1 feel assured that the gift of God has rested upon him
                            as it has upon Mother Ann and her successors. And we are thankful that the Order of which he
                            was the worthy head and leader, remains with us to-day. In no other way can we better honor
                            his memory than by rendering a loving, loyal support to those upon whom the chief burden now
                            rests." Brother Ira R. Lawson spoke affectionately of the departed one and felt the
                            necessity of adhering to gospel principles, and walking in the uprightness of our pure and
                            holy faith. A new hymn entitled, "Only Arisen" was sung in the unison of the spirit. (See
                            page 54 of this Manifesto.) Eldress Anna White of Mt. Lebanon read, "The Victor," a sonnet,
                            written expressly for the occasion by Sister Martha J. Anderson. 33<pb n="34" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 34 THE MANIFESTO. Like a brave knight in panoply of war, He laid his
                            armor by with kingly grace, Life's battles he has fought, and run the race And nobly won the
                            garter and the star. Bring laurels fair ye sons from near and far! Bring blossoms rare O

                            wielded trusted power With righteousness has meted out her dower, And, guided by the perfect
                            light within, Has wrought for good each passing day and hour, Has conquered self, and
                            vanquished every sin. Eldress Caroline Helfricii, of the Ministry of Hancock and Enfield
                            Conn, expressed her union with what had been said, and was thankful for the present
                            manifestation of the spirit of God. Elder Andrew D. Barrett of Harvard, Mass, said;�"I feel
                            the importance of all that has been spoken in the meeting. To assemble with the Brethren and
                            Sisters at Mt. Lebanon, reminds me of the many privileges in years past. I am grateful for
                            the instruction and guidance, of early years and for that planting of faith that has kept me
                            safe under all trials and temp. tations, and I bless all who have ministered the gospel of
                            salvation. Elder Daniel was to me a true father and friend and I have always loved and
                            honored him. I now realize the presence of Elder Daniel and of others who have passed from
                            our midst in years gone by. They still feel an interest in the welfare and prosperity of our
                            Zi on home." Eldress Harriet Bullard then spoke of Eldress Ann Taylor and of her extended
                            labors in the Order of Ministry, and invited Eldress Ann to come forward and receive the
                            love and blessing from the hands and hearts of her Brethren and Sisters. Eldress Arm came
                            forward and there was a general expression, and a pleasant manifestation of love, from every
                            one present. We could readily have voic d the words of the po?t;� Thrice blest whose lives
                            are faithful prayers Whose loves in higher love endure; What souls possess themselves so
                            pure, Or is there blessedness like theirs? The sunshine of our mother's sweet, gracious
                            spirit gave a cheerful aspect for the moment to the occasion. She spoke beautifully of the
                            good Brother whose joys and sorrows she had shared through the long years of official care
                            and burden. She thought all had been said that could be, and that Elder Daniel must feel
                            very happy. Thanking the Brethren and Sisters for th &gt; kind attention, she now hoped
                            that while she lived, her life might still be lovingservice to the household of faith. We
                            next sang; � "Strong the ties that bind us to }7ou." The beloved Ministry asked the blessing
                            of the people to rest upon that Order, and manifested great humility of spirit and
                            dependence on the gift of Clod. A heavy responsibility rested upon them to deal justly and
                            to maintain the gospel in its purity. They asked to be ministers of truth and saving power
                            to the people. Bit. Robekt Valentine of Mt. Lebanon remarked ;�"I have known beloved Elder
                            Daniel for more than sixty years. He has been to me a counselor a guide and a Savior. He has
                            helped me through the struggles and temptations of youth and young manhood and planted my

                            Pomekoy of Hancock although advanced in years and in feeble health, added a few choice words
                            to the already full and glorious meed of praise. The assembly then knelt in silent prayer.
                            Elder Joseph Holden again remarked;�"Doubtless there are others who would be pleased to
                            speak, but as our meeting has continued two and one half hours, and as the day is closing,
                            the Brethren must attend to the last duties, and the funeral services are closed." We
                            returned to our several homes with a feeling that a beautiful life which had borne the
                            fulness of immortal fruit had gone from our midst, but the influence and overshadowing
                            presence of a greater good remained to bless, strengthen and encourage us to go and act well
                            our part in our respective spheres of duty;�all striving to build up the interests of our

                            infirmity and gradual approach to the nether shore, of our most worthy father in God�Elder
                            Daniel Boler�yet the announcement of his actual exit from time gave me a shock and a tremor.
                            The loss to the Church seemed so utterly irreparable ! The departure from our midst of such
                            wisdom and love, such ripe experience, such heroic self-abnegation and selfsacrifice for the
                            good of others, is indeed far beyond my power to portray, as I look back through my Official
                            relation and connection with Elder Daniel. In these things which are the essentials and
                            substantials of a Christian life he may have had parallels, but Superiors, never. His desire
                            that union and harmony prevail in the Church, among all classes, and his zeal to promote the
                            same was unceasing. He once said to me, "Elder Oliver, I will maintain my union with all for
                            I can not do without it, even if I must obtain it by asking forgiveness for things I have
                            neither said nor done, but which the aggrieved party really believes I have. But I must
                            remove the stumbling-block some way and have union and good feeling restored." Now, "If
                            lie's not a good Believer Who makes such a sacrifice, Then was Christ a grand deceiver, And
                            the Scriptures, pointed lies." To speak of good Elder Daniel's personal righteousness and
                            practical purity, his complete elevation above the selfish, rudimental, animal plane of
                            life, would be an act of supererogation, his lovely and holy life having been one long and
                            complete demonstration of the same, "a living epistle known and read of all men." Finally in
                            my meditations upon the life of one who has so thoroughly "made of justioe a measuring line,
                            and of righteousness a plummet," I can only say in the solemn words of the rapt seer of old,

                            Communities for more than half a century, quietly passed away at seven minutes past six
                            o'clock on the morning of the 11th. instant. He has left the burdens and cares of his
                            important and responsible position to his successor, Elder Joseph Holden. Elder Daniel
                            passed a useful life. But few�very few�of the denizens of this earth sphere have ever passed
                            through it, from the cradle to the grave, leaving such a gracious record. He was not of the
                            world, for when only ten years of age he was called out of the world, as Jesus was called
                            out of it when young. To the public generally he was not a great and showy man. His name was
                            not blazoned forth by the press, nor eulogized by orators; yet he was the senior Elder of
                            the whole Shaker Order, consisting of seventeen Societies of the Believers in Christ's
                            Second Appearing in the female order, as its first appearing was in the male order, through
                            Jesus. We may almost say of Elder Dan'el <pb n="37" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO.
                            37 that "his life was hidden with Christ in God." It was indeed from the public gaze, for he
                            was a quiet, unostentatious, peaceable, home Brother. He was best beloved by those the most
                            like him. These knew him intimately and they knew personally that he was "a man to be
                            wondered at." A man who, by self-control and self-denial, had conquered self, subdued pride
                            and ambition, and extirpated lust. He was pure in heart and in thought. He was an
                            overcome!1, being "arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, the righteousness of the saints."
                            He was a pillar in the Eesurrection Temple, to go no more out forever, whether in or out of
                            the earth body. In Elder Daniel's life and character was written the "new name, the name of
                            his God and of the City of his God,�the New Jerusalem, which is coming down from God, out of
                            Heaven to earth." That city has been formed by human beings ceasing to do evil in all
                            things, temporal and spiritual, whilst yet on earth. For more than sixty years, Elder Daniel
                            has been a Leader, and such a leader as filled his followers' ideal of what the Nazarene was
                            ; of him who said : ' 'The works that I do ye shall do also, and greater works than these
                            shall ye do," for better conditions would be theirs than Jesus had been placed under. To the
                            twelve disciples, Jesus was God incarnated. But Elder Daniel has had more than twelve
                            hundred disciples, who believe that the Christ spirit was incarnated in him. They were the
                            "little flock," whom he led in virtue's ways of pleasantness and peace. The great, busy
                            world will not miss him ; but he will be missed very much by the little flock, to whom he
                            has been as a sun of righteousness; for they had personal knowledge of his real character
                            and believed in their hearts that he was a Savior who had come upon Mount Zion to judge the
                            Mount of Esau�the natural man� beginning with Daniel Boler. One writer has said that, "there
                            was a great deal of Heaven in being in Hell with those you love, and a great deal of Hell in
                            being in Heaven with those you do not love." Hence the wisdom of the new commandment: that '
                            'Ye love one another." Shakerism Is a unique institution. Progress is its motto. But there
                            can be no progress without change, and change is always a trying process, whether to an
                            individual or to a system. We anticipate seven stages of progress, through which the
                            successive classes of Shakers will pass during their travel toward the final stage when God
                            will be all in all. The people will see eye to eye, and all will know truth, from the least
                            to the greatest, not knowing mediators to say, "Know the Lord !" During the life-time of
                            Elder Daniel, marvelous changes have taken place. The gospel has been passing from the first
                            into the second of the seven cycles. It has been a continuous struggle between the old and

                            gathered, ignored hygiene and physiology ; diet and ventilation, drainage and bathing, had

                            stultified. of Spiritualism had its origin in the Shaker Order. Seven years before the
                            Rochester rappings began to attract attention, Spiritualism was in actual, practical
                            operation throughout the congeries of Societies of Believers. It was a powerfully efficient
                            agent in effecting the changes called for, and indispensable to the introduction of the
                            first principles of the second cycle of progress in the Shaker Order. Without the aid of
                            thousands of spirits, the changes that have since become firmly established in the Shaker
                            Church would have been utterly impossible. These spirits foretold to the Shakers the advent
                            of Spiritualism in the outside world four years before the movement began at Rochester, and
                            its subsequent history up to the present time. They also foretold much in the future of our
                            government, of Church and State union, now consummated in closing the World's Fair to the
                            whole world one seventh of the time, contrary to reason, to the rights of humanity, to
                            liberty of conscience and to the Scriptures, which they term the "Word of God." Spiritualism

                            churches,�and the statesmen in the old earth, the civil government, have put Spiritualism
                            down as a gigantic fraud. But, as an editor has remarked, it "did not stay put down worth a
                            single cent." It has brow-beaten the Babylonian priests of all denominations ; mocked, as
                            Elijah of old mocked Baal. The statesmen Members of their own families become mediums, and
                            their dead refuse to remain in the costly coffins and sepulchres provided for them. What can
                            they do when such a man as Greeley becomes "entangled in the meshes of Spiritualism?" To
                            Shakerism, Spiritualism has introduced Vegetarianism, Prohibition, Anti-Tobacco, Peace,
                            non-resistance, Divine Revelation adapted to the present needs of humanity, Celibacy as

                            glittering structure. A monument, needing neither granite, marble, nor gold. It was reared
                            through devotion to God from early childhood, until feeble old age. Stone by stone the
                            foundation was laid. First, honesty, purity, self-sacrifice, forgiveness, charity and love

                            called from his children, To mansions where hundreds of millions convene, To tell of their
                            pilgrimage, pleasures and trials And share in a grandeur, unheard of, unseen. O what a blest

                            should contribute toward enlarging and perpetuating the record of his high character, and of
                            his virtuous life. As a boy, this was his early home. And here his father and mother resided
                            for five years. The great Revivals which prevailed in this western country from 1805 to
                            1808, bore abundant fruit in the awakening and conversion of many souls. The Divine power
                            was manifested by the sacrifices which many made to follow Christ, and William Boler was one
                            who was brought under the influence of that gracious outpouring of the Divine spirit. He
                            connected himself with the United Society of Believers at South Union, in 1808, with his
                            family and remained here until 1814. In that year he took his son Daniel to Pleasant Hill,
                            and from thence to Mt. Lebanon, N. Y., to avoid the spirit of persecution which prevailed at
                            that time, against the Believers. This section of country was at that date almost a
                            wilderness ; yet on foot, with the boy Daniel, who frequently rode on his father's back, or
                            walked with him, they traversed the woods; and animated by an unfaltering trust and faith in
                            God and the truth of his promises, made their way for many weary miles to Mt. Lebanon. See
                            what faith the father displayed ! His son Daniel evidenced in his life and character the
                            same traits which characterized his father. Brought up to faithful manual labor, and to
                            patience and fortitude, early taught the principles of morality and of religion, he pursued
                            a consistent and upright path through life. He leaves the record of an example of good
                            deeds, and of triumph over the sins of the world. He lived a long life of usefulnesss, and
                            we are much gratified in surveying the beauty of his life-work to think that he commenced
                            his Christian journey at South Union.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Anon" TEIform="persName"/>Anon.</byline></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">[The following pieces were impressed upon the mind of one of our Sisters, a few

                            Having lived in the Society from early youth to extreme old age, he has been a Leader for
                            many years, and as a Leader, was fearless in perf fining his duty and what he knew to be

                            the last of his administration, yet his charity for the erring of the flock was unbounded.
                            It was not only by precept he taught, but by example as well. Able pens may write eulogies
                            to the departed, monuments may be reared to his memory, but to such as our good father, the

                            he has left. As he often expressed it, the love of his Brethren and Sisters was more to him
                            than anything the world could give. He was ever an honest and upright Shaker. He made a full

                            kingdom of Christ. We trust he may be able, with those faithful souls who have passed over
                            the river, to help us in this day of need. As a Minister, much of his time was spent at
                            Watervliet, and he has many friends at the Valley who mourn his loss. We know he had a deep
                            affection for the people at this place; but while we miss , his presence, we know our loss
                            is his gain as his physical strength was failing under the weight of years. We can add,

                            Holy Mother Wisdom, describing the reception in heaven, of those who keep the gospel to the
                            end of earth-life. She says, "I will clothe you with garments brighter than the noonday sun
                            ; then will I say to you, be joyful, your glory has but just begun." Such is the distinction
                            Wisdom confers on her children, through the life-long exercise and development of their
                            wisdom. Elder Daniel's gospel was well expressed in a little melody learned when on a visit
                            to Canterbury, and which always reminds me of him, perhaps because I first heard him sing it
                            with that energy peculiar to his power of ministration. "Lift up the standard, And let
                            forgiveness flow, For the power of our gospel is love. Love for the erring, And love for the
                            strong, Love that bears the burden All the way along." I once heard him say concerning his
                            youthful period of temptation and trial, that love held him to Believers till faith was
                            formed. Combined with his lion-like courage and fortitude, was the gentleness of the lamb,
                            and the kindness and mercy that forgave, without waiting to be solicited. He was firm as
                            iron to uphold the standard of virgin purity, and strong to bear the burden of dutiful
                            service, all the way along. And all this through his love for the cause, and for the people.
                            His love and meekness were such that he could speak the truth in plainness, and leave only
                            wounds that would heal, for the wounded could see the wisdom and necessity of the truth
                            spoken, and feel that love held the rod. The race of life is great, and the ideal fair, but
                            the many are whiffling and unsure. The hero is immovably centered to his highest ideal. A
                            main difference between people, seems to be that one can come under obligation on which you
                            can rely�is obligable� another is not. If he has not a law of rectitude within himself,
                            there is nothing to hold him. This law within, is conscience, which imparts a sense of duty,
                            of obligation to pursue a given course, because it is believed to be right, heeding not the
                            selfish appeals of appetite, passion, changing moods, ambition, love or hate. It moves ever
                            on its straight course to the Ideal it sees beyond. The primary idea of righteousness,
                            includes rectitude, and a direct course upward. Such persons are the beams and pillars of
                            society. Of such we say "They bear acquaintance, we can always depend on them, and always
                            find them at the post of duty." Such a man was our beloved father Daniel. A person without
                            conscience, has not arriven to human self-hood�has not risen above the animal plane, but is
                            subject to the passions and appetites of the body. Conscientiousness lies on each side of
                            the organ of firmness, forming as it were, the roots, that give to firmness a moral quality.
                            Without conscience or reason for support, firmness becomes obstinacy and stubbornness.
                            Firmness, guided by reason and sustained by conscience, often rises to the heroic and
                                sublime,<pb n="43" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 43 which was a conspicuous
                            trait in our departed Brother, claiming our love and admiration. Surrendering worldly
                            ambition, he attained to the greatness of overcoming the world, and exhibited the highest
                            qualities of heroism in the humble life of a virgin follower of Christ and Mother, rejoicing
                            ever in the well-earned meed of a justified conscience, and the love and trust of God's
                            people. "No human mind, fertile in imagination as it is, can picture to its wildest fancy
                            the overpowering and transcendant beauty of the progressed and elevated soul." This is true
                            of our departed Leader. There is no elevation he may not ascend even to the throne of God.
                            There is no heaven he ma}T not cleave in his goings forth on those errands of mercy for
                            which he has fitted himself, by a life of discipline in the service of God. The natural
                            spirit control of the free circle, at the Boston Banner of Light, in replying to a question
                            asked by one of our Brethren, said in substance, that they who have lived the pure,
                            self-denying life of a Shaker, when they enter the spirit world, become messengers from the
                            higher to lower spheres. If this be so, they must inhabit the higher, as we shall soon see
                            by other testimony. According to numerous uncontradicted testimonies, spirits that inhabit
                            the higher and purer heavens, are invisible to those below them, even as all spirits are
                            invisible to mortal eyes. But those above can view those below them, and appear in their
                            midst, by clothing themselves temporarily, with the elements of the inferior plane. But
                            those inhabiting a lower sphere cannot ascend to the higher without a permit, as here, by
                            trance or vision, till they travel to it, nor could they wish to remain there, till they
                            have earned it. This harmonizes with w'hat the Apostle teaches of Christ, as having
                            descended to the interior of earth, and then of having ascended above all heavens of natural
                            spirits, capturing captivity and giving gifts to men. Jesus, the first born of many
                            brethren, through his servant John, promises those who overcome and keep his works to the
                            end, that they shall rule over nations, that they shall sit with him in his throne, which is
                            a seaf of authority and judgment, or of kingship,�for he is king of kings, even as ne
                            overcame and is set down with his Father in his throne, above all created heavens Then are
                            their names called with him, "The Word of God." Our departed Elder has borne that word from
                            early manhood till his exit from time. He has ever borne a testimony for God, and aginst the
                            carnal life of the world. He is henceforth, a dispenser of the most precious things of God,
                            of the priceless riches of Christ's kingdom, of the gifts, the graces and power of the
                            Divine Spirit, to whomsoever will prepare himself to receive it.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hollister, Alonzo G." TEIform="persName"/>Alonzo G. Hollister. Mt. Lebanon,

                                largely, one of affectionate regard for our beloved Elder, Daniel Boler, of blessed
                                memory. This manifestation of love should be carefully cherished as it is the natural as
                                well as the spiritual outgrowth of the better qualities of the mind. And while on the
                                one part this bond of love and spiritual affection has been honestly earned through a
                                long series of years which have been consecrated to the best interests of the gospel
                                work ; it has no less been a life of interested care for the peace and prosperity of the
                                Community as a whole, and then of the uprightness of each individual member. A
                                consecrated lii'e, that gives to God and to his people all that we may possess, is quite
                                different from a selfish life that is wholly absorbed in the interests of me and mine,
                                that the two could not consistently abide in the same person. Communists who accept the
                                testimony of Jesus as their rule for life, must, like their divine Teacher, enter in at
                                the strait gate. Their lives, like his life must be molded agreeably to the will of God
                                as their souls become established in the principles of gospel righteousness. Many
                                witnesses testify that this has been the life work of our beloved Elder Daniel. He
                                entered the Community in childhood, and from that early age, on to one of more than
                                fourscore, was an interested advocate to make his home one of peace and no less one of
                                brotherly love. Jesus was peculiarly emphatic on this point, and made it one of the
                                essential tests to a rightful membership among those who accepted his order of life. "By
                                this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one for another." In
                                this manifestation of love, toward a gospel father who has so devotedly spent his life
                                for the good of others, there is a simple and pleasant recognition of merited
                                appreciation. It meets in its simplicity one<pb n="45" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                                MANIFESTO. 45 phase of the gospel work, and aids effectually in the diffusion of love
                                and harmony throughout the whole Community. Although the dear father may not be seen
                                walking with us on the earth, to-day, yet he is evidently, near to these over whom he
                                has watched as a spiritual guardian with such solicitous care. Elder Daniel is not dead,
                                �He has not even fallen asleep. As he was while with us an active worker in the
                                resurrection order of Christ, so is he the same in his heavenly home. It was one of the
                                beautiful promises of Jesus to those who believed on him, that they would never die.
                                Corruption has no place in the testimony of Jesus Christ. That belongs exclusively to
                                those who sow to the flesh. As Paul so clearly taught the disciples at Galatia, the word
                                of God, so may he teach us, as he says,�'' Be not deceived ; God is not mocked, for
                                whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that spweth to his flesh, shall
                                of the flesh reap corruption." The disposition that may be made of the body of man, at
                                the close of its wrork on the earth, is of as little consequence as is the disposition
                                that may be made of food he eats to-day. That law of God so carefully worded by one of
                                the inspired writers, may need no change, and it is quite doubtful if it ever will be
                                changed. While the body serves the interests of the soul, as best it can, during its
                                pilgrimage, be that of many or of few days, the law is, "Dust thou art and unto dust
                                shalt thou return." Those who walk with God to-day, God takes them, without doubt, as he
                                did those of an earlier age : not out of the body but to make them ministers of his
                                word, and those who go up into a heaven, just above the clouds, as did Elijah in a
                                chariot of fire, evidently go only in the visions of the seer. One of our writers has
                                expressed himself very clearly on this subject of the resurrection of Jesus. "It is said
                                in Rom. viii., 29, that Christ was the first-born among many brethren. This has
                                reference to the spiritual birth, being born of the spirit out of a sinful nature, and
                                all that receive this new birth are brethren. That which is born of the spirit is spirit
                                and that which is born of the flesh is flesh. No one can be numbered with and become one
                                of his brethren while living a worldly life. The lessons to be learned from this are,
                                first, Jesus was a man born of the flesh like his brethren, and second, that he had been
                                dead to that spiritual life into which he rose. He could not have risen from the dead
                                except he had been dead; but being born of the spirit by obedience to God, his spirit
                                arose from the dead, and this was his true resurrection to which he always had
                                reference, and not to his natural body."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Diligently pursue the ways of wisdom" TEIform="index"/>Diligently pursue the

                                Scripture which says, "He giveth snow like wool;'' for surely with a heavy mantle of
                                snow covering the earth we can so much better bear the Zero weather. Snow as an
                                embankment about the house, closes many a windy passage, and also protects the water
                                pipes; but "It is an ill wind that blows no good." The cold without snow gave us an
                                early harvest of clear, good ice which was secured between Christmas and New Years.
                                Thanks to Elder Oliver for considering the August "Notes." To his suggestion we heartily
                                say Amen! When we will all agree to more nearly balance our material wants with our
                                needs, we shall all find perhaps, a surplus fund, with'which to enrich the mind and
                                spirit. Amelia J. Calver. South Family. Jan. 9, 1893. We all enjoyed Christmas very
                                much; business was good and consequently we received many gifts for our comfort. These
                                kind feelings were extended to all. Our Sunday school was nicely arranged and all had a
                                good understanding of the old, old story, and that the new birth was to bring, "Peace on
                                earth, good-will to men." Elder William Anderson has just had a call from Boston, and
                                walked over the ice better than Pegasus. We hope his trip will be good luck in the
                                temporal line, if not in the spiritual. We are all trying to remember that "An ounce of
                                prevention is worth (more than) a pound of cure." The hills are bare and grey, and the
                                sleighs are tucked away. The children are all waiting for a sleigh ride, but we have not
                                foi'gotten, that one year we had more snow in March than we wanted. The snow may come
                                before winter ends. Sarah A. Collins. Center Family. Jan. 13, 1893. Januaby nearly half

                                ourselves from moving on even if we would. We are busy with the aid of hired help
                                drawing wood and logs and caring for the cattle, sheep and other animals. Ice was
                                harvested by our family in Dec. We stored about as much again as we have been in the
                                habit of doing. The quality was very good and the weather was superb for the occasion.

                                recently published by our dear Canterbury friends. I consider it a nice contribution to

                                Sister, Ann Buckingham who has now passed to the other shore. We are having a cold
                                January, with but very little snow. Ice about fourteen inches thick, and very nice. We
                                have secured what we may want for the present year. We are busy now in obtaining our
                                yearly supply of wood. Many are the blessings that are bestowed upon a good, warm stove,
                                but they will be forgotten on the approach of midsummer. The song of the shiit is still
                                being sung by the good Sisters as their machines stitch, stitch, stitch, but as the
                                price for making grows less, the song loses its joyful strain. Our water wheel, for lack
                                of water at the reservoir, does not move, and that causes lamentation. When the heavens
                                open and send down the much needed rain, I expect tu hear a song of lejoicing. The dear
                                Brethren and Sisters who came from Groveland are a great support to our Society meeting,
                                as well as to all the interests of their new home. We are very thankful they have come
                                to dwell with us We are all engaged in the gospel warfare against the powers of evil,
                                and expect by so doing, to gain the victory. Josiah, Barker. Second Family. Jan. 1898.
                                The cold weather of the past lifteen days and no snow to hinder, has made ice of an
                                excellent quality, from twelve to fourteen inches thick. The North Family joined hands
                                with us and we are securing our stores of ice for the season. We have also made the
                                Sisters glad, with a new range for the kitchen, and an addition of cold and hot water
                                for kitchen, bakery and dairy. The water is supplied by a wind-mill which pumps it into
                                a tank holding ten thousand gallons; to them it is a luxury, as in the past they have
                                pumped all water used. It also runs at the barn. Not much snow, consequently no
                                sleighing, but it has been a good time to cut fire wood. We have lately parted with a
                                loved Sister, a Mother in Israel, one who helped build up Zion by good works. This
                                causes our minds to revert to many who were of this number that have passed on within a
                                few years. The Yedders, Wells, Bates, Trains, Harwoods, Youngs, Buckinghams, Copleys and
                                other families who were the pioneers of this part of Zion, and they were a power for
                                good in their day. Would that we could convert some like unto them in this day. But with
                                all due respect for humanity at large, how many are willing to come and sacrifice all,
                                as did those blessed pioneers, asking in return only the gospel of Christ and Mother. We
                                have but a few more of these good aged souls left, and when they are gone, there will be
                                a vacuum difficult to fill. May a wave of true conviction spread over Zion and the world
                                of mankind, and may our ranks be replenished by more such consecrated souls. It is a

                                1893. Since our last notes we have passed the festive season of Christmas and New Years;
                                they were enjoyable both temporally and spiritually. At Christmas time tokens of love
                                and remembrance were passed between the different Families. Then the seasons of
                                spiritual communion. I pity the one that can attend them and not feel their uplifting
                                power. On New Year's day we enjoyed a beautiful season with our gospel kindred, when the
                                presence of our dear Elder Daniel Boler was made manifest with other angel messengers.
                                Truly it was a baptism from the inner heavens. The winter so far has been quite free
                                from snow, a few boisterous days, but on the whole, pleasant. The January Manifesto was
                                so full of good things that we could not draw the line and so have taken them all in,
                                sure they will not produce mental or spiritual dyspepsia. 47<pb n="48" id="p26" TEIform="pb"/> 48 THE MANIFESTO. The essay on "Cheerfulness" is timely How often we
                                look on the dark side even when we know the sunshine is better. The humorist is an
                                essential character, in the social economy. One that is always chaste in his remarks,
                                but has the faculty of making things pleasant and sometimes causing the company to have
                                a good hearty laugh. It is health to soul and body. We second the motion of Elder Oliver
                                Hampton that it would be desirable to have the address of those that write the Home

                                to meet with those who give up all for the gospel, and live in confoi'mity to the
                                principles of the gospel, that they may benefit humanity. What a blessing it would be if
                                all could see the beauty of a life of consecration. The remarks made by Elder Calvin,
                                touched the hearts of many who heard him. It will awaken new thought toward an increase
                                for good. We need living bread, and fresh fountains of truth and light; something to
                                reach the soul and quicken it into action. We need a new inspiration, something to reach
                                the soul. An influence that will bring into action the combined powers of body and soul.
                                I often think of the pleasant time I spent in your place, and visit in mind with those I

                                Truth and purity go hand in hand, and that which is true and pure should be exemplified

                                never just right. When some of us want it to rain, the clouds fly over our heads as
                                lightly as so many feathers, and when we want a good big snowstorm, as we do at the
                                present time, then tlie clouds pour out rain with the greatest liberality. Up to date
                                very little snow has fallen on the hills of Canterbury, and our farmers, who are anxious
                                to haul some 500 cords of fire wood during the early part of the new year, are quite at
                                a loss to know how it will be done. The only remedy, however, is in waiting patiently
                                till the good time comes; and come it certainly will at an early or a later date. Santa
                                Claus with characteristic faithfulness made his yearly visit very much o the delight of
                                all ages: but this year he unfortunately became a little mixed with the church people.
                                The old man said it was his day to visit the children, but the ministers sent the
                                children to Sunday school and told Santa Claus he must go to church. With real Puritanic
                                grace we informed the dear old Saint that he must defer his visit till Monday, as the
                                children were studying their catechism and reading the Bible. To some of the little
                                folks this made Sunday a sad, long day, but as the sun was bright on Monday and Santa
                                Claus made his visit just the same it was the manifestation of great joy. Many little
                                surprises were made, as some pretty token of remembrance was found attached to the
                                boughs of a prettily furnished Christmas tree. Singing and dancing was the order of the
                                day for all the chirttren, while those of maturer age shared largely of the same
                                enlivening spirit. Then comes New Year's day following so closely the example of
                                Christmas that the very same day of the week must always be selected as the only
                                appropriate season for the incoming year. So the good folks prayed, and si'ng on Sunday,
                                and made merry on Monday. Praying and singing will never grow old, and as the new year
                                began on Sunday, it all moved along in harmony, and then on Monday began t' e general
                                routine of business al'iairs t'nat enter so largely into the life of a Community. This
                                second day of the now year opened upon us with an entirely new programme. A class of
                                Brethren had very kindly offered to prepare a dinner for the benefit of the Sisters, and
                                then for tLe whole family. While this may not have been wholly a new thing under the
                                sun, it was new enough to create a genuine surprise among the big and little folks that
                                comprise our family. The baking of som-, very nice cake, as well as the cooking of the
                                oysters and basting of the chickens was under the direction of the Brethren and at 11-30
                                a. m. the tables were spread and not less tiian sixty Sisters were seated. The Brethren
                                also officiated in the capacity of waiters, very much to the satisfaction of all
                                present. At a later hour the Brethren sat dowu to this sumptuous feast of fat things

                                we trust, with a growing thankfulness. In the evening the Brethren appointed a meeting
                                to which the Sisters were kindly invited, and all that consistently could attend, were
                                present, either as a matter of curiosity or from special interest in the success of the
                                new year movement. The interesting and varied programme occupied nearly one and one half
                                hours in reading, speaking and singing, wholly by the Brethren, and was appreciated and
                                enjoyed by all present. Jan. 10. Ice crop harvested. Twelve hundred and fifty cakes,

                                given to heed the injunction of our Mother, in "putting our hands to work and hearts to
                                God," with an abiding trust in the guardian care of that power which rules the wave, and
                                gives hope to those who trust in the promise given, that "they who wait upon the Lord
                                shall renew their strength." Since our last communication there has been quite an
                                improvement in our Laundry, by the introduction of steam for washing purposes. This is
                                brought from the large boiler at the barn, through pipes some 290 ft. in length,
                                carrying force sufficient to heat water for all the washing and boiling of the clothes.
                                There are pipes also around the room under the wash tubs, to warm the air, making it
                                very much more comfortable than formerly. We find a very great difference in the amount
                                of labor required to do the washing. We have not yet, all [the arrangements that are
                                necessary for perfect convenience; some more tubs for boiling the clothes are needed,
                                with other fixings which will eventually be done. Business in the mill is pressing. The
                                contract for corn-planters must be filled, while things of less consequence wait. The
                                majestic waters of old Mascoma were chained in ice on the 18th of Dec. just 18 days
                                earlier than last year. On the 2nd of this month we began cutting ice for home use, 15
                                inches thick; a good supply is harvested awaiting the days when old Sol shall give us a

                                Julia Russell. North Family. Jan. 1893. The Jan. number of the Manifesto came to us
                                laden with lofty sentiments of soul-inspiring truth; we were very favorably impressed
                                with the spirit and tone of the piece entitled "Cheerfulness," by Sister Lucy Bowers. We
                                can conceive of no helping power in sighing over, or complaining of weakness and
                                decrepitude as concerns individuals or societies; such a spirit would have a tendency to
                                eclipse the brightness of active goodness and thus retard progressive life; self-culture
                                and holy aspiration can alone aid in bettering society. In nature's vast field of
                                unbounded life, we see perpetual growth of bloom and fruitage, symbolical of godly
                                attributes, ceaseless purity and continual goodness. And should not God's people blend
                                in unison with infinite laws of increasing good? "God loveth the cheerful giver;" such
                                workers being in rapport with divine influences exemplify the beauty of holiness and aid
                                in bringing about desired reform. ) the road to heaven's portals Is paved with willing,

                                Christ's mission was to bless and save, With cheering sentiment restore; The fallen, He
                                did not condemn, But bade them go and sin no more. Since our last Home Notes, the dawn
                                of a "Merry Christmas" has added clieer and happiness to our lives; we made practical<pb n="51" id="p29" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 51 the law of love by the giving of

                                Christianity, and had a very pleasant time, although we met with some disappointment. We
                                had anticipated meeting with our friends from the North Family to hold a social
                                entertainment, but as the weather (over which we have no control) did not favor u� we
                                made the best of it. One good thing, however, it was just the right weather for forming
                                ice, and on the -27th ult. our Brethren stored the yearly supply of ice of finest
                                quality. New Year's day we were somewhat compensated for our previous disappointment,
                                for we had the pleasure of having our loved Ministry with us to spend the day, and we
                                enjoyed the privilege, which is not ours very often. They were ministers of that
                                strength and blessing which ever flows from the pure in heart, and in this renewed
                                strength we will abide through the coming year. We think they began the year just right
                                by visiting the least of the flock, first. It was indeed a time of refreshing, a feast
                                of good things, spiritual and intellectual. How much better to spend time and strength
                                in the accumulation and distribution of true riches than superfluous trifles, the
                                so-called customary Christmas gifts which require the cost of time and money to obtain.
                                This practice is good for those not of our order, who live in the selfish relations of
                                this world, if once a year they can enlarge their hearts and extend their sympathies
                                beyond the family circle limit, it is well; but a religious community living above
                                selfish relationships should have something better to impart. The Apostle exhorted the
                                people in his day to covet earnestly the best gifts. By curtailing desire to necessity;
                                being satisfied with comfort and convenience ana discarding the frivolous and
                                superfluous, more time and opportunity can be given to the cultivation of the
                                intellectual and spiritual powers. Through the year we will garner the fruits of the
                                gospel, love, joy, peace, charity, forbearance, consistency and gentleness, that we may
                                have wherewith to feed other souls and to impart to our dear Brethren and Sisters, both
                                old and young, not only at Christmas and New Years, but from day to day. Angeline

                                wish them very many happy returns. "Home Notes" with us have been rather a scarce
                                commodity lately, and after so lengthened a period of silence and seeming neglect or
                                indifference, we have no alternative but to confess to a remissness of our duty in this
                                respect, and promise to be more prompt in future. Now that Time's bells have chimed a

                                see the expressions of delight depicted on the countenances of the younger ones.
                                Throughout the sociable there was a happy mingling of sentiment, song recitation and
                                reading. The recitations by two very young Sisters were excellently well execucuted. The
                                reading by another young Sister was rendered with very pretty effect. The readings and
                                recitations were all the more highly appreciated from the fact that they were given

Heke we are in the midst of a Berkshire winter, still striving
                                to "fear God and work righteousness." Have thus far had but little snow, though it is
                                now sifting down quite briskly, and the wind is whirling it in all directions. Cold
                                weather has been plentiful. The water in our reservoir is frozen to the depth of
                                seventeen or eighteen inches; and of the beautifully crystallized ice, a sufficient
                                quantity has been secured for domestic purposes in the coming warm season. The sad
                                accident which occurred here on the morning of the 14th ult. by which one of our
                                workmen, a strong, healthy young man lost his life, was indeed shocking. An animal was
                                being slaughtered, and while turning the windlass to raise the beef for the purpose of
                                dressing, he slipped and fell forward thus losing his hold on the crank. This caused it
                                to revolve rapidly, striking the man on the back of the head crushing in the skull.
                                Medical aid was promptly obtained, but in two hours after the occurrence he ceased to
                                breathe. How true it is, that "in the midst of life we are in death," and how necessary
                                that we be prepared at all times to meet the grim messenger. The night preceding this
                                dreadful event one of our tenants dreamed that an animal had just been slaughtered, and
                                immediately thereafter saw a funeral procession. Our boy trapper has caught in the past
                                summer and autumn thirty-eight woodchucks, four rabbits, two pole-cats and three foxes.
                                The foxes were taken from their dormitory in the ground, and sold to outside parties who

                                benefit to me. Presenting as it does, the truth in its simplest and purest form, it is
                                the true expounder of a faith, which claims to be the pure, simple, unadulterated
                                Christianity. It appeals to the heart and feelings, as well as to the intellect, and can
                                therefore be read with profit by all classes of society. May it grow and prosper and

                                cover and is an unusually interesting number. It starts off with a remarkably life-like
                                portrait of Jay Gould and a description of his character by Prof. Sizer, followed by a
                                pertinent biographical sketch. Mrs. Charlotte Fowler Wells adds another article to the
                                list of her charming biographical sketches, this time discussing the careers of B. J.
                                Gray and Prof. Stanley Grimes. Practical Phrenology stands out conspicuously in this
                                issue. "Human Pursuits, and How to Study them Phrenologically," is to constitute a
                                series of articles by one who has had an experience not equalled by any other
                                phrenologist, Prof. Nelson Sizer, in this number the topic being The Lawyer. The same
                                author writes about "Heads and Faces, and What They Indicate," amply illustrated, the
                                first of a systematic series under this title which will add much to the interest of the
                                Journal. Modern Football is an illustrated article, with terse and well-taken remarks
                                upon the influence of character in the choice of sports and upon the abuses of muscular
                                exercise. The Columbian Exposition is further considered, this issue containing
                                illustrated descriptions of the United States Naval Exhibit and Machinery Hall. Mrs.
                                Annie Besant, a lady whose interest in Theosophy and allied psychic phenoniena has made
                                her well known, is now in this country and lecturing on topics related to the above. The
                                Phrenological gives her portrait, description of character and an appreciative notice of
                                her work. The several departments of the Journal are well filled, as usual, with matter
                                that is appropriate to the season and of special value to the reader. All the world
                                knows the usefulness of the Phrenological, yet it is not superfluous to say that
                                everybody should subscribe and read it with care. It is published at the popular price
                                of $1.50 per annum, or 15c. a number. Address the Publishers, Fowler &amp; Wells
