THE COLUMBIA BICYCLE CALENDAR
FOR   1886.
A TBULY arti-tic and elegant work in cromo-lithography and the letter press is the Columbia Bicycle
Calendar for 1886, just issued by the Pope Manufacturing Company, of Boston. Each day of the .war
appears upon a separate slip, with a quotation pertaining to c.ycling from leading publications and
prominent personages. The notable cycling events
are given ; and concise opinions of the highest medical authorities; words from practical wheelmen, including clergyinen and other professional gentlemen;
the rights of cyclers upon the roads; general wheeling statistics; the benefits of tricycling for ladies;
extracts from cycling poems; and much other interesting information. In fact, it is, in miniature, a virtual encyclopaedia upon this universally utilized
" steed of steel." The calendar proper is mounted
upon a back of heavy board, upon which is exquisitely executed, in water-color effect, by G. II. Buek, of
New York, a charming combination of cycling
scenes. As a work of convenient art, it is worthy ot
a place in office, library or parlor.

                            away first; and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition. 2 Thess. ii., 2. And it
                            was given unto him to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues and
                            nations. Rev. xiii. 7. And this is the state Christ prophesied the world of mankind should
                            be in at his second appearance. And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the
                            days of the son of man. Even so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed.
                            Luke, xxvii., 26, 80. Plainly referring to his second appearance to consume or destroy
                            anti-christ, and make a final end of sin, and establish his kingdom upon earth ; but the
                            revelation of Christ must be in his people, whom he had chosen to be his body, to give
                            testimony of him and to preach his gospel to. a lost world. Fourth Dispensation. The fourth
                            dispensation or day. is the Second Appearance of Christ, or final, or last display of God's
                            grace to a lost world, in which the mystery of God will be finished and a decisive work to
                            the final salvation or condemnation of all the children of men, (which according to the
                            prophecies rightly calculated, and truly understood, began in the year of our Savior Jesus
                            Christ, 1747.) See Daniel and the Revelations. In the manner following. 1st. To. a number,

                            visions and revelations and prophecies ; which have progressively increased with
                            administration of all those spiritual gifts that were administered to the apostles at the
                            day of Peniecost, which is the comforter that has led us into all truth, which was promised
                            to abide with the true church of Christ unto the end of the world, and by which we find
                            baptism into Christ's death. Death to all sin, become alive to God, by the power of Christ's
                            resurrection, ' which worketh in us mightily ; by which a dispensation of the gospel is
                            committed unto us; and woe be unto us if we preach not the gospel of Christ. For in finding
                            so great a salvation and deliverance from the law of sin and death in believing and obeying
                            this gospel which is the gospel of Christ, in confessing and forsaking all sin and denying
                            ourselves and bearing the cross of Christ, against the world, flesh and devil, we have found
                            repentance of all our sins, and are made partakers of the grace of God wherein we now stand
                            ; which all others in believing and obeying, have acceptance with God, and may find
                            salvation from their sins as well as we ; God being no respecter of persons but willing that
                            all should come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved. Thus we have given a short
                            information of what we believe of the dispensations of God's grace to mankind, both past and
                            present; and in what manner the people of God have found justification, or acceptance with
                            God, which was and is still in believing and obeying the light and truth of God, revealed or
                            made known in the day or dispensation in which it is revealed: for as the wrath of God is
                            revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth
                            in unrighteousness or live in any known sin against him. So his mercy and grace is towards
                            all them that truly fear him, and turn from all their sins, by confessing and forsaking and
                            repenting, which is the way and manner in which all must find the forgiveness ot their sins,
                            and acceptance with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, or finally fail of the grace of God,
                            and that salvation which is brought to light by the gospel. But to conclude, in short, as we
                            believe and do tes'ify, that the present gospel of God's grace unto us, is the day which in
                            the scripture is spoken or prophesied of, as the second appearing of Christ to consume or
                            destroy antichrist, or false religion, and to make an end of the reigning power of sin (for
                            he that committeth sin is the servant of sin and Satan) over the children of men ; and to
                            establish his kingdom, and that righteousness that will stand forever. And that the present
                            display of the work and power of God will increase until it is manifest to all, which must
                            be done iu due time ; for every eye shall see him, and he will reward every man according to
                            his deeds, and none can stand in sin or unrighteousness ; but in that righteousness which is
                            pure and holy, even without fault before the throne of God which is obtained by grace,
                            through faith in obedience to the truth of the everlasting gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
                            in denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts ; by confessing all sin and taking up the cross
                            of Christ against the world, flesh and devil. We desire, therefore, that the chil26 THE<pb n="27" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>dren of men would believe the testimony �of truth, and turn from their
                            sins by repentance, that they might obtain the mercy of God, and salvation from sin before
                            it be too late. �Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Persons of principle, v.s. persons of circumstances" TEIform="index"/> Persons of Principle,

                            weakness ; light, in dark hours; nourishment, when fainting; refreshment, when weary ;
                            courage when resolution grows faltering; stability, when temptations and trials thorn our
                            way. These are they who have guided and squared their course in life by principles of
                            righteousness, as judged by the Divine Law. While the unnumbered millions of earth's giddy
                            throng, in surging masses, have drifted with passions foaming waves, or been driven by the
                            tide of circumstances, in various directions, according as its tide hath flowed and ebbed in
                            various directions, but veered from heaven's course, now turning, for a moment to the right
                            hand path of truth and virtue, if fortune's winds blew in that direction ; then to the left,
                            to wander in the wiles of sin, if temptations, or the influence of the multitude led in that
                            course, persons of principle have held on the path of virtue, true as the needle to the
                            pole, and steadfast as the rocks of Gibraltar. In all ages, in all climes, in all kingdoms
                            or governments of the world, the citadel of strength, and the bulwarks of protection for
                            human society have been built up and sustained by those stable benefactors of society, (few
                            though their numbers have been, compared with the masses,) who have consecrated their lives,
                            fortunes and honors, unselfishly, to work God's work as best they understood it, though
                            reviled, scoffed, or persecuted by the heedless, giddy throng of persons of circumstances !
                            Noah, Abraham, Moses, John Baptist, Jesus, Peter, Paul and their coadjutors�the saints and
                            martyrs of yore together with the "Two Witnesses," male and female servants of God, who all
                            adown the dark ages, kept their eye on God, and his work for human weal, and wrought with
                            its spirit and power. These, together with nameless and numerous others, who, regardless of
                            opposing circumstances, have consecrated their life work to human reform and progress, and
                            become the great benefactors of our race. Of these were those who received the baptisms of
                            the prophets of Bible record, and of the French prophets of later date, and lived in
                            obedience to the inspired dictum of those periods. A few of these fled from the tyrannous
                            persecutions of France, to England, and their work culminated in the advent of anew and
                            great dispensation of God's mercy and grace ; when the spirit of the Lord brooded over the
                            waters of human conditions, and prepared a few noble souls to receive the Testimony of
                            Christ's Second Appearing, those who buckled on the armor of faith, and fought the fight of
                            the Christian warfare, to the pulling down of the strongholds of Satan. Of this number were
                            Mother Ann Lee, and pioneer members of her little church. However noble the endeavor and
                                en-<pb n="28" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>terprise that persons of circumstances engage in, for a season,
                            when obstacles are thrown in their way, when opposition is to be encountered, when
                            persecution lifts her thong, these laborers forsake their field of toil, fold the banner
                            they had thrown to the breeze in the days of prosperity, abandon their noble enterprise, and
                            slink back into listless indifference and disgrace, reminding us of the patriarch Jacob's
                            admonition to his son Reuben�"'Unstable as water ; thou shalt not excel ! " But, did Jesus
                            relinquish the strife when thousands who encored him with praises and believed on him one
                            day, forsook him the next ? In no wise ! He pursued hi? godly course till life's bitter end
                            ! Did the suffering disciples, and the noble martyrs who followed Jesus in ages past shrink
                            from duty, and lock up their testimony and heart's fervor in silence because of the wicked
                            opposition of souls unwilling to bear the cross of Christ? Far from it! They toiled on till
                            life's threads were spun ! Did Mother Ann Lee, and the noble Elders with her, or their
                            faithful successors, the early pioneers of this gospel work of the "Latter Day," the day of
                            Christ's Second Appearing, relinquish their efforts to save souls, by constant labors, early
                            and late, because many souls who once set out fair in the way of God turned back, no more to
                            tread the goodly paths of self-denial and the cross? They did not! They toiled on, through
                            life, to plant and establish souls in the Gospel of Christ, in this land of liberty of
                            conscience. Even worldly philanthropists, from secular or humane motives, have been more
                            persevering than to abandon noble pursuits, because of meeting bufferings, disappointments,
                            sufferings, oft-timesintense. Witness John Howard, who gave his fortune and his life to
                            relieve the sufferings of his fellow men impaled in prison's doleful precincts. Witness the
                            unflinching efforts of the world'sdiscoverers and inventors, Columbus, Americus, Morse,
                            Harvey, Ged, Arkwright. Watt, Fitch, Howe, Mc.Cormick ; and numberless others,�Cyrus W.
                            Field, in starting and instituting the Atlantic Ocean Telegraph cable. To accomplish this he
                            crossed the ocean fifteen times, and, though he met with many failures, and the loss of
                            immense fortuues, and 1488 miles of cable, worth many hundreds of thousands of dollars, he
                            persevered until his labors were crowned with success, and an immense fortune is his reward
                            personally, while the value to the civilized world, in mercantile and civilizing purposes is
                            beyond the reach of human calculation at present. Examples numberless might be presented for
                            patronage. But, to souls who, with open eyes can trace human history, the task is needless.
                            The most gigantic and noble enterprises ever accomplished by the sons of men, have been
                            achieved only by a dauntless perseverance, under exceedingly harassing and burdensome
                            difficulties. Difficulties sternly met and overcome,. tone the spirit with a deathless
                            energy,, sometimes apparently almost superhuman ; while a good and possible purpose
                            relinquished for want of persevering effort, is the author of discouragementsand, sometimes,
                            of dissipations, ignominy and disgrace ! But, life's pressing needs are before us ; there
                            are millions who- need salvation ; there are souls seeking the bread<pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>and

                            testimony to the suffering millions groping in spiritual blindness, and wading in the
                            marshes and pits of sensual degradation and sinful pleasure. There is a harvest field
                            ripening and ripe for the sickle of the Lord; and willing reapers are needed to gather into
                            the heavenly garners the prepared guests to the wedding of the heavenly Bride and Groom.
                            Welling up, welling up daily, are all the urgent necessities for action in the house of God.
                            To be idle, is to provide for destitution and loss. To be indifferent, is to be shamefully
                            degraded. To be negligent of duty, is to incur the displeasure of the heavenly hosts, and
                            all living souls in the house of God on earth. To be opposed to the work of creating souls
                            anew, giving them a birth into God's Kingdom, is to incur the necessary chastisements from
                            the hand of God that gloom the soul in misery and merited woe, while, to unflinchingly work
                            for God, is to win crowns of glory, honor, and immortal life ! Ho for the workers in God's
                            field of redemption from sin, and progress of the human race in wisdom and virtue. Mt.

I
                            was then in my eighteenth year. I went to Watervliet to visit Mother and the Elders, and was
                            received into their family. I lived and lodged in the room with Mother Ann more than four
                            mouths. She taught me to confess and repent of my sins, and take up a daily cross against my
                            carnal nature. In obedience to her teaching I have found salvation and have " escaped the
                            pollutions that are i:-: the world through lust. " Mother left Watervliet, N. Y. and set out
                            on her journey for Harvard the first day of June following. I remained there till the
                            twentieth of November, and then came to New Lebanon, N. Y. to live. While Mother remained
                            with us, she visited many places where her testimony had been received, at some of which she
                            spent considerable time, particularly at Harvard and Ashfield. I visited her in every place
                            where she tarried any length of time, and I ever found her a perfect pattern of godliness,
                            both in word and deed. Her soul was filled with the power and gift of God, and her testimony
                            against sin was as a sharp two-edged sword ; yet she was meek and merciful, kind and
                            charitable, always ready to comfort the afflicted and help the needy. I have been with her
                            in times ol persecution, and have repeatedly witnessed the wounds and bruises which she
                            received from the hands of her wicked persecutors, who hated her for the testimony which she
                            bore. She was truly, " a woman of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. " I feel confident
                            that in point, of suffering and persecution, sorrow and cries to God, day and night. for the
                            salvation of lost souls, she came the nearest to the Lord Jesus Christ of any woman on
                            earth. I know from personal acquaintance that she was a very temperate woman in all things ;
                            and she taught the same to others. I can testify with confidence that, in obedience to her
                            precepts, I have been kept from sin and from all manner of <pb n="30" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> wickedness.
                            This blessed power of God which was in Christ Jesus, I received through Mother Ann. Can it
                            be possible that so much virtue and goodness, justice aud truth, as we have truly found in
                            her. ever pioceeded from a corrupt fountain? All the false accusations and slanderous
                            reports that have been spread abroad in the world, cannot injure Mother Ann, nor destroy her
                            testimony. And though they may deceive and impose upon the understanding of strangers, yet
                            they cannot alter the feelings of any of her faithful followers, who know the truth by
                            personal acquaintance and actual experience. Is it not very singular that those who had
                            very-little, if any personal acquaintance with her, and some too, who perhaps never saw her,
                            except when they came with mobs to persecute her, should pretend to know so much more about
                            her than those who were with her day and night, and knew all her proceedings, and who can
                            confidently say, in the truth and sincerity of their hearts, that they never found any evil
                            in her? Can rational people be led to believe that we were such dupes and idiots, as to be
                            incapable of knowing whether the abominations alleged against Mother and the Elders were
                            true or false, when we had so fair an opportunity ? Will they suppose that we were so
                            blinded by delusion and fanaticism that we could not have seen, if any thing of the kind had
                            been transacted? The truth is, we were not blinded nor deceived. Mother Ann's testimony was
                            keen enough against every wicked thing to keep us on our watch ; and had she been guilty of
                            those sins, it would have destroyed our confidence in her at once. I have not been led
                            blindfold by a vain imagination these forty-five years past. I know by the revelation of God
                            in my own soul, that Mother was the Lord's anointed, and that Christ really began his second
                            appearance in her, and dwelt in her, and that her body was a temple for the Holy Spirit. 1
                            Cor. vi., 19. However incredible this may appear to an unbelieving world, we know that we
                            are not left in darkness and doubt concerning these things ; they are as clear and certain
                            to us as the light of the sun. Here we find the promise of Christ verified : " He that
                            followeth me shall not walk in darkness." Jno. viii, 12. I know of a certainty, that Mother
                            Ann had the gift of prophecy and the revelation of God, by which she was able to search the
                            hearts of those who came to see her ; for I have myself been an eye witness of it. I have
                            known some to come to her under a cloak of deception, thinking to conceal their sins in her
                            presence ; and I have seen her expose them by the searching power of truth, and set their
                            sins before them; so that they have been constrained to confess, with guilt and shame, that
                            she had told them the truth, and to acknowledge that the light and revelation of God was in
                            her. I can say with the apostle Paul, " I speak forth the words of truth aud soberness;" my
                            eyes have seen and my ears have heard what I have stated : it is no vain imagination. By
                            obedience to the testimony of the gospel, which I received from Mother Ann and the Elders
                            who stood with her, I have found salvation from sin ; and this feels more precious to me
                            than all created things. Why then should I hold my peace? I am not ashamed to acknowledge
                            Mother Ann as my mother in Christ. I know ^he lived a pure and<pb n="31" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> sinless
                            life. I know that she loved righteousness and hated iniquity ; and I can hear witness that
                            her soul abounded in goodness and love ; and that she was able to minister the same to
                            others, as I have seen and felt it in numberless instances. I know that the spirit of Christ
                            was formed in her; aud I have ever found the same spirit in all her faithful followers. I
                            have been well acquainted with all her successors in the Ministry, and I have always found
                            in them the same godly example, and the same Christ-like spirit. I feel a firm and unshaken
                            confidence that, in obedience to her precepts, they follow her as she followed Christ. Under
                            their ministration, and in obedience to this gospel, I feel my faith established and my soul
                            resting on a sure foundation, against which the tongue of slander and the gates of hell can
                            never prevail. To the truth of these things I can freely bear witness in the presence of God
                            and before all men. I express my feelings with -i heart of thankfulness and gratitude to God
                            for such a privilege. Under his divine blessing and protection I leave this testimony, for
                            the benefit of all who love the truth. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="My heart's desire for thee" TEIform="index"/> MY HEART'S DESIRE FOR THEE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Taylor, G.

TEIform="persName"/>HARRIET A. JOHNS,</byline><p TEIform="p">One evening on silently watching the sun as it slowly descended behind the western hills, I
                            was deeply impressed with the grandeur of the scene. The western sky was as a sea of fire
                            while all things in nature illumined by its brightness seemed to bespeak the perfectness of
                            the Master workman. Its diverging rays as they passed through the soft fleecy clouds gave to
                            each a different hue and while these floated leis-<pb n="32" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>urely by each other
                            the colors constantly changed yet the beauty of a harmonious blending was gorgeous indeed.
                            The birds meantime were singing their evening praises, while the soft breathings of the
                            zephyr I fancied to be in such close communion with their Maker as to repeat the injunction
                            of our Lord and Savior: "Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is
                            perfect. " The sun having lighted this part of our globe was about to shed its cheering
                            beams upon another portion of God's vast handiwork. As my eyes lingered on the loveliness of
                            nature my thoughts reverted to the time, referred to in the Bible when the morning stars
                            sang together. The constant recurrence of the seasons, the unchanging character of all that
                            God has made in nature is proof positive that there must be a Supreme Being who cares for
                            the uufoldment and highest good of all his works, and that I even I am one of those upon
                            whom his rain descends and his sun shines and I asked myself, in whose or in what service am
                            I giving the powers which God had assigned for me to use? Am I living and simply caring for
                            those things which perish with the using and laying up my treasure where moth and rust doth
                            corrupt and where thieves break through and steal ? Of this manner cf living I have been
                            duly instructed, and if I have turned my attention to seeking first of all things the
                            kingdom of heaven and its righteousness and if my Brethren and Sisters are the angels of
                            that heaven then I should be exercised in their good, should always be giving the kind word
                            so becoming to a gospel companion, always be trying to cheer the weary and more heavily
                            burdened. In this way, toiling with hands and heart I shall gain the treasure which will be
                            as food and clothing in the eternal realms. Ah the moral lesson which I seem to draw from
                            the sunset is perpetual constancy and faithfulness. Life is made up of littles, and our
                            duties only come one by one, thus there seems no excuse for me to refuse any duty or
                            sacrifice. The Savior having so plainly marked out the way for all to pursue who will be his
                            disciples, my heart breathes the prayer that as I give my hands to the execution of life's
                            duties I may be clothed and inspired with the spirit of divine love, goodness and mercy.
                            That my life may draw others to glorify our Father in heaven, even as the glorious sunset
                            changed my thought and filled my mind with love and adoration to God the author of such
                            wondrous beauty. Canterbury, N.

TEIform="persName"/>NANCY G. DANFORTH.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Being blest in childhood with praying parents, I was early impressed with a sense of right
                            and wrong, also the need of strength beyond myself to enable me to resist evil desires and
                            to live aright. Many places in my quiet home, could they speak, would bear witness to
                            earnest prayers offered even when a child of not more than six years, and up to the age of
                            seventeen, when after relating my spiritual exercises in presence of the elders of the
                            church, 1 was judged worthy of membership with that body. Accordingly I was baptized, and
                            joined the denomination of Free-will Baptists. Notwithstanding being held in union b)r that
                            church and striving to obey its teachings ; still I did not rind that salva-<pb n="33" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/>tion which my soul desired. Thus passed six years amidst hopes and fears, with
                            many prayers and cries to God for some way of deliverance from the reigning power of a
                            sinful nature. About this time, when hope had nearly given way to despair and life was
                            becoming a burden, I decided upon a visit to the Shakers in Canterbury. Being, through false
                            reports, to some degree prejudiced against the people, I closely scrutinized all that I saw
                            or heard. I soon found there was a testimony here which, if obeyed would save the soul from
                            sin and give power to overcome all evil temptations and desires. This gospel testimony calls
                            for an honest confession and repentance of every known sin ; it requires a life of love and
                            peace ; purity of heart in all things. It is in this way that I have been striving to live
                            for nearly forty years, and find that the closer I maintain these precious Godgiven
                            principles, the more real happiness I enjoy. Life is no longer a burden, but all too short
                            to accomplish the good I desire to do. Neither do I look into the future with dread
                            forebodings of what may be hereafter. I have to-day in which to do good ; to bless all the
                            virtue I see in others ; and where any wrong is manifested, to pray that this gospel of
                            love, may eventually so light the dark places that error may be forever banished from the
                            soul. Surrounded by those I love, who are striving for the same end, why should 1 not be

                            Jerusalem, as recorded in Acts, xv., and it may be instructive to consider the cause which
                            led to it, and the manner in which it was conducted and brought to a conclusion. The first
                            converts to the new faith had been Jews exclusively, among whom was a large company of
                            priests. They had been brought up in the strictness of the ancient formalities of the law,
                            and they still clung to those observances, especially circumcision and abstinence from food
                            declared ceremonially unclean. Then came a revelation to Peter, in consequence of which he
                            preached the gospel to the gentiles also, not requiring any conformity to Jewish customs.
                            Paul also had converted many who had not been under the law. All this aroused the
                            indignation of certain ones of the Jerusalem church, who took it upon themselves to go to
                            Antioch, where Paul had established a congregation, and to represent that circumcision was
                            necessary for saltation. Then the matter was brought to an issue, and the whole question was
                            wisely referred to the mother-church for a decision. A crisis had evidently come upon the
                            infant church : on one hand were all the influences created by national tradition and
                            education, on the other were the far-seeing eyes of liberal hearts who recognized the
                            gentile world as the true harvest-field and who felt unwilling to lay upon them the yoke of
                            non-essential formalities. The composition of the council by which these momentous questions
                            were to be decided, was, a most significant one. There were the twelve apostles, every one
                            of whom held his commission from the Master himself, yet they did not claim exclusive
                            authority to decide the matter before them ; nor did the elders, appointed by the apostles,
                            arrogate to themselves legislative powers ; the matter was decided by the apostles, elders
                            and brethren�by the whole church in council assembled. The discussion was evidently
                            unrestrained, for there was "much disputing, " and the result of the debate was finally
                            summed up by James, bishop of the local church. It is note worthy that it was James, not
                            Peter, the "rock" upon whom the church was to be founded, who acted as presiding officer and
                            exercised the most commandinginnuence. Nor was James' " sentence " anything more than a
                            counsel, embodying the sense of the great majority of the meeting, declaring that gentile
                            converts should not be required to observe the Mosaic law. A few prohibitions were however
                            insisted upon, possessing great importance by having the effect of separating them from old
                            customs and associations, and leading them to a new mode of life of higher rectitude. And
                            the future proved the wisdom of the council. A threatening crisis that had endaugered the
                            very existence of the church, was happily averted and unity of faith and action brought
                            about. It would have been impossible for any one man, or any one set of men, to secure such
                            results, no matter how high their standing or how pure their intentions might have been, but
                            by the simple expedient of calling the faithful together and affording an opportunity for
                            exchange of thought and discussion of views, they were enabled to arrive at a
                                satisfactory<pb n="35" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> decision. A noble example was presented by the bishop
                            of the Jerusalem church. He himself belonged to the old school and was opposed to
                            innovations ; yet when he saw the drift of the sentiment pervading the assembly, he gave his
                            adherence to it at once and recommended its general adoption. His name has gone down in
                            history as Saint James the just. God dwells in human i tj . "Where two or three are gathered
                            together in my name, there am I in the midst of them." When, therefore, a crisis arises in
                            the affairs of men, whether it relate to state or church, experience teaches that it is
                            safe, wise and statesmanlike, to go to the people for counsel; for the masses of the people
                            are honest and trustworthy and will sustain and support the leaders that have confidence in
                            them. The advice of Lincoln to an aspiring young man was to keep as near as possible to the
                            people. The wise leader, having the good of humanity at heart, will seek to ascertain the
                            voice of the people, for it is the voice of God. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                virtuous deeds. Each new year seems like a golden promise, and may this one hold a germ
                                of abiding joy for you. What of the past year's journey? Have you made progress
                                heavenward, or taken steps backward? There is no standing still. The question is a
                                serious one for you to consider. So many things left undone, so many neglected
                                opportunities dropped along the wayside never to be recovered, you would gladly turn
                                back and gather them up. But alas ! only the present is yours. In reaching for things
                                that are past, you too often reap "a harvest of vain regrets. " It is time for good

                                for the sa:r,e. I never come into the presence of souls purified by the gospel without
                                an impression is made which opens an avenue of thought in relation to my own condition
                                and purpose. Our meeting of last evening was replete with testimonies against the spirit
                                of the world in its every form. The one theme of thought that has occupied my mind since
                                then, is that of the loveliness of young men and women, possessing the adequate
                                faculties for every worldy pleasure, and who in obedience to light and conviction, are
                                endeavoring to crucify every carnal propensity, that they may become true Brethren and
                                Sisters in the virgin relation. I love this relation because of intrinsic value to the
                                soul and I feel determined to square my life by the testimony which makes a separation
                                between flesh and spirit. They are opposite elements and cannot coalesce and any
                                endeavor that any one may make to combine them will not only prove futile, but if
                                persisted in, will eventuate in the spirit of the world. I trust and have reason to
                                believe that every one is endeavoring to do right, and yet my first and great concern
                                should be and is, that I am trying, faithfully, to discharge every duty incumbent upon
                                me both spiritual and temporal.

                                    being so cautious in the expenditure of money. When a man or woman of means
                                    exercises judgment in purchases so as to secure the worth of their money, it is
                                    attributed to stinginess, and if they head a subscription with $100 the foolish
                                    spendthrift makes an outcry because it is not $1,000. The difference is not so often
                                    in liberal dispositions between these two classes of people as it is in sense. The
                                    prudent persons have a realizing sense of the value of money because they know that
                                    it invariably represents hard labor somewhere. The fools talk and act as if it fell
                                    like the dew from Heaven. The prudent are governed in their outlays by
                                    considerations which embrace the future as well as the present, and they recognize a
                                    wide range of obligations and responsibilities in the distribution of a fund which
                                    always means the sweat and travail of anxious toil. The shallow pates throw money
                                    away as recklessly as if it were mere sand and pebbles, and when they have exhausted
                                    their store, usually levy tribute on the prudent and self-denying. They scorn the
                                    idea of judicious deliberation in their expenditures, but they rarely exhibit any
                                    pride when it comes to draining those who have displayed more sense and
                                    self-restraint. The so called " stingy " people don't leave their families
                                    unprovided for, if they have families who can be managed at all, and they don't
                                    leave unsettled debts. Their books always balance. They can help in private and
                                    public concern when they see fit to do so, and they are never found in the lists of
                                    bankrupts. It will generally prove to be the case that their imputed parsimony is
                                    only abstinence from extravagant pleasures and.useless besides injurious luxuries.
                                    They do not cast quarters and half dollars loosely about because they know them to
                                    be component parts of a dollar, but when substantial sums are needed for building
                                    purposes and other enterprises on a scale of magnitude, the accumulated quarters and
                                    half dollars which they have saved enables them to carry out respectable plans and
                                    consummate some useful ambition. Whenever you hear some silly rattlepate of either
                                    sex denouncing any "ne as " stingy" you are pretty safe in deciding that the person

                                    ages to us, is that of Diotrephes, drawn by the beloved disciple John in his third
                                    epistle. Where Diotrephes was born, or lived, or died, we are not informed. He has
                                    left neither works or words behind as his memorial. No books embalm his thoughts, no
                                    traditions communicate the story of his good deeds. All we know of his story is
                                    embodied in these brief words: "I wrote unto the church : but Diotrephes, who loveth
                                    to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore, if I come, I will
                                    remember lie deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words : and not
                                    content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them
                                    that would,<pb n="39" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>and casteth them out of the church. Beloved, follow
                                    not that which is evil, but that which is good. Pie that doeth good is of God ; but
                                    he that doeth evil hath not seen God. " Diotrephes was a church member, that seems
                                    plain. How he got into the church is � not known. It was a poor fisherman who caught
                                    such a fish. But he was in, and was inclined to stay in, no matter who else might be
                                    shut out. He was probably an office bearer, perhaps an elder in the church. How he
                                    obtained office we do not know. We can only guess by comparing his career with that
                                    of others of similar character. Somehow, perhaps by smooth talk, apparent zeal, or a
                                    profession of piety and humility, he got himself into office; and once in, he cmild
                                    1 -e trusted to stay there. He magnified his office, and magnified himself as the
                                    proper man to fill it. He not only filled his own office but run over into others,
                                    until he controlled the church. His predominant characteristic the apostle
                                    intimates, when he describes him as one who loved "to have the pre-eminence " among
                                    them. And as John in his old age was revered and beloved for his worth and labors,
                                    there was no place for him in the church where Diotrephes reigned; and so the aged
                                    apostle could say : he " receiveth us not." The epistle which John wrote to the
                                    church was treated with contempt by this stiff-necked demagogue, whom the apostle
                                    describes as " prating against us with malicious words; " and not content with
                                    maligning and abusing the apostles of the Lord, he would not receive "the brethren"
                                    and forbade them that wov.ld, and cast them " out of the church. " Diotrephes loved
                                    pre-eminence and attained it. He coveted power and usurped it. He evidently desired
                                    notoriety and he has it. His likeness is framed and hung up in infamy before the
                                    gaze of the ages. His exalted position only enhances his disgrace. Let the
                                    descendants and imitators of this ancient demagogue take warning, lest in seeking to
                                    be famous they become infamous, and not only bring upon themselves present dis*
                                    grace, but at last receive the condemnation of the Lord in the judgment day. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="national-news" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Miss Anthony's first speech" TEIform="index"/> MISS ANTHONY'S FIRST SPEECH.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">A Pittsburg Dispatch correspondent, indulging in reminiscenses, says: The first
                                    woman who ever made a speech at a teacher's convention was Susan B. Anthony. She was
                                    a teacher in Rochester, N. Y.. and after listening for hours to a discussion as to
                                    why the teacher's profession was not so highly respected as that of the preacher,
                                    the lawyer or doctor, without (as she thought) touching the root of the matter, the
                                    young Quaker girl rose to her feet and said, "Mr. President." This simple expression
                                    threw the entire convention into a state of utter consternation. The officers for a
                                    time were paralyzed with horror and amazement. Finally the president got his wits
                                    sufficiently together to tremulously and mockingly inquire ; " What will the lady
                                    have? " " I wish to speak to the. question under discussion,' replied Miss Anthony.
                                    And then and there were hurryings to and fro. The frightened men flew aroun .1 to
                                    consult each other and decide what to do. The women constituted a universal blush at
                                    her boldness. Finally a man got over his fright sufficiently to move that the lady
                                    be heard. This motion was discussed pro and con for half an hour or more. It was
                                    then decided that the women should have no vote on the matter and the question was
                                    settled by the men alone, who, by a small majority, allowed Miss Anthony to speak.
                                    The embarrassment of a young girl may be imagined under the circumstances : but
                                    Susan stood her ground and courageously and deliberately hit the nail on the head by
                                    telling them that as long as women, were considered not to have brains enough to
                                    become preachers, lawyers and doctors, but only enough to be teachers, every man who
                                    entered the profession of teaching tacitly acknowledged he had no more brains than a
                                    woman; and, moreover, the reason why teaching is less lucrative is because of. the
                                    cheap labor of women. So, gentlemen, if you want to do away with the disrespect of
                                    which you complain, and exalt your profession, you will have to exalt your

                                present age can see only the shadow or at best hear only the faintest echo. Men walked
                                with God in the evening of the day, and conversed with him face to face, as a man
                                converseth with his friend. On the other hand men were enslaved, imprisoned and deprived
                                of life through manifestation of the same gift of inspiration. The food they ate, the
                                garments they wore as well as a large share of their domestic arrangements came under
                                this same spiritual guidance. A wonderful, mysterious age and unfortunately for us, we
                                can obtain but little satisfaction through which to pursue our investigation. Like the
                                thousand and one things that present themselves for examination we are unable to sit in
                                conference with those to whom this gift is attributed, and can only conjecture what may
                                have been the state of mind of those who were engaged as writers, speakers or actors in
                                either sacred or profane history. Peter, the apostle, in referring to the biblical
                                prophecies of an earlier age, informs us that they wert. not given by the will of man,
                                "but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. " " Holy men of God. "
                                These have been considered as a privileged class, who under the inspiration of the holy
                                Spirit have written for our reproof and correction and instruction in righteousness. All
                                scripture written under the influence of so good a ministration from the holy spirit
                                must indeed, lead to a life of holiness. In the Christian church the Brethren and
                                Sisters were urged to so live that they might be able to occupy a corresponding relation
                                to the gifts of the spirit. " Know ye not that ye are the temples of God and that the
                                spirit of God dwelleth in you?" All that might have been spoken or written by a class of
                                men or women in whom the spirit of God dwelt, as was remarked by the apostle, must have
                                been of a high order of inspiration and well worthy the acceptance of those who would
                                walk in the light. These holy men of God evidently accepted the advanced truths and
                                warned the nation of the inevitable destruction that would overtake them if they failed
                                to become established in righteousness. It could have been nothing less than the THE
                                    TERMS.<pb n="41" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> influence of the holy spirit operating upon the
                                conscience, that would raise men and women above the common level of the world, and
                                infuse into their souls that light and zeal, which gave them a confidence to condemn
                                their own fellow men, for the sins of unrighteousness which were becoming so universal
                                in the nation. Among these divinely inspired teachers, who did not hesitate to instruct,
                                to warn and to admonish ; Moses stands pre-eminent. The early age in which lie lived and
                                the order of civilization that then was, should always be duly considered, especially if
                                we attempt to coutrast the influence of the religion of that age with the present. Very
                                little direct reference is made to the subject of inspiration in the Scriptures. Only
                                two passages contain that important word. One is found in Job and the other in Timothy,
                                but in the revision of the Bible, even these have been thrown out, so that the theory of
                                a plenary inspiration in the recording of all the cruelties and barbarities and unwonted
                                atrocities of a semi-barbarous age has largely faded away from our former source of
                                authority. Our present definition of the term, however, is all that could be wanted and
                                covers the whole ground for any need of a past or present age. Inspiration in a well
                                ordered mind is " a divine influence by which men and women are qualified to communicate
                                moral or religious truths with authority." It would be a sad comment on the age, if
                                among the moral and religious teachers, none could be found authorized to act in that
                                office. They might well return to the days of the Arab poet and learn of him. " There is
                                a spirit in man and the breath or the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him
                                understanding. " rJ he gift of a special inspiration is accorded to the writer of this
                                very peculiar work, in which figures some questionable characters, to complete a very
                                questionable story. The enjoyment of a divine influence, which is the inspiration of the
                                soul, and the minister of God's love to man, is certainly a treasure much to be desired.
                                Receiving the breath of the Almighty, how can man be otherwise, while he is a living
                                soul, than a subject of inspiration. Christians must admit that Christ was the fullness
                                of inspiration, and that his testimony was the very spirit of prophecy, which gave him
                                divine authority to teach moral and religious truths, and the sons and daughters of God
                                in whom Christ dwells, must share in that same inspiration and be able to teach or write
                                the principles of righteousness with a "confidence before God." " </p></div3><div3 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="All the signs of the time..." TEIform="index"/>All the signs of the time...

                                All humanity is in a process of resurrection, the moving and Jife-power of which is the
                                Spirit. All are encompassed in this good work of God, as any devout student of true
                                science may discern ;. showing that in Deity we all have a common Father, and hence as
                                we progress in the stages of our resurrection-birth, we see and realize and act on the
                                truth that we are brothers and members of one body. The above from the pen of M. L.
                                Bloom, in the Day Star of Dec. 24th. is another echo of the voice of God among men. It
                                is one of the refreshing signs of advanced thought when one can stop in the whirl of
                                pxcitement that<pb n="42" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/>is chasing after gold and glory and calmly tell ns
                                that "all humanity is in a process of resurrection. That they are coming up into the
                                varied stages of this resurrection birth, to learn of the divine Teacher how they may
                                live and die uo more. Those who accept this view of the subject have entered into a work
                                which must ultimate in the Kingdom of God upon the earth. Jesus ascended so far in the
                                resurrection that he spoke with confidence, "I and my Father are one. " It was a
                                glorious work, a far better ascension than that of the old prophet in a chariot of lire.
                                It was a discipline of the mind to that extent that his whole life was in harmony Avith
                                a life in God; and as Jesus lived, so should those live who claim to be his disciples.
                                Accepting this view we can have but little interest in a resurrection of dry bones as
                                seen by the prophet, or in one of corruptible bodies at the anticipated end of the
                                world. God's good work, as the writer says, will encompass all, and we shall realize
                                that we are brothers and sisters, members of one body. Our fortunate remove of more than
                                a score of years from the frightful savagery of contending armies, has given us time to
                                reflect, and to ask the question in all kindness, Are we not brothers ? Should we not
                                learn to treat each other as the children of one Heavenly Father and heirs of
                                immortality ? If a revival of God's work can find a place among men, and the spirit of
                                the resurrection of Jesus Christ call them forth into new life, which shall establish
                                them in practical righteousness, then we may. look with confidence to the advent of the

                                        Here is an observation within everybody's experience. Go into a room where the

                                        and though the room be uninhabited, though the air has never been polluted by

                            to this passage ; "There is really great reason to hope that Christianity can be
                            christianized." What a commentary on the Christianity of the day, the Christianity which
                            claims to be the outcome of the teachings of the pure founder of pure Christianity. And how
                            is this Christianity of to-day to be christianized ? Must it not be by returning to the path
                            from which all of the so-called Christian churches have strayed? Jesus Christ did not found
                            a church of stately ceremonial, of pealing anthem, of waving censer, of floating incense ;
                            but his church was established in the hearts and lives of mankind, a church of good works,
                            of living fruitage. What church is there existing today which teaches and practices the
                            Christianity of the Savior? the Christianity which was exemplified in celibacy, in community
                            of goods, in leaving to " Caesar the things which are" his, and giving to God the life and
                            all things which are His ? I know of none except the Shaker church. I do not mean to say
                            that theoretically Christianity is not taught, it is, but it is not lived even by its
                            teachers, and were members of any so-called Christian church, of any denomination to live
                            strictly and faithfully according to the teachings of Jesus which these churches profess to
                            follow, they would be looked upon just as we Shakers are, as 'la peculiar people." The
                            churches, like the nations, have become corrupted through pride, the pride of power and
                            wealth. In the world how often is the expression heard, such and such churches are wealthy
                            churches ; and when that is the case with any church its Christianity is of the kind that
                            needs christianizing. Even that plain, simple church and people, the Quakers, have nearly
                            become extinct; and why? because Quaker and moneymaker came to be nearly synonymous terms.
                            Assimilating with the world, lowering the standard of Christian practice to meet the tone of
                            modern morality and the religious tendencies of the day will weaken and corrupt any .church.
                            Therefore let us as Shakers, as followers in actual, daily life of the teachings of the
                            Master, as practical exemplars of those teachings, show to the world thai 4a<pb n="44" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> there is one church which does not need to "be christianized," because it is
                            a church which is Christian in the highest and best sense, Christian in its faith, in its
                            teachings, in its life ; that its Christianity is a living, working one, not one of mere

                            and yielding not one iota of principle or practice, but may we "Lift the standard higher
                            up," for " Whoever bears the standard high With purpose loyal to its name, Can every
                            principle defy, Which would a Christian's honor stain.'' </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="A." TEIform="persName"/>A. Canterbury, N.

We visit the school. The teacher is a sister from the Society and has under her
                            charge thirteen active pupils. We are interested in their exercises and listened with
                            pleasure to their recitations. At the Center Family we find some twenty two members. Leaving
                            this place we visit Bisco Cove. Here we see a Birch tree that stands as a monument bearing
                            this inscription. " William Bisco. Died, May 21, 1791. " The circumstances attending this
                            singular case are these. At that date three men were employed by the government of the U. S.
                            to run a line due north from the city of Washington, D. C. to the shore of Lake Ontario.
                            They had proceeded as far as Thornton's Point, or near that place when one of their number
                            died very suddenly, and the two survivors being in the wilderness, and thirty miles from any
                            inhabitants, were obliged, by necessity, to sharpen sticks with which to dig a grave. The
                            body was enclosed in some bark which they peeled from the trees, before placing it in the
                            earth. The grave is still visible and the inscription legible. We return to the settlement
                            of the Believers at six o'clock, P. M. and are invited to see some Cat fish, weighing eight
                            and ten pounds, also a fish called a Sheep's Head, that weighed four pounds. June 22nd. This
                            is the Sabbath. We attend public service. Some two hundred persons, not of the Society were
                            present. These with the Brethren and Sisters formed a large congregation. A very appropriate
                            address was delivered by Br. Joseph Pelham which occupied about an hour. Several others gave
                            short exhortations. The season spent in this place was spiritually profitable and we are
                            very thankful for our privilege. At three o'clock we attend a meeting of the Society, which
                            continued about two and one half hours. In it were the manifestations of the spirit of God.
                            June 23rd. We visit the quarry where the Believers are obtaining building stone. It is not
                            like the granite stone of New Hampshire but a curious combination of sea shells, insects,
                            and vegetables. We are shown a white wood tree, that measures twenty feet and six inches in
                            circumference. At their mill they are using a spiral vent water wheel. It seems to give good
                            satisfaction but requires more water than an overshot wheel. June 24th. We accompany the
                            Brethren and see them draw a fish net that has been cast in a large pond. Among the lot
                            caught we found a pickerel that weighed eight pounds. There are also some nice specimens of
                            bull heads. This being our last day in the Society, we meet in conference with the Ministry,
                            Elders and Trustees and expressed to them our thankfulness for the kindness and attention
                            that has been shown to us, and receive from them corresponding expressions of love and
                            gospel care. We leave the Believers of Sodus at three o'clock, P. M. and ride to the village
                            of Glide, where we remain over night. June 25th. At an early hour we visit a glass factory,
                            and are very much interested in the blowing of glass. It is a curious sight and a novel
                            feature to all of our company. We wait till eleven o'clock A. M. for a packet, but as the
                            anticipated boat does not arrive, we place our baggage on board the line boat, Equity,
                            Captain Vansiver, and move along slowly. June 26th. At 7.30 A. M. we find ourselves
                            blockaded by boats, and are obliged to stop. At this place we very fortunately met the
                            captain of the packet " Swan, " in which boat we sailed from Utica to Lyons on our journey
                            to Sodus. We soon make arrangements with him to take our company on board his boat. Captain
                            Wellington is a gentleman as well as a captain, and gave us the invitation to accompany him
                            to the village of Syracuse, as he thought the drive would be pleasant. We visit the village
                            of Celina where the largest spring of salt water is found that supplies the evaporating
                            establishment at Syracuse. We are informed that the Salt Works cover 180 acres of land, and
                            :hat the salt water is brought to this place, a distance of two miles in wooden aqueducts.
                            These are supplied from a reservoir in the top of a building where the water is forced<pb n="47" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> to a height of eighty feet by powerful machinery, at the rate of 300
                            gallons per minute. This machinery is propelled by a water wheel, thirty six feet in
                            diameter. We visited the boiling house where there are twenty eight kettles, placed in two
                            rows, and a fire at one end of the range heats the whole number. Four cords of wood is a
                            supply for twenty four hours. The salt when taken from these kettles resembles snow for
                            whiteness. At twelve o'clock we are again on board the " Packet. " At 4.30 P. M. we start
                            from the lock at Syracuse. After sailing one mile we reach another lock where we find fifty
                            four boats waiting for the opening of navigation. June 27th. On Friday morning we pass
                            Oriskany, seven miles above Utica, having traveled thirty three miles since nine o'clock
                            last evening. At Utica we leave the "Swan" and take passage on the "Delaware. " In the P. M.
                            we reach the "Fall Hill Ravine, " where the walls of rocks are from fifty to one hundred and
                            fifty feet in almost perpendicular height. June 28th. We arrive at Schenectady at three
                            o'clock, A. M. and find a carriage ready to take us to Watervliet, and at �.30 A. M. we are
                            once more in company with �our gospel friends. June 20th. It is the Sabbath. A rainy day. We
                            have no public service. At 1.30 P. M. the Church Family hold a religious service in the
                            Meeting House, which was a manifestation of good gifts. June 30th. We leave Watervliet at
                            5.30 A. M. in company with the Ministry, for New Lebanon, N. Y. and arrive at four o'clock,
                            P. M. July 1st. The Elders of the First Family make us a visit at the Office. We then
                            accompany them to the Family Dwelling and make a general inspection of the building. The
                            rooms are all numbered. The meeting room is well lighted, having three windows on each end
                            and six on the north side. The house is furnished with large, convenient clothes presses,
                            adjoining each room. In the attic are one hundred and seventy drawers, nicely arranged for
                            the storing of clothes. At the mill we see a planing machine which does good work. Nothing
                            of the kind has ever been seen in New Hampshire. The boards are passed through the machine
                            on the edge. In the shoe shop we saw a machine for crimping the legs of boots. It would do
                            the work, for one piece, in two minutes. At the school house we saw twenty five pupils. Most
                            of them are quite young, but gave very good recitations. July 2nd. We visit the Society in
                            Hancock and return to New Lebanon on the 3rd inst. July 4th. Visit at the Second Order in
                            the A. M. and at the Second Family in the P. M. July 6th. Sabbath. We attend the Public
                            Service. Believers from several families were present and a large number of persons not of
                            our order. Proctor Sampson is the speaker and addressed the assembly at length. Several
                            other persons made short exhortations. At 1.30 P. M. we attend the service held by the First
                            and Second Order. It is a beautiful season. The singing and speaking is a gift of spirit
                            life, and the hour of worship is an hour of spiritual devotion. July 8th. Leave New Lebanon
                            for Enfield, N. H. We bid our gospel friends a kind farewell at three o'clock, A. M. and
                            arrived at Shaftsbury, Vt. at five o'clock, P. M. a distance of twenty six miles from New
                            Lebanon. The next day we drive thirty two miles and reach Landgrove, Vt. July 10th. We reach
                            Windsor Vt. at five o'clock P. M. a distance of twenty nine miles. July 11th. We leave
                            Windsor at four o'clock A. M. and arrive at Enfield, N. H. at ten o'clock, A. M. and are
                            made welcome to our own gospel home. </p></div2><div2 type="humor" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Not that kind of a ticket" TEIform="index"/> Not That Kind of a Ticket:

                                many beautiful illustrations. $1.00 a year, The New England Magazine, Jan., 1886. enters
                                an enlarged field with a display of resources and an outline of plans which seem to
                                justify the expectation that it has before it a successful future, and will worthily
                                bear its historic name. The number before us presents a most attractive appearance,
                                within and without. It comes to us as an enlargement of the Bay State Monthly, a
                                periodical which has worked its way into a large degree of favor in Mass, and has made
                                wonderfully rapid advances in public favor. Upon its handsomely designed covers are
                                engraved the seals of each of the New England States, and its pages are profusely
                                illustrated with engravings of unusual merit, the frontispiece being a superb line
                                engraving, on steel, of Chief Justice Waite. The contents include a most readable
                                article on Brown University, by Reuben A. Guild, LL.D.; a choice little poem by Edgar
                                Fawcett; a description of "A Summer Day Outing" on the part of Daniel Webster, by John
                                K. Rogers; an excellent article, descriptive of Attleboro', Mass., by C. M. Barrows;
                                "Art in Book Illustrated," by Charles E. Ilurd, of the Boston Transcript; "Richard and

                                directly'to New Englanders, and we heartily commend it as worthy of their support. $3.00

                                Noted Pkinces, Authors and Statesmen of our time, is the title of a beautiful book
                                edited by James Parton and presented to the readers by the Henry Bill, Publishing Co.
                                When it is said that in the long list of excellent articles we have a life picture of
                                Arthur P. Stanley, Charles Dickens, Wm. M. Thackeray, The Prince of Wales, Charles Lamb,
                                Thomas Hood, Henry Longfellow, John G. Whittier, Abraham Lincoln and many others and
                                that among the writers we meet such persons as Cannon F. Farrar, James T. Field, Louise
                                C. Moulton, Wm. H. Riding, James Parton, Mrs. John Lillie, Will Carlton and Ben Perley
                                Poore, we need nothing more to assure us that the work is interesting, instructive and
                                eminently profitable for all ages. As Thomas Campbell remarked in reference to his own
                                writing's so may we of the work before us. " It is an inexpressible comfort, to be able
                                to look back, and feel that I have not written one line against religion or virtue." The
                                numerous illustrations in the work add very much to its value, both through pleasure and
                                profit. The press-work is from the Office of Berwick &amp; Smith. The book is
                                printed with a type of a beautiful face on excellent paper, and this feature, to those
                                who are interested readers is a matter of no small consideration. If you want a handsome
                                Calendar for 1886, get Hood's Household Calendar. You may search for days, but you will
                                not get one more artistic, more beautiful, or more convenient than that issued by the
                                proprietors of Hood's Sarsaparilla. It i&amp; a perfect gem, and in every respect is
                                the ideal CalendarAsk for it at your druggist's, and if you don't get it there, send six
