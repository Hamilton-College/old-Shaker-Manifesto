EVERYBODY TO HIS TRADE.
Nothing is truer than that it man who attempts to
be a jack at all trades is successful in none. Equal
ly true is it that life is too short fov a man to prepare
himself for grappling with all kinds of diseases.
We need specialists in medicine, and in large citiesit is becoming more and more the custom for physicians to adopt some favorite special line of practice.
The names of many such become familiar the world
around, as that of Dr. Douglas who attended Gener
al Grant, or Dr. Foote, of New York, whose original
ideas of and successful practice in chronic diseas< s
have become widely known because his entertaining,
writings and remarkable cures are to be found in almost every county of every state of the Union.
Ilis favorite wok, ''Plain Home Talk,' has worked
its way around the globe both via of London and
via San Francisco to Australia and New Zealand,
with the result that the doctor, at his office, 120 Lexington Ave., New York, is in receipt of consultation
letters and reports from patients in every foreign
mail. But this prophet is not without honor vn Ms
own country, and it is mainly from his own countrymen that Dr. Foote invites free consultation, and to
whom he offers the benefit of bis thirty years experience. His career and success alone prove the advantage of specialism.

                            is unchangeable, and, therefore, unmoved by our importunities, and unaffected by our joys,
                            sorrows, wants or woes ; for with Him is neither variableness, nor shadow of turning."
                            Jesus,�the Christian Preceptor and Guide, said, " If ye, being evil, know how to give good
                            gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven know how to give
                            good gifts to those who ask him." Matt, vii., 11. The fact is, the only hinge upon which the
                            justice of God hangs, is a continual adaptation of God's purposes to meet the doings and
                            conditions of his creature, man. And to apply the principle of unchangeableness of God,
                            which simply has reference to the immobility of his laws, to the idea that He is unaffected,
                            and unmoved, by the doings of his creatures, consequently does not meet their acts according
                            to his law of justice and mercy, and strengthen and fortify them in worthy, good pursuits,
                            while he discards and frowns upon the opposite, is to make justice and mercy terms of no
                            meaning, or, rather, to drive them into chaos and oblivion, and set up the Supreme God on a
                            throne ot unchangeable dispensations, showering down upon earth from time to time alternate
                            portions of blessings or cursings, let his creatures do as they may ; for, it cannot be
                            denied that both of these are the dispensations of his hand ; although some sophists
                            contend, that, since God is love, it is not consonant with his attributes to dispense
                            sufferings. But, let the objector remember that God's attribute of love does not obliterate
                            his attributes of justice, righteousness, mercy and truth, "^hall not the Judge of all the
                            earth do right?" Gen. xviii., 25. God is not solely one of these attributes without the
                            others! And, since there are opposing powers, it is not possible for God to love that which
                            is good, without hating that which is evil; for, the very effort of loving and blessing
                            certain deeds and principles that are good, is, of itself, hating and cursing that which is
                            evil. What could be a stronger demonstration of opposition, aversion, or hatred to wicked
                            deeds and baleful principles than this ? On the principle of unchangeable dispensations ;
                            or, changeable alternately and uniformly, without regard to merits<pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> or
                            demerits of humanity, it might so chance that a generation living under a dispensation of
                            God's fixed blessings might thus be blest who were quite unworthy, while a worthy
                            generation, living perchance in a period of his displeasure, would receive cursing and
                            bitterness of soul! Where then would be manifest justice, righteousness, and goodness? Would
                            it be just that a meritorious people should be ravaged by the scourge of God's displeasure,
                            and driven out of hope? Could zeal for good works survive under an expectancy of such a
                            scourge ? Could love and gratitude to God be tendersd by a soul while smarting under the
                            lacerating strokes of unjustly dispensed sovereign will? Nay, Caviler! When Omnipotence
                            frowns on virtue, she sinks to rise uo more! And when He smiles on vice, justice will wrest
                            from Him the scepter, and rule the world himself! Aye, more, were it possible for God
                            indifferently to sit, while virtue and vice contend, his silence would be a sanction to them
                            both, and, thus divided against himself, He soon should no more be ! The subject is beyond
                            reasonable prevarication that power, wisdom, goodness, justice, love, righteousness and
                            mercy, are attributes of Deity. But, all these are unmeaning terms, if God is unmoved by the
                            doings of his creatures, and unchangeable, in the sense of not conforming his dispensations
                            of love, mercy, righteousness, &amp;c.�to meet the meritorious doings of his creatures !
                            The position that, " With God there is neither variableness nor shadow of turning" is
                            strictly true, but, it is applicable only to his identity of attributes ; not to the
                            application of his powers in righteousness to meet the doings of his creatures ; for, as
                            said Paul, "The powers that be are ordained of God, and the invisible things of Him from the
                            creation are manifest in the things that are, even his eternal power and Godhead." Rom.
                            xiii. This refers only to the "higher powers." Hence, how is it possible for the wonderous
                            works of his hands to be affected by powers and principles in contact, and all nature�the
                            work of his hand, animate and inanimate to be affected by the action of surrounding
                            conditions and principles in operation, when in connection and none of this element to exist
                            in their Maker ? Without influence, communication is bankrupt, heavf.n-void, and friends
                            unknown ! Thus would Cowper sing in vain that, " A true friend must echo sigh for sigh, aDd
                            groan for groan, And wet his cheeks with sorrows not his own." If this influence extant in
                            all nature, is not from Deity, it surely must be from Satanity, for it exists, and if thus,
                            "Friendship's cordial were a boon of hell." No longer say that God is the soul of heaven,
                            and unmoved by the doings of his creatures ! Christ, the Son of God, when born of the
                            spirit, as a primary lesson, taught to feel for others' woes ; and he declared that he was
                            in the Father, and the Father in him. If God were unmoved by the doings of his creatures,
                            upcn what principle is their sufferings consequent upon the violation of law dispensed to
                            his creatures? Is it consistent for Him to pull down that which He has built up ; to erect a
                            temple for the purpose of demolition, thus to teach man his Omnipotence? If this bespeaks
                            Omnipotence, man shares his dignity ! Upon what principle are rewards and punishments
                            admissible? Upon what<pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> principle was language confused at the building
                            of Babel ? Upon what principle did Christ teach remission of sins? Upon what principle did
                            Christ teach faith in prayer? And that prayer would be granted because of importunities ?
                            Say, is it goodness,� And, did God make a pure desire, E'er to exist in quenchless fire?
                            Say, should his justice never fill, A cup formed empty by his will? Has He set limits unto
                            space, Beyond the circles of his grace, And yet designed the same to fill, When inconsistent
                            with his will? Shall justice sheathe his judgment's sword, When creatures mock and scorn his
                            word, Or did He bid mankind profane His Holy Reverential name? Shall He in justice's chariot
                            ride, And, unaffected, see the tide Of man's ambition ebb and flow And bless alike for weal
                            or woe? Is He unmoved when sordid Just Would sheathe his scepter in the dust, Ajid bigots
                            fain would rear a throne More that they honor than his own? Did He create desire and hope To
                            tantalize till they elope? Or has He granted to their will To measure future good or ill?
                            He's interfered, indeed with man, And often contravened man's plan, For this God's goodness
                            did foresee To be his justice's stern decree ! But, say, did not the piteous moan, When
                            Abram sacrificed his son Call forth an angel to his aid Before his knife the child had
                            slayed? Was God unmoved though Adam fell, Refused obedience,�Rebelled? If so, was yet his
                            promise true Of Savior and Redeemer too? When wicked Cain his brother slew, Did God, supine
                            the action view? If so, how did the curse on Cain, Derive its power to float amain? When
                            wickedness the earth did fill, And rebels spurned God's holy will, Did God, unmoved, behold
                            their rage, And blot the record from time's page? If thus, whence did the flood descend To
                            deluge earth from end to end? And why was heaven so cruel too, As to destroy the rebel crew?
                            Who taught old Noah an ark to build, Directed how it should be filled Commanded him
                            repentance preach, And perfect veneration teach? If God, unmoved by man's vile plan, Still
                            blessed and prospered him as man, In running counter to his (God's) will Man's lust to
                            pamper and fulfill, Say, if God never frowns with horror, Who punished Sodom and Gomorrah?
                            Or, being good, if God frown on us, Who gave a Covenant, with promise To good old
                            Abraham�faithful sire, Who proved his faith to feed the fire? For Moses why the bush to burn
                            If God moved not to man's concern? Or, how did he, by God's direction Inflict the plagues
                            for man's correction? If God, unmoved could see old Pharaoh's rage And, grieved old Israel
                            cared not to assuage, Pray, tell us how her murmur did Him shock, To pour forth water from
                            the barren rock? Or, why, when gratitude for manna fails, God filled the mouths of Israel
                            with quails? If God's ne'er moved by e'en a nation's plea. Say, who for Israel sundered the
                            Red Sea? And if God moves not when man's soul is tried Why were the broken tables fresh
                            supplied? When Moses, in distress for Israel's sin, Brake the two first, why give to him
                            again? Why call him to the mount, and there renew The Covenant for the idolizing Jew? And,
                            if with God, man's deeds have no avail, Who slew the fourteen thousand men when Korah fell?
                            And why was Moses, and his brother Aaron, Withheld from entering the land of Canaan? Say,
                            why, if God ne'er frowned at their distrust Why this debar from lovely Canaan, just? Why,
                            for idolatry, and whoredom too Destroy two dozen thousand of the Jews? And thus debar them
                            from the land of Canaan, Because seduced by the advice of Balaam? If God move not when
                            troubles scathe the soul, Who caused the waters of the Jordan roll?<pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>
                            And, when all Israel stood upon her banks, Divided Jordan for her dry shod ranks? And piled
                            the waters, as a heap of rubble To let his Israel pass them free from trouble? If God's
                            ne'er moved when man, in weakness calls, "Who leveled Jericho's substantial walls? When
                            priests, with trumpets rent the mellow air What was there in the trumpets but a prayer? And,
                            if Jehovah was not moved with this What threw the giant walls into abyss? The sound of
                            trumpet though it split the quill Could never move a wall without God's will! How could
                            Elijah unto heaven ride In fiery chariot without God for guide? And would his angel guide a
                            wicked man Whose life was mockery to his holy plan? Were not the prayers Elijah poured to
                            heaven Together with obedience by him given, The motive powers that rolled the chariot
                            wheels, Urged forward by the Lord, who prayer feels? If God's ne'er moved whene'er his
                            children pray, But, tyrant like, from prayer doth turn away, Who slew the Baal prophets, all
                            by fire To prove Jehovah true, and Baal liar? When good Elijah prayed, who rain distilled
                            Upon the thirsty land, a bounty willed? If God ne'er moves, when man prays in his might Who
                            bade his angel, punish in a night The eighty-five and hundred thousand men By death, for
                            trespass upon Judah then An answer to the prayer by Hezekiah United with his brother, good
                            Isaiah Did God move not, for mortals here below, In case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego?
                            Who, then protection in the furnace gave? Who rolled away the flaming fiery wave? Who saved

                            church of Christ's disciples prayed The cloven tongues of nations then displayed? Thus, when
                            they keenly felt the Savior's loss, Bestowed on them the heavenly pentecost. When John and
                            Peter, to the house of prayer In Christ's own name and spirit did appear, Who healed the
                            lame man, sitting at the gate And raised to a walking man's estate? When the Apostles were
                            in prison laid, Who led them forth�the soldier's trust betrayed? When Peter, bound with
                            chains in prison lay, 'Tween soldiers, watching lest he steal away, Who, while the soldiers
                            slept, the chains did loose 4.nd led him forth for heaven's special use? These gifts were
                            answers to the saints, who prayed 'Twas God's right hand of power these works displayed And
                            thousand thousands yet the song may sing To praying saints, God will an answer bring. Mt.

                            are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things arepure, whatsoever things are of
                            good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
                            Phil, iv., 8. Worthy subjects for contemplation ; themes to uplift the mind and feelings
                            from the miasmic lowlands of sensuality, up to the sunlit slopes of our higher nature and
                            being. The fair sweet lily and the noxious weed may grow side by side, each drawing
                            sustenance from the same soil, one absorbing the nectar, the other the poison of life
                            elements. So it is with individuals ; under the same circumstances and advantages, they
                            will, each according to their inherent nature and tendencies, either absorb the spirit that
                            unfolds the good and beautiful, or otherwise imbibe and assimilate all that tends to develop
                            the coarser part of their natures. We must strive to curb and rein our thoughts as the
                            master does his steed,<pb n="173" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> teaching them to go in the direction we will.
                            If, according to the apostle's injunction, we dwell on whatsoever things are true, we shall
                            preclude from our mental vision, that vast array of superficial and unreal imagery which the
                            world places before the mind, impressing it with false ideas and chimerical fancies, that
                            have no foundation in truth. If we think only upon the true, the curtain of life's drama
                            will rise revealing scenes of naturalness and beauty, unfolding to our senses the grandeur
                            and glory of a life whose centre is God, and whose outgrowth is beneficence and love.
                            "Whatsoever things are honest." Ah, if we think honestly we shall surely act nobly towards
                            all mankind. They who work by hypocrisy and deceit, will be crushed in the ruins of their
                            own building. Oh, let thy whole life reveal sincerity of motive, for he who strives with
                            honesty of purpose, wields a power more potent for good than earth's mightiest chieftain.
                            "Whatsoever things are just." "Deal justly, and love mercy," giving to all their exact dues.
                            If our minds are exercised in this direction, equity will govern all our dealings with
                            others ; we shall ever keep before us the divine ideal of righteousness, dispensing good to
                            all mankind, without favor or partiality. "Whatsoever things are pure." Upon this basis
                            rests the whole structure of good thoughts. For this cause came the flood. "Their thoughts
                            were evil from their youth upwards," and their whole lives were corrupt through sin. How can
                            we form a desirable character blameless before God and men, unless its foundation is in
                            purity. The foul germs of impure thoughts spring up to blight every good thing; to despoil
                            arid mar the fair image of God. Let us look well to our thoughts, and above all things be
                            chaste in our imaginations, then will our whole being be illumed with the light and truth of
                            God, for where sin reigns He cannot dwell. " Whatsoever things are lovely." If we think with
                            admiration upon those qualities and graces which adorn the spirit and make it angelic, we
                            shall strive earnestly to incorporate them in our lives, then we shall indeed be lovely and
                            loveable. "Things that are of good report" concerning our brother or our sister, let us
                            delight to contemplate, nor listen to the voice of slander which ever seeks some trifling
                            flaw or blemish, to mar or defame the reputation of those who are striving to live
                            uprightly. " If there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."
                            Look ever for the good, and blame only where duty and necessity require it, and then let our
                            reproof be given in the right spirit and manner. If we realize that " Our happiness depends
                            upon the quality of our thoughts," we shall guard the secret springs of action with care and
                            concern, remembering that out of them are the issues of life. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            cruel forms of persecution have investigated the labyrinths of social, moral and religious
                            science ; revealing truths which have rent the vail of superstitious darkness ; guiding

                            account of the few faithful souls who compose our number. Temporal business is suspended,
                            and places of care vacated, for want of mumbers to bear burdens ; and even spiritual and
                            Divine worship, sometimes goes lame, dry, insipid, barren of inspiration, and flat, because
                            of the few who are able to meet and take active part in the worshipful exercises. But, is
                            this state of feeling proper and wise ? Is it not greatly erroneous relative to the real
                            work which we are in? 'Tis true, however, that Christ, when on earth, seemed to lament over
                            the same afflicting view, particularly when he said, "The harvest indeed is great, but the
                            laborers are few." Also when he mourned over Jerusalem, saying " Oh Jerusalem, how oft would
                            I have gathered thee" &amp;c. But what do we perceive in his motives, save a spirit of
                            sympathy and yearning for the souls of his mistaken and self-righteous kindred�the Jews ? If
                            he was possessed of auy other motive, surely he never manifested it, or seemed to feel auy
                            uncommon desire to increase the number of his followers. He knew that the light, power and
                            testimony of salvation was embodied in himself, and his few disciples ; and that this light
                            must inevitably, illumine all honest, candid souls, in the progress of its increase, from
                            time to time, as stuls obey the measure of truth, and walk in the light to them revealed.
                            Apparently, his disciples had better success in obtaining proselytes, but, they soon found
                            that the purity, virtue, and godly examples of a few, was of more consequence and advantage
                            to the Christian cause, than great numbers, with very limited obedience to its precepts. God
                            designs to have a pure people on the earth, patterns of righteousness; and, through the
                            instrumentality of such, to enlighten the world of mankind relative to the true Order of
                            Christ. But the salvation of the human race in great numbers, appears yet to be far distant,
                            yet as certain as day follows night. God will accomplish that in his own time. Yet this must
                            greatly depend upon Zion's travel, and the purity of souls therein. Through the telescope of
                            prophecy, and spiritual discernment, we can plainly perceive the light of Zion spreading,
                            not only in spiritual views and doctrines, but in real gospel principles, which constitute
                            the foundation of Christ's true kingdom. These are being perceived and believed by thousands
                            of candid, sincere souls. This, I think, will not be disputed by any true Believer who has
                            watched the moving of the spirit<pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> upon the ocean of society's troubled
                            waters. In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of Him,
                            not only as his peculiar people, to whom He has, for a peculiar purpose, made manifest a
                            glorious light, by which they know and understand the whole mystery, root and foundation of
                            sin, and the requirements of a full cross against it; but such are dwellers about Jerusalem,
                            who hold a kind of spiritual union through the connection or instrumentality of invisible
                            spirits from whom they derive a measure of light and comfort, in living up to the dictates
                            of their best faith ; they pray with their faces towards Zion, and their course is
                            thitherward. Now the temporal glory and beauty of Zion however important it may be ; her
                            natural improvements, and outward order; her spiritual wrorship, her divine gifts and sacred
                            melody, all sink into insignificance in the scale of importance when compared with that pure
                            love and charity for lost souls which the true gospel children, who have suffered in
                            tribulation for their own purification, are alone able to feel. This disinterested and
                            yearning spirit for the salvation and happiness of all souls, our Savior and blessed Mother
                            possessed, in a superlative degree. All our first spiritual parents, according to their
                            measure of baptismal anointing into this parental spirit, also consecrated their lives,
                            through sufferings, for the birth of precious souls into the kingdom of God. Our Savior
                            vehemently reproached the Pharisees of his day, on account of their bigoted zeal relative to
                            outward sanctity, and the over zealous observance of traditions, rites and ceremonies, even
                            those given by Moses, while at the same time they passed over justice, mercy, truth, and the
                            love of God, and bound others with heavy burdens which they would not even so much as touch
                            with their fingers. And St. James declares, "Pure religion and undefiled before God the
                            Father" to consist in sympathizing relief to the fatherless and widows, who were in poverty
                            and affliction, and to "keep unspotted from the world.'' Jas. i., 27. Also Ezekiel, 34th.
                            chap. "Woe to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves ; Should not the shepherd feed
                            the flock r Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe ye with the wool, but ye feed not the flock ! The
                            diseased have ye not strengthened, and neither have ye healed that which was sick."
                            Therefore, must we not conclude that the real and true work of God is not so much in outward
                            form, grace or beauty, not in mere words or sounds, but in charity, mercy, love and
                            forbearance towards lost and repenting souls. Brotherly and sisterly love, gospel
                            friendship, a meek and humble deportment before all men ; a harmless, loving spirit and a
                            godly example, are virtues of most value, and of greatest consequence, as evidences of the
                            genuineness of the Christian profession, and from these qualifications, weak and hungering
                            souls may reap durable strength, courage and sustenance. It is written that God's people
                            should be " a peculiar people," and, it would almost seem that each individual child of God,
                            or, in other words, such as are truly called to Zion in this day, are very peculiarly
                            endowed, if not in their natural creation and organization, at least, they (each one) appear
                            to have been rather peculiarly prepared, through some<pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> ordeal or
                            process of light and conviction, at, or previous to entering the gospel field, or door of
                            confession end repentance. Now this peculiarity or eccentricity, whatever it may be called,
                            may in some cases perhaps, be necessary qualifications to fit them for the station they were
                            designed to fill; for such persons are frequently found to possess some rare, remarkable,
                            and choice virtues, which perhaps, we freely ascribe to them, yet they are sometimes so
                            curious, so strange, so peculiarly gifted with some peculiar impressiou spiritually, and
                            operations so zealous in some particular respects that to some they appear abnormal, and a
                            pharisaical spirit would feel like shutting them out of union and fellowship. But such an
                            unbrotherly, unchristianlike, uucharitable spirit and feeling is a stumbling-block to
                            inexperienced souls, and debars from that enjoyment of sweet social communion which is of
                            greatest importance, and productive of greatest evidences of our discipleship ; for, "by
                            this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another." "Charity
                            suffereth long and is kind, seeketh no*: its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
                            rejoiceth in the truth." &amp;c.�1 Cor. xiii. May God be merciful to his Zion, and so
                            prepare her inmates, that when honest, seeking souls come to her courts under true
                            conviction, they may find her sons and daughters clothed with this gospel spirit of our
                            Heavenly Parentage that they may behold no stumblingblocks. And whatever may be the outward
                            adorning and temporal prosperities of Zion, above all let the spirit of our Savior and
                            blessed Mother Wisdom govern the movements of all of Zion's children and a lamblike, meek
                            and loving spirit be visible in all their intercourse and dealings with each other, both in
                            private and public. 'Comfort, comfort ye my people." "Lovest thou me? Feed my lambs."

                                a little pamphlet giving some history of the Shakers. It says that the Shakers believe
                                that the second coming of Christ was made manifest in the person of Ann Lee, their
                                founder, more than a hundred years ago, when she came from England and settled near
                                    Al-<pb n="178" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> bany, New York. Have you a book that describes the life of
                                Ann Lee ? Please let me know the price of it. Have you a book describing all about your
                                religion, your belief and church doctrine! Let me know the price of your catechisms
                                &amp;c. Do your people diet auy, or are you particular what you eat and drink ? Do
                                you take medicines when sick ; or are you like our Water-cure people, that do not
                                believe in taking medicines when sick? Some water-cure people believe we should not use
                                the flesh of animals : they think we ought to live on bread, milk, cream, butter, eggs,
                                fruits and vegetables. You have probably heard of Emanuel Swedenborg ; he started the
                                denomination of Christians called Sweden borgians. Swedenborg was a vegetarian ; so says
                                White's Life of Swedenborg ; neither was he ever married. I think he was a great and
                                wonderful man. You can get ' Life of Swedenborg' for 25 cts ; send 25 cts. to J. B.
                                Lippincott &amp; Co., book publishers, Phil., and they will send you the book free
                                of postage. Did Ann Lee recommend your people what to eat and drink, or did she tell
                                what was best for mankind to eat and drink in this world ? Did she receive her religious
                                doctrine from the Lord, or from angels ? Please give short answers to my questions, or
                                part of them, as you think proper. Please write soon. Yours truly,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Keefover, James R." TEIform="persName"/>Jas. R.

                                from England with her, did not touch or teach it. Chastity�celibacy� for the married and
                                unmarried, she enjoined, taught, and practiced. Community of goods was also put into
                                practical operation, and has been successfully carried out by seventeen societies�sixty
                                families or communities. Peace principles, putting an end to wars and fightings, private
                                and national, are incorporated into their everyday life by all Shakers, collectively and
                                individually. Labor�industry, and economy, are equal upon all members, including all the
                                officers of the institution. There is no exception. Land, labor, food, lodging ; care of
                                each other in health and in sickBess, are equally enjoyed. These elements and principles
                                constitute the foundations of the first of seven cycles, through which the Gospel will
                                pass, before full redemption from the number of the beast�G66�is attained. There are so
                                many forms of evil humanity are now suffering under. Would it have been wise to attack
                                them all at once? "No man can see God and live." A full view of ourselves, as God sees
                                us, would annihilate us. The children of Israel could not bear the sight of Moses, after
                                he had been with the God of Israel for forty days. The voice of that God so frightened
                                    them,<pb n="179" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> that they fled away in great haste. And if they could
                                not stand before Moses and the God of the Jews, how could they stand before the Father
                                and Mother of all souls in all worlds? We are just now laying the foundations of the
                                Second Cycle of our Order. The trumpet�testimony�sounds longer and louder, warning the
                                people to pull up the stakes and pitch their tents, to be ready to move from the old
                                campingground to a new and more appropriate location�spiritually. The new fouudation
                                stones will be laid upon those already laid in the first cycle. 1. There will be a
                                limitation of the land to the needs of the people. In other words, the people will own
                                and hold no more land than they can cultivate without hiring outside worldlings. 2. They
                                will cease the use of all animal food, gained by killing. "Thou shalt not kill" is a
                                command. 3. Intoxicating drinks, with tobacco, opium, narcotics, will be entirely
                                dispensed with. 4. All poisonous medicines and drugs will be let alone. Food will be the
                                medicine used, in all cases of physical derangement. 5. Proper diet, with pure air, day
                                and night, good drainage to the dwelling-house, that should be so constructed as to
                                breathe naturally, like a great mammoth. Bed-rooms, where thorough cleansing of bed and
                                bedding can be effected each day. And pure water, free from foreign matter. These will
                                be amongst the good things of the coming cycle. And the gift of healing for all such as
                                will go and sin no more, will be ever present in any time of trouble. About the book, I
                                shall probably obtain it; but do not expect that its theory equals our practice. I have
                                no reason to believe that there is so perfect a state of sanitation anywhere in America
                                as exists at the North Family in Mt. Lebanon, Col. Co., N. Y. Respecting Swedeuborg, we
                                can probably give you valuable information at a proper time.; but enough for the

                                many of our readers. Ed.] South Groton, Mass. Dear Br. James G. Russell ;�I have not
                                forgotten our agreement to exchange a few lines, and by no means have I forgotten my
                                correspondent; so far from that, I think that there has not been a week pass since I was
                                at your place, that I have not been favored with a tender recollection of yourself, the
                                young Brethren and Sisters, and your more matured Brethren and Sisters. When this vision
                                of the past flits across my recollection, I never fail to desire your prosperity. I
                                discerned among the young, powers, which when developed and more perfected by
                                experience, will enable them to do much good to themselves and others; and I have prayed
                                that their growth might be steady and their prosperity certain. The Bible record of the
                                past you say is not as reliable to you as nature's universal law. This is not to be
                                wondered at, and I know not why it should be censured. If you were able to confide more
                                in the whole chain of history, of<pb n="180" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> God's past dealings with his
                                covenant people, perhaps you could draw support to a greater degree from past
                                inspiration, as well as from the laws of the universe ; thus the difference would be in
                                your favor. Your faith in the promises and prophecies given in scripture is creditable
                                to your candor and good understanding; as some say, "to your head and your heart;" this
                                reliance will be a strength to you in coming years. I do not marvel that you suppose the
                                sacred record lays a foundation for divergent theories; the land, if religion divides
                                much more, will be filled with theoretic creeds. There are millions who pour out gold
                                like water to build up these broken fragments; Where light has not scattered its rays to
                                teach men the whys and wherefores of seeming conflicting statements in the scriptures,
                                these clashing creeds will exist to darken the spiritual horizon. As the Bible is in
                                great measure a compilation of revelations given through different mediums, why should
                                we be surprised to learn that there are discrepancies. If it has been so with us wh\ not
                                so with other chosen witnesses. If well understood I think that there is nothing in the
                                8th. chapter of Heb. that has any bearing at all to conflict with the doctrine of
                                mediatorship, but exactly the reverse. The first patriarchal covenant being broken in
                                the starting family relation or kindreds of the earth, when the second was given to
                                Moses to cross the race into nationality, it necessarily had to be defective in the
                                extreme, to meet the depraved animal condition of man. This being so, Paul speaks of a
                                more perfect, first Christian covenant given under Jesus, and predicts finally the more
                                perfect, second covenant to be given in the last days. In this last period he promises
                                "Unto all who look for him he will appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
                                All these epochs show clearly the leading mediators with whom these covenants were made
                                ; but the subject opens so wide a field for investigation, that it would be difficult to
                                condense it in the contracted space of one, two or three letters. You ask, " Is
                                tribulation a necessary part of the Christian scheme?" My answer is, I think not. If you
                                should ask me if it is a result of man's loss and the gospel travel, I should return a
                                different answer. In nature entirely out of God's order, there is not a " thus saith the
                                Lord," that impels or restrains him in generation ; and he desires none. All his
                                antecedents were sinful, which leaves him in impenetrable darkness respecting God's
                                generative law ; consequently man's nature is perverse. When called into the gospel,
                                then the business before him is to travel out of a nature " that never was subject to
                                the law of God neither indeed can be." Now, my friend, if any one can take such a nature
                                and destroy it without eufferiDg, it must be acknowledged that he has made a greater
                                discovery than to have brought out a perpetual motion. The candidate for salvation must
                                bear the common cross laid upon all the household of faith and if any can do this
                                without frequent mental anguish and sorrow I do not think that God or any good spirit
                                would object to it. It seems that Jesus found no way to gain redemption on this system
                                of self-denial made easy. Paul speaking of the spiritual travel of Jesus said, " He
                                offered up prayers<pb n="181" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> and supplications with strong crying and tears
                                unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared. Though
                                he were a Son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered." Heb. v., 7, 8.
                                It appears that we all have to tread the same wine-press. Still with you I do not thiuk
                                that God created in man the necessity to bear and to suffer. Man was created upright in
                                nature and had he so remained till as John saw "a door was open in heaven" for him to
                                pass through and travel from that state into the gospel state, I think we would have
                                heard but little about his great sufferings. He certaiuly would have been a different
                                being, consequently would have had a different travel. I have passed hastily over these
                                pleasant and well meant queries to secure time, and space to notice one point in your
                                letter at some length. Xou say, " I am no candidate for theological distinction, no
                                teacher, but simply a plain farmer with a desire for spiritual knowledge." I doubt not
                                you are well aware that the labors of the husbandman or any other hand labor practiced
                                under our order can be worked up into one of the most important theological principles
                                ever incorporated with the Christian life. It is generally thought that Mother Ann was
                                the originator of hand labor for Christians, I think differently and iu raising such an
                                inquiry we will endeavor to get up a plain, common sense conversation. HAND LABOR
                                CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY. It is our privilege not only to inquire but to understand how every
                                principle was introduced that we are called to practice. It has been said by our deepest
                                ^thinkers and best theologists that Mother Ann introduced no principle that Jesus did
                                not introduce before her. Evidently Jesus planted the germs or seed of every principle
                                on which the New Creation is to be built and stand. Therefore it was his work to plant
                                them on parth and it was left to Mother to bring them to perfection. Among the most
                                important of these confessedly stands hand labor. Our inquiry will be, Did not Jesus and
                                the Apostles introduce hand labor as a Christian principle into the primitive Church by
                                practice and injunction. THE PARENTS OF JESUS WERE POOR WORKING PEOPLE. They had their
                                life experiences evidently among the lowly ; they dwelt in Nazareth the most inferior
                                district in Jewry. However upright, they exerted no great influence in society ; for
                                when on a religious pilgrimage, they were compelled to find lodgings in a manger where
                                the Redeemer was born and where the shepherds were sent to bow in simple worship to
                                Jesus. Joseph being a working man knew well the privations of the needy. When Jesus was
                                entering public life as an inspired teacher, a simple incident presents to us the
                                occupation of his father. With power and authority beyond the Scribes he came out and
                                declared his mission and immediately the inquiry went round, kWIs not this the
                                carpenter's Son." Matt, xiii., 55. JESUS LEARNS A TRADE. Dr. A. Clark says, "Among the
                                ancient Jews every father was bound to do four things for his son. 1st. To circumcise
                                him. 2nd. To redeem him. 3rd.<pb n="182" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> To teach him the law. 4th. To learn
                                him a trade." This last was founded on the following just maxim. "He who teaches not his
                                son to do some work, is as if he taught him robbery." Then, this requirement was squared
                                alike upon the rich and poor by the law of God. Joseph evidently taught Jesus the same
                                occupation at which he toiled for his daily bread. After he had ended the affair at the
                                temple with the Lawyers and Doctors and had been admonished for marking out his own
                                course he passively returned from Jerusalem with his parents and came to Nazareth and
                                was subject to them. Luke ii., 51. Then between the ages of twelve and thirty years
                                Jesus perfected himself as a tradesman, in the Village where he was brought up, Luke
                                iv., 16, for when he began his mission many were astonished at his wisdom or knowledge
                                and said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary." Mark vi., 3. And they were
                                offended at him. They considered him of too low origin for a divine teacher, too
                                unlearned a laboring man, hence they looked down upon him and set him at naught. How
                                little thought Jesus and others when he was toiling through long hours in youthful life
                                that the very hand labor he was performing he would eventually be called upon to
                                establish as a cardinal principle in the Church to aid in the salvation of the human
                                family. Yet such has been the fact in the first and second advent and will be till the
                                last offer of redemption is made. THE HABITATION OF JESUS. John the Baptist met Jesus as
                                a stranger (for he said, "I knew him not,") and in the act of baptizing him John
                                received the sign from the heavens which taught that he was the Christ. The day after
                                his baptism, John stood in company with two of the disciples and directing their
                                attention to Jesus, said, "Behold the Lamb of God," and the two disciples followed
                                Jesus. Jesus turned and said to them; "What seek ye?" They say unto him, "Master where
                                dwellest thou?" He evidently had a home, an abiding place of his own, a then present
                                residence. He saith unto them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he dwelt, and
                                abode with him that day, for it was the tenth hour. Johni., 37, 39. Jesus could
                                entertain his friends the disciples whom he invited to his residence ; there he welcomed
                                Nicodemus, who came to him by night, and no doubt others. He could provide for�thema
                                day, and if so he could have kept them longer. He could say as said Peter, "silver and
                                gold have I none." Then he must have supplied his humble residence by his own industry.
                                From this item of history we may more than infer that the disciples first saw and began
                                to study the equalizing principle at the humble home of Jesus. They saw it was founded
                                on industry, prudence and Christ like liberality. John seems to refer to this early
                                state of things when he says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard
                                and looked upon ; for the life was manifested and we have seen it." 1 John i., 1, 2.
                                Here seems to have been the starting ground of Christian community, the gathering at
                                pentecost, the Church at Jerusalem and among the Gentiles was an outgrowth from this.
                                Mother Ann was prepared by prophecy, and suitable provision was made for<pb n="183" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> the coming of the Believers. This was one of her strong arguments to
                                prove her mission. With the facts before us we may conclude with safety that Jesus did
                                as much to prove his mission. At the habitation of Mother Ann, the Believers first
                                studied Christian community and a universal brotherhood, while the present expanded
                                state of our order, shows a far riper growth. Thus though ages roll between, with
                                changes, overturns and the downfall of empires how beautifully succeeding degrees of
                                inspiration bring out the same truths and their results corrected and improved by the
                                Almighty Authors. THE APOSTLES WHEN CALLED WERE WORKING MEN. All the disciples, or
                                learners, were working men withont doubt by design, instead of accident. We have no
                                knowledge that any were agriculturists, but they were made up of fishermen, tax
                                gatherers and perhaps other laboring men. As they were to practice hand labor as leaders
                                in the Church, it was evidently desirable that all should have this qualification to
                                start with. For we eaa. show positively that this important requisition was laid upon
                                all who were called Apostles, after they commenced their Christian ministry, not
                                excepting Paul who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel.

                            They are to occupy important places : make them beautiful." Each alike anxious to obey

                                will willingly exercise a little care for the benefit of their own cultivation and as
                                anxiously assist, so far as they are able, in establishing a love for the the truth and
                                no less an interest for a thorough discipline over the thoughts. Idle and impure words
                                are the legitimate offspring of a class of thoughts of corresponding character. The
                                Psalmist was, without doubt, dwelling with solicitude upon this subject when he penned
                                that worthy, godly admonition. "Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking
                                guile." So essential is this in the preserving of peace among mankind, that to be doubly
                                sure of success in selfgovernment, we make this petition, "Set a watch, O Lord, before
                                my mouth : keep thou the door of my lips." Certainly, the sons of God should have a pure
                                language, as this would go far to establish the truthfulness of their heavenly origin.
                                Indeed, we may suppose this was the case, as a deviation so marked as to have every
                                imagination evil, met with a severe rebuke in the early history of the race. "And G-od
                                saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the
                                heart was evil continually." Such a state of the mind was a great departure from God's
                                law, and culminated as we might have supposed it would, in the ruin of nearly all of the
                                human family. A discipline of the thoughts has been a subject which many of the
                                inspirational writers of the Bible have kept, in all clearness, before the people. "Let
                                the unrighteous man forsake his [unrighteous] thoughts, and let him return unto the
                                Lord." He had gone from God. In all probability he had made friends of the wicked, and
                                his thoughts were like the company he kept. The advice of the prophet, '' Forsake your
                                wicked ways, change your thoughts and return to the Lord," was the only sure road to
                                success. To justify the indulgence in thinking', having for a plea that a person cannot
                                control the thoughts may have some force in a crude, vulgar mind, as the habit of
                                drinking, gives a plea to the man that keeps company with social tipplers and is a
                                constant visitor to the sample room. If Jesus was correct, and we think he was, he knew
                                quite well what he was anxious to cultivate among those who came to hear him. He said, "
                                The good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things." It is
                                quite evident that such a man must<pb n="185" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> "delight in the law of the
                                Lord," and take pleasure in having a strict discipline over the mind. Books or
                                conversation suggestive of evil or impure thoughts may so far corrupt the miud, as to
                                change the whole course of a person's life, and like the fires of the hidden volcano,
                                break out at a time and place when least expected. The indifference assumed by some
                                persons in the remark,�"It does me no harm," may not terminate even so well as it did
                                with honest old Tray, that was found in bad company. There is great danger in becoming
                                familiar with any form of wrong doing. It may not seem particularly unpleasant at first,
                                and may possibly elicit the approbative smile, but so certain as the influence has a
                                tendency toward error, it will by farther development lead to ruin. The vivid
                                illustration of this subject by the poet, is the very embodiment of truth. "Vice is a
                                monster of so frightful mien, As, to be hated, needs only to be seen; Yet seen too oft,
                                familiar with her face, We first endure, then pity, then embrace." St. Paul in his
                                advice to the church of Corinth, recommended the Brethren " to bring into captivity
                                every thought to the obedience of Christ." Could he have spoken more directly to the
                                point ? His knowledge of the treatment of the Roman captives, gave great power to his
                                form of speech. He had, in all probability, witnessed the triumphal processions where
                                captive kings and queens, loaded with chains or with halters around their necks, were
                                marched abjectly behind the car of the victorious monarch. These were brought into
                                captivity, and so thoroughly subdued that they had not the least power to act. The
                                apostle would have the thoughts as thoroughly under the control cf the mind as these
                                captives were under the conqueror. It was a forcible representation of the power of the
                                victor and of the hopeless state of the captive. Corinthian soldiers of the cross of
                                Christ who were engaged in the spiritual warfare, might with honor treat their evil
                                thoughts as the victors treated their captives. St. Paul says, secure every thought and
                                allow those only to go from you that are in obedience to the spirit of Christ. If the
                                teachers of two thousand years ago were so earnest in their endeavor to establish a
                                careful regard for the thoughts, lest they corrupt the mind, we certainly should be
                                stimulated to a much greater faithfulness in this respect. It is with pleasure that we
                                notice the agitation of this subject, and the formation of a society that can glory in
                                this beautiful, evangelical motto,�"Keep thyself pure." Gathering under the protection
                                of the " White Cross" they can pledge, in all fidelity, with a promising hope of
                                victory. They agree to abstain, carefully and persistently, from all rude or impure
                                language and from all coarse and vulgar jests. They not only promise to make this a
                                special work for themselves, but also to assist all others in accomplishing the same.
                                That an abundance of good fruit may be gathered by this society of benevolent, moral
                                workers, will be the fervent prayer of every Christian mind.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Reverence is the golden clasp that holds secure the treasures of the soul" TEIform="index"/>

                                        well preserved man of 64 years. He has a bright eye, elastic step, handsome
                                        face, long, flowing white beard, and hair of the same color that falls in heavy
                                        locks upon his shoulders. He is a man who will attract attention in any crowd.
                                        He is a fine conversationalist, and has some queer notions, but he can't be
                                        called a crank for he never obtrudes his opinions upon others unless he is asked
                                        to give his ideas about various social matters. A reporter of the Review,
                                        desiring to learn how he kept so healthy and well preserved, interviewed the
                                        gentleman on the subject. " So you want to know how I live? " said the professor
                                        in answer to a question. Well, we never eat meat of any kind, no fine wheat
                                        bread, no pickles or spices of any kind, no pie, cake or pastry, of any
                                        description, and we never drink tea, coffee, liquor or even water at meal time.
                                        What do we live on? Well, we eat two meals a day�one at 12 o'clock noon and the
                                        other at 6 o'clock in the evening and we never eat a particle between meals. We
                                        partake of Graham flour bread, baked in various ways, oatmeal, cracked wheat,
                                        rice, potatoes and all kinds of vegetables, cooked in a great many different
                                        ways, and we never fail to have fruit of some kind on the table. We are
                                        vegetarians and you can readily see that the plan agrees with us for we are
                                        never sick. I have lived that way for twenty five years, and I have never been
                                        sick a day in all that time. I have never been forced to break an engagement on
                                        account of any physical ailment. I can walk a long distance without getting
                                        tired and I am in good trim throughout. I am a living example of the vegetarian

                                        everything, but still I don't believe in prohibition, because I believe that
                                        every person should be allowed to do as he pleases in the matter of eating and

                            Outside a chapel door. And the chant came floating outward, "Leave all and follow me." And I
                            thought if I should enter Perhaps I should be free. So I knelt low at the Altar, And laid my
                            treasure there ; One by one, with sadness, slowly, For some were very fair. But one was so
                            very precious That I kept it, I was weak. And I thought, sure all the others Will give the
                            peace I seek. I rose and left the Altar, Hoping I should be blest, But my heart was just as
                            heavy And my soul received no rest. Then I built a grand cathedral, And gave alms far and
                            wide, But my wishes were not granted, Nor my bright hopes verified. And none of my mighty
                            efforts, None of my patient thought Gave to my spirit comfort, Or brought the boon I
                                sought.<pb n="187" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> And I journeyed the wide world o'er In search of the
                            missing peace, Toiling from morn till ev'ning, And rinding no release. Till I came again one
                            morning To that little wayside place Where I had left my treasures, Hoping to meet his
                            grace. And I heard again the music Of the chant, "Leave all for me," And I cried, " I will,
                            my Master, If thou wilt make me free ! " Once more I kneeled at the Altar, And bowing low my
                            head, I dropped my cherished treasure ; Then all my sadness fled, And suddenly all around me
                            With radiant glory beamed, And my heart so filled with rapture And wonder, that it seemed
                            That the very gates of heaven Were ope'd unto my soul, And the peace that passeth knowledge,
                            Came down and made me whole.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Miscellaneous" TEIform="index"/>War</head><div3 type="shaker-press" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Resistance or non-resistance" TEIform="index"/>RESISTANCE OR NON-RESISTANCE.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">In an extract from Prof. E. D. Cope, published in Unity, some time ago, I
                                        find these words : "If resistance to evil were more general, the world would be
                                        better." I say unto you, "Resist not evil," are the words of Jesus. Now do Jesus
                                        and Professor Cope teach antagonistic doctrines? If so, I must accept the
                                        teachings of Jesus rather than of Professor Cope. Did not the Shakers resist
                                        evil in the most effectual manner, and in the spirit of the precepts of Jesus,
                                        when in their early history, they faced their persecutors, not with swords and
                                        clubs in their hands, but with stern and stinging rebuke, telling their
                                        persecutors that they were contending against the spirit of truth, against the
                                        teachings of Jesus, against their own sense of right, when they scourged,
                                        imprisoned, fined and tortured them for no crime of theirs, for no harm they had
                                        done, or wished to do, but because they worshiped God according to the dictates
                                        of their own conscience, and taught the members of their community to obey to
                                        the letter the precepts of Christ? It seems that this kind of resistance towards
                                        their enemies and persecutors proved effectual in quelling their hate and
                                        enmity, and soon made them their defenders and friends. We wish that Professor
                                        Cope would explain the exact methods we are to adopt in resisting evil. Are we
                                        to resist evil by doing evil? Is the old Mosaic code, "an eye for an eye, a
                                        tooth for a tooth," to be practiced now that Jesus has given us a different and,
                                        as we think, a better rule to go by?</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Unity" TEIform="index"/></bibl></cit></p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="B., J.

                                        will be most effective to do it with. When the offering is laid on the altar of

                                        another's hand and it must be crucified from without. Every child of God will be
                                        tested, and the eye of God will watch to see if it yields, simple and willing to
                                        have its human nature burned away, or whether it will yield to its human nature

Dibble.] The cause of human redemption has its
                                        pioneers in every generation from Israel down. Succeeding ages, liberty had its
                                        adTocates. That nation which advanced according to light, prospered and escaped
                                        the curses due to tyranny. In Russia, in England and in our own joasted land of
                                        liberty there is a call for reform. Monopoly threatens to control Government and
                                        all business enterprise. Seats of Government are becoming theaters of amusement
                                        and dissipation, where aristocracy is encouraged and license is granted which
                                        makes widows and orphans, and fills prisons and almshouses. The toiling millions
                                        are asserting their right to live and breathe, think and speak, and possess an
                                        honest compensation. Men are advocating the right of the poor to a portion of
                                        the soil upon which they were born. The struggle of the masses is for existence
                                        and subsistence. It is no more nor less than the spirit of Moses praying the
                                        modern Pharoahs, to let the oppressed go free, to inherit God's blessings. Will
                                        they find relief, or shall the result of tyranny follow? We hear from every
                                        pulpit that if Christian love prevailed it would bring the Millennium; but how
                                        is brotherly love practical, without equality? Is aristocracy on one hand, and
                                        destitution and servitude on the other, congenial to brotherhood? Does the
                                        possession of millions give a Christian, license to lord it over his fellows?
                                        Slavery said so. The millionaires say so. Humanity, says so. Christianity says,
                                        Nay ; God is just to his children. The rich man and Lazarus will have their
                                        deserts. "Oh men of wealth and station, Heed how you use your power, For clouds

                                    minding. So a farmer might say that foxes and mice were not worth minding; but what
                                    if he finds his poultry and grain disappearing through the agency of these despised
                                    marauders? What if he finds that he must make war upon them", or abandon his produce
                                    and his property to their ravages? Anything which leads men astray from God and into
                                    darkness and sin, is worthy the attention of Christians, and if we were disposed to
                                    be astonished at anything in these days, we should look with amazement on the
                                    inaction of professed followers of Christ, while infidelity sweeps in around them
                                    like a flood. For one or two persons to attempt to stem this torrent, seems like
                                    undertaking an impossibility. Individuals can only hope to do their own personal
                                    work. This work we propose by the grace of God to accomplish, whatever may be the
                                    neglect and indifference of others. And while many who bear the name of Christ are
                                    building their dividing walls and separating and scattering the flock of God, thus
                                    laying stumbling blocks in the way of sinners, regardless of the dying petition of
                                    Him who prayed that they all might be one, that the world might know that He was
                                    sent of God; we hope to do our little to oppose t!:ese evil tendencies, by

                                    Of course a few single-handed workers without wealth or influential connections can
                                    hope to do but little; but if those who have means and opportunities neglect the
                                    work, those who see the need must do what they can to meet it, and ask the Lord to

                                    riding in a steamer down one of the world's broad rivers, when he fell into a
                                    conversation with a pilot. "How long," he asked, ''have you been a pilot on these
                                    waters?" The old man replied, "Twenty-five years; and I came up and down many times
                                    before I became a pilot.' "Then," the young man said, "I think you should know every
                                    rock and every sand-bank in the river." The old man smiled at his friend's
                                    simplicity, and replied, "Oh, no! I don't; but I know where the deep water is." It
                                    is not necessary for young men to have intimate and experimental knowledge of every
                                    sand-bank of moral danger, and every rock where character and hope may be shattered.
                                    It is enough to know where the deep waters are, the waters of purity, health,
                                    noble-mindedness, and righteousness ; and with the Pilot of Galilee on board, the

                                themselves." ' What you love you think about: what you love, you strive to obtain. Good
                                thoughts are like good air, invigorating and strengthening. "Pure thoughts produce their
                                image on the soul, and a beautiful image it is." Pure thoughts are good company. Have as
                                many of them as possible. The best guard against impurity of action is purity of
                                thought. Every pure thought is valuable. " When a thought comes to your brain, That
                                would place on life a stain, Banish it from heart and mind, Eor a purer thought to
                                find." Keep your spirits constantly guarded with<pb n="190" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> virtuous thoughts
                                and no evil can enter there. "To near your God be pure in heart." Cultivate virtuous
                                thoughts and you will gain untold happiness�riches without measure. Fit yourselves for
                                that home where you wish to go. Keep your thoughts pure and you will make rrogress
                                toward a healthy body and soul. Thoughts produce actions, actions strengthen habits,
                                habits form characters. The more you strive for purity, the better. If you have
                                virtuous, loving thoughts they will write themselves in your faces and manners, and they
                                n&gt;ay be encouraging to those who read them. Your lives will be spotless if your thoughts
                                are pure. Watch well what seed you sow, for from the seed comes the crop. Like will
                                produce like. Watch against temptations, evil influences, all the wiles of the
                                adversary. Otherwise there is no safety. Sow well, reap well. If the sowing be sinful,
                                the harvest will be painful. If you sow thoughts that are impure, your harvest will be
                                grief and sorrow. If you sow the precious seed of loving, virtuous thoughts, thoughts
                                that will bear the fruit of truth and purity, you are sowing that which will yield rich
                                returns. When you have for your companionship virtuous thoughts, you have an element of
                                constant joy, and of constantly increasing joy. As you have sown, so shall you reap. The
                                sowing has been in your hearts and lives, the reaping is there also. The precious fruits
                                of the spirit are yours. If I have said that which will awaken in your hearts purer
                                thoughts and higher aspirations, then am I blest and happy.

                                In trying to get out again, it struck the window with such force as to fall to the floor
                                perfectly stunned. We carried it out and placed it in front of the house where we could
                                see if it revived. Presently another bird came and hopped around it, then going a short
                                distance, would return as though seeking to induce it to fly; but all of no avail; the
                                poor bird remained motionless. The well bird then went away, but soon returned with
                                another bird. They both went directly to the little senseless bird and began to peck its
                                head vigorously. This continued a few seconds, when the unfortunate bird seemed to
                                recover, arose, and all three flew away, apparently quite happy. Canterbury, N.

                                    Ky., about twenty-five miles from Evansville, Ind.. is creating considerable
                                    excitement among the negroes of that section by his claims to supernatural power and
                                    a revelation, He claims to be a licensed apostle of God. He declares that he daily
                                    converses with the angel Gabriel, and that he has been delegated to lead all of his
                                    people back to their native land in the wilds of Africa, where they in turn are to
                                    evangelize all of the savages of the Dark Continent. He says that the hour for
                                    departure is near at hand, but the time has not been designated by the angel. The
                                    negroes are greatly excited, and though many are dubious as to these divine
                                    dispensations, they keep their doubts to themselves, as M� has alwaj s maintained a
                                    strong influence over them and his word has been law. What causes many to believe
                                    this modern Mahomet is the prophecy, remembered by the older negroes, that he made
                                    concerning emancipation. The fulfillment of that prophecy has been the secret .of
                                    his long influence over them, and the additional fact that he is said to have
                                    prophesied the earthquakes last year, and the premonition of wonderful changes to be
                                    made in his race in the near future. Many of the negroes are getting themselves in

full line of over SO different colors.
LlXL IXL IXL 111 IXL IXL
The extremely hish prices at
which the IXL inks have been sold
ever since their ii'r -duction into
this country has h iherto limited
their use to the most critical or what
may be termed " gilt-edged " consinners. It is proposed now to so
reduce the prices as to make them
accessible to the masses.
The Violet and Red av- r< commanded above all other inks f><r
fountain lJen use as they contain
font B to SO times less solid mutter th'in the hest of other fountain
inks in general use.
It may seem increditable that any
ink used in fountain pens actually
contains as much solid matter in one
gallon as can be obtained by evaporating the water from 50 gallons
of the IXL Violet or Red. And
yet the fact may be easily demonstrated by any one. This explains
why 9 out of lOof all Fountain Pens
ever sold have been abandoned as
useless, or have done interior
service.
The TXTj Violet is also a good
cop 11 in gink, and is warrant- d io
preserved, steelpr-n from rusting.
