                            will he perfect, go sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
                            in heaven ; and come and take up the cross and follow me."Mark, x : 21. But some com- plain
                            of the tempter : "Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation." The vigilance which savers
                            from the tempter for one hour will save for two, and the vigilance that saved for two hours
                            will save for a week, and that which saved for a week, if continued, will save throughout
                            life. But of him thatyieldeth, it is written. "He goeth straightway as an ox goeth to the
                            slaughter, or a? a fool to the correction of the stocks, till a dart strike through his
                            liver ; as a bird hasteneth to the suave and knoweth not it is for his life. Hearken unto me
                            now," therefore. 0 ye children, and attend to the word^ of my mouth : Her house is the way
                            to hell, going down to the chambers of death." Prov. vii: 22, 23, 27. But let no man say
                            another tempts him, for the motor is within; the tempter is there, and the power of
                            resistance is there. "Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God. But every man
                            is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed (not the lust ot somebody else,
                            but his own.) Then when lusthath conceived, it 'bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is
                            finished, bringeth forth death." James, i : 13. This is the consequence. Now, then, the life
                            of Jesus Christ—¦ what was it? A life of self-denial or of <pb n="2" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 2 THE
                            MANIFESTO. indulgence? Was Hiolife a worldly life or something else? Let me ask you, who
                            profess to be Christians, was the Christ life a higher life than any of you now live, or was
                            it lower? Or was it the same? One thing is very certain—His life, which lie commends us to
                            copy, was either a higher life than yours, or it was lower, or it was the same. Can any one
                            lay his hand upon his heart and say his life was the same .as that of the professing world?
                            If not, all are bound to acknowledge that His is the higher life, which we are bound to
                            copy, or not call ourselves Christians. When Christ came, he found the natural order in as
                            much perfection, the marriage relation as sacred and as much respected as it is to-day, and
                            all the old heaven system, with its pillars and eorHer-stones as erect and perfect as now.
                            Did He come to make no change? Was He satisfied with the old? or did He set about the
                            creation of new heavens and earth? If so, how comes it that His professed followers are
                            satisfied with, and to be in, the old heavens, or the lower floor, and this in a very
                            dilapidated condition? How is this? Did He only cutTie to get up the most fallacious story,
                            and then say to the world: "Only believe this story, and you can remain in the old heavens,
                            and live the life of generation, copying the old life of Adam and Eve, and I will receive
                            you, and you shall be my children?" How is this? Does this appear rea- sonable ? Let us not
                            be longer deceived, "for God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.
                            If we sow to the flesh, we shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but if we sow to
                            tl:;&gt;. spirit, we shall of the spirit reap life everlasting." Gal. vi: 8. Whatdoauy
                            suppose is meant by "sowing to the flesh?" "Let us have clear ideas, and understand each
                            other. What did old Adam do ? Did he sow to the flesh or sow to the spirit? Whatsoever is
                            born of the flesh is flesh, and whatsoever is born of the spirit is spirit." You will
                            doubtless acknowledge that Adam, Noah, and the Patriarchs, and all the pillars of the old
                            heaven sowed to the flesh, and so they all did till the coming of the "Son of man," and so
                            do the professors of to-day, they all go on sowing to the flesh, and the promise of God is
                            sure to them, and that is, "they shall reap corruption." What difference do any surfpose God
                            will make between a professed minister of the gospel and his slave, when both of them are
                            sowing to the flesh? Will lie give corruption to the slave and life everlasting to the
                            minister? By no means. God is just, and no' respecter of persons ; and where the works and
                            motives are the same, the reward rest assured, will be the same. Again, how cruelly
                            mistaken, and what an egregious blunder the Son of God made, if He came to "create new
                            heavens and earth wherein righteousness should dwell," if the old would still answer the
                            purpose oi salvation, wherein all manner of unrighteousness, and hardly anything else,
                            exists ! Christ was not the supreme, but the Son of God—a godly man, who was "tempted in all
                            points (not some points) as we are." But what did He do? Why he denied himself of all
                            ungodliness, and every worldly lust, even in its most refined and modified forms, and
                            required the same of all His followers. Then I put to all, the pertinent ques- <pb n="3" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. tion : Is not the man, who, for purity's sake, likewise denies
                            himself as did Jesus, nearer like the pattern than anyone who does not J;hus ^leny^himself,
                            ? The honest answer must be that he is. Hence, after denying himself, Christ says : "If any
                            man (black, white, bond or free.) will come after me, let him deny himself (not gratify
                            himself,) and take up the cross and follow me ;" not follow somebody else, neither John the
                            Baptist, Moses, nor some of the patriarchs, but, follow me. But how do the people act? They
                            act as if Christ had said : "If any man will come after me, let him gratify himself." People
                            by their actions imply all this and more. But the apostle says : "'They that are Christ's
                            have crucified the flesh, with its affections and lusts." "And if we live in the spirit, let
                            us walk in the spirit." Gal. v : 24. If Paul had only said: "They that are Cirist's have
                            gratified the flesh with its affections and lusts," I would at once bow to the professors of
                            Christianity, black and white, '"blue spirits and grey ;" for nothing more true could be
                            said of them. But it so happens that (he terms crucified and gratified are not synonyms. And
                            I would ask where is the professor of Christianity among all the worldly sects—I mean
                            outside of this fold— who can, with this single test of Paul's before him, stand up, with
                            his hand on his heart, and his eyes turned toward heaven, and say : "Iain a Christian." I
                            venture the assertion that not one can be found. And why? Because they all go on gratifying
                            the flesh instead of crucifyi ::g it. They also live in the flesh and walk in the flesh ;
                            all in direct opposition to the test here given by Paul. This is a sweeping charge, and oh !
                            that it were only false ! In heaven's name of Christianity, I fervently wish ir were. There
                            is but one right way, and I cannot say any are right when the good fruits are not manifest.
                            I have endeavored to convince all that by coming into the ''new world"—by taking up the
                            cross and leading the Christian life of self-denial, all would thereby be rendered more
                            happy here a d hereafter, than by remaining in the "old heavens" and continuing in the
                            worldly life. If this is not true, the Son of God failed in His mission, and came into the
                            world in vain. Ail will admit however, that moments of pleasure attend you : "There is, I
                            grant, a triumph of the pulse, A (lance of spirits. ;i mere troth of joy, That numtles high,
                            that sparkles and expires, Leaving the soul more vapid than before.'' But if there are still
                            those who contend that true and perfect happiness is to be found" in the outer world, let
                            them produce their evidence. Statistics have shown that in at least one locality, out of
                            about one hundred thousand families, only tjiirteen were considered perfectly happy ! But
                            the condition of even the best of these, the confessional might disclose the part of Pope's
                            Placebo and Justin: "In spite of all his praises must declare, Ail he can find is bondage,
                            cost and care; Heaven knows. I shed full many a private tear, And sigh in silence, lest the
                            world might hear !', If this, then, is the case with those considered most happy, what must
                            be that of the most miserable? And what the condition of the libertine, whose sole enjoyment
                            is— "------------------A transient gust. Spent in a sudden storm of lust— A vapor fed from

                            heads of Europe,—a millionaire was rarely to be found ; and when found, he (for who can find
                            a woman disconnected with a man that possesses her millions, except by dowery ?) was treated
                            with marked respect and reverence, and by some considered almost an object of adoration.
                            Others were filled with hatred, jealousy and envy ; feeling that so i;.uch wealth had never
                            come into the hands of one individual honestly; but bore the insignia of.in- justice, and
                            could only havebeen obtained by oppressiug and grinding the faces of the poor. What a marked
                            change has been gradually wrovght in .society,-especially "in America—in that time ! Now, it
                            is of common occurrence, as obituary notices show, that individuals accumulate from one to
                            two hundred millions of dollars ! then, at their demise, as die they must, they leave their
                            unjust hoardings of wealth for heirs to wrangle over, and lawyers by prolonged litigation to
                            fatten upon ; and in turn fill their coffers until they also become millionaires. Some
                            persons hold on to those ill gotten riches with a miser's grasp. Oth- ers, through
                            sensuality, and yielding to perverted appetites, squander their wealth and in reality become
                            paupers, and are a burden upon society. Quite recently, we noticed in some public journals,
                            an account of one millionaire, who became a rag-picker, and died in abject poverty. But,

                            such monsters in human form as Nero and Caligula. Also it prepared men to be soldiers,

                            that the French clergy not only permitted, but looked upon dancing in their churches with
                            favour until the twelvth century, and in this present nineteenth century it forms part of
                            the Easter Sunday ceremonies at the Cathedral of Seville in Spain. The principal actors are
                            boys, who are placed in the open space in front of the altar, five standing on each side

                            events. The first execution chronicled in the annals of the human race, is the Deluge. It
                            was a wholesale execution. The details were admirably planned and successfully carried out;
                            no hitch occurred in the arrangements ; all the world were spectators, and, alas I all the
                            world were delinquents. The tremendous cataclysm which overwhelmed the primeval people, most
                            effectually destroyed the sinners; but, had its infliction such a terrifying effect upon the
                            few survivors and their posterity as to prevent their sinning? Scarcely had the glowing
                            colors of the bow of promise faded from the once more cloudless sky when Noah's drunken
                            curses rang out upon his wicked child, condemning him and all his race to perpetual
                            servitude. The causes which seemed to justify the infliction of the death-penalty a
                            thousand, or even a hunired years ago, no longer exist. The political construction of
                            civilized nations a few generations since, was of such a character that it was impossible to
                            maintain many and costly prisons. It was impracticable to make prisoners earn their support
                            in industrial occupations ; and to provide for thein I out of the public funds, the
                            comparative poverty of those times did not admit. So the state put the large majority of
                            criminals to death, which was not only the most summary punishment which could be adminis-
                            tered, but also by far the cheapest. For it must be remembered that it was not murdei, only,

                            important considerations which reqiiL'e its abolition. In how many instances people have

                            known. In such cases restitution is impossible ; the guilty go unpunished and instead of one
                            murder, two have been committed. What a comment on human justice ! To deprive an individual
                            of his life on circumstantial evidence, is always and utterly unjustifiable; for there is
                            always a possibility of innocence. Six months ago, .a jury of twelve men, "good and true,"
                            in Jersey City, convicted two persons of murder, who, in consequence of the verdict wer-e

                            true," with precisely the same evidence before them, acquit the prisoners. Where was justice
                            in that case? One of the juries must have been wrong. If the former was right, than the
                            latter compounded a crime by allowing two murderers to go free ; if the latter was right,
                            then the former was ready to become murderers by causing two innocent persons to be put to
                            death. It is frightful to contemplate that, the fate of two human lives depended upon the
                            interpretation of some points of circumstantial evidence. Again, there is no doubt that many
                            murderers are acquitted because jurors refuse to become the cause of a fellow-being's death
                            as long as there is the slightest possibility of innocence; while if the law would punish
                            murder by imprisonment, conviction would be readily secured. Thus, justice is baffled, and
                            the community is endangered by having murderers go at liberty. The murderer has forfeited
                            his right to a social existence ; heretofore society got rid of its enemy by killing him;
                            the same end can be obtained now by confining him within the walls of a prison for the
                            remainder of his Mfe; let his labor pay for his support; let the Executive be deprived of
                            the pardoning power; let him die to the world politically and socially, but not physically
                            or morally. Then he will have time for reflection anil repentance; humanity will not be
                            shocked by brutal, demoralizing executions, and judges, jurors, executioners and all
                            concerned will be spared many harrowing pangs of eonscience. As the deluge failed to remove
                            sin from the earth; as the sanguinary doctrine of eternal darrnation failed to stamp out
                            unbelief, so Has capital punishment failed to suppress the crime of murder. So long as the
                            human heart is swayed by passions of revenge, of greed, of lust and hatred, so long will the
                            criminal annals continue to record instances of the violation of the sixth commandment. It
                            is only when the tone of public morality has been raised high enough that Cain's crime will
                            become unknown. "Thou shalt not kill," is an eternal law as well as a prophecy. Shall we not
                            begin its observance and hasten its fulfillment by blotting out from the statute-book its
                            legalized violation? Let human life at least be regarded as sacred: let the brutal law of
                            retaliation be supplanted by the divine law of love : thus we shall draw nearer to that
                            golden epoch when peace shall reign throughout the earth, and Christ shall appear the second

                            a cause, which to them, was from God. Marv Whitcher was the daughter of 8 <pb n="9" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. John Shepard, and was born in the town of Epping, N. H., Dec. 13, 1/52 She
                            remained in her father's family dor ing her childhood and youth, and is ac credited with
                            being a worthy and affectionate daughter. She joined her husband, Benjamin Whitcher, in the
                            wilderness, so soon as he had cleared sufficient land and builded a suitable residence for
                            the maintenance and protection of the family. Her brother John Shepard, who settled in
                            Gilmanton, and became a zealous preacher in the Eree Church, accompanied her on the journey
                            to her new home. At this time the section now known as Canterbury was included in Rockingham
                            County. It was several years before they had any neighbors nearer than two or three miL-s. A
                            "meeting house" was finally built and only two miles distant, but the doctrine was of the
                            Calvinistic order, as no other was permitted. This church creed was carefully guarded by the
                            law of the state, and every family was taxed for its support, whether they believed in the
                            doctrine that was preached or not. If any refused to pay, the officers would seize an amount
                            of property, sufficient to cancel the debt. Many an honest but poor dissenter of that day,
                            lost his pig, for the gospel's sake, or rather for the minister's sake. But those old and
                            cruel ways were destined to pass away, and a class of men and women arose who dared to think
                            for themselves on the subject of religion, and to have an untrammeled free will in regard to
                            what they should accept for a religious belief. That remarkable revival of religion of 1776
                            which parsed like a tidal wave over the New England States, enlisted the interest of Mary
                            Whitcher and her 9 family and paved the way for their acceptance of the testimony of Mother
                            Ann Lee. This was in 1782, as set forth by those able teachers and preachers, Israel Chauncy
                            and Ebenezer Cooley, who came from the Society of New Lebanon, N. Y. As a companion of
                            Benjamin Whitcher, Mary stood in every respect his equal. An economist in the things of this
                            life, a guide to the family, n protector among those who sought the hospitality of their
                            home, and as a conscien- tious, devoted and Christian parent. The best witness of the
                            goodness of her heart and of her motherly affection is, that her three sons, Joseph,
                            Benjamin and John, and her daughter Zilpha, should have, through a long life, always spoken
                            of her as a kind and affectionate guardian. Knowing as we do the many remarks that have been
                            made by those not friendly to the harvest work as taught by our Savior, Jesus Christ, of the
                            merciless havoc that was made by the Shakers in the separation of families, and of the
                            especial care that was taken, that no two persons from this one group should remain in the
                            same family of Shakers ; we here find a case that dates from the time when the society vas
                            formed in this State, where the father and mother and children have dwelt peacefully in
                            their own home. Through a religious conviction of duy to God, they changed the order of heir
                            relation from that of the narrow md selfish interest of husband and wife, o the more
                            universal and Christ-like order of brother and sister ; and from this date watched over
                            their children as parents in the Lord. An incident is related of the mother, hat occurred
                            previous to her acceptance of the faith. Having been from home vith the children, they all
                            returned at evening and passed to an upper room of <pb n="10" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> 10 THE MANIFESTO.
                            the dwelling. The Believers were engaged in their religious service, in another part of the
                            house. Suddenly the noise of singing and dancing was heard, which at first started the
                            children and one of them asked, What is that noise ? Mary's answer was as significant as it
                            was brief,—"Dancing, I suppose." She followed carefully in the rear of her husband in the
                            acceptance of a testimony which was to take from her those earthly relations which were
                            considered so honorable before the world. Step by step she passed slowly along till she was
                            able to receive a baptism of the spirit of ' Christ's work, when she became an able and
                            zealous advocate for the truth and really a mother in Israel. At the time of the formation
                            of the Society in 1792, Mary Whitcher was appointed as one of the directors of the temporal
                            interests. In this calling she won the respect and confidence of al[ her friends, and was
                            retained in the office for some years. In the manifestation of a prudent spirit, and in her
                            faithfulness to every duty assigned to her charge, she made an indelible im- pression upon
                            society which still lives in the loveliness of her memory. We learn from the records that
                            she made a visit to the society at Enfield, N. H. on the 19th. of January, 1797, in company
                            with Joanna Fletcher, Zadock Wright and Francis Winkley. It must have been a long and
                            wearisome sleigh ride, as the Believers at that early date, traveled through Boscawen,
                            Salisbury, Andover, Springfield and on to Enfield. Her health at this time was also quite
                            impaired, as she had for some months been sadly afflicted with a dropsical af- fection. She
                            endured her sufferings with a remarkable patience and quietly departed this life for a
                            renewed order in the world to come. Her death occurred on the 22nd. of March, 1797 at half
                            past two, P. M. in the 45th., year of her age. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Editor:—Please accept this Christmas offering from..." TEIform="index"/>

I am ninety years of age. Some of
                            you may think that I have lived to a great age, and so I have, four score and ten years.
                            Only think of it! Well, as this is my Birth month, and as I shall not be likely to meet you
                            all here, ninety years her.ce, I wish to hold sweet communion with you today through this
                            simple method, the silent language of the pen. Dear Ones, time, to me, seems to be passing
                            rapidly, I feel the infirmities of old age, my step is feeble, my hair is now silvery white,
                            and my eyes are not as bright as they once were. The years come and go much faster than they
                            did in former years. One writer says, "When I was young the skies were clear, and all things
                            wore a lovelier hue, when I was young." My song may differ a little from this, when I was
                            young, I received faith in the testimony of our beloved Mother Ann. It was blessed to my
                            soul. I was only fifteen years of age, when I was called of God to forsake the world and
                            live a new life; the life of consecration. My conscience was touched, my soul was awakened
                            and I heard the voice of God, I often had serious thoughts, in my childhood, especially when
                            I had done wrong, for I was quite certain I should not go to heaven, if I was disobedient to
                            my parents. "Children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor thy Father and
                                <pb n="11" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 11 Mother, that thy days may be long in the land
                            which God hath given thee as thy sacred inheritance." And, here let me say to the fathers
                            and mothers, that I believe it is just as necessary that we talk to our children of the
                            penalties of the wicked as of the joys of the just. Each are alike needed. Their minds are
                            like tender plants, and they should have great care from day to day, and living examples of
                            purity always before them. "The sinner will not go unpunished." I can say as did our Mother,
                            "once I served God through fear, but now I serve him with pure love.'' Well, as I have told
                            you, I was now a girl of fifteen summers, and had learned the difference between right and
                            wrong; I had not wealth to lay at the apostles' feet, but I had a precious soul to be saved
                            or lost. I had not great possessions, neither house nor lands to consecrate, but had a
                            selfish life to lay down, and I believe I did it willingly, I accepted the cross and blest
                            it. Now, while nearing the golden gates of yonder city, which needeth not the sun, for the
                            light of God is there, I feel the blessed effects of a life given to Him who many years ago,
                            said "child, give me thine heart," and I gave it without any selfish reserve. I shall not
                            always walk these streets as I do at the present time, but I have faith in God, wavering not
                            in the least. My reward is with me. I have not builded air castles all my life, neither have
                            I built upon the sand ; nay, I have secured my treasure in heaven, and the garment wrought
                            here in earth life, will be mine to wear in the land of souls. Dear children; You who are
                            young, need a great deal of love and charity. Some of you are young in faith as well as in
                            years, and must be carried in the arms of your gos- pel parents, until you have become
                            strong enough to walk; when, like little children in nature, you may stumble and perhaps
                            fall, many times, but the kind hand of parental love will place you again upon your feet.
                            Careful, anxious eyes will watch your every step, until you are able to stand or walk alone.
                            Forget not your kind benefactors, but when you have arrived at the age of maturity,— deal
                            kindly and lovingly with them ; and return to them that sweet affection and simple obedience
                            which is justly their due. This will make you lovely in the sight of angels, and beautiful
                            members of the church of Christ,—Be as a staff to them in their declining years and God will
                            bless you. I may never talk with you again in this life, therefore I would deelate unto you
                            my faith, so that you may all understand it, I am an old fashioned Shaker, and believe I
                            have a correct faith, and love to hear that beautiful song which you sometimes sing. "O give
                            me the faith of the fathers, A courage to do and to dare; Mid tempests the wi'Mest, And
                            billows the highest, O let me be true even there." This is a great favorite with me; it
                            speaks volumes to the soul. Now I shall feel free to tell you that I can have no fellowship
                            with the spirit of pride and vanity. These are. not of the fathers but of the world,
                            worldly. If ye be risen with Christ, ye can have no part nor lot in these things. Many years
                            ago, my faith called me to come down into the valley of sweet humiliation. Our good mother
                            and the first founders of our faith taught their children, that cleanliness was next to
                            godliness. "Keep your hands clean and your hearts pure," said Mother, "and chasten your
                            eyes, that they may not desire the unclean things of the world,, which defile the soul and
                            bring death and darkness." "Chasten your feet that they may not walk in by ways and crooked
                            paths which lead to destruction." "Chasten your tongues that you speak not evil one of
                            another, for the tongue is an unruly member, and is likened to a great fire ; therefore I
                            would that you be guided and led by the Holy Spirit, even the spirit of truth, which is
                            within you. If you are the children of the light, walk not in darkness, but, in the light of
                            God, which worketh true obedience." I never saw Mpther Ann, but, once while living at Gorham
                            Maine, I never saw Mother Lucy Wright. She was a beautiful woman and greatly gifted in
                            spiritual things. Her testimony and ministration were purity and love. I have also seen
                            Eldress Ruth Langdon, in 1825. Our worthy parents, the ministry of Mount Lebanon visited
                            this place and among the many privileges er.joyed with them, was a beautiful meeting in the
                            door-yard at Poland Hill. It was a society meeting, and the <pb n="12" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 12 THE
                            MANIFESTO. First Family or church, in company with the ministry marched to the Square House
                            when that family, also joined the ranks. The whole distance was one mile, but this joyful
                            meeting was one, never to be forgotten, we were all so happy and cheerful, as parents and
                            children met and exchanged gospel greetings of love and affection. Elder Ebenezer Bishop,
                            Brother Kufus Bishop, Eldress Ruth Langdon and Sister Asenath Clark, composed the order of
                            ministry at that time. After our meeting had closed, they commenced their homeward march,
                            with a joyful song of praise, and we listened to their sweet music as it died away in the
                            distance. To me it was like the music of angels, I then lived at Poland Hill. Such precious
                            seasons, are made doubly precious to me, by the recollection of gospel testimonies, which
                            were as a two edged sword against all sin. They gave me new aspirations, higher and holier
                            feelings, and I feel joyful as I look back on those golden moments. I have only a few more
                            words to say, soon my sun of life, will have set to rise no more in this beautiful world,
                            and another sphere will be mine to inhabit, there it will rise to set no more. I have been
                            thinking of late, how necessary it is for us to be prudent and saving of all our temporal as
                            well as spiritual blessings. Did not Mother say, when she was upon earth, "Be prudent and
                            saving in all things, my children, for, without the blessing of God, ye cannot make one
                            kernel of corn grow, or even a blade of grass?" and, thinking of this I am carried back to
                            the time, when Jesus went over the sea of Galilee and from thence up into a mountain, where
                            he sat with his disciples. A great multitude followed because of the miracles which he had
                            wrought. Jes- us lifted up his eyes and saw this great company and he said unto Philip,
                            Whence shall we buy bread? One of his disciples said unto him, there is a lad here who hath
                            five barley loaves and two small fishes, but, what are they among so many? When Jesus said,
                            make the men sit down, so they sat down in number about five thousand. Then he took the
                            loaves and, when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples and the disciples gave
                            to the multitude, he gave also of the fishes. When they were filled, he said to his
                            disciples, gather up the fragments that nothing may be lost, so they gathered them together,
                            and. behold there were twelve baskets full. I wonder if any of you, my good children, take
                            such a deep sense of this little Bible story, as your aged friend and mother. Write and let
                            me know, will you not? O these beautiful words ! Gather up the fragments that nothing be
                            lost, they are too good to be forgotten ; too precious to be over looked. They are as
                            priceless jewels. What I wish to impress upon your young minds, is, not only the miracle
                            wrought, but the great care and concern which was manifest even in those days, so many
                            hundred years ago to "save all that nothing may be lost." Now as you have all gathered
                            around me to listen to my story, I will give you my hand in blessing, and when you think of
                            me after you have returned to your homes sing this little song, for me which will always
                            bring my spirit very near. "O my mother, my blessed mother, Her name to me is dear; I'll
                            praise her name I'll spread her fame And Kings and Priests shall hear. There are many
                            thousands praise her name And shall be many more;— Yea millions, millions tens of millions
                            Shall her name adore." This is the sweetest song I ever heard. I rejoice that there is a
                            motherhood as well as a fatherhood in God.

                            was only by the kindest persuasions of my Sainted mother that I consented to eat as others
                            ate. She didn't want me to be so odd. At Watervliet, April 6, 1820, I found the Shakers.
                            They had an enfilading fire against "The Flesh," their own flesh. The flesh of swine,
                            cattle, sheep, fowls and fishes was not contraband of their war on "the flesli," nor was
                            Cider Beer, Rum or Tobacco. On the Holy Sabbath, we were served with lordly dishes of extra,
                            luscious, flesh meat. When, in 1837, the Heavens began to draw near to liberate Zion, it was

                            beginning of miracles. In ecstasies of delight, I wrote, impromptu, the following jingle. Of
                            all the days in seven, I like the Sabbath best! For this, through gracious Heaven, is made a
                            day of rest, A rest for men and oxen, for horses, cows and sheep, For turkeys, hens and
                            chickens, and all the beasts we keep !! Now, 1882, Purity loving souls may abstain, as
                            aforesaid, Seven days in seven. Does the world move? Heavens without end are before us ! Mt.

                            and for her general moral and industrial training; also her special care-takers, although we
                            have not the pleasure of knowing which of her many kind friends they were, we tender to them
                            our sincere and hearty thanks. To our highly esteemed friend Elder F. Evans we have already
                            expressed our thanks for his great kindness in bringing her across the At- lantic, at her
                            own special desire, (and she was but nine years of age at the time) from our dear old
                            England when he came with our friend Dr. James Peebles also two other friends whom we much
                            regret did not have the wisdom, and therefore not the happiness to join your community and
                            receive the Kingdom of Heaven as a little child. It is now twelve years since all these dear
                            ones landed in this country, since then I have been twice to see our dear child, at her
                            beautiful home at Mount Lebanon, the last time I remained three weeks, and was most kindly
                            entertained, of course on my part I made myself active and useful in the very pleasant
                            outdoor occupations of the garden and the field, and had not other duties prevented for the
                            time, how glad I should have been to have stayed there to help my dear sisters and brothers
                            to prove to the world that nearly all the vice and crime, and consequent misery of society
                            are preventable. I should thus have had the privilege of working in the ranks of those
                            self-sacrificing men and women, the pioneers of human progress of the past and the present,
                            who are persistently and nobly, aye divinely striving to build up the Kingdom of Heaven in
                            this beautiful, this might be happy world. I had several interviews with my daughter at
                            Mount Lebanon, when she assured me that she was very happy, and would not like to leave on
                            any account. Her mother and myself feel thankful to Grod that He in his inscrutable
                            providence guided her -when but a child to such a beautiful and happy home, beautiful and
                            happy in the highest sense, where she has been, and still is surrounded by wise, by
                            righteous conditions, instead of living out her life-time in the present vile and therefore

                            Gave promise of the day; The quiet village slept, nor dreamed How near the angels were, Nor
                            saw the radiant light that streamed From heavenly gates ajar. On one alone the vision
                            broke,— One soul the summons heard; To her it came as glad and sweet As song of morning
                            bird; It called our sister from her pain, And nights of weariness ; To an eternal day, with
                            God In realms of blessedness. <pb n="14" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> 14 THE MANIFESTO. The hands which
                            patiently had wrought Were folded on her breast, And on her face a peaceful calm Told of the
                            heavenly rest. With us, the shock, the grief, the'pain, The sense of weary loss ; With her,
                            the light, the bliss, the gain The freedom from the cross. No more is borne its heavy
                            weight. It falls at Jesus' feet, While on her brow He lays the crown With benediction sweet.
                            The crown, her daily life hath set With jewels bright and rare, With words of love anil
                            gentleness, And deeds of virtue fair. Its glistening pearls of purity Her stainless life
                            attest, And radiant gems of azure tell She followed Truth's behest. The spirit's robe of
                            silvery white Enfolds the child of heaven, And for the feebleness of age Eternal youth is
                            given. We lay the body down to sleep With thoughtful tender care ; But upward turn our gaze
                            to thee Where blessed spirits are. Oh sister, let thy presence rest Around us as we kneel;
                            The blessing of a heavenly guest Teach every heart to feel. Come to us in our daily toil,
                            And linger by our side, And with thy clearer vision be Our comforter and guide. Be with us
                            when the day is done, When silent every care, And on the Mother heart of God, We lay our own
                            in prayer. Forgive us every thoughtless word, Each act that gave thee pain ; Now, knowing
                            all, thou knowest well, We loved thee still the same. We will not say farewell, We know 'tis
                            well with thee; And they whom holy ties unite, Can never parted be.

                            visionary state. I was soon walking with a company of spirits. We passed on till we reach-
                            ed a body of land that was mostly covered with large trees. A road had already been cut
                            through, and some brethren were still at work felling trees. Meeting with Father Jam es
                            Whittaker, he informed us that the brethren were making preparations to build a house, as a
                            society of believers would be located in that place. I now became anxious to know where I
                            was, but could not determine satisfactorily. We enter a beautiful place and I observe a
                            large cistern of water. The reservoir seemed to be lined with burnished gold. Over this was
                            a circle of light. Upon a platform was a pair of scales, and my guides asked, if I would
                            like to be weighed. 1 said nay—At this moment Father James stepped forward and said, uYou
                            must be weighed. These scales are to determine how much you have gained by your privilege,"
                            1 feared the test as I knew I should be as a feather when placed by the side of all that had
                            been given to me. 1 stepped upon one of the scales, while in the other was placed all the
                            spiritual treasures that had been given to me and all the counsel and admonitions that I had
                            received from my gospel parents, and from the brethren and sisters. I thought of my
                            sacrifices and my con secrations, and then accepted some presents from the sisters who were
                            with me. It proved just as 1 expected, I was "found wanting." The presents which 1 had
                            accepted from the sisters, all vanished at the time when I was weighed, and I was informed
                            that nothing was my own only what had been gained by my personal exertions. The sisters
                            comforted me and said I had not yet left the earth, and would <pb n="15" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 15 have time to gain more gospel treasures which would be my own. These are the
                            scales of justice said, Father James, although they appear to you as they do in the natural
                            world. They are shown to you in this form, to meet your understanding. All things in the
                            spirit world will appear the same as these till you meet your last and final change. What
                            does Father mean by the last change ? When you are born of the spirit unto God, and your
                            soul is redeemed from the earth and earthly things, then the treasure of good which you have
                            gained will counter-balance all that you have received from us or from earthly friends.
                            Every soul must pay the debt of gratitude they owe to God, by doing as much good for others
                            as they have received. I thought that when souls left the body, if they had been faithful,
                            they left all natural and earthly things behind them and had no pleasure in anything but
                            that which is spiritual. There is a great difference in souls. All that one has in time more
                            than is really necessary for their present needs, serves to draw them to the earth. Whatever
                            has enlisted their interest in time will enlist their interest here,—they will follow the
                            same occupation, and obtain that which they desire. Is it not right to lay up something
                            against time of need, that we may be able to help others who may be in dis- tress ? Those
                            who keep and improve this prudent spirit will lay up a great treasure in heaven. Such may be
                            weighed and not found wanting. When a soul has traveled out from their loss to God, they
                            will feel that love, that all self-promotion or the indulgence of a selfish nature will be
                            very repellant to them. Their whole interest will be for the honor and glory of God. I have
                            already told you that you must be weighed in the balance of justice, and must be innocent
                            and upright, at peace with all men, having no love but the love of the Holy Spirit. They
                            areno w free from the earth and stand before God and his witnesses as clear as crystal. Tl;e
                            book of their lives is now opened and read to them. Conducted by the angels they enter a
                            pool of clear water, and as they return receive a white robe and a new name, also a crown of
                            stars, a sword, a stafif and a shield. I now observe in the distance a boundless sea which
                            has the appearance of glass. Every soul must cross this sea before they can travel to
                            perfect glory, and yet no one can pass over until they are re- deemed from the lusts of the
                            flesh and of the mind. It is as you observe, a sea of glass and no unclean soul can walk
                            upon it. It is a beautiful place, and here the wicked cease from troubling. Is there any end
                            to the travel of the soul? Nay; they are ever increasing in beauty—which is Love, Wisdom,
                            Light and Truth. They can no more stand still, than can the planets in the heavens. If our
                            gospel parents have traveled so far beyond us, how can they come so often to help us? Our
                            love for our children and our hope for your prosperity and increase in purity of the gospel,
                            leads us to sacrifice our happiness for your good. At times, we send ambassadors in our
                            name, who are inspired with our word and spirit. Souls in the spirit world are equally
                            inspired by powers above them, the same as you are by those next in order before you. Mt.

                            in God's eternal love. The old idea of prayer was, that God could be dissuaded from doing
                            evil unto his creatures, if they curried his favor. The new idea of prayer is that God helps
                            those who help .themselves, and that we must co-operate with the Divine Spirit, otherwise we
                            may not receive the Divine blessing. Prayer should embody the will to act as occasions
                            otfer; our prayer must be in our lives. If a brother, sister or neighbor needs a helping
                            hand, extend it, do what lies in our power; in that way a tide of sympathy goes forth that
                            is felt by the individual to be lasting. It is not what we give, but how we give it; not the
                            words we use, but the spirit of our words. Is there not a beautiful thought con- nected with
                            prayer for the dead ? Were it not sad to feel that when our loved ones pass away, they are
                            wholly separated from us ? Through prayer we may still hold communion with them ; by the
                            spirit of prayer we may gather the inspiration and clothe ourselves with the mantle they
                            were clothed with. In blessing them we receive their blessing. Let us pay a tribute to our
                            ascended Christian friends, by identifying our lives more and more with the heavenly
                            principles that they held dealer than life. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                    passing year teaches a warning lesson. How many good resolutions are formed, and how
                                    few are kept. New Year's day often rules the year. Begin right. As you turn over a
                                    new leaf in the volume of the yeafs, turn over a new leaf in holy living. One sinful
                                    deed will stain your consciences. It will be a bad start. It may wreck your immortal
                                    souls! Don't yield to sin. "A sin stained conscience is an unpleasant companion."
                                    Beware of the first stain. Constant, self-denying struggles will adorn your souls
                                    with purity. "Shun the appearance of evil," is good advice to follow. ''Each day is
                                    a little life in itself." Grow into a beautiful life. Be virtuous to-day, and
                                    to-morrow, be virtuous then, and'by the. year's end, you will have accomplished what
                                    would surprise you to contemplate, if the work was set before you at the beginning
                                    of the year. Each day pertorm good vows. Gain all the soul wealth you can. Day by
                                    day, every day well spent will insure you a Happy New Year.

A New Year of prosperity and peace to

                                affectionate regard for the past,—the old year which has dealt' so kindly with us.
                                Unnumbered blessings have been granted to us, while the gentle hand of a loving
                                Providence has sustained us through all our cares and burdens'. We have much, very much
                                for which we may well render thanks, and in this renew our zeal and watchfulness as
                                faithful believers in the redeeming work of God. Were we partial to remember those on-
                                ly who have become interested in the publication of '"The Manifesto" we should even in

                                wrong to right, and are learning that righteousness increases with our faithfulness in
                                the duties of this life. It is most fortunate for us as a nation that t'le custom of
                                wishing1 each other a Happy New Year has become so universal. It has in it a potency for
                                good that establishes its own reward; and it is equally fortunate that this vivifying

                                have equal claims to all the privileges and benefits, as well as to all the ameliorating

                                for all who have shared with us in our simple offerings during the past year, or who
                                have in the least contributed to the prosperity of our little publication, "The

                                that we may be able to accomplish more good, by sending into the world a publication
                                which shall be welcomed by those who love the Lord, and that it may be, at^the same

                                H. Leland, author of several books, and recognized authority upon such topics :</byline><p TEIform="p">1. Keep the body clean. The countless pores of the skin are so many drain-tiles for the
                                use of the system. If they become clogged and so deadened in their action, we must
                                expect to become the prey of ill-health in some of its countless forms. Let us not be
                                afraid of a wet sponge and five minutes' brisk exercise with a crash towel every night
                                or morning. 2. Devote eight hours out of the twentyfour to sleep. If a mother is robbed
                                of sleep by a wakeful baby, she must take a nap sometime during the day. Even ten
                                minutes of repose strengthens and refreshes, and does good ."like a medicine." Children
                                | should be allowed to sleep till they awake of their own free will. 3. Never go out to
                                work in early morning in any locality subject to damps, fogs and miasms, with an empty
                                stomach. If there is not time to wait for a cup of coffee, pour two-thirds of a cup of
                                boiling water on two teaspoonfuls of cream, or a beaten egg, season it with salt and
                                pepper, and drink it while hot before going out. This will stimulate and comfort the
                                stomach, and aid the system in resisting a poisonous or debilitating atmosphere. 4.
                                Avoid over-eating. To rise from the table able to eat a little more is a proverbially
                                good rule for every one. There is nothing more idiotic than forcing down a few
                                mouthfuls, because they happen to remain on one's plate after hunger is satisfied, and
                                because they may be "wasted" if left. It is the most serious waste to overtax the
                                stomach with even half an ounce more than it can take care of. 5. Avoid food and drinks

                                indigestible suppers. Suppers should always consist of light, easily digested
                                foods—being, in the country, so soon followed by sleep, and the stomach being as much
                                entitled as the head to profound rest. The moral pluck and firmness to take sucli food
                                and no other for this last meal of the day can be easily acquired, and the reward of
                                such virtue is sound sleep, a clear head, a strong hand, and a capital appetite for
                                breakfast. 6. Never wear at night the under-garments that are worn through the day. 7.

                                closely in-doors, and have no work or recreation that takes them out into the open

                                and live for, besides the daily round of labor or the counting of profit and loss If we
                                have not any talent for writing splendid works on political economy or social science,
                                or the genius for creating a good story or a fine poem, the next best thing—and, in
                                fact, almost as good a thing—is to possess an appreciation of these things ! So have
                                good books and good newspapers, and read them—if only in snatches—and talk about them at
                                dinner time or by the evening fire. Cultivate choice flowers and fruits, and help some
                                poor neighbor to seeds and cuttings ; or take an interest in bees, or fine poultry, or
                                trout culture. And study always farm and household science, and take advantage of the
                                new and helpful things that are every little while corning to light. 9. Live in Peace !
                                Fretting, worrying, fault-finding, borrowing trouble, giving away to temper, and holding
                                long, bitter grudges— all these things affect the liver, poison the blood, enlarge the
                                spleen,, carve ugly lines *&gt;n the face, and shorten life ! Try to be half as wise
                                as that little creature, the bee, who takes all the honey she can find, and leaves the
                                poisons to themselves.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Agriculture" TEIform="index"/>House &amp; Farm</head><div3 type="house" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Uses of ammonia" TEIform="index"/>THE USES OF AMMONIA</head><p TEIform="p">S'. O. J., in the Country Gentleman, says : <cit TEIform="cit"><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Country gentleman" TEIform="index"/></bibl><quote TEIform="quote">"Spirits of ammonia is nearly as useful in housekeeping as soap, and its
                                        cheapness brings it Avithin the reach of all. For many household purposes it is
                                        invaluable ; yet its manifold uses are not as generally known as they should be
                                        It is a most refreshing agent at the toilet table ; a few drops in a basin of
                                        water, will make a better bath than pure water, and if the skin is oily, it will
                                        remove all glossiness, and also disagreeable odors. Added to a foot bath, it
                                        entirely absorbs all the noxious smell so often arising from the feet in warm
                                        weather, and nothing is better for cleansing the hair from dandruffa nd dust.
                                        For the headache it is also a desirable stimulant, and frequent inhaling of its
                                        pungent odors will often entirely remove a catarrh cold. For cleansing paint it
                                        is very useful. Put a tablespoonful of ammonia to a quart of warm soapsuds, dip
                                        in a flannel cloth and wipe off the dirt and fiyspecks, grime and smoke, and see
                                        for your selves how much labor it will save you. No scrubbing will be needed. It
                                        will clean and brighten silver wonderfully; to a pint of hot suds mix a
                                        teaspoonful of the spirits, dip in your silver spoons, forks, etc., rub with a
                                        brush, and then polish with a chamois skin. For washing mirrors and windows it
                                        is also very desirable. Put a few drops of ammonia upon a piece of newspaper,
                                        and you will readily take off every spot or finger mark on the glass. It will
                                        take out grease spots from any fabric : put on the ammonia nearly clear, lay
                                        blotting paper over the place, and press a hot flat-iron on it for a few
                                        moments. A few drops in water will clean laces, and whiten them finely; also
                                        muslins. For cleaning hair and nail brushes it is equally good. Put a
                                        teaspoonfull of ammonia into a pint of warm or cold water, and shake the brushes
                                        through the water; when the bristles look white, rinse them in cold water, and
                                        put into the sunshine, or in a warm place to dry. The dirtiest brushes will come
                                        out from this bath white and clean. There is no better remedy for heartburn and
                                        dyspepsia, and the aromatic spirits of ammonia is especially prepared for these
                                        troubles. Ten drops of it in a wineglass of water are o'ten a great relief. The
                                        spirits of ammonia can be taken in the same way, but it is not nearly so
                                        palatable a dose. Farmers and chemists arc well aware of the beneficial effects
                                        of ammonia on all kinds of vegetation; and if you desire your roses, geraniums,
                                        fuchsias, etc;., to become more flourishing, you can try it upon them, by adding
                                        five or six drops of it to every pint of warm water that you give them, but
                                        don't repeat the dose oftener than once in every live or six days, lest you
                                        stimulate them too highly. Rain water is impregnated with ammonia, and thus it
                                        refreshes and vivifies all vegetable life. So be sure and keep a large bottle of
                                        it in the house, and have a glass stopper for it, as it is very evanescent, and
                                        also injurious to corks, eating them away."</quote></cit></p></div3><pb n="21" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/><div3 type="crops" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Lemon trees" TEIform="index"/>LEMON TREES</head><p TEIform="p">It is surprising that more persons do not grow these in pots and tubs as room-orna-

He sent, for St.
                                Thomas, a builder rare, And bade him to rear them a wonder fair. The king's great
                                treasure was placed at hand, And with it the sovereign's one command : "Build well, 0
                                builder, so good and great! And add to the glory of my estate. "Build well, nor spare of
                                my wealth to show A prouder palace than mortals know." The king took leave of his
                                kingdom.then, And wandered far from the haunts of men. St. Thomas the king's great
                                treasure spent In worthier way than his master meant. He clad the naked, the hungry fed,
                                The oil of gladness around him shed. He blessed them all with the ample store, As never
                                a king's wealth blessed before. The king came back from his journey long. But found no
                                grace in the happy throng That greeted him now on his slow return, To teach him the
                                lesson he ought to learn. The king came back to his well spent gold; But no new palace
                                could he behold. In terrible anger he swore, and said That the builder's folly should
                                cost his head. St. Thomas in dungeon dark was cast, Till the time for his punishment
                                dire were passed. Then it chanced, or the good God willed it so, That the king's own
                                brother in death lay low. When four days dead, as the legend reads, He rose to
                                humanity's life and needs. From sleep of the dust he strangely woke, And thus to his
                                brother, the king, he spoke : "I have been to Paradise, O my king! And have heard the
                                heavenly angels sing. "And there I saw, by the gates of gold, A palace finer than tongue
                                has told; ''Its walls and towers were lifted high In beautiful grace to the bending sky;
                                "Its glories, there in that radiant place, Shone forth like a smile from the dear Lord's
                                face. "An angel said it was builded there By the good St. Thomas, with love and
