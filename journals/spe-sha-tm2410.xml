                            12.</head><p TEIform="p">FEB. 13. Early this morning, thirty-six Confederate Cavalry call at the East family and ask
                            for some milk. We supply the company and they pass on to the railroad station. We soon learn
                            that these men are pressing into their service all the horses and negroes that they can
                            find. They even capture the free negroes. Two of the Brethren go to Franklin in search of
                            the two stolen horses. Some of the friendly citizens advised them to return to their home or
                            they might lose the horses they were on. At four o'clock p. m. seven heavily armed robbers
                            dash into our Village. They have stolen a valuable horse at the East family, and going
                            directly to the field, capture another. They then enquire for the head man of the place, and
                            Br. Urban Johns goes out to them. RobbersWe wish to get some of your fine riding horses. Br.
                            TJ.We have none, you took most of our best horses some time since. Robbers.Oh, they were
                            nothing but wagon horses. We want Cavalry horses. Br. TJ.We have none. Robbers.Where is your
                            fine sorrel horse? We have the bay and now want the sorrel. Br. TJ.I do not know where it
                            is. We have a written order that you are to take no more of our stock. Robbers.Who gave you
                            that order? Br. TJ.General Hardee. Robbers.We do not belong to his brigade. We are
                            Lincolnites. Where is your store? OCTOBER. 1894. <pb n="222" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 222 THE MANIFESTO.
                            Br. U.We have none. Robbers.Where is your Center House? Br. U.On the other side of the
                            street. Robbers.Well, where is the house in which you transact business? Br. U.At the
                            Trustees' Office. Robbers.Well, go with us to the Office and we will give you a receipt for
                            the horses, and then we want to buy some cloth. Br. U.We have none for sale. Robbers.We know
                            you have, and we will have it. At this they went into the Office and John McLean warned them
                            that they were in the Post Office and the company left the house in great haste and Br. John
                            locked the door. Robbers.Oh, you need not lock that door ; locks do not stand in our way.
                            Evidently they were afraid to use much force at the Post Office, however. A company of
                            Sisters were called to assist the Brethren, and stood upon the steps of the Trustees'
                            Office. Leaving the Post Office the soldiers turned to the next building, but found the
                            steps blockaded by the Sisters. One of the company then cried out, "Here, boys, this is the
                            Office, come this way." They said they intended to enter that house and see every room in
                            it. During this time 1 went to the Meeting House to close some windows and while there
                            prayed that we might be led to do the best thing in this time of our affliction. "Give them
                            something to eat" came forcibly to my mind and I soon learned that a corresponding
                            impression had entered the minds of other Sisters. Robbers.Do you not have some cloth to
                            sell ? Sisters.We have none. Robbers.But, we know you have it, we have been told so by your
                            neighbors who are well acquainted with you. Sisters.Do not those of us who live in the house
                            know best? If we had the cloth to sell, we would not tell you that we did not have it.
                            Eldress Betsey Smith then addressed them, "You are, certainly, too gentlemanly to rob poor,
                            helpless women and children of their hard earnings, that which they have earned with their
                            own hands." Robbers.We know your resources. We know you have plenty of money and get what
                            you want with it. Sisters.We are a poor, little dependent company, and work hard for our
                            living. Robbers.You bought that shawl. Pointing to one worn by Eldress Nancy. Sisters.We
                            did. Robbers.You wear silk kerchiefs; Do you buy them? Sisters.We make all our silk
                            kerchiefs. We spin and weave the silk, ourselves. Robbers.Did you make the kerchief you have
                            on? <pb n="223" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 223 Sisters.We buy no silk kerchiefs. Robbers.Well,
                            it is very nice, anyhow. At this point we thought to change the conversation, and invited
                            this rough, ungentlemanly company to accept of a dinner. To this they gruffly replied, "No,
                            we have had our dinner." After more talking we induced them to move from the steps of the
                            building, and becoming a little more passive, they conversed more pleasantly. Again they
                            refused, but more mildly, our offer of food and then remarked, Bobbers.You do not know your
                            riches. Sisters.We are not rich. We are not laying up treasures on earth. We work for our
                            living, with our own hands. We have no slaves nor servants to work for us. Robbers.That is
                            the reason we do not like you. You will not tolerate slavery. You are a set of
                            abolitionists. Sisters.We are not abolitionists, yet we have nothing to do with slavery. We
                            mind our own business. We do not interfere with any man's servants. Robbers.Your leaders
                            have deposited all your money with some big men in New York. You are held in ignorance. One
                            of our Brethren remarked,"You are mistaken. All we own is [placed in the care of Trustees of
                            this Society, and no one in New York has any control over it." The Brethren now brought
                            several loaves of warm bread, a bucketful of milk, several pies, and some new peach sauce,
                            from the family Dwelling. We filled the bowls with milk, and then passed it around, even at
                            this time some of them modestly refused. Several mounted their horses and seemed anxious to
                            leave the place, but after a little more persuasion we brought them all over, except one
                            poor fellow, who rode off to the pastures in search of another horse. After this simple
                            repast they became more gentlemanly. The Sisters conversed pleasantly with the men and tried
                            to change their minds from their wicked designs. When they entered the place they told us
                            that Bowling Green was burned, and that Shaker Village would be burned; but after they had
                            become better men, through kindness and a bowl of bread and milk, we again asked them if the
                            town of Bowling Green was really destroyed. Robbers.It was fired in four or five places, and
                            one bridge was blown up. Sisters.We are sorry to hear of the loss of property, and sorry
                            that our country is in such a condition. We have a high regard for the Mississippians, and
                            our Brethren have traded a great deal with them and entertain deep feelings of friendship
                            and respect for them. Robbers.Kentucky is disloyal to the south. Anyhow Mississippi has more
                            men now in Bowling Green, than Kentucky has in Confederate service. Nine-tenths of the
                            Kentuckians are Lincolnites, and what will you do when the Lincolnites come here? <pb n="224" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 224 THE MANIFESTO. Sisters.We do not know what we shall do. We shall
                            endeavor to do right. Robber.You are all abolitionists and your property is held by men in
                            New York, so we have been informed. Sisters.Then you are mistaken. Robbers.You don't know,
                            you are held in ignorance by your leaders, who do not work. Br. Urban Johns, one of the
                            Ti'ustees of the Society, was standing near to us, with his working suit on, when a Brother
                            asked,"don't he look as if he worked? And he is one of the head men as you call them."
                            Robbers.We know that you have cloth and plenty of money. Sisters.We have done a great deal
                            fur the southern soldiers, and have been on friendly terms with them, and it can not be that
                            you will rob us. Robbers.We need more horses and we need cloth, and money. Yo&gt;u have plenty
                            of money and plenty of horses. We can not plough the lai'.id without horses. i By this time
                            one of the company acted as though he was ashamed of the proceedings, and said,"Let's go." :
                            Another said, "I wonder what we came here for?" One hundred thousand Lincolnites are coming
                            on to Bowling Green and will kill all the southerners they find in the place. .' The Sisters
                            said they sympathized with the South, and were sorry for tht? country. Robbers.We know how
                            you sympathize. If the Lincolnites should come you would sympathize with them just the same.
                            Sisters.Certainly, we would, we should treat them kindly, and do for them as we have done
                            for you. We do not take sides with either party. The robbers remarked that the Federals were
                            coming and would be in Bowling Green to-morrow. As the Captain closed his meal he remarked,
                            "I declare you are mighty friendly, anyhow," and mounting his horse, he said, "You must have
                            that cloth ready for us when we return to-night, and then we will give you a receipt for
                            your horses." They dashed off in a hurry and meeting a Brother near the station demanded his
                            horse. Finding the horse blind in one eye they would not take him. The Brother rode along a
                            short distance when another company demanded his horse. The Brother again said he was blind
                            in one eye. But they replied,"Never mind, we want the horse, he will be worth something."
                            They made Br. Robert Sammons, who was sixty years old, alight from his horse, take off the
                            saddle, and putting it on the old man's back, told him to go home. They met another Brother
                            near the station and demanded his horse. "My horse is lame and tender-footed and can not
                            travel with much speed," <pb n="225" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 225 and he soon convinced them
                            of the fact. They then cursed the Shakers for having such old, blind and lame horses. This
                            Brother returned with his horse, and they also let him have one of the horses that were
                            stolen a few nights since.

                            boundary to a law, and then Condemn the hungry when they fight for bread ? Earth's cry of
                            suffering rises like the cloud That hung so darkly over Sinai, While Israel stood below, a
                            faithless crowd, And Moses caught the tablets from the sky. Borne on the lightning and the
                            thunder peals We hear the echo of man's strife with man, While patient Justice to our souls

                            cast At the fierce forge of its necessity And then is branded, and condemned at last To
                            prison cells. Who says that man is free? Who talks of virtue ? When the man is starved Can
                            conscience hesitate and question law ? Nay, it must sin and see its tombstone carved, Nor

                            coals of shame upon its head? And where is virtue when the children dear Must learn with
                            care the youthful ruffian's art? And with the strife for money boldly sear The early

                            richest purple, shading into cerulean blue and amethystine violet, bordered with deep orange
                            tints that melted to the pale gold of the light of the harvest moon, whose innocent
                            baby-eyes looked with wondrous penetration into your soul, composed the central figure of a
                            cross. It was surrounded by the chaste leaves of the ice plant, creating by contrast of
                            color the effect of water; it seemed to float. Oh, what thoughts were started upon beholding
                            the sacred symbol set m the fairest works God has made! The imagination flowed back to old
                            Judta and in spirit saw the scenes of which the Son of Mary was the life anl chief actor.
                            Solemnly came down the ages the memorable words : "If anv man will come after me, let him
                            deny himself, and take up his cross, and\ follow me." Twenty-four years ago there were
                            stirring events taking place in France. The emperor had declared war against Germany, but in
                            quick succession his armies were defeated, himself made prisoner, his throne declared
                            forfeited, and the republic proclaimed. But in the confusion incident to the sudden and
                            violent changes, a number of malcontents, refusing obedience to the new government, obtained
                            control of the city of Paris; and when their case had become hopeless, they resorted to
                            every kind of outrage, murder and pillage, burning the finest parts of the city. They
                            imprisoned the archbishop, George Darboy, a man of stainless character, against whom no
                            charge of misdemeanor was ever made, and shot him. In his cell were found the words he had
                            traced upon the wall; "O Crux Spes Unica"0 cross, my only hope. He fell with uplifted hands
                            blessing his murderers. He died as a Christian should, without hate or rancor, sustained by
                            a saving faith. But how about those whose lives are cast in seclusion ; who are oppressed by
                            circumstance and environment; who feel the disappointment of hope and the betrayal of
                            confiding trust so keenly, that the martyr's doom, be it cross or bullet, seems preferable
                            to the long, lingering agony of daily and hourly <pb n="227" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 227
                            torture. To be wouudi-d iii the house of our friends ; to be misunderstood and
                            misinterpreted; to see love grow cold and faith become weak; to see sr.cred principles set
                            aside for mercenary considerations; when the midnight prayer seems unanswered and the tears
                            flow inward, scorching the soul, and the sinister question obtrudes itself ; Have I made a
                            mistake ? are faith and duty hope and self-denial, but a delusion? why not return blow for
                            blow, and meet craft with craft? then, on fellow-pilgrim, regard thy cross. See, it is not
                            the bitter wood of Calvary, but one of flow^ers, woven by consecrated hands and pure, loving
                            hearts, whispering a gentle call to duty, and noble action. "Let him take up his cross," are
                            the Master's words. Resist not evil when nothing can be gained by resistance, but retain in
                            your hearts, and have appear in your lives, the testimony of truth, and when the hour comes,
                            give it utterance. Character will tell at last; no good is ever permanently lost; that God
                            who remembers the lilies and the sparrows, will certainly not forget us. Beloved travelers
                            up the hill of Mt. Zion, you who have borne the heat and burden of the day for many years,
                            but who now feel as crying with the Psalmist; O Lord, how long! and dear young friends, who
                            have entered the gospel path, but who dread the uncertain future, and who look with anxious
                            eyes from on high to confirm their faith, let us read together Hebrews xii., in the spirit
                            in which it was written, believing, doubting not. There we find that a great cloud of
                            witnesses takes cognizance of all our actions, both good and evil; that Jesus, the author
                            and finisher of our faith, not only bore his cross but also the contradiction of sinners ;
                            that without being at peace with all men and walking in holiness of life, none shall see the
                            Lord. "Wherefore, we receiving a kingdom which can not be moved, let us have grace, whereby

                            there is no government, there is no God." This proposition can be easily proved, and if God
                            is synonymous with good and goodness, the said condition implies a total absence of all
                            desirable qualities. It is self-evident that where there is no government there can be no
                            law, for law is the effect of a governing cause, and the governing cause of law, must be
                            intelligent. Where there is no law, there certainly can not be order; and where order is
                            not, there can not be harmony and co-operation. Then, if God is a God <pb n="228" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>
                            228 THE MANIFESTO. of order, and "order is heaven's first law," the nearer we come to God,
                            the more order He does require, as declared by one of our seers. All the works of the divine
                            Creator, evidence order, design, adaptation of parts, and a harmony and regularity of
                            action, which prove a Governor at the helm, from whom all order and regulation proceeds.
                            This is proved not only by the movements and regularity of worlds, whose periods of
                            revolution are exact to seconds of time, which h;ive to be included* in calculations in
                            order to correctly predict and locate celestial phenomena,such as conjunctions, occupations
                            and eclipses,but by the fine and delicately organized machinery of all animal and vegetable
                            life. Also by the laws of all chemical combinations, which are fixed beyond the power of
                            man's wisdom to change or modify. The governing and directing principle of all automatic,
                            intelligent, selfmoving life, is placed in the head of the body. We believe it safe to say
                            there can be no living body manifesting rational intelligence, without a head or center of
                            power to organize, unitize and direct to a common purpose, all the elements and factors
                            required to produce said manifestation. It was a saying of Mother Ann Lee, that a body
                            without a head is a monster. In accord with this view, a riotous mob has been aptly styled
                            "A monster without brains." Mother Ann also used the simile, l'How active the hands will be
                            to save the head from a threatened blow," to illustrate the duty of members to the head of
                            the body social. Careful observation and seer-ship have discovered that man is not an
                            originator of life, nor is the living, progressive, ideal man and woman like a pool or
                            cistern, but rather like a flame, expending or transmuting ami transmitting life, which is
                            supplied by constant influx through the brain. This has its analogue in the physical body,
                            which has to be continually fed, to supply the expenditure all the time going on while body
                            or mind are acting. Dr. Buchanan, the most advanced and scientific of Anthropologists, has
                            demonstrated by experiment and observation, that all parts of the body are duplicated by
                            representation in the head; hence, the ready response of the latter to all requirements of
                            the former, and vice versa. This we regard as a true type of what the body social is, when
                            perfected. The head of the body social, if it be a true head, responds to the interests of
                            all the members of the body, and the support rendered by members to the head, is not to
                            exalt a personality nor persons, but to promote the health of the body and the welfare of
                            all its members. The apostle Paul, in 1 Cor. xii, and elsewhere, compares the body of
                            Christ, i. e. the visible congregation of believers in Christ, to the human body, and
                            declares that we are all members one of another. This union is so close, that if one member
                            suffers, the whole body suffers with it. If all members were the head, where would be the
                            feet, or the hands. If all were the eye, where would be the hearing. The head, though
                            ruling, is minister or servant of the whole body. <pb n="229" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 229
                            Jesus, who is h-ad oi all his true disciples, declares, "The Son of man came not to be
                            ministered unto, but to minister." The greek word, here translated minister means to serve,
                            as if he had said I came not to be served, but to serve. In agreement with this he
                            says,Those esteemed to rule the nations, lord it over them, and their great ones exercise
                            authority over them but it shall not be so among you. Whoever may wish to become great among
                            you, shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to become first, shall be slave of all. (Mark
                            10: 42.) This is the true principle of communal order and relationship. He or she who
                            accomplishes the greatest and most useful service to the body, will in the end be the
                            richest and most honored of all. The love, esteem, and appreciation of all the members will
                            flow to the faithful and wise contributor of good deeds, spontaneously in return for
                            benefits received, even as the blood of the body flows back to the heart which sends it
                            forth. The head is the center of unity and all-concerted action in members of bodies social,
                            industrial, ecclesiastic, literary, scientific, debating or political. Its utility and
                            necessity is proved by the fact that a number of people can not combine effectively to do a
                            job of work requiring skill, or to gain knowledge by study, or by profitable discussion, or
                            to accomplish any difficult or desirable enterprise, without having* a head to oversee and
                            direct. It is found in the, elder, teacher, boss, architect, captain, king, general,
                            commander, bishop, priest, pope, parson, patriarch, chairman, moderator, chief, president,
                            emperor, sachem and sheik. Its necessity is proved by every attempt of members of an
                            organized body, to set up independence of its head; also by the impracticability of
                            accomplishing any useful purpose requiring co-operation, without a leading mind to direct.
                            Though a head may sometimes blunder, or fail to fill its office, it does not impair the
                            office, nor do away with its necessity. People recognize the principle here contended for,
                            in all national and tribal wars, and in all enterprises for pleasure or material gain. But
                            when it comes to following Christ and crucifying the selfish will,, some people who seem to
                            desire all the benefits, without sacrificing ambition, find great obstruction and much
                            fault, with the constituted head of the body, unless themselves are the head. Of course the
                            vaporings of the carnal mind can not undo the law. It is sometimes claimed that all just
                            governments derive their authority from the consent of the governed. But this is true only
                            of democratic governments. The government of a jail, of a lunatic asylum, of a school, of a
                            family of children, derives no authority from the consent of the governed, but from the
                            reason and judgment of the people who create those institutions. Neither does the government
                            of Christ derive authority from the consent of the governed, but from its divine Author. For
                            Jesus says to his chief apostles;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordain-

                            from me ye can do nothing. Even an unjust and oppressive government, over a savage and
                            barbaric people, is better than no government. Herod the Idumean is referred to by writers
                            as an outrageous tyrant. But was he worse than the fractious and quarrelsome people over
                            whom he ruled ? He suppressed robber outlaws, and compelled violent and contentious parties
                            to live in outward harmony, and to respect each other's rights. He muzzled the bears and
                            lions of his dominion and thereby rendered use ful service to the people of his day and
                            generation. He built cities and temples, gave employment to the laboring class, and paid
                            them for their services. The same can be said of some other oppressive governments, fastened
                            on the people by force or fraud. So long as the people are actuated by covetousness and
                            hate, rather than by benevolence and love to the neighbor, their governments will partake
                            more or less of the same character. Hence the surest way to improve the government of a
                            people, is to improve the moral status of the people. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            shouldst be mindful of him?" The question can be properly answered by saying that he is the
                            aggregation and accumulation of all the progressive forces that have evolved from out of
                            primeval chaos, the being that has been pronounced only a little lower than the angels. We
                            propose to discuss the subject of human progress in the light of an optimist, and view life
                            as on the ascending scale; for to admit of any other deductions or conclusions, would be to
                            admit the possibility of annihilation. When the Omnipotent said, "let there be light," and
                            there was light, it was the enunciation of the law of eternal progress. In the light of
                            geology, life has ascended from the lower types. The doctrine of evolution, does not and can
                            not conflict with the divine creative plan, as it is one with the divine Spirit. All
                            physical life has its period of growth and decay ; but the vital force, the soul life, is
                            immortal, not at all subject to physical law. The fall of civilization, indicates and proves
                            the law of progress as truly as their rise. The spiritual forces that had evolved them,
                            demanded a more advanced medium through which to manifest its life, and all that had been
                            attained, was not lost to the race as a whole. We at present hold as a divine inheritance
                            from the past, all that they had gained in their struggles on their upward journey.. <pb n="231" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 231 The present social, political and religious
                            structure of society must eventually give way to something more advanced when the time comes
                            for the ripening of the harvest. Present indications point very strongly to the fact that
                            the time is near at hand and even at the door, when the consummation of the present age will
                            be accomplished and the human race will cast off its worn and soiled garments and reclothe
                            itself in raiment that is more in accord with its advanced conditions. But let none be
                            deceived. The old, while it must die and make room for the new, will recede, only as it is
                            compelled to. The new must force its way upward, through a dead and inert mass, but it will
                            be done. While there are many who cry, "lo here and lo there," suggesting plans for the
                            betterment of human conditions; many that are yet premature ; the ripen-* ing of the harvest
                            steadily proceeds, and those watchers on the towers who are waiting to catch a glimpse of
                            the new day and proclaim it to the world, will not be disappointed, for in the fullness of
                            time will be evolved a civilization, the grandeur of which, at present can not be
                            comprehended. In the coming time, the cosmopolitan spirit will be more manifest, unifying
                            mankind, abolishing race, social and religious distinctions that now divide mankind into
                            many discordant factors. The divine Revelator caught a view of the Millennial age in the
                            innumerable host that no man could number, who stood with the spiritualized band on the

                            spiritual growth where they were free from the bondage to the elementary forces, and had
                            through tribulation, worked out their salvation. "First that which is natural and afterward
                            that which is spiritual;" and the intense struggle at present in operation, to master the
                            physical forces of the world and bring them under subjection, forcibly illustrates that
                            fact. " 'Tis coming up the steep of time and this old world is growing brighter." Truly the
                            ascent of man up the hill of progression may be slow, but it must be and is permanent. The
                            growth of the present age, will stand as a beacon light, to guide the future traveler with
                            more safety. Each generation lighting new ones, marking the pitfalls that they may be
                            avoided. Finally, nothing will stay the onward march of the race, because it is so linked to
                            the divine Spirit, and the inspiration that is drawn to feed its life is "from above, in
                            that realm where the influence from the elementary forces does not enter, and from which, is

                            them, may enjoy great satisfaction by comparing the pilgrimage of earnest and honest souls
                            of an earlier age, with that which is known of the pilgiims of to-day. We may have our
                            trials and crosses,we may have our burdens consequent upon our journey through this world of
                            labor and care, yet we have only to study the biblical history to learn lessons of wonderful
                            res'ignation to the work into which God was pleased to call the witnesses of his work among
                            men. These are by no means isolated cases, which are almost hidden from observation, but
                            beginning with that of righteous Abel, they are never lost from sight. "Faithful unto death"
                            lias been the watchword of these servants of the Lord, and as this devoted class has never
                            been wholly obscured by the unrighteousness of man's heart, we have all reason to believe
                            that witnesses for the truth of God will ever be found so long as the race lasts who will
                            stand erect and bear the testimony as it is manifested to them. This we may do both as a
                            duty and as a privilege. Our high calling in Christ will admit of nothing less. In this we
                            have the voice of Wisdom, "In all thy ways acknowledge God, and He shall direct thy paths."
                            To be directed into the path of righteousness is all that can be desired. It is in that
                            situation where we find the "yoke easy and the burden light," and ultimately find rest to
                            the soul. Those who fail to obtain all that this promise presents, both in its earthly and
                            its heavenly relations, have as signally failed to make the promises an active principle in
                            the acceptance of the cross of Christ. With the cross comes the crown, and the manifestation
                            of the first is quite equaled by that of the last. As we bear cheerfully the cross which our
                            divine Teacher bore, we have an assurance that we shall with him, wear the crown of perfect
                            peace. There are many who can confidently look for the blessing that is awarded to the
                            honest seeker after righteousness, yet how many there are who neglect to secure all the
                            advantages that are offered. They may have been faithful, but it was not unto death. They
                            may have run well for a season, but they grew weary. The broad way was a subject <pb n="233" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 233 of closer investigation, although they were fully assured
                            that the way through the narrow gate would lead to eternal life. The best way is to take the
                            advice of the inspired writer, who says, "Hold fast that which thou hast." As small as it
                            may be, it is a precious treasure, and by no means obtained through the asking. If anything
                            is to be accomplished it must be through earnest prayer, through careful working and through
                            patient waiting till the desired end shall be accomplished. The treasure that was hid in the
                            field, could only be secured by exchanging all that the man had in his possession, and then
                            the field and what it contained became his only treasure. One step toward the kingdom of
                            righteousness is of great value,too great to be lost. One promise of consecration in the
                            interest of the work that God has chosen for us to do, is of inestimable value. All that we
                            have should be given for truth and light, and a faithful continuance in this well doing
                            assures the full and promised reward. This may not demand a special recognition, by the
                            worldly wise, and yet it may be the beginning of a life which shall lead direct to the city
                            of our God. "Hold fast that which thou hast," in walking uprightly. This admonition can not
                            be otherwise than the voice of God to the soul. The pilgrimage can be of no advantage if the
                            pilgrim fails to reach the place he anticipated. He must renew his strength and endure to
                            the end. Communities like individuals must inevitably reap a harvest corresponding, in every
                            respect with the life that gives them action. If they are Christ-like in their organization,
                            their laws and rules must spring from the law of love and good-wrill, Communities must be
                            under a healthy system of discipline, if success in consecration to God is to bring about a
                            perfect work. The inspired lessons of the Revelator as he addressed the Christian churches
                            and pointed out to them their wanderings from God, should be held in close remembrance as
                            they will be potent for good or ill. What if we do not exist as a Community,if the life of
                            the Community is not zealously active in the manifestation of good for the benefit of our
                            own homes and no less for the peace and prosperity of all around us, then our mission does
                            not meet the demand that is with and before us. Too much care can not be exercised in the
                            establishing of righteousness, as every violation of principle makes prominent inroads into
                            the spiritu al relation and leads to an inheritance that is not of God.</p></div2><pb n="234" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Ransomed" TEIform="index"/>RANSOMED.</head><p TEIform="p">"He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, to set at

                                Sabbath, Sept. 9th, and it has been a day of spiritual overflowing with us. Our Service
                                was over two hours long, being increasingly devotional from the beginning to the end.
                                There is a growing interest among mankind to learn the status of our religious belief.
                                We have had from six hundred to seven hundred attentive spectators in attendance on the
                                Sabbath. Occasionally an applicant seeks a place and is received into our ranks. This
                                evening a large company from the several families of our Community assembled in the
                                Meeting Hall of the Church family, and listened to a lecture, delivered by Henry D.
                                Lloyd of Chicago, on the Labor Trouble, Strikes, and Monopoly Trusts. He has made the
                                subject one of profound study and research. He interested us for about an hour and a
                                half, giving details of the whys and wherefores of the coal and railroad strikes, also
                                of the oil and sugar trusts. The past month has been very dry, vegetation languishes,
                                and the earth suffers for want of rain. There is a good crop of fruit. Pears and
                                cherries are abundant. Apples and plums as well as berries of various kinds are
                                excellent. Some of our buildings have been reshingled. We have made some improvement on
                                the school premises. Our boys and girls school being combined, we have had to make
                                arrangements to meet the change. It is a time of general health in the family, and all
                                appear to be interested to act well their part. This produces peace and harmony which
                                insures prosperity in things both spiritual and temporal. If there is anything in this

                                North family and eight from the Second family went to Albany and took the 8-30
                                steam-boat the "Albany" and went down the Hudson river sixty miles to Rhinebeck. It was
                                a very enjoyable ride as the day was fair, and everything favorable for a pleasant time,
                                and it was especially so to westerners who had not seen much of the Hudson river. The
                                passengers of the boat when they found out that we were Shaker Communists were very
                                inquisitive and anxious to know something of our profession and practice. Some of them
                                had never heard of such a sect. The writer was plied with numerous questions from people
                                who seemed to be honestly seeking for light and before he was aware of the fact found
                                himself surrounded by an attentive audience of nearly a hundred. They seemed spiritually
                                hungry and many that we had private conversation with evinced an earnest longing for a
                                conscious knowledge of the power that enables men and women to enjoy social and
                                spiritual communion in community homes, in purity of life. We do not doubt but that good
                                seed was sown by the Brethren and Sisters, and we also thought of the harvest,"it is
                                great but the laborers are few," but we will "pray the Lord of the harvest that he will
                                send forth more laborers into his harvest " May we keep our inner temple clean that the
                                ministrations that go forth will be uplifting. Since we came to Watervliet we have many
                                times thought of the vision of the apostle John, when he looked and saw upon Mount Zion
                                the mighty host who had their Father's name written in their foreheads. And "these are
                                they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them
                                white in the blood of the Lamb." There have been many of that number who have lived in
                                this Society arid have" passed "to'fl're Spirit land who are ministering angels bearing
                                the truth to those who are willing to receive it. We have often realized their presence,
                                and their testimony to the young is to hold the fort, to bear the standard high that was
                                transmitted to us by our gospel parents: and this we will do. "For the cause that lacks
                                assistance, and the wrongs that need resistance, and the good that we can do." We did
                                not intend to preach a sermon but our heart is full and we must express it. Long may the
                                dear Manifesto continue to make its monthly visits to cheer and strengthen the laborers
                                in the field. The weather continues dry, with an occasional light shower; but when
                                compared with the drought-stricken west we are very much favored. We just want to
                                whisper to the editor, that "the melons are ripe." We have made an addition to our dry
                                kiln so that the steaming, cutting and drying of the sweet corn will be done under one
                                roof; a great saving of labor. Work has commenced on the water works that we intend to
                                put in this fall; bringing the water from the quarry pond, forcing it up to a high point
                                so that there will be head enough to throw it over any of our buildings. The motive
                                power to drive the pumps has not yet been decided upon. It will give us a magnificent
                                supply of pure, soft, spring water.

                                ministrations of love and power, also their spiritual influence so potent for good. They

                                which has been so long and severe, is the topic of conversation. It has not been
                                confined to our immediate locality. As yet our water supply is good, while many are
                                suffering. The sun at rising and setting, resembles a ball of fire, and the dense smoke
                                is widespread. The grain has all been harvested in good condition. The corn will be

                                interest enough in the dear Manifesto to add a few lines at least. We have felt the
                                effect of the long drought, although we have not suffered for lack of water for domestic
                                purposes, as have some of our neighbors. On the 10th inst, we had a drenching rain so
                                that vegetation is looking somewhat improved and fresher than it has for some weeks. The
                                rain also laid the dust which has been the worst for years. August 25th, at 8 p.m. we
                                had a splendid illumination on the lake. A parade of decorated boats and hundreds of
                                lights and bonfires, with displays of fire-works made a scene of fairy-like
                                magnificence. It was quite a dissipation to our little people as the display lasted till
                                nearly 10 o'clock. Soon after midnight we were aroused by some people who were
                                passengers on the steamer that plys between Enfield and Lake View. In the darkness the
                                pilot had run them aground, and after the boat was floated they could not be induced to
                                get aboard again. Some of our Brethren conveyed them to Enfield where they took the
                                first train for their homes. It is pleasing to note a growing interest among the young
                                people in the cause of religion. We,have recently organized a meeting for the younger
                                part of the family and so far the attendance is good and the zeal unflagging. We are
                                holding in loving anticipation a visit from the Ohio Ministry, and before this reaches
                                the readers of the Manifesto it will be a thing of the past, though none the less

                                religious advancement as noted by her, was especially interesting. The memorial address
                                of Lawyer Thomas Savage, of Maplewood, Mass., was listened to with pleasure, while the
                                company of the genial spirited Rev. Charles Lyford and wife of Cambridge, Mass., and the
                                bible school conducted by our reverend friend was educative, for by mental comparisons
                                arise clearer conceptions of the essential duties and consistent faith that benefit
                                humanity and which should lessen the hold of nonessentials that cause one to "hang
                                reverently upon the neck of conservatism;" the pinion which impedes proper progression
                                in the direction of a purer more universal fellowship in Christ. The drought of the past

                                in beautifying the foliage with autumnal hues. While many of the farmers throughout the
                                New England states are complaining of the blighting effects of the drought we have been
                                wonderfully favored with usual good crops. As all life has its ever unfolding panorama

                                beautified by the masterful hands of architectural and agricultural grandeur for man's

                                it is to confine it to one weighty and important line of thought. But a daily habit of
                                retirement into complete silence and sequestration from all outward things and holding
                                communion with the Spirit alone will gradually give you a wonderful power of
                                concentration of mind, so that you can think on any given point or subject of thought
                                steadily and as long as you please. When one has reached that point, the advantages
                                therefrom, in the blessings of victory, peace, and the perfect mastery of one's thoughts
                                are far beyond description. Let me kindly exhort you to give it a year's trial and you
                                will never give it up as long as you live. Well, our afflicting drought yet continues
                                without abatement; I suppose it is our own fault. We have laid the land bare of forest
                                trees, and for every thousand trees we have lost 500,000 tons of water which the
                                beautiful trees would have elevated into the air and blessed us with refreshing showers.
                                In the winter they would have protected our grains, vegetables and fruits from the
                                destroying winds and frosts. So much for being money-mongers and fools. Indeed I am glad
                                it is no worse for it seems as though it ought to be. What next? O here it isDo the
                                eastern people come into a room where one is reading or writing and without the least
                                apology, ply him for half or three quarters or even a whole hour with the merest,
                                sheerest twaddle and sometimes a great deal worse, and not only expect such a reader or
                                writer to lay down his book or pen and piously attended to the nonsense (or worse) to be
                                communicated; but feel hurt and slighted if it is not done? Those who do so, of course,
                                mean well; they doubtless wish to entertain you (and if not they at least want you to
                                entertain them and both these are laudable and worthy motives,) but I fear they are not
                                considering the esoteric meaning of the Golden Rule, and so commit a breach of good
                                manners without knowing it or even thinking of it. One would suppose that the common
                                sense would dictate a different behavior, but some one has said that common sense is one
                                of the scarcest things in the market. Now there is nothing in the slighesfc degree

                                could be in central New Hamphire, and has wrought out for the farmer and the summer

                                brought more, much more than this, and we are rejoicing as did the prophet when he was

                                from the beautiful and fertile fields of the west, they must witness a great contrast on

                                covered with permanent and movable bowlders. It is with the most rigid economy that we
                                are able to move on from year to year, and yet as the old farmer said in illustrating
                                the fertility of his patch,"We have some pumpkins." Well, on the cutting of our corn
                                field, of a few acres, we discovered some pumpkins which have developed to an honorable
                                size and may be reckoned by the hundreds. Pumpkin pies belong to an earlier generation
                                and have given place to the finer qualities of the squash. We are now commencing our
                                first experience with the silo, and have just finished one llxll^o and 32 ft. deep. Its
                                estimated capacity is 101 tons. We planted five acres of Sanford sweet corn, some of
                                which reached eleven feet, and after stiipping off the ripened ears, the stalks were cut
                                for the silo. The pieces were about two inches long. After being filled it settled
                                several feet, but the ensilage on the five acre lot will be all that can be forced into
                                the silo. We shall now wait future developments and see what may be the advantages of

                            room; beautiful floral decorations were arranged in tasteful order and in harmony with the
                            declining season. The members assembled at 7.15 with a desire to do the best that their
                            mental and soul developments would allow. The proceedings were as follows: Hymn, 'Willing
                            Service;' composed by Martha J. Anderson; A recitation by Bessie Tyner; Martha Burger read
                            an article on 'Hygiene;' The Emancipation of Woman;' an essay by Annie K. Stephens; 'The
                            Summer Song;' composed by Lucy S. Bowers was then beautifully rendered by six young Sisters.
                            'The Labor Exchange;' by Isabel Mac. Leod; 'Sabbath or Sunday;' an essay by Lucy S. Bowers;
                            'The Kose and Golden-rod,' poem by Martha J. Anderson, read by Julia Lincoln; 'Flowers from
                            Heaven' was then sung by the young Sisters; 'Capital Punishment,' an essay by Belle

                            Age,' an essay by Catherine Allen; 'America's Working People,' poem by Cecelia DeVere read
                            by Sarah J. Burger. The president here remarked that the productions were all original and
                            that the time devoted to their arrangement was taken between the hours allotted to the
                            common duties of life. We had with us two very interested visitors one of whom, Henry D.
                            Lloyd is our mutual friend and co-laborer in the field of radical reform, concerning the
                            system of wage slavery that is binding humanity in iron chains; he is a man of rare
                            reflective qualities and deep intuitions, combined with large social and religious
                            faculties; by religious we do not mean orthodox, but that deeper religion that sympathizes
                            with humanity and comes in touch with its needs and sufferings. After the general exercises
                            were completed we tendered to him an invitation to add whatever he might desire, by way of
                            criticism, instruction or encouragement. In reply he said in part: I have no word of
                            criticism to offer; I can understand that feeling that seeks for higher development and
                            wishes to be criticised; I am in the same position myself; I am always a learner. I am
                            agreeably surprised at the system that I find here, and am deeply impressed with the
                            magnitude of the good that you are doing in a quiet way, but you must not always be so

                            here when you should let your light shine and show the world the divine conditions under
                            which you live. I have had a new experience while with you, feelings arise,a something has
                            come over me (at this point lie showed the intensity of his spii-it that he could scarcely
                            control) to which words fail to give utterance. I have had a great many thoughts while here,
                            this one especially presents itself. I have long pondered in my mind how changed conditions
                            for humanity could be brought about; to-night the problem seems solved, in the article read
                            on 'Emancipation of Woman;' and did you know that it was a woman that first uttered those
                            words of 'immediate emancipation,' which were our inspiration when our country was going
                            through the strugglethe agonies of the rebellion? And will it be a woman that will utter the
                            word of deliverance in the revolution that is already upon us? Another thought arises, do
                            not for one moment think that the manual labor you perform is a hinderance to a higher
                            development. Your equality in material labor is a great help to you in your mental and
                            spiritual aspirations,a source of inspiration. I can not recall a single work of art in
                            literature that has been a benefit to humanity that was not born of the needs of the people,
                            it has never been the product of wealth or luxury, and the experiences of life that you
                            derive from it will prove valuable in the development of your higher spiritual qualities.
                            After more than a hundred years of growth, the result of self-sacrifice, devotion and
                            chastity, is it possible to keep this accumulation of good to yourselves and not share it
                            with others? I am fully convinced, that there is no other spot in America so favorable to
                            the highest inspiration; no other people so susceptible to those clear, burning truths that
                            are for the redemption of humanity. Your communal homes are the seed-beds from which must
                            spring the plants whose leaves will heal the nations. From you who have so long dwelt in
                            solitude, your lives and your work hidden from the. world, a voice will yet go forth and
                            will be heard; it must be so. There is a power here that will strike a spark in the heavens
                            whose fire will light the outer darkness. S. I.

                                The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health
                            </head><p TEIform="p">The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for September is up to date as regards
                                both matter and manner. The frontispiece is a handsome portrait of Mrs. Charlotte Fowler
                                Wells. She is also the subject of an interesting phrenograph which Dr. Beall publishes
                                at this time in honor of her eightieth birthday. The second number is a logical,
                                eloquent and earnest plea for voice culture, by the well-known actress, Mary Shaw, which
                                will attract attention among teachers and student.of elocution, and all who favor
                                intellectual progress. Prof. Sizer, in his series, How to Study Strangers, shows his
                                skill in delineating character from photographs; and Mrs. Wells, in a sketch of Dr. Sim,
                                gives an account of a most remarkable phrenological test. The editor has an interview
                                with an American "White Mahatina," recently returned from India, who tells of the
                                marvels he has witnessed in the Orient, and describes many traits of character of the
                                Hindoos, Japanese, Chinese, etc. This is illustrated by a number of fine engravings from
                                foreign photographs. The departments of Child Culture and Hygiene are pithy, and the
                                editorial columns are especially strong in advocating the need of phrenology in
                                legislation, etc. Price, 15 cents, $1.50 a year. Address the Fowler &amp; Wells Co.,
                                27 East 21st St., New York. The famous musical composers have taken a hint from their
                                literary brethren, and are securing an advance magazine publication for their
                                compositions just as the authors publish their novels in serial form. The Ladies' Home
                                Journal, which was practically the first magazine to offer this outlet to composers of
                                repute, finds all the musical men rallying to it, Sir Arthur Sullivan an nouncing that
                                the new song which he has just finished will be published in that magazine. Patti's
                                veteran conductor, Arditi, has given his new waltz to the Journal, while Reginald de
                                Koven's new song goes also to the same periodical. Strauss has sent his new waltz to the
                                editor, Sousa a new march, and Mascagni of "Cavalleria Rusticana" fame, is writing a
                                piano score. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Journal of Hygeio-Therapy" TEIform="index"/>

                                Samuel Smith, M. P. This being the twelfth thousand that has been published, of this
                                little work, is sufficient evidence that the Book is appreciated in the Christian
                                Churches. The writer evidently has an unshaken confidence in the work which he has
                                written, which goes far to make a favorable impression upon its readers. Chapter second
                                which teaches of "The necessity of a Revelation," is beautifully written and must lead
                                the mind to an appreciation of the arguments there brought forward. The other chapters
                                lead the reader through equally beautiful written arguments which are as carefully
                                wrought out and sustained in the heart of the writer. The Christian religion is
                                something that can never be clearly represented by arguments either written or spoken.
                                When the spirit of Christ takes up its abode in the soul, then righteousness will be
                                manifested through the whole life,then it will be "peace on earth, to men, good-will."</p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Intra-mural view" TEIform="index"/>An Intra-Mural View

                                An Intra-Mural View," a very artistic brochure, has been received from The Curtis
                                Publishing Company, Philadelphia, publishers of The Ladies' Home Journal. As the title
                                indicates, the booklet gives us glimpses of the interiors of the Journal's offices, and
                                some idea of the work carried on there. The main building, entirely occupied by the
                                editorial and business offices, was designed by Mr. Hardenberg, the architect of the
                                Hotel Waldorf, New York, and was completed in January, 1893. The exterior is attractive
                                and the interior elegantly appointed and admirably planned. The numerous illustrations,
                                showing the commodious and well-fitted offices, and the accompanying text, giving us
                                some insight into the work in the different bureaus, requiring a force approximating
                                four hundred employes, indicate the wonderful success which The Ladies' Home Journal has
                                achieved in an almost incredibly short time. The first number was issued in December,
                                1883, so that less than eleven years have elapsed since Mr. Curtis conceived the idea
                                which has developed into so vast an enterprise. In this short time its merit and steady
                                improvement in all departments have received such recognition that its circulation has
                                reached the enormous average of about 700,000, the largest magazine output in the world.
                                The brochure also describes at some length the work of printing and binding the Journal,
                                which is carried on in a separate building. "An Intra-Mural View" will be sent to any
                                one who will address The Curtis Publishing Company, and inclose four cents in stamps for
                                postage.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="God has made many..." TEIform="index"/>God has made many...
