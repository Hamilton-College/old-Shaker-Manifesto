That's a large number, but the Symphonion plays it. The Symphonion is an unlimited
music box instead of a cylinder playing from
one to six airs. The Symphonion uses steel
plates as shown herewith.
These plates revolve and their teeth strike
the teeth of the steel combs, thus producing
the tones. Plates are changed in a moment.
They may be bought by the hundreds and each
plate represents a different tune. One may
thus have sacred music, old favorites and latest songs of the day, as he chooses.
The Symphonion is simple in construction
and does not get out of order, as the old fashion music boxes always do. They are rich and
melodious in tone and not the least expensive.
We are headquarters for the trade and are
prepared to quote lower prices than ever before with all the latest improvements.

                            JOHN RANKIN.</head><p TEIform="p">[The following very interesting biography of
                            John Rankin was furnished to us by the friends of South Union, Ky. Ed.] My parents emigrated from Ireland to the state of Pennsylvania, while in their 37outh. Both
                            of my parents were educated in the Colonistic church and adhered to the doctrines in the
                            Westminster confession. ?Jy parents after a suitable acquaintance entered into that civil
                            connection natural to the human family, who design living according to the order of the
                            first Adam. I was born Nov. 27, 1757 in Guilford Co., North Carolina. When nearly three
                            years of age, my father was removed by death, and my mother was left with two little
                            children. While but a mere child, my mind was given to religious subjects, and my mother
                            instructed me in the catechism, and had me commit to memory the creed, and some passages in
                            the Psalms. In this I understood but little that I had learned although it made a serious
                            impression on my mind. In addition to this she was careful to warn me against all sin,
                            either in myself or by the example of others. I was taught to abhor intoxication and to
                            detest the company of blasphemers. A kind parent ever solicitous for my welfare, taught me
                            to beware of effeminate company. By this education and a protecting Providence, my mind was
                            armed in a good measure with a shield against outbreaking sin. While I was receiving the
                            above verbal education, a sufficient supply of religious books were put into my hands for my
                            information and entertainment in leisure hours, and in particular on the Sabbath day, which
                            had to be observed almost to Jewish scrupulosity. This observation held me under restraint
                            and formed in- me a habitual and easy subjection to order, whether religious or civil. Some
                            of the books were highly Calvanistic, and held forth their doctrines in general, with all
                            the practical duties of religion as taught in their system. This course gave me a relish for
                            reading and for research into those difficult scriptural doctrines. Having these lively
                            impressions, my mind preponderated in favor of the New Light doctrine, and I greatly desired
                            a living religion that would reach my understanding. I was now nineteen years of age and

                            convinced that I was destitute of what was called living religion. While under these
                            impressions I made a practice of praying to God to illuminate my mind and bring me to the
                            knowledge of the truth, to save me from temptation and sin. If I conversed on religion it
                            was on the topics of the day. I dared advance no further, but at the expense of a sneer. In
                            1776, I was warmly solicited to obtain a classical education preparatory to becoming a
                            theological preacher, or a preacher made by men. After mature deliberation on the subject, I
                            embarked in the enterprize. I knew I was destitute of that which was said to be the effects
                            of the gospel in that day and therefore made no determined choice of a profession, only on
                            certain conditions, which were�that if God, in the course of my studies should enlighten my
                            mind, and lead me to be a subject of his favor, I would then apply my education to public
                            usefulness. I proceeded assiduously through Roman and Greek literature, and was entertained
                            by a history of the exploits of their heroes, kings and emperors. Also with the account of
                            the heathen mythology, a course of reading much better calculated to inspire a youth with
                            inclinations to become a Julius Caesar or an Alexander, than to lead him to the gentle
                            waters of eternal life. In my laborious study I lost my taste for reading the Scriptures and
                            other religious books. Against Saturday eve-n ing my mind would be so fatigued with study,
                            that I required the Sabbath to refresh myself for the labors of the following week. I went
                            from home to the town of Charlotte and entered the academy in Mecklenburg County. Here I
                            heard a man deliver a discourse that quicken d my feelings and created in me strong desires
                            for living religion. On Sabbath evening I retired to a thicket where I had frequently spent
                            some time in meditation. I fell on my knees in grief and earnestly called on God to have
                            mercy on me, and deliver me from the burden of sin. It now occurred to me, that it was worse
                            than vanity to attempt to preach a gospel which I had not in possession. Instantaneously I
                            declined all prospects toward the gospel ministry and resolved that I would pros cute my
                            learn ing and if possible, become a proficient in some branch of education by which I should
                            be qualified for a teacher in some public institution and could live an honorable life.
                            After a few months, I left the academy, to which I never returned. Our peace and prosperity
                            was clouded by the desolating approach of war. Civil and literary improvements were laid
                            aside, and the struggle to defend the country, was the great object. Annies were marching
                            and counter marching in every quarter; scenes of blood and carnage were presented to the
                            eye, and a cruel foe marked with desolation, for three years their whole route in the South,
                            when their career fell by the arms of their triumphant captors. Things now began to wear a
                            new aspect. Victory had brought peace. During the unsettled state of the nation and the
                            return of peace, my mind was generally occupied with the chang-<pb n="203" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 203 ing scenes of the day. I applied myself to regular business, if possible to
                            retrieve my loss, and I was successful in obtaining a profitable employment. About this time
                            I heard of a Methodist preacher, who had visited our place, and I was desirous of hearing
                            him. I reached the place of meeting too late to hear the first part of his sermon, but one
                            remark that he made, entered my heart never to be forgotten. He said,�"I know I am alive to
                            God." My heart rejoiced; that is the life I want, but how to obtain it is beyond my
                            comprehension. In this state of perplexity I continued to pray to God for light and wisdom,
                            but could obtain no consolation. By industry and economy I laid by a sum of money to answer
                            purposes I had in contemplation. On the 5th of Dec. 1786, I entered a new relation in life
                            and settled in a family capacity. In this situation new duties devolved upon me, the
                            religious part of which I found myself inadequate to perform to the satisfaction of my
                            conscience. I had been baptized with water, but had no evidence of the remission of sins,
                            but had evidence of the condemnation for sin. I now resolved to obtain the all-important
                            treasures of the gospel. Accordingly I arranged my business in such a manner that I could
                            attend all the principal meetings without inconvenience. The light was appearing. I had not
                            put the above resolution into practice long, until on a memorable morning in great heaviness
                            of spirit I retired to a sequestered spot for meditation and prayer. In composure of mind I
                            arose from my knees and returned to the house, and instantly this passage of Scripture came
                            to my mind,�"He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus
                            Christ." Under these considerations I was encouraged in the performance of every duty. In
                            the mean time, I made no more profession than formerly, but kept the operations of my mind a
                            secret, as much as possible. Time seemed to pass almost imperceptibly. My mind was chained
                            to the subject of Divine aid, so that I wrestled day and night, and would take no denial.
                            Again the messenger came to my soul,�"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after
                            righteousness, for they shall be filled." I believed it came from God, and applied to my
                            case. New consolation came to me and my hope revived. After this encouragement I determined
                            to persevere in the path of duty let my condition of mind be what it might. A favorable
                            opportunity offering, I opened my mind to one of the leading preachers of the revival,
                            respecting my belief in the promises of God, and he frankly told me I had religion. I said I
                            was not satisfied. He told me to persevere and I would be better satisfied. On another
                            occasion being in company with a preacher who was very learned, I stated my situation to
                            him, and he also said that I had religion. (to be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="As shines the sun..." TEIform="index"/>As shines the sun...

                            is so singularly narrow and unspiritual when compared with the magnificence and depth of our
                            soul-saving faith, that it would invite some remarks even if its conclusions concerning
                            Mother Ann were correct and acceptable. If we discard old theologies, why should W2 take the
                            silken thread of truth and tangle it up into a new snarl or snare. Ages and ages of the past
                            have left no trace of their history and fame�well, it never was the object of a great soul.
                            Jesus through the eternal truth that he lived reached glorified immortality. We have reason
                            to believe that his body was not corrupted by disease, nor by generation, and, as far as our
                            requirements extend that would be all the immaculate flesh which we could see any use in; as
                            to the "personality, name, form and function of the mangod that stood forth from the grave,"
                            they have as little bearing on the soul's travel as the Father, Son and Holy Ghost doctrine
                            has. There is obvious inconsistancy in the statement, that Jesus showed the world a "new and
                            living way, by having attained to the knowledge and possibility of dematerializing his body
                            and converting it to spirit," for then it could not be a tangible, material form as declared
                            ; or, if through the perfection of his character he rendered his flesh immortal either pure
                            or indestructable. What became of it after it appeared? for "flesh and blood cannot inherit
                            the kingdom of God" however transcendently immaculate, because they are of substance and
                            weight, therefore could not share the throne. In the waters of repentance, the soul may be
                            cleansed from the corruptions that are in the world through lust; and for the external,
                            there are several methods by which fetid organism corruption is overcome or stayed.
                            Embalming, freezing, potrifymg etc., will keep it from the old dead way, namely, the
                            corruption of the body. It is a curious fact that no ethics or religion have as yet been
                            able to bring the body to the perfection that is produced by the science of the pugilists.
                            It is veritable nonsense to speak of one having received an illumination of immortal
                            thoughts while his body, brain and surroundings are undergoing the disintegration which is
                            but a natural process of decay? then alas, for our inspiration and aspiration ! But nay, is
                            it not far more in accordance with the general plan that our earthly form, like all other
                            things which have served their use, shall go to the elements that made and unmade them?
                            Whoever is instructed in and lives the life of the heavens to which we look, will surely be
                            welcomed by their intelligent hosts whether he believe that God is man, that the son of man
                            is the Son of God, and all the rest about the God-head bodily, or, that he thinks all creeds
                            are non-essentials or even rubbish. While we believe that all souls are immortal we would
                            not think that any are celestially immortalized that merely overcame corruption or depravity
                            ; purity and holiness must be added and then perfected in the fear, which is the sacred love

                            the same influence in a refined way, just as the festering pool sends up its lovely white
                            but poisonous vapor. What kind of contracted, "angelic heavens" are they, "whose central and
                            foundational principle is that the Son of God was glorified in his humanity," and that they
                            could not "tolerate the sphere of any person who denied the Divinity of the Lord whom they
                            confessed the Son of God and the divine human;" that intolerance has the color of the
                            blueness of the blue creed. Such heavens ought to pass away by the death and closure of
                            their cycle. No broad minded soul would wish to be admitted into any of them; for their
                            angels in order to progress have need of being scattered among the noble ones on earth, who
                            have overcome corruption and conquered in all its phases the nature that produced its
                            loathsomeness; such are capable of teaching that class of angels not to minister to mortal
                            flesh. If we were going to seek for embodiments or prototypes of Ann Lee, we would not begin
                            with the mother of Ephraim, who was "joined to his idols," nor close with the gentle Mary,
                            who watched over and sympathized with her son through his mission of trust and suffering.
                            The march of time developed more advanced women than were those. Mother Ann, by her soul
                            labors and with the derrick of her testimonies, tore out the great root of evil; trunk,
                            branches, blossoms and fruit were cast into the flames never to be resuscitated, never to be
                            made immaculate, but to be burned. She flung up the earth in all directions, and searched
                            for every fibre which might again send forth the growth of that Upas tree ; thus clearing
                            the soil for the germs of the immortal. While she taught what constitutes that life most
                            lucidly and with the simplicity of her own genuine goodness, neither she, nor any of her
                            children, believed that the goal of human aspiration was reached by her or by themselves.
                            How could they while they were encouraged by the ministrations which were the reward of the
                            work that they did, and which their faith still revealed as being before them. What an Olio
                            Incongruous could be published of the various presentations of Ann Lee that have been
                            listened to by the Shakers for the last forty-five years, while they adhered to her
                            instructions and were blessed. She left us, in degree the Immaculate Motherhood which
                            proceeded from the arch celestial, the key stone of which was and is Hatred to the Flesh.
                            That Motherhood has been increased and glorified, it more than meets our souls; no man hath
                            seen it, for it could not manifest, save to souls that travel in the regeneration. Behold it
                            is not connected with the male prophet who is to turn the hearts of the fathers and sons to
                            each other; fathers and daughters are seldom separated in feeling. The Messenger is he (not
                            she) that is to prepare the way before the Lord, who is to come to his temple, in his
                            dreadful day (with whip<pb n="206" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 206 THE MANIFESTO. of small cords,) and who is
                            to abide his coming? evidently no daughters. He, the Messenger of the Covenant, in whom men
                            delight, "Behold he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts." That sentence we thought went out
                            of use with Miller's misinterpretation of the spiritual influx that was about to illumine
                            the world. Who saith of Ann she is my Mother and shall perform all my pleasure ; even saying
                            to Jerusalem thou shalt more beautifully be built, and to the temple, thy foundations shall
                            be strengthened, they who have come up out of great tribulation and who still in humility
                            walk in the light of their Immortal Faith.</p></div2><div2 type="biography" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="My choice" TEIform="index"/>MY CHOICE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Horton, Lizzie D." TEIform="persName"/>Lizzie D. Horton.</byline><p TEIform="p">When a very little girl I was placed with the Shakers by a kind father who wished me
                            protected from the sins of the world. He knew that with this people I should find a good
                            home, receive an education and be taught to live an honorable and upright life. Not being
                            blest with any particularly religious aspirations, I could not realize so fully as to-day
                            the great blessing which came to me, not by chance, but by the leading of the Spirit. I was
                            loved and kindly cared for by my Shaker friends, and in my childish fancy and affection
                            tried to return that love. I endeavored to be good and obedient because it pleased them,
                            feeling very sorry when I did wrong, principally, because I had grieved my dear teachers,
                            not knowing that every sin marred my own spirit. I always found forgiveness for my faults,
                            even before I sought it; and when reproved for some error, recognized that love guided the
                            hand that chastened. Thus years passed on, and childhood with its free, happy days gradually
                            blossomed into youth. I began to realize that life was not all play and I longed for the
                            virtuous freedom of spirit which I saw so plainly manifested in the lives of my superiors,
                            not fully comprehending the import or meaning of the desire. I had always said I never
                            should leave this home, for I intended to become a Shaker Sister, but how little did I know
                            what it was to be a Shaker Sister,�a disciple of Christ. At one time, when conversing with
                            one of my best friends and asking counsel, I was advised to pray that conviction might rest
                            upon my soul and lead me to confess, honestly and humbly, all past errors and ask the
                            forgiveness of my friends. This work she assured me would be the first step in the new life,
                            and a sure foundation upon which to build. In this condition, I was seemingly placed before
                            two roads. In one,�the broad way I dare not walk, yet desired to obtain the joy, comfort and
                            reward of the narrow way without paying the full price. While thus undecided the words of
                            our Savior came forcibly to mind,� "Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to
                            destruction, and many there be which go in thereat, for strait is the gate and narrow is the
                            way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." Heeding this voice of warning,
                            I said, The broad way is not the path for me.<pb n="207" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 20" I then
                            prayed that I might walk in the "strait and narrow way," and that I might clearly see and
                            comprehend my duty. As an answer came the words, "Knock and it shall be opened unto you,"
                            and again, the price to pay is, "Thine own life also." I felt that now I must make my final
                            choice, for time spent in doubting and indecision is wasted. I resolved to enter the
                            cleansing waters of Jordan and thus fit my soul for acceptance with the pure in heart. By an
                            honest confession of all sin and by consecrating my services to God, anew, sought the
                            privilege, on the 17th of May, 1892, to write my name in our Church Covenant. There my name
                            stands enrolled with tried and true souls, and also my resolution to be a loyal member
                            thereof. Thanks to God and to my precious friends, that I number one among you in the
                            morning of my days, for one of the greatest blessings crowning our Centennial year, I deem
                            that of recording my name as a member of this Church. The beloved friends of my childhood
                            and youth who have often "turned my feet from harm I could not see," have been the "angels
                            in the way." May I be so loyal to my mission that by an upright example I may be able to
                            impress some little soul with conviction, and aid such to make a wise choice, with me. East

On account of our

                            and accepting them as members of the Noith family, on condition that they live out in daily
                            practice the fundamental principles of our Order, oral confession of sin before a living
                            witness ; a pure virgin life; the principle of peace as taught and practiced by Jesus; and
                            consecration of all worldly goods to the gospel cause, some might think that we endorse the
                            theological statements and ideas set forth in the Flaming Sword. We do nothing of the kind,
                            and especially we do not in the article referred to, and some previous ones. A correct
                            understanding of the meaning of words and terms is very essential. When a Shaker speaks of
                            the flesh, it is distinct from the body, or our mortal part. It is the root of the great
                            tree of . evil that bears the fruit spoken of by the Apostle ; (Gal. v.,) herein is the
                            Shaker definition of the flesh. When the flesh is spoken of as the body, we mean the mortal
                            part of man which is not the man, but simply the casket of the real man, the spirit; and the
                            medium of its, or his manifestation. In the article referred to, the immortal flesh is
                            spoken of. Immortal, according to Webster is, "Having no principle of alteration or
                            corruption; exempt from death ; having life or being that shall never end." There has been
                            no evidence or proof given, that<pb n="208" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 208 THE MANIFESTO. my rational
                            understanding can accept, of any human body or flesh becoming immortal. If the body of
                            Enoch, Elijah or Jesus became so, it must be in existence to-day. If it is not in existence,
                            then it is not immortal. The probability is that no human body ever will be. Scientists tell
                            us, that nothing can be destined, that matter is eternal; but by the operation of the laws
                            of nature every particle of matter is continually undergoing the process of change. Now if
                            dematerializing is the process of nature, making matter invisible, or changing its form,
                            then every human body or any other body can be and is subject to the process. Tne Society of
                            Believers may be ignorant of the immortal life spoken of by the writer of that article, but
                            we of the Society of Believers, or Shakers, do not believe that Ann Lee "attained the goal
                            of human aspiration." But we do believe, and have a spiritual evidence, not understood by
                            the natural man, that Ann Lee is immortal, and that we by living the same life, obeying the
                            same principles she taught and lived, we also shall become as she is ; and many have become
                            so already. Not by eating the literal flesh or body of Jesus or that of any other human
                            body. The statement that the Lord made choice of a woman, who was the wife of Joseph, the
                            mother of Ephraim, and the espoused of Joseph, and the mother of Jesus ; and that woman was
                            Ann Lee, the Society of Believers take no part in. That Ann Lee is about to come forth
                            re-incarnated in the immaculate Motherhood, and by that means the Sons of God will come
                            forth as biune beings, is no part of the faith of the Shaker Order. We become the Sons and
                            Daughters of God, by doing in all things the will of our Heavenly Father and our Heavenly
                            Mother, just as Jesus became the Son of God, and Ann the Daughter of God. There has been in
                            the last century, a number of individuals who believed they had attained to a knowledge
                            whereby their mortal bodies would become immortal; but where are the}?' now? Just where all
                            other mortal bodies are, and where all human bodies that are now in existence will be sooner
                            or later. "Re not d( ceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
                            also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
                            soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            blessings connected with abstinence from tobacco. In the article under the above heading
                            there are some points that need correction. . It is not the "eating of meat that provides
                            the rich red blood that furnishes the animal vigor necessary to rough sports," but it is the
                            amount of fresh pure air we inhale and its combustion in our lungs that condition the amount
                            and quality of the i\d blood corpuscles. If the country people of the old country (the
                            robust Irishman and the sturdy Scotchman) should depend on meat for their red corpuscles
                            they would have very few of them and far between�on holidays and exceptional occasions. To
                            state that the various herbivora have been created because the vigor and stamina of the
                            human race are dependent in some degree on moderate meat eating is about as logical as for
                            the cannibals to assume that the meat of their captives in war (or missionaries for a
                            change) \&gt; necessary for keeping up their strength and courage in prime condition. The
                            majority of the inhabitants of the earth prove that we indeed are able to feed directly of
                            all the earth produces for us, for whole nations and<pb n="210" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 210 THE
                            MANIFESTO. classes do abstain from eating meat� be it out of religious motives or out of
                            necessity�and still (yea for this) maintain vigor of body and mind; whereas the slaughtering
                            of animals for feeding on their often diseased bodies is one of the many sources of the
                            intemperance that produces so much misery and sickness* among men to-day. There is no.
                            reason to fear that "the day that animal appetites are bred out of the human race, we shall
                            be too worthless to accomplish any work the Lord has appointed for us." On the contrary we
                            shall then approach nearer the Kingdom of Heaven, with peace on earth and good-will to man,
                            and cultivate the arts, industries and labors of peace. For as long as man will continue to
                            kill animals for food, war will not cease. But I admit that total prohibition of meat eating
                            once established will render us effeminate so as to deprive us of that animal vigor that
                            vents itself in bestial excesses, and of that ferocity which moves our death-dealing hand
                            not only against the harmless creatures of a lower plane, but forges weapons of death
                            against our fellow-man�our brother. "Thou shalt not kill" will yet be sacredly observed both
                            concerning animals and man ; he who slayeth an ox will be like him who slayeth a man. Before
                            the temperance movement, farmers thought it impossible to go through the arduous
                            requirements of their occupation without the whiskey-bottle. Now many a good-tempered tiller
                            of the soil and his brothers in the different trades prove the contrary to their
                            satisfaction and benefit. That men in different occupations perform the most laborious work
                            witLout the stimulant of meat lood will not be disputed. We need not give individual or
                            general cases to prove it. We are masters of causes but become the slaves of consequences ;
                            sis long as man chooses to kill in oide.1 to eat, to ransack ocean and laud for the
                            gratification of animal appetites and trying to appease the following indispositions by
                            using stimulants like coffee, tea, tobacco, morphine, opium, hashish and so on, he will
                            suffer all manner of diseases and vent his wrath in extinguishing life. But the refined man
                            is a simple feeder, and the temperate enjoys all the blessings of a life worth the living.
                            In the future development of man he will rely for his food more and more on the garden and
                            orchard and less on the pasture and slaughter-house. The law of love will protect all
                            harmless living beings and the life of our brother-man will b &gt; sacred above ail things. No

                                    poisoned dart of hate Control the functions of the mind, Then life, no matter what
                                    its state, Can peace no longer in it find. Burning with jealous fire, the soul

                                    The desolation they would bring, No pen of man could e'er portray, Eternal ages,
                                    too, would ring, With loud anathemas displayed. If we would have ou, life infused,
                                    Not with the evil, but the good, In starting out be sure to choose The proper kind
                                    of kindling wood. Instead of hatred, let the soul Be kindled by a flame of love,
                                    Dark passion, then, will be controlled By quickening power sent from above. If

                                Christian union that is to be found to exist among the several members who compose that
                                body. Brotherly love has a wonderful, magical effect upon the mind to dispel all doubt
                                and fears, and to make the burdens and trials of life grow light. No amount of wealth,
                                nor extent of worldly possessions, nor multitudes of people can bring to Community, the
                                peace and prosperity which is found to unfold so beautifully in the cultivation of the
                                precious gift of union. This in its fulness is the love of God to man. It creates, holds
                                and remolds till degree after degree is passed, and a life obtained that may, very
                                properly, be said, to be "hid with Christ in God." "By this shall men know that ye are
                                my disciples, if ye love another." In this is the key-note of success for the followers
                                of Jesus. This divine gift of love was an out-pouring from the presence of the Lord,�it
                                was a manifestation of the refreshing that was promised to come upon the earnest seeker
                                after righteousness, and was no less a baptism into a new and spiritual life. Neither
                                wealth nor poverty, are in the least calculated to develop that love which Jesus was so
                                anxious should be known among his disciples ; and yet he promised them an hundred-fold
                                of all the blessings in time, if they would become the children of God. This prDmise of
                                such abundant blessings in this world, was the introduction of the Ministry of wealth,
                                through which so much good might be accomplished for the happiness of the race of man.
                                This had no reference to the accumulation of wealth for selfish purposes, which might be
                                consumed as is the wealth held by the children of this world, but should be used for the
                                peace and prosperity of all who entered the religious communion.<pb n="213" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>
                                THE MANIFESTO. 213 Gold and silver are as essentially needed in the dissemination of the
                                glad tidings among men, as is the daily bread in the maintenance ol the physical life.
                                To secure a healthy, active, religious Community, there needs to be a constant liberal
                                expenditure to keep pace with the perishable property and to meet all the demands of the
                                general household. Poverty on the other hand is not at all to be desired, even though a
                                religious communist in his consecration to God has given all he possessed into the
                                treasury of the Lord. With this disposition of time and talents and worldly treasures,
                                he is by no means poor, unless the Community, as a whole, is poor, which indeed, must be
                                the visitation of a sad affliction upon the faithful workers of the cross. Here again,
                                comes the greatest of all treasures, and the surest road to ultimate success, as the
                                love of God and the union of the brotherhood is consummated in the daily life of the
                                Christian disciple. This transcends all things else, in that it gives assurance of a
                                present happiness and an unfolding prosperity. It was our Mother Ann who foresaw the
                                great need of the Communistic life, and impressed this saying upon the minds of her
                                people. " P ut your hands at work, and give your heart to God." She well knew that an
                                industrious people would never need beg for bread nor suffer from the want of any
                                temporal blessing, and yet at this same time, Mother Ann was suffering intense cruelty
                                from the hands of violent persecutors, and often reduced to a very low point for the
                                want of her daily bread. In all of these sad afflictions, her hope rested permanently on
                                God. and she could praise him for his boundless mercies to her and to her gospel
                                companions. Parallel with this was the experience that Jesus passed through while on his
                                gospel mission. At the same time that he was exhorting his followers to maintain their
                                integrity in God, and promising them an hundred-fold for every sacrifice that they would
                                make, he also gave them to understand that as a selfish man and in the accumulation of
                                private property, he had not where to lay his head. The members of a Christian Community
                                can readily understand the position which Jesus occupied in the forming of his little
                                family of Believers. There is not the least doubt but that every phase of selfishness
                                was manifested in them, that had previously occupied their minds. It was the conversion
                                to a great work and to a wonderful experience in practical self-denial for Peter,
                                Andrew, John, James and others to give all they possessed into the common treasury, that

                                and brought out that beautiful and oft-repeated saying which is so .imperfectly
                                understood. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one
                                for another." In fact there was no other way to know it. Whoever reads the history of
                                Peter and John and James and Judas would wonder how such diverse dispositions could ever
                                harmonize with each other. They were emphatically, the men of the world, while their
                                love for themselves was above all other considerations, and it was only by having this
                                love one for another that their Christianity could be determined. Can we not as a
                                Community learn from this, a lesson that may be of value in our Community life ? Shall
                                we be any better known as the disciples of Jesus the Christ, than the world at large
                                unless we manifest a Christian love and union for each other ?</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="How blest to dwell..." TEIform="index"/>How blest to dwell...

                                entire Order, of desire to enter upon a work of self-examination and expurgation of all
                                that is contrary to our principles and hinders our spiritual growth and usefulness
                                Conditions are in many respects at the present time, unsatisfactory, but there is no
                                cause for alarm. Ours has always been a progressive gospel, there is more wisdom, love
                                and virtue among us, as a people to-day, than at any previous period of our history,
                                with a stronger confidence in the value and importance of our mission and a deeper
                                realization of our responsibility. The power that has inspired and sustained us
                                hitherto, will still succour, guide and deliver, as we are individually prepared to take
                                up the cress and move forward in the light of the present day. The call to us is, "Be ye
                                therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect." This will be a long travel
                                but the end of our faith will be the salvation of our souls. It was suggested some time
                                ago, that yearly, or every two years, a Convention be held to discuss and advise upon
                                points of doctrine and practice. Has the idea dropped? Something needs to be done to
                                engage the interest and enlist the enthusiasm of the progressive minds among us. Our
                                good Sisters, Ann Offord and Catherine Allen have been away from home a little over two

                                company of our Sisters recently spent three pleasant days with Church family Sisters
                                picking blue huckleberries on the mountain. They gathered five bushels. The berries were
                                much appreciated, but the gospel union between the families, was better than berries.
                                The last day they went up to "Holy Mount" where many a gospel meeting has been held, and

                                The homes of Believers are much appreciated as training schools for the young. We have

                                our efforts seem to be in comparison. We can at least be thankful to be counted worthy

                                Although arisen, they are still ministering angels, and their blessing is descending
                                upon the faithful ones in this the time of Zion's great need. We are having our first
                                experience in a contest with that persistent foe to the gardener,�quack. It reminds one
                                of the struggle with the elementary forces of the soul in the effort to bring them under

                                action. In our more than twenty years experience gardening, the most effectual means
                                that we have found to combat that pest, the cut worms, has been in late fall plowing.

Jesus said, "If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up
                                his cross and follow me." How plain the injunction, and how pleasing it should be when
                                we know that bearing the cross will ensure eternal life. To be a true crossbearer
                                requires a crucifixion of all sinful elements. By the cross salvation is free. The true

                                Mother Ann Lee, the founder Oi this Church, landed in America with her little band of
                                eight followers, after a most perilous voyage in an old, leaky and condemned ship. This
                                voyage of nearly three months was taken consequent on special revelation; a revelation
                                confirmed by signs, visions and extraordinary manifestations to individual members of
                                the, then little Church in England as well as to Mother Ann herself. During a storm on

                                The opening address was a graceful statement of the anniversary celebrated, and stated
                                that "It afforded a fitting opportunity to renew vows of consecration to the noble cause
                                espoused by every grateful member, to exalt the integrity of purpose which enabled 'Our

                                cross, one sacrifice enables whosoever will to find one brotherhood, one family tie,
                                even a spiritual home for soul and body. Those who are blest to associate as Brothers
                                and Sisters in the virgin order, which is the legitimate fruit of the revelation of God
                                through Mother, have a debt of gratitude to render for sacred protection and liberty,
                                which no others can conceive. Its beauty and blessing have opened to our youthful minds
                                to such a degree that with bowed heads we would repeat, 'Let us be there with the holy
                                in heart.' We are not hero worshipers in any sense of the word. We trust in no arm of
                                flesh, but in that Christ we have unlimited confidence which spoke through Jesus of
                                Nazareth, giving to the world as much of truth as it was prepared to receive, and which
                                was opened afresh and finally perfected through the agency of Mother Ann as a mouthpiece
                                and represented through her personality. Only for this sacred feature connected with the
                                journey, the landing of Ann Lee on the shores of America would be an event of no more
                                moment to us, than the landing of hundreds of women before and since that memorable day.
                                That she was English born, is too insignificant to claim thought, but that the Spirit
                                breathed into her soul and that she conceived, thereby, a purely unselfish mission, to
                                which she was ever faithful is beyond all praise and above all criticism. Even this
                                little 'Centennial Band' have life to-day from the faithfulness of parents in the seen
                                and unseen worlds. We have a peaceful, happy home, blest with more than the essential
                                comforts of life. But best of all, below, above and beyond all for which we give thanks
                                to-day, is the knowledge of Mother Ann's Christian mission, which lias opened its arms
                                as a warm-hearted father and mother to this band of daughters, enabling us, if we
                                choose, to stand in Gospel relation equal with our Brothers, to attempt the full cross
                                and win and wear the full crown." The programme consisted of the choicest offerings of
                                singing, recitation and dialogues. The "Twelve Christian Virtues" were an interesting
                                and most telling item. A paper on "Confession" was read, treating of that most important
                                duty from a comprehensive, spiritual and thoughtful view. The meeting claimed the
                                highest approval and appreciation from the Brethren and Sisters who were invited to the
                                celebration, as it has endeared the younger members of the household to their older
                                friends in, let us hope, an indissoluble tie of Gospel love and union. Albert Evans.

The temperate zone seems to have overstepped its boundaries and strayed into
                                the tropical regions, as the mercury in the past few days has reached the altitude of
                                one-hundred degrees in the shade. The earth in our section is extremly parched and a

                                we were visited by another violent thunder shower accompanied by hail, and unusually
                                sharp lightning. Fortunately our home was preserved from any direful effects, but it was
                                found necessary to replace several broken window panes. On one of our small farms lying
                                just over the line in the town of Richmond, is a field of six acres of sweet corn which
                                was totally destroyed. It swept with terrific force through the section just south of
                                us, laying waste everything in its path. Many of our neighbors in that vicinity suffered
                                the loss of nearly all their crops. The following day was Sunday and proved to be a most
                                propitious one, as a company of angel visitants, still in earth form came over from Mt.

                                in the weather last night which was very agreeable, it being cool and pleasant this
                                morning, but very dry. Since our last "jSTotes" we have gathered a family of children,
                                or rather a part of it, three girls and a boy. We would much rather gather adults

Richard went his usual rounds of duty. On returning to the house he
                            said, "I feel just as I do not want to feel. I am much exhausted but perhaps a little rest
                            will bring me out all right." He walked out again in the p. m. The physician who was called
                            entertained hopes of his recovery. The Doctor came again at evening, but his symptoms were
                            worse. On Sunday morning at 4 o'clock, the physician was again summoned and then said that
                            he was beyond all mortal aid. It was pronounced to be heart disease, combined with
                            peritonitis. The Church were in the morning service, but soon after meeting received word
                            that life was fast passing away. At 1 p. m. all was over, and the sad word was sudden and
                            unexpected to many in the Society. Sister Margarett had left us just twelve hours previous,
                            but we had been expecting her departure and were better prepared. The funeral of our two
                            gospel friends was held on Monday at 3 o'clock p. m. at the Church family. Several friends,
                            not of our Order, attended the services, and sympathized with us in our bereavement. Shaker

                            withereth and the flower thereof falleth away." We are often reminded of this important
                            fact, but seldom so forcibly as on the present occasion. One of our little company,
                            anxiously awaited the summons to "come up higher," not considering death the dread messenger
                            many supposed it to be, but a birth into spiritual life; neither did she wish to evade the
                            duties and responsibilities of earth-life. She cheerfully labored and vvhen unable to do
                            more, sought to be as little care as possible. We were prepared for this change, but not so
                            with our much needed, faithful Brother, who but a few days since was apparently in the prime
                            of activity, performing the many duties encumbent on one of his marked ability. It hardly
                            need be said that our Brother possessed talent and strength of character rarely met with,
                            one of the few who had the courage of his convictions and dared to meet them with friend or
                            foe, fearless and undaunted in any emergency, never s werving from what to him seemed right.
                            He was possessed with a kind, sympathetic nature and won many friends who will sadly miss
                            his genial smile and cheerful greetings. Even the least child grew to expect some pleasant
                            remark when Br. Richard passed by. Even while in earth-life, he had a foretaste of the
                            powers of the world to come. Only one short week since he was with us to mingle his voice in

                            life of usefulness, counting no sacrifice too great that would enable her to gain complete
                            victory over worldly elements, and their existing influences, possessing a kind, benevolent
                            disposition which won many friends. My acquaintance with her has been pleasant and
                            profitable but my loss, is her gain. Her freed spirit can rejoice and she will hear the
                            welcome, "Well done, good and faithful servant." She was prepared to meet the change, which
                            seemed so long in coming, but it is well with her now. Days and weeks are swiftly passing,
                            saying as they go, "improve us, for these opportunities will never return." Should we not be
                            deeply impressed on such occasions and moralize upon the inevitable condition? Without
                            gospel vision, we should fail to see why so many hopes and purposes, lay waste, and so many
                            fields whose precious harvests we long to gather are not ours. May we not open the volume of
                            inspiration and read, "Vanity of vanities." The highest ideal of life includes the assurance
                            that it is eternal. For what shall it profit us if we gain the whole world, and yet come
                            short of the everlasting prize. Is there not a power delegated to those who are determined
                            to live a life of holiness and power in its richest and fullest extent, to conquer the man
                            of sin? We often lament our poor ability to work out the noble purposes of a spiritual mind.
                            The indwelling of the Spirit purifies both thoughts and expressions and the whole being is
                            elevated and sanctified. The mind that acts in harmony with the spirit, is lighted with
                            peace, which kindles every feature, expressive of joyful emotion and thus it will be when
                            the spiritual body comes forth from God's crucible purified from all dross. Hark! what is
                            this I hear! one more transition to the other sphere, a brother has been suddenly called
                            from the shores of time. "In the midst of life, we are in death!" One moment in the
                            confidence of perfect security, the next beyond the reach of struggle. How can we
                            short-sighted mortals solve the problem. The summons must be obeyed and although their loss
                            in our midst is deeply felt and lamented, are we not carried along on the strong wings of
                            faith? "Be ye also ready" is the voice of the Spirit. "Thy will be done." After the somber
                            shades of night Cometh the welcome morning light After the saddest notes of pain Cometh a
                            higher, sweeter strain, Cometh a strength, steadfast sure, Cometh a peace which shall
                            endure. After the cross so patiently borne Waiteth the crown to be royally worn Hope sweet

                                trust we will never permit its monthly visitation to cease to visit each household, when
                                it does such valuable missionary work, in sowing seeds of truth. There is a great
                                controversy in churches as to which is the true mode of baptism, claiming that without
                                water baptism, we are eternally lost. Paul in his epistle to the Galatians 111- T 27,
                                says,�"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ." This
                                is plain, that if we "walk even as he (Jesus) walked we are baptized with the true
                                baptism, water being simply a sign to link the dispensation of John's baptism to
                                Christ's baptism.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Bellmire, W. W." TEIform="persName"/>W. W.

                                phrenological description of the Earl of Aberdeen, the new Viceroy of Canada, leads in
                                the August number of the Phrenological Journal and Science of Health, while the textual
                                matter is noteworthy. Following this a graphic article on the importance of
                                phrenological information to the managers of public institutions will arrest close
                                attention because written by Mr. Stead, the editor of Review of Reviews. An elaborate
                                delineation of Ella Wheeler Wilcox, from an examination, accompanies a fine por trait of
                                that very well-known writer of poetry and story books. A profusely illustrated
                                discussion of the vital temperament forms the installment in the series on How to Study
                                Strangers, and an Analysis of Approbativeness on a fresh line of thought will impress
                                the reader. In the series of phrenological biographies two important names appear this
                                time, Dr. Coxe and Dr. Gleason, the latter of water cure fame. These biographies show
                                one feature sharply enough, that scientific men who were in advance of their fellows
                                readily accepted the teachings of Spurzheim and Combe. Several finely written articles
                                appear in the departments of Child Culture and Health the usefulness of which elicits
                                general notice and the wish that all the world could read them. Only 15 cents a number,

                                the Anti-Infidel Library, a series of brief, cheap, pointed pamphlets bearing on these
                                important questions. They have received the heartiest commendations from persons well
                                qualified to express an intelligent opinion on this subject. The first number of this
                                Library, containing "A Lecture on the Inspiration of the Bible," has had a circulation
                                of more than two million copies. Lord Shaftesbury, for more than thirty years president
                                of the British and Foreign Bible Society, used to order them by the thousand for
                                distribution among City Missionaries and outdoor preachers in London and England, Other
                                numbers have been widely scattered. Some 40 numbers have been issued, up to July 1893
                                which are sold at 5 to 10, 15, and 25 cents each and furnished for distribution at
                                reduced rates. This work appeals to all Christian and rightthinking men. The profits on
                                the sale of these publications do not warrant our expending money in advertizing them,
                                as we would gladly do. May we not take the liberty of asking Christian friends and
                                editors to help a work that is being done, under many difficulties, with limited
                                resources, by directing the attention of Christian people to these publications? H. L.

COMMENDED BY THE HIGHEST
AUTHORITY.
From Ex-President Hayes: "It is a valuable work. I have subscribed for two copies." Dr. Elliott Coues, author of "Birds
of the North-West," says: "It is a really
notable work." Prof. C. J. Maynard, author of the "Birds of Eastern North America,'' says; "Contains the best pictures of
the species which I have ever seen."
Dr. J. S. Newberry, President Academy
of Sciences, says: "The work is accurately
and tastefully prepared, and I take pleasure in recommending it as the most attractive popular exposition of our ornithology yet given to the public."
From Prof. Wm, D. Hornaday, Taxidermist, N. 8. National Museum:
"I have carefully compared the figures
in "The Birds of North America,' with
those in Audubon's great work, and am
free to say that they are more accurate in
outline as well as more faithfully colored
to nature."
"A careful examination of this beautiful
work has given me much pleasure. Indeed, it is a great gift to those who love
the study of Ornithology."
