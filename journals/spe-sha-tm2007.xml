                            OF THE CHURCH OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 13.</head><p TEIform="p">In 1806 blue coats and vests began to give place to the steel-mixed, and this
                            latter was adopted as the uniform color. Among the reasons for discontinuing the "blue" was
                            partly on account of the expense of the Indigo, and the labor of making the garments.
                            Trowsers for winter use were made of woolen cloth or of serge. For summer, Sabbath uniform,
                            the trowsers were of linen or checked cotton, blue and white. Garments for manual labor were
                            generally of tow cloth. Another radical change was made in 1810 when the gray was laid aside
                            and the coats and vests were made of drab-colored cloth. The form of the coat was also
                            changed quite essentially. The double folds of the skirt were set aside, and a single fold
                            adopted. The front edge was cut more circling, and fell back at the bottom of the skirt,
                            some four inches. The pocket lids of the coats and vests instead of being cut with two
                            scallops and leaving a point in the center, were cut with a curve on the lower, parallel
                            with the upper edge. A collar of about one and one-half inches wide, was added to the coat.
                            This was made upright. Over this was a cape that extended to the edge of the shoulder. All
                            the buttons and button-holes were now omitted, and for the fastenings of the coat in front,
                            two or three pairs of "hooks and eyes" were substituted. The vests were cut shorter in
                            front, and the skirts reduced to correspond more closely with the height of the person,
                            which made the medium length about seven inches. By adopting the use of suspenders a slight
                            change was made in the form of the trowsers, which had been, to this date, so formed at the
                            waist as to hold themselves in place without any other aid. Shoe buckles were laid aside,
                            and strings of leather or cloth were used instead. For several years the trowsers for
                            uniform on the Sabbath in summer were colored with nutgall, but in 1820 these gave place to
                            garments made of cotton, striped blue and white. In 1832, the drab vest, which had been
                            largely in use since 1810, was partially displaced by the introduction of a fine blue. While
                            this color was<pb n="146" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> generally used in the summer, the drab was
                            retained for use in the winter. Blue seems to have been a favorite color for summer, and in
                            1854 they obtained a delicate, fine article of light blue, that was of foreign manufacture.
                            For winter use the blue was laid aside in 1840 and drab was established as the uniform color
                            for vests, and continued to be used till 1854, when blue was again introduced. From 1813 to
                            1840 the surtouts and great coats were made of drab-colored cloth, manufactured by the
                            Society, then a finer quality of cloth was purchased and used till 1847 when a steel-mixed
                            again was introduced. THE FORM OF DRESS WORN BY WOMEN AT THE DATE OF THE ORGANIZATION of the
                            Society. Many persons wore short gowns with short sleeves. These were made of light-colored,
                            striped cotton. The stripes went around the sleeves, but lengthwise on the body of the
                            dress. The waist extended to the hips, while the dress reached a few inches below the knees.
                            For more common use the short gowns reached only some eight or ten inches below the waist.
                            Over the dress in front, was worn a checked apron, about one and one half yards wide, cut
                            circling at the top and gathered to about two feet in width. A white binding of an inch went
                            across the upper edge which terminated in white tape-strings that were tied in front with a
                            double bow. These aprons were an inch shorter than the dress or about two inches from the
                            floor. Homespun linen was largely used till the year 1800, when the Sisters learned to card
                            and spin fine cotton, and were able to manufacture their own dresses, aprons and kerchiefs.
                            The extended dress, or dress worn under the short gown, was generally black and fell to
                            within one inch of the floor. After several years the black was partially laid aside and
                            garments of blue were introduced. In 1811, the long outer dresses were adopted for summer
                            and winter use, by all classes. Black silk shoulder kerchiefs were worn for many years, when
                            they gave place to fine, white lawn or linen, that were manufactured in the Society. In 1818
                            drab colored silk neck kerchiefs were used. Subsequently, some very beautiful silk kerchiefs
                            were made by the Believers in the western and southern states. For winter use the dress
                            reached quite to the floor. These were made with two box plaits in the rear part of the
                            skirt, and from these single plaits, of one-half inch in width, extended to a line from
                            under the arm, where they met the plaits from the front part of the dress. The waist of
                            these dresses extended several inches below the natural waist, and ended in a point on the
                            back. Under the dress was a bodice, agreeably to the prevailing custom. These were abandoned
                            in 1811. The sleeves 'ended just below the elbow, and were supplemented by plaited cuffs.
                            Blue and white checked aprons were largely used and blue cotton neck kerchiefs ; these last
                            were finished with two or three white borders, about<pb n="147" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/>
                            three-eighths wide and one-half inch apart. On the head the Sisters wore a fine lawn or
                            linen cap. They were formed by plaiting and gathering, to adjust them to the head. These
                            were trimmed in front with a border of open-work, one inch wide. Tape was passed through the
                            back hem of the cap, and brought forward, then over the head, and return to terminate in a
                            bow knot behind. Muslin was used in the Society in 1806 and made into caps, and also into
                            kei'chiefs. Collars with a cape attached were worn in 1810, but previous to this date the
                            neck kerchief only was used. Girls on accepting a head-dress have generally arranged the
                            hair under a net woven for that purpose. The form of the caps changed quite essentially in
                            1819. A border in front of about three inches in width, made of leno, was attached to the
                            cap and considered very beneficial.

                            Throughout the universe of mind and matter we see this law operating. Whatsoever communities
                            or individuals sow, that they must reap.' To be able to predict that if a man sow wheat he
                            will reap wheat would not be considered wonderful; but to highly spiritualized minds the
                            gift of prophecy or discernment is as plainly understood. The law of cause and effect comes
                            in operation, this law is so vast in extent of time when the whole race of man is considered
                            that only the most prophetic minds are able to discern its uufoldment. Witness the evolution
                            of the race that was necessary before the one that we rejoice to call Mother could bring to
                            the understanding of man a realization of the truth of her mission. But centuries before,
                            prophetic souls peering into the future of the race as the astronomer is able to view the
                            formation of worlds, declared, (in the coming time,) there would be a wonder in the earth,
                            "a woman shall compass a man." The discordant elements in the human soul by their din have
                            silenced for a time the ever present voice that is telling them that "not in the earthquake
                            or thunder do we realize the highest unfolding of the spirit, but in the still small voice."
                            Up the hill of progression humanity is toiling, not by direct ascent, but by a circuitous
                            route coming at times almost to the point of starting but a little higher. This accounts for
                            the apparent retrogression of the race, but not so, the soul enshrouded in darkness is
                            constantly striving for the light. The dark ages when science in Europe was almost smothered
                            by the false ideas of life that prevailed at the time, was a struggle of the races to reach
                            a higher vantage ground. It was the earthquake and the thunder that appalled and fascinated
                            ; the voice of science was then heard but feebly, until out of the discordant elements there
                            was evolved better conditions for its unfoldment. Witness the intense<pb n="148" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> activity that is displayed in all branches of material improvement; since
                            the dawn of history such rapid strides have not taken place as in the last one hundred
                            years. We are now commencing an era of spiritual unfoldment of the race, those illuminated
                            souls that through prayer and labor laid the foundations of the spiritual temple firm and
                            strong, and passed on to spirit life, are now compensated for their labors. They are still
                            with us though unseen, ministering angels bearing the record of truth to souls who have left
                            the decaying forms of lifeless theology, and are reaching out in prayer for power to live
                            more acceptably to the holy spirit. We are not as a forlorn hope struggling against forces
                            that are overcoming us, but as an "army with banners" we are marching on, with an assurance
                            that truth will eventually triumph over error. We are thankful to be counted worthy to be
                            one of the least of those who have given all, even their own life that they may inherit a
                            home in the resurrection and prove to the world the superiority of that spiritual
                            relationship where as Brothers and Sisters we can enjoy sweet and holy communion, enshrouded
                            in peace, and where naught that defileth or maketh a lie can enter upon God's holy mountain.

                            holds the heart in error's way, And chills its vital tide. There's a blight on our fruitless
                            earth to-day It is the blight of sin, The buds of promise fade away, And die as they begin.
                            There's murder abroad in our land to-day, In many a princely hall, Where blasting, cursed
                            infanticide Prepares the mother's pall. There are mingled sounds on earth to-day Of Science
                            and Reform, Like waves that fret their rocky way, They herald in the storm. Alone is Zion
                            bright to-day, She gleams amid the gloom, To her shall earth its tribute pay, To her the
                            Lord has come. Far down beneath the elements That curse the earth to-day, The angel of
                            repentance sent With speed shall make his way. Be joyful, sorrowing heart of man Though
                            still in nature's tomb, There are but few more shadows Before thy hope shall come. Mt.

                            ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
                            ohveyards which ye planted 'not do ye eat. Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in
                            sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of
                            the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the
                            Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served
                            that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in who�e land ye
                            divell; But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Joshua, xxiv., 13. The question
                            arises, is not the above text literally true in this present day and generation, and does
                            not history here repeat itself ? There is a large number of us in the different families who
                            were adopted in childhood by the Society, and many at mature age. Do we not occupy lands for
                            which we did not labor ? Do we not dwell in houses that we built not, and eat the fruit of
                            vines that we planted not? and in taking upon us the apparel and name of Shaker do we not
                            assume a character that is well known and accepted throughout the world as a synonym of
                            honesty, justice and square dealing which personally we had not earned? these facts I think
                            will be readily admitted. Then there is certaiuly a great and heavy responsibility resting
                            upon all, that we make a wise and judicious use of those treasures which we have come into
                            possession of, and only hold in trust for those who are to succeed us, that by no neglect or
                            carelessness, we waste or criminally squander the heritage of the Lord, but be adding
                            thereto. If by causing two blades of grass to grow where only one grew before, the race is
                            benefitted, how much more to be commended are they who add to the consecrated inheritance,
                            consecrated by the toils, labors and lives of those workers in the vineyard who have gone to
                            their reward. Yet of far greater importance it is that by no word, act or deed we in anywise
                            lower the high standard of honesty and truth bequeathed to us by the lives and stern
                            integrity of the founders of this Order. Then I would say let no one be ashamed to don the
                            uniform and earnestly accept the profession and life of a true Shaker. Jesus said, whosoever
                            shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him also shall the son of man be ashamed, when he
                            cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. We should at all times fear the Lord
                            and serve him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods of this world, which are the
                            lusts of the flesh and of the mind, which if any man love, the love of the Father is not in
                            him. Let every soul take heed and not wait halting between two opinions, but this day choose
                            whom ye will serve, and may the choice of everyone be, "As for me and my house, we will
                            serve the Lord. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            holding the so-termed "Consecrated property of Believers," by the employing of so much help
                            from the world. As I see it, this practice prevails to such an extent in some Societies, as
                            to place the Brethren and Sisters in the minority. Only a few more years of this mode of
                            management, and who will be the legal owners of this Consecrated Property ? Echo answers,
                            Who? I cannot be reasoned into the belief that this is the right way to merit the prosperity
                            and blessing that is promised those who forsake the earthly order and come into the
                            spiritual relation of Brethren and Sisters in Christ's kingdom. Are not the Believers of the
                            present day drifting away from the proper appropriation of the property that was consecrated
                            and dedicated by the founders of our institution, designed to become the inheritance of
                            those seeking to become the true followers of Christ and Mother Ann? Some one has affirmed,
                            and most truthfully too, I claim, that the more hired help a family or Society employ, the
                            fewer will be the genuine Believers ; and why not, if "Hands to work and hearts to God" is
                            the cherished motto of the truly consecrated members of the virgin order? No thinking,
                            reasoning mind can deny the assertion, that depending on hirelings to the extent that some
                            of our Societies at the present time are doing, has a growing tendency to create indolence
                            on the part of the members, and with it a train of evils, which surely cannot aid in
                            bringing out those qualities of mind which characterize the true Believer ; or in other
                            words, the genuine Shaker. Hence, arises the query, Whither are we drifting ? Will some one

                            that seemed to sound in my ears when all else was hushed in the silence of night. Could I
                            refuse, and thus wound a spirit I so deeply loved ? Her mortal lips were sealed in death ;
                            but her soul, triumphing over physical pain, rejoiced in a glad release. For twenty years it
                            has been my privilege to be associated with our dear Sister, and I fully appreciate the
                            virtues and excellencies of her beautiful character. A strong bond of love and I friendship
                            united us closely in spirit, and though the years of her earthly pilgrimage far outnumbered
                            mine, still there has always existed a mutual feeling of sympathy, good-will and pleasant
                            companionship. Perhaps it would not be amiss to mention a little circumstance that took
                            place about eighteen years ago, as an, explanation of my especial regard for her. I was then
                            a child, and my plastic mind readily "eceived indelible impressions. There chanced to be
                            quite a company of Sisters together, when some unpleasant occurrence<pb n="151" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> served to agitate the feelings ; on the impulse of the moment she spoke
                            hastily and unwisely. I took no notice of it as I was not especially concerned. Shortly
                            after when I retired for the night, Sister Olive entered the room, and bending over me,
                            whispered; "My dear child, I have come to tell you how very wrong it was for me to speak as
                            I did this evening: I condemn it, and ask your forgiveness for so doing. I would not set you
                            a bad example, and will be more guarded in the future." I cannot tell how many, many times
                            that one act of self-condemnation has since recurred to my mind, always bringing with it a
                            feeling of admiration and respect. Since that time I have always cherished a deep, undying
                            love and affection for her; it also taught me a lesson for life, that my actions whether
                            virtuous or evil�especially in the presence of children�had an influence either for good or
                            harm, and I realized the responsibility resting upon me to guard well my words and ways, and
                            strive always to impart the good that returns in blessing. Shall we wait until the shroud
                            and pall remind us of their departure ere we eulogize our friends ? Commendation is sweet to
                            the living, and spoken praise drops like a jewel in the heart's treasure-casket. All knew
                            her but to love and cherish her self-sacrifice, devotion, patience, humility and purity of
                            heart; we prized and extolled her active and expansive goodness of life, and knew that even
                            in her trial and suffering, her consideration of others, curbed every selfish desire and
                            needless wish. Two days before Sister Olive's demise I called to see her, and returned
                            thanks for many kindnesses received, and spoke of the blessing her righteous example had
                            been to me: It seemed like being in the presence of an angel. When I am called to put off
                            the mortal, I shall ask no greater boon, than to be ushered into the great and glorious
                            beyond with as rightful a recommend as our dear Sister has to-day. Surely blessing follows
                            the righteous, and peace is their everlasting inheritance. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            sick, curing lepers, opening the eyes of the blind, making the deaf to hear, the lame to
                            walk, the tongue of the dumb to speak, receiving sinners, and preaching the Gospel to the
                            poor, we have a most beautiful picture of true greatness. The selfish man sees greatness
                            only in high places, and he seeks high places as the way to greatness. He has the idea that
                            to be chief among his brethren, they must wait upon him; to be exalted he must be haughty
                            and proud and look with scorn upon those who are just as good, but whose rank, of talent and
                            natural acquirements place them below him in name, but who practice more rigid self-denial
                            than their exalted brother. But all this is clearly reversed in the kingdom of God. Here the
                            prince is he who serves, the exalted, he who<pb n="152" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> humbles
                            himself ; the chief est of all is the servant of all. Jesus said, "Whosoever will be great
                            among you shall be jour minister, and whosoever will be chief est, shall be servant of all."
                            From the many lessons given by the humble Savior we find that he who wishes to be
                            Christ-like, may always find occasion and opportunity to increase his humility; he can
                            always find some one whom he can serve by a kind deed, a timely word or a sympathizing
                            prayer, and in so doing he finds that humility leads to honor, and that service is the sure

                            divine service with them at the Square House, I heard Father James say, You must love God
                            with all your heart, might, mind and strength. At another time Mother Ann informed me that
                            when she lived in the wilderness at Watervliet, she aided the Brethren all she could while
                            they cleared the land. I gained a deep love for Mother, and yet I feared her, for she was
                            filled with indignation against all evil, and I knew she could see me through and through."
                            Father James remarked ;� "No one will find fault with the way of God who is in it, while

                            much that is instructive in the "Covenant" and the life of Mother Ann is very interesting.
                            In searching fOr truths, especially for spiritual truths, one has to remove an immense

                            present. I cannot prevent the effect of the wrongs of yesterday and can only take care of
                            to-day. Brother, distance lends enchantment ; that good place we wish to reach is always in
                            the distance. I was born in Westmoreland Co., Pa., and have crossed the continent two and
                            one half times. When I have left places to get rid of disadvantages, others have met me in
                            the new place, and my condition has often been made worse. My present opinion is this : that
                            the good place is where we are cop tented, having a good degree of health and enough of this
                            world's goods to supply our daily wants. If life is spared, I intend to leave Louisiana and
                            go farther north. As to the disadvantages of the southern country, their name is legion. One
                            has to be here, to see and to realize them. I close, wishing you well.

                            Successive seasons in their course appear, But go, before we hardly know they're here. The
                            summer fled and autumn soon was gone, And rigid winter now comes rushing on, His loud, rude
                            blasts now sweep from shore to shore, And hail us with their wild, unwelcome roar. The
                            warring elements seem all at strife, To banish comfort from the stage of life; A mantle cold
                            enwraps both hill and plain, And one vast scene of desolation reigns. The fleeting seasons
                            in their rapid course. Conviction pour with unremitting force. They seem a mirror in which I
                            trace, How short this life, this sublunary space. Then to the youth I say, learn to be wise;
                            Improve each moment as it passing flies ; To labor now while it is said To-day, The chance

                            waited in suspense To see destruction's flaming sword unsheath, The awful mysteries of
                                Providence.<pb n="154" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> All things terrestrial cringed and swayed
                            Within the balance of his just decree, The Almighty fiat could not be delayed, Its
                            consummation all would quickly see. The Lord of hosts would in the heavens appear, To judge
                            the living and to raise the dead, The myriad throng of all the ages hear, Their doom by the
                            recording angel read. A fearful apprehension seized the mind; The hours were numbered, and
                            as criminals wait The final moment unto death assigned, Souls seemed transfixed in horror of
                            their fate. When came the last day of the triple mines, The madness had attained its dizzy
                            height, Imagination drew her sable lines Across the gleaming brow of morning bright. Palsied
                            the arm of toil in busy marts, Deserted all the market places stood, Farm, field, and home
                            of loving kindred hearts Were voiceless as the lonely solitude. No social meal was spread,
                            no lighted fires, On household hearth gave out their cheerful glow. No gleam of hope the
                            weary watch inspires, Or lights with joy the somber shades of woe. With faces blanched men
                            met, nor even spoke Their hearts were chilled and warped with doubt and pain, An answering
                            stare each others eyes invoke, The import terrible to them was plain. Stillness profound
                            enwrapped all things, save when In churches met a grave and cheerless throng, Where every
                            aisle and transept echoed prayer, Or caught the notes of penitential song. Those who had
                            never sought Religion's shrine Fled to her courts as to a citadel, And with the faithful
                            asked for aid divine, Their keen remorse and terror to dispel. That day and night�on
                            watchfulness intent� No eye was closed, but all the vigil kept, Each knee in humble
                            suppliance was bent. Entreatingly by turns men prayed and wept. No clocks were found in
                            tower, or house or halls, But burning tapers marked the hour's round, And hold suspended
                            little metal balls Which full at intervals with solemn sound. Dread fear intensified, each
                            moment hath When a brief space of time remains between Life's certain end and God's
                            impending wrath That draws the curtain on each earthly scene. * * * * But mercy is the
                            Lord's ; revenge and hate Are the crude offspring of untutored minds, God rules by law, the
                            schemes of chance and fate The progress of his trutli can never bind. Lo! in the east the
                            beams of morning broke, And on the pallid watchers shed their light, A newborn century in
                            glory woke, And superstition vanished with the night. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            small affair ; but life is made up of small things. The man who goes through life constantly
                            saving in little ways finally possesses considerable property. It is constancy, that ensures
                            success and the want of it brings failure. If we attempt to cultivate a field, and hoe one
                            day and then rest off a while the weeds get the better of us. We shall all find the same
                            experience spiritually. We must keep at the work of gaining a little every day. "Grain by
                            grain" may be a very slow process but if the grains are of gold a man would find himself
                            rich who had patiently accumulated them; and the Christian meets the same result.

TEIform="index"/> WHAT IS CHRISTIANITY?</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Thomas, Ida A." TEIform="persName"/>Ida A. Thomas.</byline><p TEIform="p">True Christianity is self-denial. What is self-denial? It is the denying one's
                            self of all those things that are self-pleasing to the natural man or woman Christianity
                            combines all virtue and all virtue springs from selfdenial. All are prone to err, yet by
                            daily striving to overcome the evil of our nature we are gaining, be it ever so little at a
                            time, control of the lower nature. No human being was ever born into the world perfect, as
                            we all inherit that game nature, some under more favorable circumstances than others, still
                            the same nature controls all. Then it remains with each individual especially those with
                            enlightened minds, those that have felt and prov?d the goodness of God, to make themselves
                            fit receptacles for true Christian virtue by subduing the natural will and being governed
                            and guided by God's holy law. Truly we have not the right to our own personality for that
                            belongs to God, unless in consecration we yield in obedience to his laws. Are we not
                            dependent on our Maker for our very existence? Man could not make a spear of grass or a
                            grain of corn grow without the goodness of God, and we would not know how to appreciate his
                            goodness if we were not endowed with intelligence which gives us the understanding of these
                            things. God indeed is great and mighty, his blessings are bestowed on all humanity. Think of
                            the liberality, the justness and the mighty power of his understanding. God's ways are the
                            ways of wisdom. But you say we never see God. But oh! how often are we in his presence and
                            little do we know or feel the power of his mighty judgment. Only as we knowingly and
                            understandingly come before Him at the throne of grace and lay the burden of our souls
                            before Him, can we feel the great power of his love. Seemingly in a worldly sense God is
                            forgotten in our prosperity and we stop not to consider whence cometh all these blessings.
                            But it is in affliction's dark hour that our sense is turned to God in prayer for
                            deliverance. It is then God directs and points the way saying, "all ye that are weary and
                            heavy laden come unto me and I will bring peace and rest to your souls" In affliction God is
                            with us as in prosperity, we are made to feel it if we draw nigh unto Him in prayer for He
                            is our surest and truest friend. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            thoughtless youth, in. answer to a gentle reminder that she had carelessly repeated a
                            message, misstating the time and thus causing an hour's delay in the appointment of a very
                            important conference. A trifle !�so it was in the common acceptance of the term, and the
                            tiny words pass flippantly from lip to lip. Let us pause a moment and define the term. A
                            trifle may be considered one of the unequal parts into which life indirectly may be divided.
                            As the seashore is but an accumulation of grains, so life is a vast multitude of trifles. A
                            slight exaggeration in conversation is but a trifling matter, an unkind word is easily
                            uttered, yet the effect is by no means slight, for "in the Divine Economy nothing is lost."
                            The tongue which "cannot be tamed" in the minutiae of life is unfit for the service of God.
                            The value of seeming trifles rests with the Creator of time ; our duty is to improve them as
                            though each were the last. The contribution of a tiny coral polyp is but a speck beneath the
                            deep waters. Slowly, yet surely, the additions are made, until the beautiful atolls and
                            reefs, the wonder of the southern seas, rise to view. So it is in our experiences. Life is
                            but the multiplication of one moment and character, the accumulation of good or evil to
                            which the moments give birth. How often we read and sorrow over the railway aee'eit i.ts and
                            fir.'S which occasion so fearful a loss of life and property. We enquire the cause. A
                            lighted match incautiously thrown down, or one person away from his post of duty, we are
                            told. Mere trifles in themselves,� yet hundreds of lives pass from our midst in consequence.
                            Applicable and true are the words of St. James, "Behold how great a matter a little fire
                            kindleth." "The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts," is an axiom well proved. The
                            individual who is true in the trifles of life, is true in the ultimate, and "he who is
                            unfaithful in the least is unfaithful also in much." Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In remembrance of eldress Harriet Storer" TEIform="index"/> In Remembrance of

                                        This cannot be too much depiecated. Carpets, like curtains, are mere dirt-traps,
                                        which become loaded with filth of every description. This is abundantly proved
                                        when a carpet is swept, and the dust allowed to settle on all the articles in
                                        the room. Such dust, if examined, will be found to consist of dried mud, chiefly
                                        granite or wood, but also containing every description of vegetable and animal
                                        impurities. When raised by walking about a room, it is a common cause of "colds"
                                        and bronchitis. In addition, as it consists largely of organic matter, it
                                        produces a close smell, and contaminates the entering air. The substitution of a
                                        central carpet for one covering the entire floor, is a great improvement, the
                                        floor around the carpet being covered with parquet veneering; or, if the expense
                                        of this be too great, the whole floor may be painted with four good coats of
                                        dark oil paint, and varnished, the joints of the boards having first been made
                                        secure. The carpet should be easily removable, in order that it and the floor
                                        may be thoroughly cleansed at intervals. Rugs will be found even better, since
                                        they may be taken up and shaken every day, if necessary. In bedrooms, the less
                                        carpet the better. Good Chinese or Indian matting is strongly recommended
                                        instead, as it does not retain the dust and other impurities which become fixed
                                        in the woolly texture of a carpet.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Good health" TEIform="index"/>Good Health.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="crops" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="A little kerosene poured into the heart of a burdock or thistle..."

                            </head><p TEIform="p">The followers of Jesus can do no better than to learn of him who has said,
                                "Come unto me all ye that are weary and I will give you rest." His life work among men
                                is well defined and his words are simple and easy to be understood. No better foundation
                                for "peace on earth" can be laid than wras enunciated by him, in his sermon on the
                                mount. "Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness." Those who study,
                                anxiously, to do right toward all men, need have little fear of being left without a
                                sure guide, or the solace of the divine comforter. The extremely slow progress that has
                                been made in establishing the Christian principles on the earth, leads us to this
                                conclusion ;�that the millennial age, when the kingdoms of this world are to become the
                                kingdoms of our Lord, may be placed, very safely, in the far distant future. On this
                                point the Christianity of the churches, instead of representing the "sun of
                                righteousness" in whose light all may walk on toward God and be saved, rather invites
                                its hearers into a labyrinth which ultimately leads them to a theological mystery. Jesus
                                very plainly taught the principles which led to a Christian community, and then entered
                                into the practical workings of the order with those who became his disciples. Other
                                religious teachers had faintly anticipated the same form of society, and in harmony with
                                the light with which God had illumined their souls, worked for the good of humanity. A
                                remarkable instance of this will be found in the march of the Israelites from Egypt to
                                the land of Canaan. It is certainly one of the wonders of the age, and doubly so as it
                                occurred at such an early period of the history of man, The call that was extended to
                                the twelve who accompanied Jesus on his mission, is fully illustrated in the remarks he
                                made concerning himself. �"The son of man hath not where to lay his head." He had no
                                selfish home, nor any property with which to buy one. His little, wandering company of
                                twelve persons was the<pb n="159" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> first living Christian
                                community thathad ever been established. To encourage his hearers to enter into this
                                community, this kingdom of God among men, he promised them an hundred fold of earthly
                                gifts, and an assurance in the world to come of eternal life. There is also a
                                corresponding force in the life of Peter as he remarks,�"Behold we have left all to
                                follow thee," and although the promise is still based on the acceptance of this word,
                                "Except a man forsake all that he hath he cannot be tnj disciple," modern Christianity
                                passes lightly over it, and rests satisfied among the letters to the Corinthians. In the
                                work which inspires the brotherhood of man, we find more or less, the direct influence
                                of the life of Jesus as the Son of God. He accepted the growing light among men which
                                had been increasing for four thousand years, and clothing it wTith a more exalted
                                inspiration, it became most emphatically, the voice of God, through his beloved Son. It
                                was not only a system of religious belief but it embodied the beautiful principle of
                                goodness, which must be diffused in the world. The sons of Adam would become the sons of
                                God, and this new creation, the resurrection order, would include all who chose to
                                follow Christ in the regeneration. It is singular that many of the orders of Christians
                                and socialists and communists, assuming to be the followers of Jesus, still hold with
                                great tenacity to the selfish, generative order, which includes the whole of a worldly
                                life. Generation belongs wholly to the children of this world, but regeneration is the
                                doctrine of Jesus. The cultivation of the "vine of the earth," the relations of the
                                private family, is God's work in the natural order, while the "true vine" the family of
                                Christ, is God's work in the spiritual order. Christian socialism may harmonize with the
                                former plan, but Christian communism must find its relation with the latter. "Not where
                                to lay his head" is as potent now as it was in the primitive church. If all is dedicated
                                to God, stewards only can take charge of the Lord's goods, and although in this relation
                                they may possess an abundance of the blessings of this life, they can have no personal,
                                selfish claim on that which has been devoted to the church.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="national-news" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Bible in the schools" TEIform="index"/> THE BIBLE IN THE SCHOOLS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">A recent decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin declares the

                                last Sabbath afternoon. It was a beautiful day, and four lovely people from the North
                                Family came to the Sunny South to have a visit. Elder Frederick Evans our dear father
                                whom we love, and Br. Daniel Offord whom we respect, Eldress Anna White whom we all
                                admire, and no less our precious Sister Martha Anderson. Do you not think we were highly
                                honored? We wanted Elder Frederick's autograph. He wrote this original verse, Like a
                                candle almost out, Or a person in a doubt, Flickering, burning very low, Studying, shall
                                I stay or go. Eight here we must say that the oldest Sister of Mt. Lebanon who has been
                                quire bright all winter, has during the past week been sick, and at the age of
                                ninety-two has passed over the river. She came to Mt. Lebanon while young, of her own
                                free-will, and has from infancy lived a divinely pure life. We have a good Samaritan
                                here by name Sister Louisa Rice, and who during forty years has patiently cared for the
                                infirm, the sick and the dying; "Glory to the righteous, who can know their worth?" S.
                                A. C. , TsTortli ITa,mily. June 12, 1890. On the 8th. our Society Meetings were opened.
                                I did not number the people, but there was a large assembly. Farm and garden operations
                                have been put rather behind, on account of the weather. Eain, weeds and worms, with
                                winged insects are far too prolific. I never saw the tent caterpillars so numerous on
                                the fruit and forest trees as they have been this spring. Many trees have been entirely
                                stripped of all foliage. We need the God of Israel to come among us, and teach us how
                                and what to do, to be saved from the curse of worms, flies and bugs. Israel of old was,
                                according to the Scriptural record entirely saved from this curse, when obedient. Where
                                is the wise man, spirit or God, that will tell us just what to do to be saved. On the
                                9th, Elder Frederick completed his eighty-second year, sixty of which have been spent
                                among Believers. A company of five, one Brother and four Sisters are busily preparing
                                for a visit to all the Eastern Societies Glorious are the anticipations, but as nothing
                                to the realization. They start in the forepart of July. Peace and joy to all. Daniel
                                Offord. Center Famliy. June 14, 1890. Dear Elder Henry :�Last Wednesday night we had a
                                terrific wind-storm doing considerable damage in the gardens breaking down beans,
                                tomatoes and corn and stripping off cherries so the ground was quite covered with them,
                                they were rather scarce before the storm, but much more so now. Our prospect for pears
                                and plums is very slim indeed this season, yet we are buoyed up with the hope of having
                                enough of other fruits to make us comfortable. The Sisters have just about finished
                                spring's cleaning, there are so many buildings to be cared for it comes quite hard on
                                them. Brethren have done a little painting inside the dwelling on the bath room and
                                Vestibule on east side of house. I have had considerable difficulty this season with
                                Hubbard Squash seed, in getting it to grow , something destroys it in the ground and
                                that little pest the mole has made me much work in the hot-bed by rooting under the
                                plants. But with all these drawbacks, we have enough to be thankful for; a good degree
                                of health and a fair share of prosperity in temporal things. Your Brother, T. R.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Enfield, Connecticut" TEIform="index"/> Enfield, Conn.</head><p TEIform="p">We must not try to live without labor.

                                raised cheaper than most crops, because they will bear more neglect. But they don't pay
                                in-the end. They are the little vices that beset plant life, and are to be got rid of
                                the best way we know how. It is cheaper to nip them in the bud than to pull them up root
                                and branch. Here is where brain work comes in. Our experiment with Japanese buckwheat

                                Hens that are spare and leggy, are said to be the best for layers. We should study to

                                the several localities. The lovely month of June, with us, has been almost constantly in
                                tears, grass and foliage is luxuriant, but gardens, we fear, are having an excess of
                                moisture. The sun, whose glorious rays dispense health and happiness, has grown of late,
                                too modest, only showing himself at intervals, so brief are these manifestations, that
                                vegetation and humans also, need a protracted sun bath. Our South Family, which has for

                                under the direct control of the Society, glad also, that the elderly members of the

                                make it their earthly, therefore temporary home, for to some of them we know,�' 'The

                                and his Honorable Staff who are laboring in the interest of a noble cause. So we'll
                                pause in the days occupation Hoping to give a pleasing donation Of notes that will
                                pleasure impart. The reader may read, the singer may sing, And unto each one we trust

                                prophetically sung by an angel choir in the wonderful long ago. Very reluctantly we said
                                good-bye to merry-making May, as the night winds floated back its final farewell. The
                                many profitable lessons we learned during our sojourn with sunny May will not be
                                forgotten. The<pb n="162" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> sowing and planting season has been
                                unusually extended, owing to the incessant rainstorms which have prevailed here and
                                everywhere ; storms of the most diverse quality and tone. Storms consisting of long
                                rain, short rain, windy rain, mild rain, sunny rain, rainbow rain, dashing rain,
                                dripping rain, and hail, all hail, rain ! Eacli day farmers are busy beyond measure;
                                forenoons they are hurrying and worrying their crops out at interest, and afternoons
                                they may be seen doing the same. All crops planted and sown during the Spring have grown
                                rapidly, and are springing admirably night and day, much to the satisfaction of the
                                ambitious farmers, whose anticipations of the would-be high and lofty type are
                                occasionally lowered at half-mast only to rise with the rising of prosperous results,
                                which we are daily witnessing as the season advances. Summer came this way in all the
                                beauty of loveliness. A clear sky with balmy and healthful air, birds of brightest hue
                                and reviving tunes are rendezvousing throughout our grove-like yards, And announcing
                                life in all their songs, Melodiously rich and rare; Reminding us of that fadeless land
                                With music they're making in air. Our home is daily delightful, Surrounded with flowers
                                and trees; While ever our ears they are greeted By the hum of the honey-bees. The robins
                                build nests in the tree-tops, And chirp on the broad branches tall; While mosquitoes
                                they sing overhead And grasshoppers dance on the wall. Romantic indeed is our home-life,
                                With a mingling just now and then Of inmates from all ages ranging,� From eighty away
                                below ten. Our gardens and yards are resounding, Resounding with laughter and glee; For
                                many have learned the grand adage That laughter is healthful, you see, That laughter
                                restores life and vigor, Brings fortune and happiness near: That laughter is good for
                                the body And the mind it fills with real cheer. Then smile for all nature is smiling,
                                Through clouds and through sunshine and rain, Repeating the same lesson daily, In
                                laughter there's surely much gain. Our mutual friend and brother Michael A Shutz, A. B.
                                native of Odessa, Russia, a present of the Dansville Sanitorium was our honored guest
                                during one of the sunny Sun days of May last. He attended our morning service and
                                delivered an interesting speech on "Community Life" and the "Brotherhood of man." He is
                                contemplating writing his history, which will contain his experience in Russia and
                                America. His is an experience filled with thrilling and adventurous scenes. The work
                                when completed will read like a charming romance All interested in the cause of

                                need to watch very carefully. When we are tempted to do that which is wrong we can pray
                                to God for aid, and if our prayer is sincere He will be sure to give it to us. Sometimes
                                when we have done wrong a great many times, we feel as if we would not try to do right
                                any more. But it is because we have not been prayerful and watchful enough. If we set a

                                for that grace which cometh down from on high to strengthen our efforts for the right.

                            blessing, the favor of God. It would profit us little to know the errors of Saul's life if
                            we did not realize the lessons to be learned from them. Much is said and written about the
                            progress that has been made since those days, but it is evident that human nature remains
                            very much the t-ame with all our present enlightenment. Even a child could comprehend the
                            mistakes of Saul. Disobedience, deceitfalness and jealousy are only a few of the evils that
                            mar the lives of many in this day ; but with the light of the gospel of Christ, which grows
                            brighter as the years roll on, and the knowledge that "the wages of sin is death," let us
                            find true progress in the subjection of all evil, cultivating rather, the virtues and graces
                            of the Christian life. Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="American women receiving patents" TEIform="index"/> AMERICAN WOMEN RECEIVING

                                    Mrs. Gen. Green gave Eli Whitney the idea of the Cotton-gin, and he had to be pushed

                                    Massachusetts in making straw bonnets. Betsey Metcalf of Providence, R. I. in 1789
                                    invented the first one. It was Elizabeth Buckley who invented the first Sheet-iron
                                    Shovel, and Sarah Mather invented the first Submarine Telescope and Lamp, the model
                                    of which is of surprizing beauty and may be seen at the Patent Office. Isabella

                                    lady gave to the world the manikins which do so much for dress-making. Mary J.

                                    other devices out of which she has made considerable money. Mary Kies was the first
                                    woman in whose name a patent was recorded in the Patent Office. It was for weaving
                                    straw with silk or thread. The Dietz Sisters of CaL, have invented a Cyclone

                                    took place. Science insists upon it that the universe is governed by unchanging and
                                    unchangeable laws. The Scriptures are rejected by some because of the miraculous
                                    element in them. It should be borne in mind that the grandest miracles recorded in
                                    the Scriptures are the miracles of life regenerated and ennobled by the gospel and
                                    by the spirit of God. De Quincey has well said that no exhibition of blank power�not
                                    the arresting of the earth's motion�not the calling of the dead back to life, can
                                    approach in grandeur to this miracle which we daily behold, namely, the
                                    inconceivable mystery of having written and sculptured upon the tablets of man's
                                    heart a new code of moral distinctions, all modifying �many reversing�the old ones.
                                    What could have been thought of any prophet, if he should have promised to
                                    transfigure the<pb n="165" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> celestial mechanics; if he had
                                    said, I will create a new pole star, a new Zodiac, and new laws of gravitation;
                                    briefly, I will make a new earth and new heavens? And yet a thousand times more
                                    nwful was it to undertake the writing of new laws upon the spiritual conscience of
                                    man. The Prophet of the Lord said, Instead of the thorn, shall come up the fir-tree;
                                    instead of the brier, shall come up the myrtle-tree. This is the everlasting sign or
                                    miracle, which shall never be cut off. If all admit, as all must admit, that the
                                    gospel of Jesus Christ changes men in heart, in thought, and in character, we must
                                    not stumble over the account of the stilling of the tempest, or of the cleansing of
                                    the leper, or even of the raising of the dead.

                                author, he whose ink is bread, recognizes more than ever before the commercial side of
                                literature as a most potent factor in his work, says a writer in The Ladies' Home
                                Journal. There was a time, and not so long ago, when authors could write for pleasure,
                                when competition was not so keen, and their productions were certain of acceptance in
                                certain channels. Everything they wrote was acceptable because they wrote it, upon the
                                argument that they had cut out for themselves a certain constituency which hailed
                                anything from their pen, good, bad and indifferent. Two or three authors often
                                constituted the resources of a magazine. All this has changed. No writer, however strong
                                or popular, can carry the subscription list of a magazine in his or her pocket. Variety
                                is the order of the day. The magazine which gives the greatest variety in a, single
                                issue is the one most bought and enjoyed. "I do not care for amagazine," saidaliterary

                                beneficial effect which this tendency is undoubtedly having, is the doing away with
                                cliqueism in periodical literature. In fact, it cannot be truthfully said of one
                                prominent magazine to-day, as it could as late as a year ago, that it is "cliquey."
                                Editors fully recognize the necessity of continually presenting a different array of
                                writers, and thereby securing a variety of style and thought. To the old writers who
                                have been accustomed for years to write for a single periodical this new order of things
                                is disastrous in one respect, but for the whole school of modern writers it is a decided
                                advantage. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Anti-infidel library" TEIform="index"/>The Anti-Infidel Library

                                Howells by Hanilin Garland. The remarkable change in spirit and purpose which marks Mr.
                                llowells �later novels, especially A Hazard of New Fortunes, is what is chiefly dwelt
                                upon, and Mr. Garland's socialistic inclinations lead him to write with the warmth which
                                would be expected. The article is accompanied by a new portrait of Mr. Howells. A new
                                portrait of George Kennan faces a stirring poem entitled "Kara," in which Mr. Allen

                                illustrated article in this number is a bright account, by Elizabeth Walling, of a March
                                journey in a runabout along the Massachusetts North Shore, the paper abounding with
                                interesting bits of antiquarianism and gossip about Beverly, Manchester, Magnolia and
                                Gloucester. A beautifully illustrated article on "Some Old Dorchester Houses," by Mrs.
                                Marion A. McBride, is also full of pleasant antiquarianism, and shows how finely some of

                                best inte � ests of their chosen party. As this has become one of the vital questions of
                                the day, it crosses the threshold of nearly every family and awakens more or less active
                                thought for the present and future welfare of our country, and indeed of our homes. When
                                our public schools become the subject of denominational controversy and the contestants
                                are Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians, it is at once circumscribed within
                                the narrow limits of ereeda.l churches, and immediately assumes the character of a
                                leligious or holy (?) war. In those countries where the civil power acts in concert with
                                the religious power, they form the dominant party and rule all others, agreeably to
                                their own will, and the people can neither- learl), preach, pray nor sing only as they
                                receive permission. In these schools a governmental religion is taught and all minor
                                sects are ignored. From this sectarian influence arises the trouble that has grown in
                                the public schools of the [J. 8. As our government rests on civil or judicial
                                foundation, it should S:&gt;hinx-like, neither smile nor frown on the leligious
                                faith of any class; and our publicschools like our government is for the civil education
                                of the pupils and should not be open to the promulgation of the ;eligious dogmas of an /
                                sect. The churches being the a -kiio-.vledgeJ educators of the multiplied �h.a'es of
                                religious belief, can ius-irurt their chiYlien in the catechism, agreeably t &gt;
                                their own peculiar notions, and no one need to be disturbed, but a doaiaiint Teiigious
                                body that carries the s.vord, whether ru'ed by the creed of the Catholic or of the Pi

                                loathsome dungeons of Salem. Do not fail to send for the pamphlet, and see what may be

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
Following in the line of the large English
publishers who have opened Agencies to the
United States Comes the announcement that
the Religious Tract Society of London are
also about to establish a Depository in this
country. Mr. Fleming H. Revell, (New
York and Chicago), has been appointed sole
Agent for the Society, and will supply both
the wholesale  and  retail trade   from  both
points. The publications of the Religious
Tract Society are by no means confined to
�Tracts". On the other hand they are aniong the largest publishers in Great Britain
of fine illustrated Gift Books, Works of
Travel, Science, Healthly Fiction, and popular Juveniles, as well as most valuable Theological and Devotional Volumes.
Owing to the somewhat conservative policy of this Soci< ty in the past, their valuable
issues have not been known in this country
except to a very limited extent, but in literary worth and attractive style of production,
they are second to none. Fleming H. Revell,
12 Bible House, Astor Place, N. Y.
