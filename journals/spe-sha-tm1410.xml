                            1 put away childish things." So said Paul in substance. Sometimes it requires a long time to
                            attain to a state of manhood and womanhood, or a condition, where we are able to understandf
                            reason, think and act correctly. I am inclined to think, it is better for children to be
                            taught to fear some one, and reverence something, even if that fear and reverence be
                            somewhat misplaced, and misdirected, than for them to grow up high-headed an 1 strong in
                            their own way and will, regardless of the prayers, tears and entreaties of parents and
                            friends, and devoid of reverence ; upon the principle, that it is easier by far to turn the
                            thoughts and feelings, into a right channel and mode of reasoning, even as it is easier to
                            turn a stream of water into a new conduit, than to search out an entire new source of
                            supply. I call to mind when I was a child, and leaned upon the knee of a pious mother, how
                            she taught me to think of a God in some far off region, who was "angry with the wicked
                            everyday;" and if we did that which was Avroug in his sight, He would surely punish us. The
                            preachers and singers in those days, seemed to be in perfect accord. The minutrs told of a
                            literal hell; while the selected choir sang :� " This awful God is ours, He tliundtrs when
                            he please ; He rides Upon the stormy skies, And manages the [seas." My young receptive mind,
                            imbibed those ideas, and when a roaring thunderclap burst over our heads, 1 thought it Avas
                            the voice of an offended God showing<pb n="218" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> his displeasure at some wrong that
                            mortals had done. I was also taught to reverence the Bible as the word of God ; and what an
                            awful thing it would be ; if any one should take from, or add one word to the Holy
                            Scriptures, which contained all that was needful for mortals to know. However erroneous I
                            now think those ideas were, they were the best that my instructors could give at that time,
                            and were beneficial, many times in keeping me from wrong-doing. As T now read and understand
                            the Scriptures, I venture to enquire without compunction of conscience ;�What is meant by
                            the term Rook, that would be such a diabolical crime to take from or add unto? Thee was a
                            time when the Bible, as a book, did not exist. Was there no word of God previous to what we
                            call the Scriptures of Truth ? Those scriptures were called into being as events transpired
                            ; many of them were written upon parchment or engraven on stone. The art of printing was
                            then unknown ; and for centuries they only existed in a fragmentary state. The Adamic age
                            had its history. 'I he Abrahamic followed. Then the Mosaic dispensation, with its numerous
                            sacrifices and ceremonies, extending over a long period of time. During that period, many
                            Prophets arose, delivered their testimony and then slept with their fathers who had passed
                            on before the*n. In the fullness of time, the many books of the , Old Testament were
                            collected and compiled, many parts of which we think had much better been burned than
                            printed. However, that book, or books, gathered into its present form, was not brought forth
                            all at once in some miraculous way, any more than the temple of Solomon was builded in a
                            moment without preparation. The materials existed, ages before they were gathered from the
                            mountains, and quarried from the earth ; but human labor and skill were requisite to build
                            the temple, and it took time to rear and perfect it. For the sahe of brevity, we Avill pass
                            by the New Testament, with its long history of written and unwritten Gospels, according to
                            the several disciples of Jesus as they have come down to the nineteenth century ; leaving
                            the council and cardinals, who have met in conclave from time to time, to decide what was
                            canonical, orthodox, or heterodox, what should be retained or rejected�and hear what the
                            Revelator John had to say concerning the Book, this book, the Lamb's book of Life etc. upon
                            which so much stress has been laid, and which it would be such a heinous crime to tamper
                            with. The New Testament did not then exist in its present form. I once asked a professed
                            minister of the Gospel, his opinion of" the Apocalypse ; he replied, " to me it is still a
                            sealed book ; and I do not dare to do much with it; it is too much like getting into an
                            apothecary's shop ; I am fearful I should break some of the vials] " John, when on the
                            I&amp;lo of Patmos certainly had some marvelous Kevelations; and while in vision, saw
                            and heard many strange things that would come to pass, when the inhabitants of earth were
                            prepared for them. He was instructed by the Angel who opened his inner sight, to write the
                            things which he saw and heard, and seal them, that they might be a witness of the truth, and
                            evidence the spirit of prophecy to incoming generations; when, in the fullness of time, the
                            seals would be broken, and<pb n="219" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> the key to those revelations would be given
                            to inspired men and women, who would be able to unlock the mysteries pertaining thereto ;
                            when the Holy City, the New Jerusalem had descended to earth, and a new spiritual temple
                            erected beautiful in all its parts, containing a throne, and a pure river of life clear as
                            crystal proceeding from that throne. Then will all the mystery pertaining to those
                            utterances and predictions cease, by being fulfilled. Then will idol worship cease, whether
                            in ?:ook form or any other form. Living witnesses will arise who will be inspired as deeply
                            and truly as was John the Kevelator who will speak the truth, and no longer depend upon the
                            letter that killeth. If we could see the heaps of gold and silver that have been paid to a
                            hireling Priesthood for their dry husky explanations of the Book of which we have been
                            writing.�would it not be astounding ! Let the Seals be broken, that we may read and
                            understand ! Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            among the human race, except in a little child, or among small children? Why? Because they
                            never committed any actual sin, they never violated any law, and were always subject to
                            their earthly parents. So, it will be with souls who are redeemed unto God. They will not
                            knowingly, commit any actual sin, they will not violate any law, neither human nor divine.
                            And they will always be subject to their heavenly Parents, their heavenly Father, and
                            Eternal Mother. See Rom. i\, 20. They will ever be intent on building up the spiritual work
                            of God, both in their own souls, and iu those around them. They will not join hand in hand
                            with the wicked against the " Lord's Anointed." They will not build up fraud and deception,
                            under whatever<pb n="220" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> garb it may assume, because such are of the world. The
                            world loves its own, and the Lord loves his own. When ? In that day, spoken of by the
                            ancient prophet Isaiah ; which day is already beginning to dawn upon the earth ; if any
                            doubt this, let them look back and see, where the world stood a hundred years ago ; find
                            compare it with what is now beginning to take place on the intellectual plane of
                            development, and just beginning to touch the moral and spiritual element, and when that
                            plane is fairly reached, as it surely will be, there will be a thousand living lives of
                            purity and innocence, on the earth, where therj is one now ; and those who have been living
                            lives of virgin celibacy, for the last one hundred years, have not lived in vain. Great will
                            be their reward for setting this example before a licentious world, and maintaining it for
                            so long a time. Crowns of glory await them in the "spirit world." In that day the world will
                            not be governed by physical force, but by the influence which mind exerts over mind, spirit
                            over matter, men and women will no longer be slaves to their appetites and passions, the

                            its widest sense, that is, an intuitive conception of some character of a Supreme Being, or
                            Power, more mighty than man, to whom man is subjective and accountable, has been manifest,
                            in ils theological sense, that is, as a system of doctrines, or principles, from the days of
                            Moses. But, religion, in its sense of practical piety, as distinct from theology, has ebbed
                            and flowed, both in the individual, and society experiences, in some sense, and in some
                            degree, from the days of Moses, unto the present time. But, religion, meaning systems of
                            faith and methods of worship, comprehends the beliefs of Pagans, Mahomedans, Hindoos,
                            Indians, Parsees, Jews and Christians ; in all their varied characteristics of profession,
                            belief, or denomination ; and it is religion in all the foregoing "tenses that we now
                            propose to consider. It is possible that, in each and all of the religious systems of past
                            human history, there may have been some elements and principles adapted to human needs for
                            the period in which they existed, bit all of them appear to have been measurably transitory,
                            and many of them wholly so ; and yet, myriads of their professors cling to their sail riven

                            world teeming with woes ! But, man is a creature ot progress, and is not content to remain
                            in any locality or condition, either physical,<pb n="221" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>mental or spiritual, that
                            does not give him satisfaction, peace and comfort. He is not content to merge his faith in a
                            system of so-called religion, which is both material, finite, and transitory, and therefore
                            incapable of moral and spiritual elevation, progress and continuity! His organization calls
                            for life, perpetual and uubounded life! Yet, when the chalice is presented to his lips, if
                            it requires a sacrifice of something he has adopted, and for a time pursued and sought unto
                            for comfort and therefrom, in some degree, been fed and nourished, he is loath to part with
                            it! "This tendency to resist innovation, even though it be improvement, is observable in
                            every special organization ; in law ; in medicine ; in science ; in religion." And a measure
                            of this conservatism is a necessary element in human character, to avoid rashly rushing into
                            systems of theology, adopting supposed philosophical propositions, which on trial, by
                            experience, prove sophistical ; or scientific problems, which, by a deeper and truer
                            knowledge of science, are found to be erroneous. Yet, dissatisfaction,�a want of life. soul
                            life, liberty and love; a want of that knowledge which solves the problems that weigh upon

                            constantly asking, the absence of that lamp of truth that throws light on his origin, his
                            nature and his destiny, urges mankind onward to new fields of exploration, seeking truth ;
                            to higher flights of the winged soul to know God ; and to more interior and intense labors
                            of soul to find a true, lasting and happy relation to Him ; to be panoplied with His power ;
                            to triumph over error with His wisdom ; and to bask in the sunshine of truth by obtaining
                            His revelations. Hence, the urgent inquiry, What are the vital, and eternal elements of a
                            New and True Religion? The history of the transitory religions of the past has shown that
                            mere formalism and monotonv, are elements of materialism, of earth-born origin. The drapery
                            of religion�good words,' in some degree, existed 2,000 years before Christ; and every phase
                            and color of religious belief, has had a share in this sacred verbiage, which, as a helm to
                            guide the human barque of floating destiny, has, beyond all controversy, ported many a hum^n
                            craft in a harbor of measurable safety, from the wrecking storms of selfish, passionate
                            humanity, but, the end is not yet! The human family are not at rest ; salvation from those
                            destructive throbbings of human passion, from those perilous graspings after momentary
                            pleasures of sense, is not obtained from those transient sources. Engulfing chasms of sin
                            swallow up earth's millions in misery, inequality in the distributions of a bountiful
                            providence, provokes interminable jealousies and hatreds ; and injustice breeds desire to
                            revenge; thus human will, ra?ped up to desperate energy by the injustice and oppression of
                            human laws and systems of association, breaks over all bounds of restraint; dashes into
                            crimes that appall the senses, and contribute to make earth a pandemonium of strife and
                            contention ; of wretchedness and woe. From these conditions the soul turns shudderingly
                            away, and agonizingly inquires for those elements of religion that are eternally flowing
                            forth fountains of soul life, liberty, equality, justice and happiness.<pb n="222" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>The faith, the religion that is to save and redeem the world, must have a vitalizing
                            motive which proceeds from the strongest forces in the soul, that force is pure love ; not
                            the flickering emotion which dances on the pulses of animal passion, but that tractive power
                            that lifts the soul to heavenly mansions, and ushers it into the embraces of the righteous
                            doers of the will of God, who have wrought to make happy the abodes of man. "Philosophy has
                            made slow progress in redeeming man," and has tardily and falteringly wrought to save them.
                            "I have eyes to see man's misery, but no hands, to lift him out of it. " It is manifest that
                            the elements of eternal life in religion ; that is a perpetual vitality, and propelling
                            power of religious progress, are to be found in the sacrifice of selfishness, and a whole
                            souled consecration and love to God above, through love to man below. It was this
                            overflowing and everflowing soul of love to God and man, which made, of Jesus, a vicegerent
                            of God ; which gave him power to give his life for his people and God's Cause ! The language
                            and logic of true love is there is no death ; no death ! Spiritual, " Xo death to those who
                            walk with Christ, They overcome the world, And rising from the carnal life They win the
                            hundred fold. " " The supreme truth that God is love, is the secret of the Universe, God's
                            whole creation swims in a sea of eternal love." "Not to love is, at last, absolute and utter
                            desolation," solitude; hermitage. All that is now manifest in human society that is
                            inharmonious, is not of God's creation ; it is of man's conception and inception. The truth
                            which by God's revealed word flashes its light upon the world, is, that the gospel of
                            eternal soul-life, is a gospel of eternal soul love ! This, indeed, was the divine germ of
                            the Mosaic Law ; the grand trunk of the tree of Life upon whose fruitful branches hung " all
                            the law and the prophets." The beloved Apostle John hath truly said, " He that hateth his
                            brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him." I

                            socalled, ) that have deluged the world with wordy creeds ; the one only element which has
                            been of any value to mankind, and, as a bursting germ of life, has, from time to time
                            pierced the flimsy husk of bare progressions, and given even a ray of hope to those who
                            embraced them, was love to God and man ! " Christ presented himself to the world, drawing
                            off from its speculations its ritualized dogmas ; its traditional ethics, and fixed its
                            thought on himself, " not on himself worshipfully, but on himself as exemplarily sacrificed
                            to the love of God and man ; giving thereunto his life! And, said Jesus, " Greater love hath
                            no man than this, that he give his life for his friends. John, xv., 18. This love, as the

                            would '"turn the whole world into joyfulness." This love, being the soul and substance of

                            gospel testimony, so that '� the wayfaring man though a fool, need not err therein. " Christ
                            hath begun to make his second appearance in<pb n="223" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> " One like unto the Son of

                            the spirit of the Lord cried out, " Thrust in thy sickle and reap, for the time is come for
                            thec to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. " This harvest is the harvest of
                            humanity ; that is, cutting it off from its natural, generative stock, and garnering it into
                            the Kingdom of God which is not of this evil world,�-Now nothing is more like a " Son of
                            man" than a daughter of man ; and Christ now manifest through the daughter of man,
                            constitutes Christ manifest the second time in hij glory ; "woman, the glory of man" and
                            Christ thus dually manifest, the glory of God. Now in this Christ dispensation '"there shall
                            be no more death," (soul death, the fruit of sin,) " neither sorrow nor crying, neither
                            shall there be any more pain," (the fruit of sin,) '"for the former things" (religiousfalse

                            Dartmouth College, Hanover, N. H. and eleven miles from White River Junction, Vt. About the
                            time of the -evolutionary war in this country, ihe minds of many were uncommonly religiously
                            exercised. Dissatisfied with the absence ot a spirit divine and the want of power in the
                            Christian churches, they honestly sought a higher life, a clearer revelation of the will of
                            God for the elevation of humanity. In prayer and in sacrifice for deliverance from bondage
                            and slavery to sin, as avcII as a freedom from the injustice and oppression imposed by the
                            edicts and laws of the king and parliament of England, the people were heavily suffering and
                            the country was in a state of constant unrest. An appeal was made to- the various churches
                            cf our land anil fellowship sought for deliverance from the burdens of spiritual captivity.
                            But no relief came that was abiding, until the year 1782, when a delegation from the Shakers
                            in the State of New York was sent out to declare the testimony of the coming of Christ and
                            to minister the ' power ot his spirit. At that, age of our religious order, its members,
                            like their neighbors, lived in their respective private families, caring for their personal
                            comfort and wants ; and with the revelation of light t) them, maintaining strictly and
                            conscientiously their religious faith in the pure celibate order and practical Christian

                            religious body, was formed and all Avho chose to ffive their S signature to a covenant (
                            accompanying the constitution, pledging their service, their talents and all they possessed
                            to the support of community interests, thus making the property of its members a joint
                            stock, a common interest to be appropriated and used for the benefits of the institution and
                            for such religious and charitable purposes as by its members might be deemed advisable, were
                            privileged so to do ; and thus they organized a church and government on communistic
                            principles. For the protection of persons and property and the administration of government,
                            officers were appointed by common consent, Elders to teach and direct spiritually and
                            Trustees and Deacons to advise and superintend temporally. From that time to the present, we
                            have maintained this form of government, after the manner of the church as established at
                            Jerusalem in the days of the Apostles, whose members "were of one heart and of one soul;
                            neither said any of them that aught ot the things which he possessed was his own ; but they

                            the societies of Watervliet and New Lebanon. Issachar Bates, jun. was a beloved Elder in the
                            Society at Watervliet, N. Y. for a great many years, and Betsey Bates was an Eldress several
                            years in the Church at Mt. Lebanon, N. Y. and then became one of the Ministry in which order
                            she was greatly beloved by the Believers in the several Societies. Issachar now owned, a
                            small farm and besides caring for these duties, he engaged somewhat extensively in the
                            trading of horses, cattle and sheep. In 1780 he went with twenty live young men to West
                            'Point for three months, and in referring to this he says ; "although Benedict Arnold sold
                            us all to the British, the bargain was disannulled and we all returned safely to our homes,
                            and this was the end of the war with me." We next find Issachar in Petersham, Mass, and on a
                            visit to the Shakers. He was anxious to see Mother Ann Lee, and to hear her speak. While at
                            this place a disorderly mob made some disturbance, but no one was seriously injured.
                            Issachar was very much interested in this meeting, and expressed much displeasure that it
                            should have been disturbed by a mob. The preaching of Father James Whitta.ker and the
                            singing by the Believers were very satisfactory to his mind, and at a later date he would
                            testify that it was this special time that he received faith in the gospel work. He says, "
                            When I saw a manifestation of the life of the Shakers, so active in speaking, singing and
                            warning people to turn to God and confess their sins, I was convinced that it was the -work
                            of God, but I was not ready to be one with them. " After the Shakers gathered to Harvard,
                            and other places, they seldom visited Petersham and Issachar became wholly absorbed in the
                            life of the world, in buying and selling and selfishly gathering the treasures of this
                            world. At the age of 28 years he moved with his family into the State of N. Y-. and went to
                            work in the woods, and obtained an honorable living. Although he made no poofession of
                            religion, and as he says, " hated conviction" yet the spirit of God. did not wholly forsake
                            him, and serious thoughts would at times occupy the mind At the age of thirty seven, he
                            formed a determination to mend his life, and still thought it was all in vain to think of
                            being any better. He says, "I was addicted to the use of profane language, and one day after
                            giving vent to an expression of this kind, I said, I am all alone, nobody can hear me but
                            God! I fell upon my knees and prayed and cried for God to help me govern my tongue, if no
                            more. " From this time he became a changed man, and for many weeks was in devout prayer to
                            God for a freedom from sin. He says " One day as I was in deep distress, a voice spol^p to
                            me in these words, ' Will you be as willing to go and lead mankind in the way of
                            righteousness, as you have been to lead them into vanity?' I answered yea, Lord, I will go
                            where you send. " Issachar says this created a little hope in his mind and he was led to
                            attend church. He was among the, Baptists and heard them condemn themselves as sinners.
                            Before the close of the meeting he was urged to speak, but had no thought of becoming . a
                            member. They urged him to be baptized, but as he was not yet ready they read to him their
                            covenant which he accepted. They then read the Articles of Faith, but he objected to a part
                            of them and would wait till he was better satisfied on some points. Prayer now seemed to be
                            his constant companion, and through this he enjoyed a direct ministration of the spirit of
                            peace. He was overjoyed and returned to his family singing and praising God, which continued
                            for many hours into the night. The next Sabbath he preached to the people as they passed on
                            the road and before they entered the Church, very much to their joy and astonishment. At
                            this time he consented to be baptized but did not expeiience the benefit he had anticipated.
                            He still prayed that the spirit of God might direct him aright, and soon learned that he was
                            to take the yoke of Jesus Christ and learn of him to be good even as God is<pb n="228" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> Issachar contended that he received this ministration from God. That he was a
                            free agent to choose or to refuse, and although he had played the part of the prodigal, he
                            had through deep sufferings, returned to his Father's house Not long after this he was
                            examined by four Baptist preachers and licensed to preach, which he did from 1795 till 1801.
                            In the acceptance of this new light the Confession of sin, the swearing of oaths, the
                            bearing of arms and following the fashions of the world, were all brought plainly to the
                            mind as subjects which needed a most thorough investigation. For several years he kept pace
                            with the revivals, but finding that they all ended in the life of the flesh or the spirit of
                            the world, he began to conclude that salvation was not among them. " Here I was for three
                            years, my faith with the Shakers and my union with the world. I was warned to keep away from
                            these deluded people. " At this time the Shaker settlement of New Lebanon was seventy miles
                            distant, but he made arrangements to go and see them. On his way he called to see his sister
                            and learned that she had already found fellowship with the Believers, and had made
                            confession of her sins to God. Issachar hesitated for a while what course to take, through
                            fear if he went to Lebanon he might be deluded. On the way he tarried 'vith a man, at night,
                            who had at one time ,ived with the Shakers, and he reported some dreadful stories concerning
                            them. On arrival at the North House in Lebanon " I soon met Elder Cooley who asked me what I
                            wanted. " I want to talk with you. What about? Religion. Do you profess religion? I do. What
                            order? Baptist. Are you satisfied with what you have? I am not. Very well, have some
                            breakfast, and then we will talk. "I at first asked the privilege to tell my experience, for
                            this reason, I had been informed that you would call it all the old heavens, and I do not
                            think so. " "Well," said Elder Cooley, "tell yours and then I will tell mine. " It seems
                            that both of them had enjoyed a rich religious experience and both had been Baptist
                            preachers, and had been led along from degree to degree till they had found that they were
                            called to forsake the fellowship of the world, and live a life to God. Issachar remained in
                            New Lebanon at this time only one hour and as he says, " I ate quick, talked quick, heard
                            quick and started home quick. " Elder Cooley advised him to " Count the cost well, " in
                            regard to the acceptance of a new faith. To remember that there is but one Christ. This
                            visit was followed by a severe trial of faith which awakened all the internal and external
                            enemies of the cross. A committee from the church waited on him, to warn him of the danger
                            of believing a lie, and also of the danger of being lost. This contest was continued for
                            several weeks, but Issachar had resolved upon being a member of the Society of Shakers and
                            in August 1801 he made a second journey to New Lebanon and after an hone�t confession was
                            accepted as one of the Brethren. On his return home he met with trials on every hand; even
                            his own family opposed the course he had taken. He says, " I was like Job mocked of his
                            neighbor who calleth upon him, and he heareth him ; and the upright man is laughed to scorn.
                            " In the course of a few months Issachar was sent, in company Math Benjamin Youngs, to
                            preach the testimony of Believers. They first visited Hartford Vt. and soon won the respect
                            of the people in that place. They next visited Pittsford Vt. at the time of a remarkable
                            religious revival. The Brethren were very kindly received and solicited to speak in the
                            several meetings which they attended. The blessing of God accompanied their labors and quite
                            a number of persons faithfully promised that they would consecrate their lives to God, and
                            many of them were able to endure unto the end. (To BE CONTINUED.)</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Unless a tree bears blossoms..." TEIform="index"/>Unless a tree bears blossoms...

                            January is received. It is good news from a far country. To learn that in that far oft land
                            of abundance in earthly things, there is at least one who hungers after knowledge of an
                            order so unpopular as Shakerism is really good news. I shall proceed to give you answers to
                            your several questions, in the order you have put them, witnout re writing them. Some years
                            ago, I had a correspondent, John Finlay, in Balerat Australia, to whom I sent a great deal
                            of reading matter. He was a school master. He died. He did intend to come to America. In
                            England I held many meetings, the most important was in St. George's Hall. Am glad you have
                            that lecture. Have you seen Hepworth Dixon's "New America?" If not, you had better read it.
                            That would give you " how and from what classes of society our societies are kept up ;"
                            also, how new societies originate, the material that composes them. Religious revivals are
                            the preparatory processes. By religion we mean all forms of truth, from naturalism to
                            Shakerism. Believing that in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
                            and that no good thing will God withhold from those who truly love and serve him. There are
                            no better ages for new comers than from twenty-one upwards. It is easy for young men and
                            women to become Shakers. At that age they know something of the world, yet have not used up
                            their life energies. Young men and women are strong to overcome the world, to bear the
                            burdens of society. They are the first guests called to the marriage supper. The second
                            class, from the streets of the city, are widows and orphans. The third class, compelled, by
                            necessity, from the highways of travel and the by-ways of sin, come for a home and to be
                            saved from the wickedness they have fallen into. Many of them are thus called arm few of
                            them are chosen. Only a small proportion remain permanent members. But the labor upon them
                            is not lost. Good will come of it. Having once had a taste of community life among the
                            Shakers, they never forget it, but either do, or will, in or out of the body, re-enter the
                            order to go no more out forever. They arc our loudest preacher because the world will
                            believe what they say. I speak now of the honest and sincere, not of reprobates�violaters of
                            their own consciences�who defile the flesh, speaking evil to cover their own wickedness. All
                            real Shakers do as did Jesus and His Apostles�make themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of
                            Heaven's sake. They are not made eunuchs of men. That only is circumcision that is of the
                            heart and of the spirit of God. It leads men and women not to look at each other with
                            lustings. About doctors, etc., you have heard the Spanish proverb, "Every man is a fool or a
                            physician." The Law of Moses was of God. It saved its subjects from the diseases of the
                            Egyptians. " The Lord your God shall take all sickness away from the midst of you, " was the
                            promise. Should not the Gospel retain all the good of the Law, which was only a
                            school-master to bring or prepare souls for the Gospel ? " No man cometh to me except the
                            Father prepare him. " As yet we are only in the first of seven cycles that will develop
                            Shakerism, the Gospel.<pb n="230" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/>When a people are prepared for a religious
                            community, they usually have properly enough to begin with and they soon create more.
                            .vhakers all labor and nothing is lost by idleness, waste nor sensual pleasures. Godliness
                            is profitable for all things, the world that now is and the world that is to come. It
                            creates Heaven upon earth, and supplies all normal wants. About a second visit to England I
                            think co-operation, infidelity to a false church, temperance, physiological reforms and many
                            other forms of truth have well-nigh prepared a people for our order. The rate of mortality
                            of the Quakers in England is about eight years beyond the mass of the population, as near as
                            I can come at it. The rate of mortality among the (Shakers is about tea years. It should be
                            twenty five when the system is fully proved. I have sent a letter by Vincent; also a paper
                            published in the Tribune, our leading paper. I will send other things as I get time, the
                            autobiography for one. We have volumes of the Shaker and Shakeress that I will send to
                            libraries if they will pay postage and have them bound. Weather�We are in the midst of
                            winter. Good sleighing. Do you have snow and ice ? What have you done with the cannibals? I
                            always think of maneating in connection with JS'ew Zealand, that they eat their
                            missionaries. Is it any greater crime for Christians to eat one another than it is for them
                            to shoot one another? Would they do either it they did not violate the command, "Thou shalt
                            not kill ? " I send my love to all who believe in doing right, until there be no cross in
                            it, and that sin consists in wrong-doing, in unrighteousness. Your friend, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F. W." TEIform="persName"/>F. W.

                            certain that wrong is destined to utter destruction. Whoever links himself with error, is
                            sure eventually to encounter overthrow. There may be temporary prosperity, there will be
                            final defect; hence, they consult their wisdom and safety who cling to the right at whatever
                            cost ; not through stubbornness of will, but through<pb n="231" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> steadfastness of
                            faith and honesty of purpose. How brief the scenes of trial Avill seem when the struggle is
                            over; how unworthy of notice will be all the sufferings of the present time, when compared
                            with the crown, the joys, the raptures which shall reward the faithful soul. Let the
                            followers of Christ take courage ; their conflicts are brief and they war against powers
                            destined to fall. Those who cling to the right, shall triumph with it forever. Canterbury,

                                    invited to speak in Dr. Scudder's Plymouth Church, while here, cind there he gave
                                    expressions to views not exactly in harmony with those of the distinguished divine
                                    whose pulpit he was temporarily occupying, and which creatad for outsiders a very
                                    pleasant ripple of merriment. The celebrated Hindoo alluded to the Christian
                                    missionaries and their work in India in the highest terms, and then naively said
                                    that he "could not congratulate them on their success in reaching the national heart
                                    there, because they did not conciliate the peculiar religious tendencies which
                                    existed in the Hindoo mind as it is. " He thought there should be more conciliation
                                    in regard to the views of the Hindoos. For this candid expression of his own
                                    personal views, it has been whispered that Dr. Scudder told him that he had acted a
                                    part that he considered not exactly proper and courteous under the circumstances,
                                    and in order to controvert his position, he made a prolific statement to a reporter
                                    of the InterOcean, giving an elaborate account of the success that had crowned the
                                    labors of the missionaries among the Hindoos. The public will be allowed, of course,
                                    to take their choice in the statements of the respective parties, the same as in all
                                    other questions of dispute now agitating the public mind,�the majority probably
                                    leaning favorably towards the views expressed by the distinguished Hindoo, who, in
                                    response to a question from Dr. Scudder, said that he did not know about Southern
                                    India; his remarks had been in regard to Northern India. Had Dr. Scudder carefully
                                    read what the New York and Chicago papers have said of Mozoomdar's addresses in this
                                    country, he would have considered him too liberal to occupy his pulpit, to which he
                                    invited him, and then like a little pampered boy, pouted because he wasn't reflected
                                    in the remarks that were made. However, notwithstanding Dr. Scudder's displeasure,
                                    he paid his foreign visitor a high compliment during his interview with a reporter,
                                    saying : " He is one of the ablest men I ever knew. Chunder Sen, at the head of the
                                    movement, is one of the grandest men the world has today. And I believe they both
                                    are Christians. I have read Mozoomdar's ' Oriental Christ, ' and from that and his
                                    talk I believe he is a Christian. That was why I invited him into my pulpit. He may
                                    call it Brahmo Somai or what he will, but my opinion is it is Christianity, and that
                                    his conversion was brought about by the influence of the missionaries, I bid them
                                    and their new movement Godspeed, and I hope it will do much for India and help the
                                    Christian missionaries to convert the land. But we must not get discouraged so
                                    easily. In this country, a Christian nation, one person in five is nominally a
                                    Christian� attends church. India has five times as many people as this country, and
                                    it will take a long time to convert her 250,000,000 heathens."</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Religio P. J." TEIform="index"/>Religio P.

" Hosea, vi., 8. Whether we consider
                            these words as an encouragement addressed by the godly to each other, or to their own souls,
                            they remind us of an important aim ; a necessary duty ; and an assured privilege. The aim
                            is, to " know the Lord, " for the soul to be without knowledge it is not good. All the
                            operations of the Spirit are begun and carried on in the renewing of the mind. ' Nothing can
                            be perfectly spiritual or religious in our dispositions or our actions that is not ftnmded
                            in knowledge ; because it must be destitute of principle and motive; and the Lord looketh at
                            the heart. Real repentance must arise form correct knowledge of the evil of sin in
                            connection with the cross of Christ. Even faith is impossible without knowledge. " For how
                            can they believe in Him of whom they have not heard r" But what says the Savior? "This is
                            life eternal, that they know Thee, the only true God ; and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.
                            " This declaration not only decides the importance of this knowledge, but also the nature of
                            it. It is not a philosophical knowledge of God as an Almighty being,�the Creator of all
                            things ; or even a knowledge of Him as holy in all his ways, and righteous in all His works.
                            Such views of Him, on the mind of a sinner must engender dread and aversion. The saving
                            grace in the restoration of the wayward is to know that He is willing, even now, to become a
                            friend and Savior to the needy, and has already given undeniable proof that he is waiting to
                            help us if we but call upon Him. Connected with this there is a necessary duty, it is to
                            "follow on to know the Lord." This takes in the practice of what we already know. To what
                            purpose would it be for God to afford light to be neglected? It would only increase the sin
                            and condemnation. ' Whensoever hath, to him shall be given and he shall have more
                            abundantly, but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath, " and we
                            see this constantly exemplified. When men do not choose to retain God in their knowledge; it
                            is their interest to see things less clearly; and so they part with one truth after another
                            until they are left as it were without God in the world; while those who do his will know of
                            the doctrine, and by patient continuance in well-doing seek for " glory, honor and
                            immortality." The privilege is as sure as the word of God, history and experience can<pb n="233" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> make it. And if a probability of success will actuate a man to engage
                            in an enterprise, and continue in a series of exertions and sacrifices, how much more should
                            actual certainty ! Let therefore this full assurance influence us to seek after him who
                            giveth to all men liberally, then shall our path be as the shining light that shineth more
                            and more unto the perfect day. According to the promise our perplexities shall be solved,
                            our doubts removed. Crooked things shall be made straight and the rough places smooth, then
                            shall the "wilderness bloom and the barren desert smile," and he will have become k' our

                                picture of the pretty home, where I live and I will try my best to draw one for your
                                pleasure I hope, and for my own improvement in writing as well. Within the Southern
                                limits of the state of Maine you will find what I am pleased to call " my Home " nestled
                                down in the peaceful quiet town of West Gloucester. On the North arc pleasant hills
                                which command a fine view of our little settlement. On the East lies a beautiful lake
                                formerly called Sabbath day Pond which affords fine pickerel, trout, and pout. On a cool
                                summer day when one would like a little recreation and there is seemingly no place to
                                go, just take the second thought and you will propose going to the lake. South of us
                                there lies a quiet neighborhood where all seems to be as busy as a hive of bees. In the
                                same direction lie "Centennial Springs." On the North are the "Poland Springs " where a
                                large house has been constructed for the accommodation of invalids, that they may drink
                                of its waters and thereafter enjoy good health. For miles around us you can see
                                magnificent trees of varied kinds. In the midst of certain trees is another lake which
                                supplies the mill. People come from the surrounding cities to spend their vacation in
                                our section, and amuse themselves with hunting and catching small game such as
                                partridges, wild ducks, and gray squirrels, much to our inconvenience ; and others come
                                for the purpose of viewing the scenery, enjoying the fresh air, and the quietness which
                                pervades the country: Near our home stand-; the modest little Church wherein is held
                                "public service" each Sunday, unless foul weather prevents. Large companies come from
                                cities throughout the United States to regain their health at the celebrated Poland
                                Springs, and then attend our service. The mill which lies North-east of us is a great
                                accommodation to the people throughout Cumberland Co., it does many different kinds of
                                work like sawing, grinding and planing. The orchards and gardens around, supply us with
                                fruit yearly, the fields yield an abundance of hay, and pasture lands afford fine feed
                                for cattle. Our Home has been greatly improved by the construction of a stately brick
                                building which stands facing the road. Two magnificent elm trees one at each corner and
                                the little birds build their nests in the branches; and when the gentle breezes blow,
                                each tree makes a courtesy to the passer-by, and seemingly says " Good Morning" or "Good
                                Afternoon" as the case maybe. The road is lined witli beautiful trees which make a fine
                                appearance. Near by is the Cemetery where many of the consecrated builders of our home
                                have been laid away peacefully. The body is dead but the soul is immortal, it can never
                                die! The many prospects of the coining year lead us to hope that it will be a fruitful

It is of little

                            the other hand it is of the greatest importance that our lives harmonize with that spirit
                            which establishes a foundation for righteousness and comes to us with authority from the
                            Kingdom of God. Christ is, indeed our example, a divine pattern of which we need not be
                            ashamed. He has given us to understand that his meat and his drink�his whole life,�was to do

                            relation that should make us as one, in the spirit of the Testimony ? Christ instructed men
                            to make the heart pure that they might worship God, as a Heavenly Father, in the beauty of
                            holiness. He established no ritual, formulated no creed, but gave as the essential criterion
                            by which his disciples should be known in every place, and at all times,�this new and simple
                            commandment,�that ye shall have love one for another. in Ihe selfishness of the heart men
                            had manifested a partial love for those who would return a corresponding regard, but to work
                            faithfully and devotedly for the spiritual interest of others without a stipulated reward
                            was a new feature in the religious experience,�a thorough test of the true disciple. Not by
                            the name which has grown up around us ; not by the separation which we have accepted, and
                            through this thrown ourselves out from the body of the world, shall we be known as the sons
                            and daughters of the living God, but by tests far more important in self-examinu'ion and
                            self-government which has for its guidance,�pure in heart,�merciful in spirit. A great many
                            good things may be said and a great many wise things accomplished, and yet the actor in all
                            this may be destitute of that spirit of purity which is so emphatically demanded to
                            establish him as a true disciple of the great Teacher. Christ at the same time speaks of
                            peacefulness. " Blessed are the peacemakers for they shaH"be called the children of God." A
                            great many sermons have grown from these few, simple words and learned divines have made
                            themselves eloquent in their zeal to repeat that which in reality they but feebly
                            understood. The peacemaker and the pure in heart must walk together. The one is not without
                            the other in the Lord. With the peaceable fruits of righteousness comes that quality of the
                            mind which allows nothing that engenders strife. With this will be found the spirit of
                            wisdom,�"first pure tnen peaceable and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.
                            " The abnormal phase of the subject is where we find contentious and fighting Christians. If
                            we are being crucified to the world as was the apostle, we shall have no fellowship with the
                            inheritance of the flesh. Kindness will then take the place of unkindness and we shall learn
                            the heavenlv lesson of governing the ton sue<pb n="235" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> and keeping unspotted
                            from the world. Without this power of Christian control over self and selfishness, without
                            this discipline that will render the mind pure and peaceable, the prayers and psalms and
                            exhortations Avill be of but little value. The spirit of Christ will be to those who receive
                            it "a savor of life unto life," while to those who neglect its inspiration and care the
                            ultimate is death. When Jesus found the Jews and Samaritans at variance with each other
                            respecting the place for the worship of God, he gave them to understand that the location
                            had very little to do with it. They might live in either city, ascend the top of any
                            mountain and yet the only worship that would prove acceptable must be from that class that
                            could manifest it in spirit and in truth. It must be iu harmony with the spirit of God and
                            the outgrowth of our lives while under the guidance of righteousness. This constitutes
                            religion and by this manifestation of the living spirit of Christ we shall stand honestly
                            and righteously before God and the whole world. </p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary. </head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Vegetarian" TEIform="index"/> A VEGETAKUN.</head><p TEIform="p"> [ Contributed by Elder F.

                                JJeM. A letter from Dr. T. R. Allinson to the London Times says : "Allow me to bring
                                under the notice of your readers some experiments I have just concluded to solve the
                                difficulty of feeding our poor in London and elsewhere. The cry is that food is so dear
                                the poor can scarcely live. This cry is true if they want to live on luxuries, but if
                                they will live on wholesome but plain and healthy fare they can do so for very little. A
                                little over a month ago I determined to give up all expensive articles of food and live
                                almost as cheaply as possible. Having left off flesh foods fer nearly two years, and
                                lecturing frequently on the question of food, I knew what to select. Looking over my
                                food accounts, I found milk, butter, eggs and cheese, with tea and coffee, were fairly
                                expensive articles, and none of them necessary, so I gave them up for a time to see
                                results. On Oct. 19th. I began my experiment, my weight was then nine stone eight
                                ounces. I continued this purely vegetarian diet for a month, when my weight was nine
                                stone three pounds twelve ounces or a gain of three and a quarter pounds. My friends
                                said I looked well; I felt well, and did my usual work the same as ever. I walked from
                                ten to fifteen miles daily, seeing patients or taking exercise. Here is an account of my
                                dietary, which cost me little more than a sixpence a day, and I could easily live for
                                less without luxuries : Breakfast consisted of a basin of porridge, made from a mixture
                                of oatmeal and wheatmeal, which I found more palatable than either singly. This I
                                usually ate with bread to insure thorough insalivation. Then came bread fried in refined
                                cottonseed oil or fried vegetable haggis. For drink I had a cup of cocoa or fruit syrup,
                                with warm water and sugar. The cocoa used was an ordinary one with plenty of starch in
                                it, which makes a thick drink, and no milk is than required. Dinner consisted of a thick
                                vegetable soup and bread, potato pie, savory pie, vegetarian pie, vegetable stew, stewed
                                rice and tomatoes, etc. For a second course I had bread, plum pudding, stewed rice and
                                fruit, baked sago, tapioca ajnd apples, stewed prunes, figs, raisins and bread. Tea meal
                                consisted of bread and jam, stewed fruit, or some green stuff, as water-cress, celery
                                tomatoes etc. I had only three meals a day, and frequently, when very busy, I had only
                                two, and a cup of cocoa and a biscuit for supper. I always use the whole meal bread, as
                                it is laxative and contains a great deal of nitrogen, which is thrown away with the
                                bran. The cottonseed oil is a cheap and good cooking oil, and is impossible to detect.
                                This diet I continued for a month, and now I only take the an-<pb n="236" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/>imal
                                products when out, not having- them at my table. " Now compare this diet with one of
                                flesh or a mixed one. The latest analysis shows flesh to contain from 70 to 74 percent
                                of water, the dry residue being A'ery rich in nitrogen, and it contains a little
                                carbonaceous or fatty matter. Hence, to live on meat alone, as much as eight pounds a
                                day is necessary. Then there are to be considered the diseases of animals which are
                                communicable to man if that flesh be not thoroughly cooked all through and as very few
                                of our animals live a perfectly natural life, most of them are more or less diseased,
                                especially the fat ones. The excess of nitrogen taken into the system in eating flesh
                                meat has to be got rid of by the liver, kidneys and lungs; hence these organs, are
                                overtaxed, and much disease is the consequence., in fact, were it not for flesh food we
                                doctors should have very little to do. Man living in towns can not afford to eat much
                                flesh, because he does not get sufficient exereise and oxygen to burn up the excess of
                                nitrogen. If he does eat this flesh, and if lie eat much, then he must suffer from many
                                complaints, such as indigestion, bilious attacks, congested liver, hemorrhoids, gastric
                                catarrh and other gastric troubles. If the habit be continued in gall-stones or urinary
                                calculi may follow, or rheumatism and gout. Then the kidneys become diseased and more
                                nrork is thrown on the heart, which becomes also diseased; the end is death by one of
                                the lingering diseases, which shows a diseased organ somewhere. E^en epilepsy and many
                                nervous diseases are aggravated by flush. Cancer is on the increase, and from some
                                observations I have made, it may be indirectly traced to flesh. Consumption lias only a
                                remote connection with flesh, it being due chiefly to the want of fresh air. Vegetable
                                food is cheap, contains an abundant supply nfriutrj. noent at first cost, and our
                                systems are so formed as to use it with least expenditure of vital force.

                                        but at all seasons of the year We do not understand by that feet that become
                                        cold accidently by standing in the street, on the cold ground, on the snow or en
                                        the ice, but we wish to speak of a condition of disease which consists in having
                                        the feet habitually cold. If a person cannot have the feet warm, in spite of
                                        warm felt shoes, in spite of woolen stockings, and these moreover in a warm
                                        room, and his feet are cold in bed during the night he is :n a condition of
                                        chronic malady, which is the cause of many other maladies. What is the cause of
                                        such cold feet? The physiologist would say that animal heat depends on the blood
                                        which gives out its heat to all parts of the body, and if the circulation is
                                        sluggish in any part, there is in that part a sensation of cold. In that chronic
                                        condition which consists in having the feet cold we have then a defective
                                        distribution of the blood. As the cold feet do not receive a sufficient quantity
                                        of blood, therefore they do not get a sufficient quantity of warmth, the
                                        nutrition of these extremities is perverted, some of their functions are
                                        arrested and organic troubles follow. Not only the part affected becomes
                                        diseased, but as a result other remote organs. To have the feet habitually cold
                                        is not the result of a deficient quantity of blood in the system ; the quantity
                                        exists, but it is blocked up in other places, in the arteries and veins. This
                                        ebbing tide of blood, which sometimes causes extravasations of blood has often
                                        been followed by dangerous symptoms. Thus we find hemorrhoids in men, and nearly
                                        all uterine affections in women, are due to habitually cold feet, and when these
                                        cease, the affections that follow disapx&gt;ear also. Habitually cold feet
                                        are the origin of many affections of the stomach. This unequal circulation of
                                        the mass of the blood often causes diseases of the liver, of the intestines, of
                                        inflammations and catarrhs of the stomach. This blood repelled from the
                                        extremities goes xery often to congest the lungs, organs which easily yield to
                                        sanguine congestions. And it can be said that ninety times in one hundred,
                                        diseases of the lungs are due to cold feet. Cold feet often induce difficult
                                        respiration and asthma; the heart becomes subject to palpitations. The
                                        congestion reaches the larynx, the head; from these the trouble extends to the
                                        brain and to the eyes.<pb n="237" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/>All these affections disappear when
                                        the feet are kept warm. It is to our own carelessness that habitually cold feet
                                        arc due. We systematically render ourselves ill. Even from the cradle they raise
                                        us to have cold feet. The stockings are thin and the shoes narrow with elastic
                                        tips, so that the blood cannut circulate in the feet; add to this the evil
                                        custom of having garters, and the general want of care for the feet, and it is
                                        easily seen why these organs revenge this treatment later. What is necessary to
                                        avoid cold feet, and to cure this infirmity when it exists? It is not well to
                                        give baths too warm to children; it is well to continue baths at all ages. The
                                        feet should be attended to, and infants should have loose shoes, without
                                        elastics, and then tlie feet will keep warm. If the feet have become habitually
                                        cold, it is necessary to have patience and not think that a trouble that has
                                        required twenty or thirty years to establish can be cured in one night. There is
                                        no specific for the cure of chronic cold feet. The cure of the evil pertains to
                                        natural therapeutics, as rubbing, vapor baths and walking. In this way warmth
                                        comes to the feet, and with it health returns. When the feet are warm it becomes
                                        easy to talk, for then the head is cool and the blood circulates freely. The old
                                        proverb which said that " head cool, feet warm and waist free may laugh at the
                                        doctors " finds here confirmation. An excellent vapor bath for the feet is made
                                        thus : In a small box put a jug of boiling water, and envelop this jug with
                                        cloths wet witli hoi water. Place the naked feet on �lats thai cover the box.
                                        and then envelop them with flannel. The vapor which rises from the wet cloths
                                        warms the feet and dilates the blood vessels ; thus the blood has more space to
                                        circulate, and the nerves are excited to action. After a certain time wipe the
                                        feet with a dry towel. It is well also to have at the feet, in the bed, during

                                    on its anniversary, was advised by a clergyman to look upon the audience as if it
                                    were so many cabbage-heads. The suggestion was not a bad one, provided the youth had
                                    thoroughly prepare.! the speech for heads with brains. The young man, though he d'd
                                    not know it, held in that nervousness, at least, one claim to a place among orators.
                                    For there is scarcely<pb n="238" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> a public speaker whose words move men,
                                    who does not feel a similar tremor every time he rises before a great audience" My
                                    throat and lips, " said the late Lord Derby, surnamed the "Hubert of debate,'' from
                                    his dashing, fearless style, " when I am going to speak, are as dry as those of a
                                    man who is going to be hanged. " Mr. Ma thews, in his essay on " The Orator's
                                    Trials, " has collected a number of cases to illustrate the fact that the very
                                    sensibility which gives the orator his power makes him aervously anxious before
                                    rising to address an audience. Patrick Henry usually began with a hesi. tating
                                    timidity, which continued until the excitement of speaking threw it off. William
                                    Pinkney, a haughty, defiant, and vehement orator, would turn pale when about to
                                    speak, and his knees would tremble, as though he were BeJshazzar, gazing at the
                                    mysterious handwriting on the wall. Even years of practice failed to repress this
                                    nervousness. It is fortunate for the orator that years do not do this. For without
                                    the sensibility which begets it, one of the forces of oratory would be wanting.
                                    Tristam Burgess, " the bald eagle of Rhode Island," while speaking, onjsome
                                    important question, in the House of Representatives, suddenly pointed his
                                    fore-finger toward his opponent and made a long pause. "Thatpause was terrible,"
                                    said a colleague to Mr. Burgess, on leaving the House. " To no one so terrible as to
                                    me, " replied the orator, "for I couldn't think of anything to say.'� " Nothing but
                                    strong excitement and a greaj occasion, " wrote Lord Macaulay while he was looked
                                    upon as one of the orators of the House of Commons, "overcomes a certain reserve and
                                    mauvaise horde [bashfulness] which I have in speaking; not a mauvaise honte which in
                                    the_least confuses me or makes me hesitate for a word, but which keeps me from
                                    putting my fervor into my tone or my action. " Dr. Storrs, the most finished of
                                    pulpit orators, whose extemporaneous sermons are marvels of rhetoric, thought and
                                    eloquence. It is said made a cead failure when he first preached without notes.
                                    After floundering for twenty five minutes, lie came to a full stop. "I sank back in
                                    the chair, " he said describing his mortification, " almost wishing that I had been
                                    with Pharoah and his hosts when the Red Sea went over them. " " My Lords, " said the
                                    Earl of Rochester, as he began a speech to the House of Lords, " I�I�I rise this
                                    time�My lords, I�I�I divide my discourse into four branches. My lords, if ever I
                                    rise again in this house, I give you leave to cut me off, root and branch forever. "
                                    The lesson taught by these incidents is this: The orator should master, but not
                                    eradicate, his nervousness. Canning, one of England's wittiest and most classical of
                                    orators, used to say he Avas sure of speaking his best if he rose in a great fright.
                                    The more his heart beat the more certain he was that the heart of the audience would
                                    soon beat in responsive sympathetic rhythm.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Wonders of littleness" TEIform="index"/> WONDERS OF LITTLENESS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> Pliny and Elian relate that Myrmeeides wrought out of ivory a chariot, with four

                                    lesson from this? Does it not teaoh that we are to offer to the Lord nothing but
                                    gold�pure true gold? What, then, is the gold which we are to give to God? Can we all

                            Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. The name of Daniel F. Beatty, of Washington, New Jersey, is
                            tolerably well known to the majority of the people of the United States in connection with
                            the manufacture and sale of musical instruments. By liberal and wide-spread advertising, and
                            by dealing direct with the purchaser, he built up a most extensive business in organs and
                            piaiios. It was his ambition to erect and own the largest organ factory in the world, and he
                            succeeded! in so doing. Bin: the hindrances and losses incident to a disastrous fire in
                            1881, and the want of adequate capital, combined with a lack of business method, led to a
                            serious entanglement in his affairs. Although he made and sold over seventeen thousand
                            (17,000) organs last year, his embarrassments, which dated their origin years before, became
                            so serious that he finally sold his business to a corporation composed of his creditors. It
                            is understood that this company, with ample capital, has undertaken to make good as far as
                            possible all the obligations of Mr. Beatty, giving preference to the purchasers of organsand
                            pianos whose goods arc still undelivered and to whom it is shipping daily their instruments.
                            The company is under the presidency of Mr. I. W. England, of ISew York, his manager being
                            Mr. W. 1'. Hadwen; and the gentlemen composing the directors and stockholders are among the
                            best known and most responsible business men in the country. All new orders, we, are
                            assured, are filled on receipt with instruments of the best quality; while arrearages

"By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition, and
by a careful application of the fine properties of well-selected Cocoa, Mr. Epps has provided our breakfast
tables with a delicately flavored beverage which may save us many heavy doctors' bills. It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist
every tendency to disease. Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating around us ready to attack wherever
there is a weak point. We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves well fortified with pure blood
and a properly nourished frame. "�Civil Service Gazette.
