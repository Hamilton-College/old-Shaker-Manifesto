                            11.</head><p TEIform="p">JAN. 4. Col. Nixon left this morning with his soldiers, for Russellville, having received
                            orders from head-quarters, last night. Col. Scott charged the pay-master to do better by us
                            than he did by Dr. R. We received $25.00 for corn; $100.00 for oats; $98.50 for beef ;
                            $48.00 for board bill of Officers, and $15.00 for milk, biscuits, etc. This amount was
                            passed to us in Confederate scrip, but we received no compensation for the wood that was cut
                            and hauled for them nor for anything that was taken, without orders, by the soldiers. During
                            the time of this encampment we lost several sheep skins that were tanned with the wool on,
                            also some horse collars and bridles. We try to be patient under all these trials. Through
                            the prayers of Believers we have been enabled to work patiently and this has influenced us
                            to be kind to the soldiers, and thus far we have marvelously escaped from all harm. For this
                            we have great cause to be thankful. After the soldiers were all gone from the Village, we
                            had time to reflect, and it pained us to think of the awful work, in which they were
                            engaged. Fathers and brothers in bitter conflict with each other, and doing all they could
                            to destroy life and property. We are praying for war to cease, and that a more substantial
                            government may be established on the earth, while the spirit of the Lord may find a place in
                            the hearts of the people. Col. Nixon was a careful reader of our publications, and Elder
                            John Rankin presented him with a "Millennial Church," and remarked,"I hope you may be able
                            to exchange the sword for a pruning-hook." A sick soldier expressed many words of gratitude
                            for the kindness that had been shown to him, while he was at our Village. SEPTEMBER <pb n="198" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 198 THE MANIFESTO. At one time while Elder Solomon was in company with
                            the soldiers, he was interrogated by them about our religion. Elder Solomon quoted some
                            passages of Scripture and then remarked,The Savior says, "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy
                            right cheek, turn to him the other also." These words were no sooner spoken than one large,
                            rough-looking man, struck Elder Solomon quite a hard blow on the cheek. The good man turned
                            around and the soldier struck him on the other cheek. This was a lesson in practical
                            Christianity and caused much amusement to those who were looking on. Jan. 29. Br. Urban
                            Johns goes to Bowling Green to ciiange some Confederate bonds into gold, which he does for
                            seventy-five ce.its on a dollar. Soldiers are passing on their way to Russellville, leading
                            horses which belonged to Scott's cavalry. About one hundred soldiers were killed, : nd these
                            horses escaped the sad fate of their masters. Br. Urban returns with an order from Gen.
                            Hardee, that no more forage should be taken from the Shakers for the use of the army. As the
                            country is under military law, we are now under the Confederate army. Jan. 30. Brs.
                            Jefferson Shannon and Cyrus Blakely, went to Russellville, to present two guns to the
                            Confederate Officer at that place, as the law now reads, "Every man with five hundred
                            dollars, shall either furnish a gun or pay twenty dollars." When it was learned that we had
                            only two guns for so many people, they told the Brethren to take one home. Jefferson and
                            Cyrus called on Capt. Williams, who was at the Village several days. He told them that most
                            of his men were sick with the measles. Feb. 4. Two doctors, Evans and Patterson, belonging
                            to Gen. Buckner's army, at Bowling Green, calls upon us to furnish hospital for their sick
                            soldiers, who were dying at the rate of ten each day. They wish us to accept from one
                            hundred to five hundred. The Brethren inform them of our crowded condition, since the
                            burning of the large building at our West family, but we would accept about twelve at a
                            time, and could take no more. The Physicians said they did not want their patients so
                            separated from each other, and they had asked this by the General's request, not by his
                            order, but the next time we may enforce it. Feb. 5. Br. Urban goes to Bowling Green, to
                            exchange some Confederate notes for gold. As our good Br. was on his way home, he was
                            accosted by some Texas Rangers, who had passed through our Village yesterday and called for
                            dinner, but the Brethren urged them to go to the Hotel, about one mile distant. This refusal
                            created a dislike toward us, and they stopped Br. Urban's horses. He asked them to explain
                            the object of their conduct. They replied,"You would not give us any dinner yesterday." At
                            this time, an officer, hearing the disturbance, halted to see what was being done. <pb n="199" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 199 The Rangers, fearing the officer, cursed Br. Urban
                            and then striking his horse, dashed off toward Bawling Green. Br. Urban was very glad that
                            he escaped with no more harm. To-day, we hear very distinctly, heavy cannonading in the
                            direction of Fort Henry. We count one hundred and three reports. Feb. 6. Soldiers are
                            passing through the Village, all day, in companies of two, four or six. They are moving
                            toward Bowling Green. Feb. 7. Fifty-two Cavalry pass through the Village, on their way to
                            the east. Army wagons are hauling corn for the soldiers. Elder Solomon met a Confederate
                            officer and asked him if the rumor was correct, that the Federals had taken Fort Henry. He
                            seemed very indifferent, but reckoned it was not correct. Sabbath, Feb. 9. A large company
                            of Cavalry and several army wagons, pass through the Village toward Bowling Green.
                            Thirty-two men with sixty-three horses, also go toward the same place. Then follow fourteen
                            wagons loaded with corn for the army. As the Cavalry halted in front of our dwellings, for
                            some little time, one of the Officers was heard to say,"Yes, yes, all these fine buildings
                            belong to them as a religious body. Every thing is held in common, as it was in the church
                            of the apostles. Do you not wish every body was like them ?" To this the answer came, ' 'If
                            we were like these Shakers, we would not be fighting the Yankees." Feb. 11. Two horses were
                            stolen from the West family last night, but no trace of them could be found. At about 2 p.
                            m., thirty horsemen halted in front of our dwelling. Elder John Rankin went to see what was
                            wanted. The Captain, McLemore, wished to know if the company could obtain a dinner. He was
                            informed that the Sisters would have dinner ready in fifteen minutes. We placed some tables
                            under the cedar trees, near the Trustees' office and the table was well furnished. When all
                            was ready, the Captain spoke in a low voice,"These are a religious and orderly people, and
                            we must be very quiet and orderly while at their home." After taking care of their horses,
                            they walked to the table in good order. They spoke in high terms of their dinner, as being
                            the best they had seen for a month. The charge was twenty cents each, which the Captain said
                            was cheap. (To be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Neither circumstances nor surroundings..." TEIform="index"/>

                            source of life's great good, To hearts beloved that here remain In Father and in Motherhood.
                            Dear guardians of that Mercy Seat. Brought out from types remote and dim ; That throne of
                            Truth where souls retreat For freedom and its morning hymn. We knelt in prayer, a circling
                            calm That held a central strength from heaven, Warm waves of blessing, mingling balm As
                            unction to our souls, were given. Ah, then it was within the veil, Parental supplication
                            rose, As perfumes, incense sweet exhale, When snow white lily leaves unclose. Our Mother
                            kneeling when we knelt But symbolized united hearts, Where Zion's every pulse is felt, Where
                            Zion's tide of blessing starts. Our duty saw no halting fear, The banner of the Light was
                            ours; An eager multitude drew near, As if to reach the holy powers. Our vision had extended
                            scope Through all that life's fruition mars, While reasons for each Gospel hope Were bright
                            as midnight's crown of stars. Plant faith, 0 God, the earth hath need, Of other harvest than
                            she bears; Glad rain, fair sunshine, and good seed Are folded in abiding prayers. Mt.

                            no sympathy with that doctrine. It seems like a childish speculation of intellectual minds,
                            who must have something to fill the void made by the absence of knowledge. Some people feed
                            on fiction till it seems more real to them than truth itself; then they begin to doubt
                            truth, because it does not fadge with their imbibed fictitious measure. True intelligence
                            will teach them better things. A true knowledge of spiritual states will eventually so
                            commend itself to reason as to cast out the fantastic and unreal. If the true is not

                            the language reputed as his, "I will go out as at other times before and shake myself," and
                            find few parallel cases wherein sin sinks a man farther away from God'. Kad the degradation
                            which he brought himself to, been pointed out to him at an early period of his career, would
                            he not have said with one of old, "Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?" yet
                            the position man attains and the character he makes for himself are no mere matters of
                            accident. Experience however, clearly shows us that falling away from integrity, is not
                            attributable to chance, but to deliberate choice; the rebellious will, the unstable
                            character: at first there is no intention of going far astrayjustI shall have a merry life
                            for a year or so and then settle down, but like a stone rolling down hill, we forget the
                            power evil habits have over us, and though we may have been instructed and warned, yet so
                            few will learn by any other experience than their own. Scarcely a week passes that we do not
                            read of young men going wrong; doubtless they supposed they had only to resolvenow I will
                            stop this folly and do right. It may have been, alas, the first temptation, and boasting in
                            the strength of young manhood they thought,I shall not yield again. How bold they are, but
                            lo, the next trying moment finds them again conquered and conscious of guilty shame; still
                            this class often overcome in the end. Each honest effort does them good. It is to the
                            indifferent person, having no desire than to be steeped in sin, that fearful apostacy from
                            God, that our best efforts should be made to save. The experience of the Shaker Church is

                            and the world. How few of the friends of early years can we now trace; one by one they have

                                answer it especially on your account mother, for I know you feel interested to hear how
                                we are getting along. We are all well and enjoying ourselves far better than we could if
                                we were back living in the old way. I tell you John there is rest here for the sinsick,
                                weary soul in our peaceful, swreet Shaker home and I hope you will be wise enough to
                                live a pure, celebate, virgin life the remainderof your days. As for myself I would not
                                change back again for all the money, land and houses you could offer me. You told me we
                                could not bear the restraint that we would be compelled to live under here among the
                                Shakers, but I can assure you after five or six months' experience that I never enjoyed
                                so much real true liberty as I have since I came among Believers. Here in this family,
                                we have people of all ages, from little Gladys up to Sisters 82 years old, and we are
                                living far happier than we ever could if we were scattered around in little private
                                families. We are banded together not for the purpose of merely getting a temporal
                                living, but we declare our religious principles before the world, thereby making
                                ourselves an object lesson for the world to look at and learn from. We are now holding
                                our religious meetings in the large meeting-house, all of the six families attend, and
                                the doors are open to the public. The Brethren and Sisters are all at liberty to express
                                their honest convictions. Here we are a free people, we shake off our old earthly sinful
                                conditions, and rise into a higher and more spiritual state of mind. I tell you the
                                freedom of the spirit is the highest kind of freedom. Now perhaps you will say that you
                                can enjoy this liberty in the outside, worldly life without joining the Shakers; you are
                                welcome to your choice, but for my part I prefer to come out boldly and declare my faith
                                and let the world know just how I stand. <pb n="203" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 203 I wish
                                to be known as one who has arisen above the animal or generative plane of life, and that
                                I have put the lust of the flesh under my feet. According to my belief there are two
                                orders of life there is the generative order and the spiritual order. By the generative
                                order I mean all those who wish to multiply and replenish the earth, strictly in
                                accordance with nature's lower law, having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
                                darkness, that is prostitution and abortion, or in any other way shirking the
                                responsibility of nature's requirements. This order is right for the Adamic man, and
                                there will always be plenty of people to carry on this work as long as the earth is
                                capable of sustaining material forms. The spiritual order is composed of those persons
                                who have risen above the desire for propagation. The more spiritually minded a person
                                becomes the less desire he has to beget or bring into life a natural offspring. The
                                powers and forces of the being flow in a higher channel, we have aspirations toward that
                                which is higher and better, we are living on the resurrection plane, that is in the
                                regenerative work. This is my experience, the more spirituality I have the less animal
                                desires rule and govern ; I think you will find it so. In your last letter you spoke of
                                married men being better than bachelors, now in a certain sense this may be true, for
                                they may be dissipated and live single only to escape responsibility, and to selfishly
                                spend their money on rum, tobacco and bad women. I claim that such men are not as
                                honorable as those who live in the married state; they have nothing to do with Shakerism
                                whose requirements are strict continence and self-denial. I know what the fruits of the
                                flesh are by my own bitter experience; but thank God I have risen up out of these low
                                groveling conditions which still cling to me, and then I will be free to progress onward
                                forever through the endless ages of eternity. With much love to you dear mother and

                            unfortunately is often unheeded. Because of failures in enterprises and engagements in the
                            affairs of life, courage oft goes down with disappointment. Prospects externally bright give
                            faith and hope ; yet, with the exercise of our best judgment and the application of our best
                            powers, human wisdom often proves inadequate to the accomplishment of the attainments and
                            objects sought. In human experience, this fact is verified:the battles of life are to be
                            met; they must and will come, bringing the invasion at our door. As it exists in the
                            temporal, so we find it in the spiritual. Many a traveler in pursuit of the treasures of the
                            spirit stumbles at the cross and fails <pb n="205" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 205 to obtain
                            the crown, because of the straitness of the gate and the narrowness of the way ; because
                            there are hills to climb and the paths oft rough and thorny; because of foes to encounter
                            and burdens to be borne, which imposes a sacrifice greater than he is willing to endure. But
                            vain is the effort to secure this endowment, without paying its full value by a total
                            surrender of all that is selfish, carnal and worldly. Eternal life is found only as we yield
                            the selfish. The yoke must be taken, and it is made easy by being continually and cheerfully
                            borne. Jordan must be reached and repeatedly entered for the baptism that gives complete
                            remission and the necessary washing. Failures in life, ignorant or willful, may be many; and
                            though they number seventy times seven, fail not to continue the strife; wrestle until the
                            break of day, as did the patriarch Jacob, and suffer not the angel to depart until the
                            blessing is reached. Oh, earth, earth! listen and hear the word of the Lord. Although it
                            bring heavy sacrifices, a satisfactory reward is sure to follow, commensurate with the
                            offering. As is the work, so will be the reward. No good effort will be unrewarded, and no
                            evil design or act will go unpunished. Therefore keep in view the wise motto,"Try again,"
                            and fail not to make it practical. East Canterbury, N.

' 'And fear not them which kill the body, but are
                            not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body
                            in hell." Matt, x., 28. AS it was the mission of Jesus the Christ to lead mankind from the
                            paths of unrighteousness into those of righteousness and peace, he must adapt himself to all
                            the variations of life in which these people might be found. He was a Teacher of the rich
                            and poor, the educated and ignorant, and no less of the old and young. At this time Jesus
                            was giving instruction to his disciples as he appointed them to the mission of teaching
                            others as they had already been taught. They were to put on the whole armor of God, and go
                            into the world fearlessly in the accomplishing of their duty, as sheep in the midst of
                            wolves. (Matt, x., 16.) Several of these disciples had already learned by experience what it
                            was to battle with the world, and to enlist in the Lord's army without fear. Others may have
                            embraced the gospel testimony, having this invitation at heart, "Wisdom's ways are ways of
                            pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." To inspire the several classes with unflinching
                            love for God was the divine work of the Teacher. <pb n="206" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 206 THE MANIFESTO.
                            While the disciples were to "beware of men," lest they should become ensnared through
                            flattery or threats, they were expected to do their duty and trust in the protective spirit
                            of God which had called them into ihe gospel work. Jesus had forewarned them of the dangers
                            through which they must pass. The Jews, said he, will deliver you up to the councils ; they
                            will scourge you in their synagogues. It was no child's piny to be an evangelist, and the
                            timid might well shrink at the thought of being imprisoned or of being scourged with thirty
                            blows upon the naked back with brutal fore-1, and each blow cutting deep into the flesh. The
                            disciples were also made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions, and hated of all
                            men. One might wonder at the determined zeal which could inspire the twelve to go into the
                            cities of Israel and deliver the gospel messages which were so well calculated to destroy
                            all the sensual pleasures of a selfish relation. After this wonderful preparation for
                            entering the gospel field, Jesus then adds another encouraging word by saying, "Fear not
                            them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul." The duty to God was made the
                            essential feature. Through this came the fulfillment of the promise of increased blessing on
                            the earth, and in the world to come, eternal life. The same spirit that whispered the above
                            word" also said to them, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give the * a crown of
                            life." God's will and work must come first, and the love or fear of God must conquer every
                            other form of fear. </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="B., H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.

                            of holiness and love. But what of the present? war, crime, slavery to ambition and lust are
                            rife in the land: evil is not confined to the innermost thoughts and feelings, but it is

                            children often become tainted with its pernicious influence. We exclaim like one of old,
                            "How long, 0 Lord, how long before wickedness and sin will be swept from the land, and
                            righteousness and truth reign instead," Poets have written and bards have sung of the good

                            presence. To attain unto this as a universal condition, will require a pentecostal revival

                            peace and well-being, should not the unfolding and development of a spiritual power bring
                            forth corresponding results, causing the "wilderness and solitary places to be glad, and the
                            desert to rejoice and blossom as the rose?" Most assuredly. Then may it be said of a truth
                            "ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills shall

                            each." As the flower is in the seed and only needs the careful hand of the husbandman to
                            nurture it till it expands into the bud, then on to the beautiful blossom, so with the
                            spirit of truth, though often concealed beneath the creeds and superstitions of a false
                            theology, yet it remains in its embryotic state, till the germ is touched with the sun of
                            inspiration and it bursts forth as a new revelation of the Holy Spirit, developing the God
                            life in man, creating a holy communion between the internal and external world, forming a
                            heaven upon earth, a paradise of God, the true Millennium. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            of the perilous last days, we may now feel justified without reserve in calling these the
                            special last days of which the good man made reference to his son Timothy. We are having all
                            the signs placed so prominently before us that we have no occasion for any guess work. Paul
                            very properly calls them perilous times as they are so objectionable to the mind of a
                            Christian, and he evidences this by saying that the people would be lovers of themselves,
                            covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful and unholy. The
                            apostle extends the list of sad deviations from right still farther, as the unfortunate
                            result of a life of unrighteousness. It must, indeed, be perilous times to any individual,
                            or family or society when it enters into one or more of those selfish relations which would
                            so soon dc moralize the mind. If this was to be the state of those who had not experienced a
                            call in to the gospel testimony of Jesus the Christ, it would be a fair representation of
                            what might be expected, more or less, to enter into his church as probationary or more
                            permarent members. Those who are "lovers of themselves," would without doulit be covetous,
                            and even this fractional portion of the list would be enough to bring "perilous times" upon
                            any large or small community. The spirit of selfishness and the spirit of Christ could not
                            under any circumstances be brought into fellowship. Covetousness in the church of Christ
                            would soon reduce it to the level of the world, unless there was sufficient vitality in the
                            religious body to expel it. The fierce war which is now going on between capital and labor
                            is the result of that state which was so clearly presented to the apostle. The rich and the
                            poor are alike covetous, and either class would willingly allow the other to suffer, if the
                            suffering would increase their advantages to accumulate wealth, or increase their dominant
                            privileges over the souls and bodies of men. From the day that Cain made himself the
                            possessor of the property of Abel, an incessant war has been raging among men. Cain
                            evidently wanted to increase his wealth, and to obtain this he put Abel out of the way,
                            which gave him an undisputed right. This same spirit of covetousness which finds a home in
                            the hearts of the "strikers" and no less in the hearts of those who are struck, engenders
                            outrage and murder in order that their own selfish plans may be consummated. Jesus was espe-
                                <pb n="209" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 209 cially a friend to the poor and gave his life
                            that he might raise them from their low estate. Although poor, he would have them become
                            peacemakers, and then become the children of God. The essential lesson to be learned by
                            those who accept the divine Teacher as their heavenly guide is, first, to be pure then
                            peaceable, and this, at once, would exclude the piofarve person, and those who are
                            unthankful. It was the admonition of the first Elders of our own church, that those who were
                            unthankful for the blessings which God gave to his people from day to day, be they few or
                            many, they were equally unholy. The lesson of thankfulness must necessarily be accepted by
                            those who would become the children of our heavenly Father, if they expected to gather souls
                            and be able to protect them from the sins of the world. There may, indeed, be "perilous
                            times" when children become disobedient to their parents, and under the Mosaic dispensation
                            a severe penalty was inflicted upon either the son or daughter that presumed to disregard
                            the advice of a parent. This was the discipline of the natural order when the faithful
                            father and mother stood as mediators between their children and their God. The apostle may
                            have had this in mind as he saw other conditions moving forward and with prophetic vision
                            determined the time when even the children would deviate so far from propriety as to be
                            disobedient to their parents. Entering upon the spiritual plane where a higher and purer
                            relation is manifested to both parents and children, he anticipates greater things for the
                            church of Christ and urges the immature minds with the care of a faithful
                            guardian,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord." This was a step in advance. The church
                            had accepted the children and these spiritual parents now asked that due obedience might be
                            rendered to them as it had been rendered to their parents in the order of nature. In our
                            Community home it is imperative that children should be obedient to their parents in the
                            Lord, as without the acceptance of this, there can be no foundation upon which to build an
                            honest and an honorable character. And as we say of children, we would as clearly say the
                            same of every adult who accepts the cross of Christ. Study the character of Jesus, who in
                            his ministration of the gospel work said to his disciples, "Learn of me for 1 am meek and
                            lowly in heart." And in addition to this bear the good apostle in mind who says, "First pure
                            then peaceable, easy to be entreated." In the acceptance of these Christian lessons, we may
                            escape those "perilous times" which are sure to overtake the careless transgressor.</p></div2><pb n="210" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Reign of peace" TEIform="index"/>REIGN OF PEACE.</head><p TEIform="p">''Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you."St. John, xvi., 27.

                                be brief, leaving room for something better. We are deeply interested in the war history
                                of our Southern Believers, and won der where the strength and courage lay for so much
                                "arduous and continuous" toil, with no hope for remuneration only in the consoling
                                thought, that kindness was being done to many poor soldiers, whose hearts lay not in the
                                work before them. The society must have been under Divine protection to survive
                                financially and physically after such a tax on time, strength, and material wealth. The
                                most interesting feature of our home at present, is the increased gathering at our
                                public Sabbath service, of a quiet, attentive audience. Speaking and singing are so
                                appropriately alternate, that nearly two hours pass before we are aware; and there would
                                be a still greater variety of gifts ifwell perhaps it is better to speak too long, than
                                to keep the good thought hidden. But monopoly in these days seems to be unpopular. We
                                see nor feel no deterioration, in our gospel testimony. Our confidence in its worth
                                inci'eases, and it is only left for us to add works to faith, patience and unselfishness
                                to works, and as Elder Daniel Offord says, "let the light shine through all our works,
                                financially, as well as morally and spiritually," and our spiritual strength would
                                gather and hold many who are sick of sin, and are willing to cast their all into the
                                Lord's treasury for the compound interest which they will receive. Health of family as
                                good as such hot weather will permit. Haying nearly done and harvesting of grain in
                                order. Our abundant supply c f raspberries are gathered, blackberries and dewberries
                                nearly gone, but tomatoes are fast ripening to fill the place. Surely with such abundant
                                blessings, gratitude should be the characteristic of our lives. Our Sunday School class,
                                studying the life of Jesus from the four gospels during this quarter, are much
                                interested in selected readings from "Ben Hur" on that subject, which, with its
                                beautiful description of life in the Orient, clothed in such rich language, makes the

                                North Family. Aug. 1894. Just a few hastily written notes, which I fear are too late for
                                acceptance by the tolerant editor and prompt compositors of our Manifesto. The good
                                Brethren have been rushing through the haying and harvesting; not only overseeing the
                                necessary hired help, but doing their full share of the laborious work. The weather has
                                been all that could be desired for gathering the crops: the last load of oats was
                                secured on the eleventh, a fair yield of hay and cereals, excepting wheat, which was
                                light. The Sisters have been kept quite busy harvesting; a nicely cultivated blackberry
                                patch in our north orchard has yielded twenty bushels of berries, two thirds of which
                                have been sold in the Pittsfield market, with other produce. Were it not for the dry
                                weather, we would have a fair yield of apples, as the orchards are in excellent
                                condition, all the trees having been trimmed in proper season. Those that have been
                                gathered are small; perhaps the winter fiuit will be larger. Tomatoes and sweet corn,
                                with other fresh vegetables are abundant; and our gardens show the diligent care of
                                those who handle the cultivator and hoe. Our public meetings have been largely attended
                                for three Sabbaths past; it was estimated that five hundred people were present
                                yesterday morning, and a more respectful, attentive audience could not have been
                                gathered in any house of worship. We find a growing interest in our own town to know and
                                understand more of our life and doctrines; which interest has been awakened by an
                                intelligent young friend of ours who is in business relation with Tilden &amp; Co.
                                She has been a constant attendant at our meetings, and says that many young men come to
                                our services who never step inside of any other church. We have discontinued exercises,
                                so it is not the external that draws them. We hope that many will be benefited by the
                                simple and sincere utterance of truth, and the offerings of praise and prayer rendered
                                to God, by those whose lives are consecrated to good, and who seek to draw all men and
                                women to the knowledge of right and the practice of every virtue. With universal love,
                                blessing and appreciation of every good word and work, I desire to strive with gospel
                                kindred for the unity of the Spirit of Christ. Martha J. Anderson. Center Family. Aug.

                                be seen and read of all tribes and nations, that the truth alone maketh free,  We are
                                encouraged to press forward and to give all that we have to the support of the cause,

                                overcoming power, and feel that we are made better for those strivings. Let us so live
                                that we can feel the treasures of heaven are ours. The first point is to staut right,
                                and keep in the heavenly pathway-it is plain. It is safe to walk uprightly. Success in

                                not to be done we should not think of doing. Among the pitfalls in our way, let us be

                                on the 6th of August 1774, Mother Ann Lee and her little band of faithful followers,
                                after a perilous voyage of several months across the ocean, all landed safely in the
                                harbor of New York. i Holding this event in pleasant remembrance a social service was
                                held on the above date. .A very interesting . programme of recitations and songs had
                                been prepared by a company of young Sisters, rest1ng upon the historical incidents that
                                transpired in the lives and in the Gospel work of Mother Ann and the Elders. To us this
                                eventIs One of, deep interest. Through it comes the blessing of our earthly home, the
                                religious element ofour Community and the anticipated hope ofa never ending work of
                                righteousness and • peace. From New York City they went to Albany, and then purchased a
                                tract of land in the town of Watervliet. -For several years the little family toiled
                                earnestly. in their new home, and were faithful witnesses of the gospel of our Divine
                                Teacher, Jesus Christ. Under the-blessing of God they were able to establish other
                                community homes where the Believers had dedicated themselves to the Lord. With the
                                coming of an early spring and its never failing seed time, we pleasantly antioipated a

                                we were unable to see the end from the beginning. From some cause the early potatoes did
                                not grow very large, which has prevented us from dig. gingmany of them up to the present

                                pleasure to 'an appreciative audience .of some two hundred persons. '.' Large companies
                                of visitors from the cities are with us nearly every day. Some of them dine in the

                                the maples. All want to walk about the premises' and see what the Shakers have in their
                                home, and if they are just like 'all other people. I wonder why the guides who accompany
                                these visitors do not keep a note book of the curiosities of literature, which could be
                                so easily gathered. A thousand and one questions are asked, and as many answers must be

                                of useful knowledge and much matter that saddens; yet all, stores the reflecting mind
                                with valuable lessons; even the most horrifying news has its moral picture, informing us
                                that virtue pays and "the way of the transgressor is hard." I am led to muse, should not

                                Christ's redeeming virtues to those who "Awake the powers of mind, of soul attuned, To
                                all the grand sublimities of life." We have harvested seventy-five tons of hay and
                                twenty tons of oats and barley. Having had a few lowery days, the plough made furrows
                                through some of the worn out land near our home, which means a fuller and more
                                productive hay crop in the future: and the question is, would not the cultivation of the
                                land near us be a good idea, while that afar off be sold? The general health of our
                                family is good, and as health strengthens virtue, the most valuable gem mankind can
                                possess. We are still cheered with bright hope that leads away from sorrow and

                                Our labor is now turned to herbs, of which we have a generous supply considering the

As I passed down the road to the ferry from Pleasant Hill to High Bridge over

                                the romantic cliffs, perpendicular walls, hundreds of feet high, which rise on each side
                                of this wonderful stream. This scene of cliff, tree, plant and flower, was one of
                                profound silence. Yet here was an invisible energy at work, sufficient to raise a
                                million tons of water into the upper air. From every crevice between the layers of rock,
                                sprang a tree or lesser plant, some so tiny as to be scarcely visible. Perfect peace and
                                concord reigned. No pushing, jostling or contention were here. Contentment and peace
                                pervaded the tiniest plant, the most inconspicuous shrub and the tallest tree. The
                                admirable and inspiring effect of this scene, was not produced by any one object, but by
                                the natural, spiritual combination of the sublime whole. All organizations, from the
                                tiniest plant to the tallest tree, from the smallest insect to the elephant, seem to
                                move in harmonious contentment with themselves and their environment. How beautiful, how

                                be satisfactorily explained to every rational being in existence. When Archimides
                                discovered the law of displacement, he exclaim ed,"Eureka! I have found it." This is the
                                point I profess to hail from in my experience : not as boasting by any means, but for
                                the comfort and encouragement of others who are dismayed at the pertinence of the above

                                Our dry-house and laundry wood-shed was burned on the 18th of July, ult. The laundryj
                                itself had a close call, but was saved by our tank and hydrant system. We have had two
                                field fires since, but neither was very disastrous. There is no clew to our first fire.
                                We have had no fire in the dry-house for three years. As each of the fires came far

                                for saying as our beloved Brother Peter Boyd used to say, '-'It is well it is no worse."
                                We are watering trees, plants and flowers daily and have been for weeks. Notwithstanding
                                we meet unpropitious circumstances occasionally, we manage to keep a good degree of
                                cheerfulness and good nature through it all. Our harvest is abundant. Hay extra good.

                                (16 acres) yielded about seventy bushels per acre. I have seldom indeed read any thing

The annals of time
                            bear many records of those who have fought victorious battles, who have slain their
                            brother-man, and have conquered nations without mercy, but few in comparison are the truly
                            great and virtuous acts of self-sacrifice and heroism which have have been universally
                            acknowledged. Society has too long honored the power of the sword rather than puiity of
                            heart and integrity of purpose. He who has not moral courage enough to defend the right and
                            battle with inward foes, is in truth a coward; though he win the plaudits of men. How very
                            pathetic, yet inspiring are the many accounts of the great philosopher Socrates, who
                            willingly met death, rather than yield his convictions. With what calm resignation did he
                            endure false accusations, and when comdemned to die, his chief accuser sent a private
                            message wherein was stated, that if he would desist censuring his conduct, he should be
                            delivered from death; but from deep religious motives, Socrates spurned such a degrading
                            act, and replied, "While I live I will never disguise the truth, nor speak otherwise than as
                            duty requires." Only the divine, the God-like spirit could have prompted this noble
                            utterance. Greatness depends not upon external power and affluence, but upon the conquest
                            gained over the lower elements of our being. When virtue stands forth preeminent in the
                            life, and all the energies of the body, mind and soul are devoted to the elevation of
                            humanity, then do we find our God and then do realize our heaven. When we have attained full
                            victory over self, then shall we realize the dignity of that true greatness with which all
                            that is denominated as such by the worldlyminded, will seem as fleeting shadows. Mt.

                            </head><p TEIform="p">The Phrenological Journal and Science of Health for August is exceptionally strong and
                                bright. Mary Shaw, the well-known actress, is [ the subject of the frontispiece and an
                                artistic phrenograph by Dr. Btall. John W. Shull gives a masterly analysis of Ideality,
                                with four handsome portraits showing great contrasts of development. Prof. Sizer
                                continues his series, How to Study Strangers, with character delineations of Prof.
                                Charles E. West and Hon. Edwards Pierrepont. Mks. Charlotte Fowler Wells reviews the
                                life and character of Prof. Benj. Silliman. An article entitled Ethics for Lovers, by
                                Grace Pierson, is a brilliant and vigorous arraignment of Mr. Bok, the editor of The
                                Ladies' Home Journal, for some of his views on courting. The contributions on hygiene by
                                Dr. Dray, ton and. others are especially interesting. The other departments present more
                                than the usual variety. Dr. Beall's editorials cover half a dozen pages of breezy
                                replies to contemporaneous critics, also an illustrated physiognomical study of the eyes
                                of Col. Breckenridge as compared with those of Annie Bessant. This will attract especial
                                attention among young bachelors aud maidens. Price, 15 cents, $1. 50 a year. Address the

                                Book is an answer to that class who have written against the wonderful work that was
                                accomplished by Moses in liberating the children of Israel. It is now a revised and
                                enlarged edition and has reached no less than "three hundred thousand." Such an extended
                                circulation is positive evidence that the book has been appreciated by interested
                                readers and certainly it can not fail to afford a fund of information, and at the same
                                time interest every one who appreciates the study of biblical history. Published by H.

                            writes;"I have been in this place for some time and have learned that it is not the place
                            for me. They are too narrow in their religious belief and they think it a great sin to marry
                            or have a wife, but I do not." We hope Br. Loiigley will write at once and have this fellow,
                            who is in distress for a wife, "hurry up" and reach the community at Mo. as soon as he can.
                            He certainly is too narrow for the Shakers and too ignorant to understand their religious
                            belief. The Shakers say no such thing, that it is a great sin to marry. Sin is a
                            transgression of the law, and the law almost enforced the men and women to marry. This man
                            who is ashamed to write his present address is evidently in the wrong place and is looking
                            for an easy job.</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="B., H. C." TEIform="persName"/>H. C.
