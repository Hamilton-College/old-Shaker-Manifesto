D,        Think that a cure is imr\ k I    ~p possible  just  because   the

TEIform="persName"/>OLIVER C. HAMPTON.</byline><p TEIform="p"> The Bible has this remarkable apostrophe which is put into the mouth of one of Job's
                            interlocutors. '' Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou knoAv the Almighty to
                            perfection? It is high as Heaven what canst thou know deeper than Hell what canst thou do?"
                            Still we have some ideas of God, though we must con i'ess that probably no two persons have
                            precisely the same views. We would not dwell very long on this difficult question as our
                            knowledge seems limited. But we will write some ol our impressions concerning the subject.
                            Pope in describing the finite objects and ideas he could see and think of around him and in
                            the Universe generally, makes this remarkable observation, viz : " All are but parts of one
                            stupendous whole, Whose body Natui e is, and God the Mill.' We seem to detect in every one
                            of the phenomena of Nature, signs of intelligence, benevolence, justice and eternal
                            equilibrium by which the forees of Nature are balanced and antagonisms.. or what would
                            otherwise be such, constantly restrained within such bounds are suggested by the twin
                            principles of Love and Wisdom. These principles are the moving forces of the Universe the
                            primary essence of our Father and Mother God. These are intelligent, spiritual, sympathetic,
                            emotional. These are male and female. In a word these are God. But we do not know whether
                            there is or is not a personal identity of these primary forces, distinct from the Universe
                            of visible manifestations which they seem to control. Indeed in which they seem to live and
                            move and have their being,�we do not care. However, our most satisfactory view is,<pb n="194" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> that there seems to be an unending category of individualized
                            Intelligences extending endlessly and infinitely higher and lower, and all located along a
                            line of everlasting evolution and progress to higher and higher conditions of perfection
                            toward which they will forever and ever approach, but never reach. We do not know and cannot
                            conceive of any end of this that would be satisfactory to the reaching party and therefore
                            do not believe there is any end. "'God is all of tin's visible and invisible phenomena of
                            Infinite love and wisdom, permeating all the realms of the Infinite Universe and moving it
                            on in all directions, towards eternally higher and higher, holier and holier, happier and
                            happier conditions. We mean the totality of this whole phenomena visible and invisible,
                            finite and Infinite, past, present and to come is directly or indirectly, God. God is
                            omnipresent, all present ; Omnipotent, all potent or powerful, and Omniscient, all
                            Intelligent." hrough all the world below, God is seen all around, Search hills, valleys
                            through, there he is found. i the growing of the corn, the lily and the thorn, The pleasant
                            and forlorn, there He's seen, there He's All declare God is there, [seen. In the meadow
                            dressed in green, there He's seen. " Now we can conceive of the personality of such an
                            Infinite, limitless being, in no other way only that all this vast Universe is His
                            embodiment. Is not this Universe the divine manifestation of Infinite Love and Infinite
                            Wisdom and so the image of the Godhead bodily? This is a subject too deep and goes too far
                            into the absolutely unknowable and incomprehensible for you kind reader or us to fathom.
                            Still in the infinite concatenation of intelligences from the lowest scullion in creation to
                            the highest Archangel, and yet there is no highest, Ave shall both be able to find friends
                            and helpers innumerable, for as there is no end to the Heavens, we shall never be in want of
                            myriads of friends and spiritual guides always ready and happy to lead, direct, help and
                            comfort us under all trials, sorrows and temptations and to gradually locate us in realms of
                            peace and rest.

                            Why hide ye your light ? The world is a presto All seeking the fountain of immortal youth.
                            Speak out! let us hear you, ye gifted and God-wise; Fear not lest the truth lose its value
                            when weighed; We might as well think that the smilighted skies Will be lost, ever lost, when
                            by clouds overlaid. If you have but a spark of celestial fire, Make a flame, by addition of
                            fuel and breath; At length it will spread its bright light wider, higher, And warm into life
                            those who're sinking in death. The worst of all states, all conditions, e'er found, The
                            incubus state of indifference is van; We may hunt the whole, earth and the universe round
                            For meanness,�'twill prove �n indifferent man. Then come up yc brave to the help of the Lord
                            ! Bring into his treasury offerings pure, And see if rich blessings are not your reward, Far
                            more than you have ample room to secure. Throw out strong inducements to get new
                            subscribers. We want a round thousand and more, and still more Of radiant readers, to be the
                            imbibers Of truths pure and glorious that we have in store. O ! is it not pitiful, with a
                            vast world full Of noble, intelligent, truth -seeking minds, That not one in a million, has
                            yet had a rightful Conception of blessings obtained at our shrine. Then let me beseech 3 ou
                            to work for the good, The faithful Expositor! Send it abroad Into every hamlet, for surely
                            it would Be to them, a rich blessing dispensed by the Lord. Don't let us grow faithless and
                            faint by the way, Nor think our good messenger can't be sustained; If we as a people intend
                            to bear sway In the tho'ts and opinions as now entertained, Or any that rise to enlighten
                            mankind, We need an Expositor stating them clear Then don't let it fail, men and women of
                            mind But keep the craft sailing the honest to cheer. And then the good laborers surely
                            should share, Of the bountiful harvest, from seeds they have sown; O, let us remember their
                            patience and care; Then we all may rejoice when the harvest is grown. Mt. Lebanon, N~.

                            consonant with my faith, and understanding of gospel principles. The true followers of
                            Christ cannot equal or excel the world in natural learning, and the investigations of
                            science, without devoting all their time to it, as many of them do ; that would leave the
                            true Christian no time to learn the gospel thus, such Christian professors would continue to
                            be like the world ;� simply natural creatures. Br. William Bussell, of Groveland, N. Y. once
                            wrote to me thus, "As he cannot be a true teacher of science who has not studied it, until
                            it has become, as it were, a part of his own being, " So, I think, no one can be a true
                            minister of the gospel of Christ, who has not practiced it until it has become his life
                            clement; his deepest interest, and greatest treasure. For a time, at least, under the
                            baptizing influence of the Holy Spirit, it takes all the power and attention of the mind
                            that can be spared from the performance of temporal duties, to learn and practice the
                            gospel. It is recorded that Mother Ann Lee said, "You should make the way of God your
                            occupation, the way of Ood is to be learned, as really as any trade; you learn to have
                            faith; you learn to believe ; a man who has a trade is industrious, to work at it, and make
                            a living ; and you ought to be as industrious, and as much engaged in the way of God." If
                            there is anything that can be called science, in this study, 1 know, by experience, that it
                            is as different from natural, or physical science, as day is different from night, or as the
                            spirit of God, or Divine Intelligence is different from the unintelligent element of matter.
                            And these natural sciences, and their literature, can never form any part of the gospel
                            message ; much less, mere human art, as painting, sculpture, fiction, which, in my
                            estimation, constitute mere rubbish, a lumbering hindi-ance to a child of God. What the
                            special advocates of a larger education desire is larger general and particular
                            intelligence, culture, which I believe we can all agree to, but, let it be confined to the
                            really useful and necessary. The Christian life is really the most intelligent, and most
                            useful life to live, and will develop all the intelligence an individual is capable of,
                            whether educated in book lore or not, that is, if lived earnestly, as exemplified in the
                            life of Jesus, and his true and faithful followers. Education, truly defined, consists in
                            drawing out, unfolding the faculties, and covers the whole ground of culture, directing
                            action, study, letters, investigation, practice, natural and spiritual culture�the formation
                            of character. As the physical body is first (so called) and is the medium for the growth and
                            manifestation of mind, so natural knowledge comes before the spiritual in order of time, and
                            is the medium of our proper relation to, and orderly connection with the affairs and duties
                            of a merely temporal life ; it is, also, to a great extent, the instrumental medium for
                            communicating the higher, or spiritual knowledge, from one to another. Peter and John were
                            regarded as unlearned, illiterate, but the teaching of Jesus, and the enlightenment of the
                                Ho-<pb n="196" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> ly Spirit, and the community of intelligence in their little
                            circle, more than compensated for lack of artificial training, such as Paul had, at the feet
                            of Gamaliel ; and though Paul counted all his attainments as dung and dross, that he might
                            win Christ, his developed and trained faculties became efficient instruments for good.
                            During minority, before the mind has matured to the period for the quickening of the
                            spiritual faculties, young people should diligently improve their opportunities to acquire
                            all useful knowledge possible : not as an end, but as a means for greater usefulness. The
                            more one knows, the easier it is to increase in knowledge ; but it is necessary, for our
                            best interest, to exercise a care as to what kind of knowledge.�Mere knowledge is not grace,
                            nor wisdom, intellectual culture ; educated talent, when consecrated to the advancement of
                            the Cause of Christ, is so much progress toward that eventful epoch when the Kingdoms of
                            this world shall become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ; " it is beautiful. But,
                            mere learning, or any grace of simple intellectual culture can never be appropriate as a
                            substitute for the graces and gifts of the spirit, which are ample to require the whole time
                            and attention to gain and cultivate, after we have become alive in the resurrectien element.
                            For, when a soul is waked up to God, to feel the need of being born again, it will feel the
                            need of crying to God as though there was no other soul on earth. It will have done with its
                            own way and will, and cry to God, knowing that it must be delivered, or die. We can conceive
                            intense prayer to be compatible with hand labor, but not with intellectual pursuits of the
                            literary productions of the world, nor with the philosophical investigations of natural
                            science. The two elements are as different as air and water. When a soul is born of the
                            spirit, then commences a spiritual education which can be but little assisted by natural
                            learning, none at all by mere worldly literature, and, if souls would progress in the new
                            life thus begun, the spiritual education should be kept in the lead, in all life's motives,
                            but, of course, with due regard to the duties and responsibilities of the temporal life.
                            Society has suffered much pecuniarily, and not a little spiritually on account of persons
                            whose calling was to do business, not keeping proper and correct book accounts of business
                            transactions, hence, it is a necessary qualification to lr-ive a good knowledge of
                            book-keeping; however, it is not needful, in a community, for every person to understand
                            book-keeping ; nor is it needful for every person to understand the science of astronomy, of
                            electricity, of mineralogy, etc., etc. But, eacli person should be qualified for positions
                            appropriate to talents given, and duties assigned, while those branches of science, or
                            philosophy, which prospectively, the individual cannot apply to life's duties and interests,
                            may, with propriety, be neglected, and the time and life be employed in those pursuits which
                            are needful to prepare for the Kingdom of God ; those important to the well-being and
                            happiness of the soul. Elder James Whittaker wisely said, "The way to labor for the Gospel
                            is, to keep your minds exercised in laboring upon those things which belong to your peace,
                            aud not upon the things of the world, that are not in the line of your duty ; for if you
                            give vour minds to labor upon such<pb n="197" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/>: worldly things, they will become
                            corrupt, ed. " Again, "I warn you Brethren, not to be overcome with the cares of this world,
                            lest your souls lose the power of God and you become lean and barren." This is the kind of
                            education needful for a Christian, again said Elder James, " I Avill tell you how you can
                            always know the way of God ; the way of God is always right against a carnal nature ; and a
                            carnal nature is directly against the way of God." However, natural learning does not appear
                            opposed to a carnal nature, though we all acknowledge that a degree of it is very
                            serviceable and necessary. The world of mankind will not gather to the Christian fold to
                            obtain that which they possess among themselves, and, probably, in a greater degree of
                            perfection, without the gospel; but for what the gospel contains which they do not possess.
                            Those who have not the gospel cannot get it only from those' who have it in possession. If,
                            when the world come to Zion, her children have not the gospel, that will be Zion's loss, and
                            the loss of Zion seekers. But, the earth has produced a few god like characters in the past;
                            and, we believe the future will be prolific of many, many more. The childhood of the race
                            has passed away from some advanced souls, and they have matured to the perfect dawn of the
                            kingdom of everlasting righteousness, whose teachers, or light bearers, shall not be removed
                            into a corner any more. And the judgment hath been given to the people of the saints of the
                            Most High, who will break the oppressors' rod, and reprove, or argue with equity for all the
                            meek of the earth ; and the curse shall be lifted from rhe sinner who will mend his ways ;
                            and their dominion shall be from ocean to ocean, and their kingdom and glory shall endure
                            forever. Your Brother, </p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Hollister, Alonzo G." TEIform="persName"/>Alonzo G.

                            that state they enjoyed paradise. As are the hands on the human body, so is the equality of
                            the sexes in the spiritual order. There is a right hand and a left hand, the right hand is
                            always first, the left hand is always second, and both hands are always ready to help each
                            other in bearing one anothers burdens, and so fulfilling the law of Christ, in ministering
                            to the wants of the body, which is the Church. Perhaps no one understood this law, better
                            than St. Paul Avhenhe said, " these hands have ministered to my necessities. " It is evident
                            that St. Paul, when nut engaged in preaching the gospel, labored with his hands. In case of
                            the absence or inability of the right hand to perform its office, in the natural body, the
                            left hand is always ready, in every emergency and under all circumstances to fill the place,
                            and make up the lack. So is the body of Christ. Two of each sex are appointed in this day.
                            This is the law govei*niug the equality of the sexes, in the spiritual Order, and there can
                            be no other, because it emanated from God, making the government a Theocracy. North Union,

                            " Luke, iv. 18, 19. * * * Without doubt we have here the key note to his entire teaching.
                            This was his gospel from first to last, whatever he may have said of an apparently different
                            tenor on special occasions. It is a derogation and an absurdity to suppose, as is sometimes
                            asserted, that Christ, finding this kind of teaching did not answer, changed his tone to a
                            "woe. " It may be reasonably supposed that Christ did not feel his way along, but that he
                            understood himself and his work from the first, and struck at once to the heart of his
                            business. This appears still more plainly as we realize that here at the outset, lie brings
                            out the whole divine meaning of the Jewish economy. It is understood that great numbers of
                            persons are still reading that purblind mass ot crudities known as the Mistakes of Moses.
                            Does the author of that book know what the Jewish system means when you get down to the soul
                            of it? Does he tell you that its key note is mercy, and that its method and aim is simply
                            that of deliverance and freedom from the actual ills of life? Does he tell you that it is a
                            system shot through and through with great redeeming and liberating forces? Docs he tell you
                            that it takes a nation of slaves, ignorant, barbaric, besotted in mind and degenerate in
                            body, and by a shrewdly adapted system of laws lifts it steadily and persistently, and bears
                            it on to ever bettering conditions, and always toward freedom? Does he tell you that from
                            first to last, from center to circumference, it was a system of deliverance from bondage,
                            from disease, from ignorance, from anarchy, from superstition, from degrading customs, from
                            despotism, from barbarism, from Oriental vices and philosophies, from injustice and
                            oppression, from individual and national sin and fault? Does he tell you that thus the
                            nation was organized in the interest of freedom, planned to secure it by a gradF.ally
                            unfolding system of laws, educational in their spirit, and capable of wide expansion in
                            right directions? Nothing of this he sees, but only some incongruities of numbers and a
                            cosmogony apparently not scientific. It is the peculiarity of Christ's preaching that he
                            pierces at once to the center of this great delivering system, and plants his ministry upon
                            it. He takes its heart, its inmost meaning and intent, and makes them universal. He draws
                            them to the front, leaving behind the outworn frame-work of laws and ordinances, and lays
                            them directly before the eyes of the people. "This is the meaning of your law, this is the
                            secret of your nation, namely, deliverance, freedom."' We cannot conceive a better Gospel
                            nor a profounder social order than this. It accords with the largest views of humanity,
                            whether it be scientific, historic, or religious. Science and history and religion tell a
                            like story of deliverance, emergence from the lower into the higher, struggle toward the
                            better, deliverance from evils, and so a passing on into righteousness and peace. Christ
                            supplements and crowns this order of nature and providence by his Gospel. "I have come to
                            save you in full, body and spirit, to make you free indeed by a spiritual freedom ; I have
                            come to declare that this deliverance, which is the secret of your national history, is to
                            become universal, the law of all nations, and the privilege of all men. " Here is a gospel
                            indeed ! The peculiar feature of this quotation from Isaiah, which Christ makes his own, is
                            its doubleness. "The poor,"�but men are poor in condition and in spirit. "The captives,
                            "�but men may be in bondage under masters or circumstances, and also under th'eir own sin. "
                            The blind, "�but men may be blind of eye and also in spiritual vision. " The bruised, "�but
                            men are bruised in the struggles of this rough world, and also by the havoc of their own
                            evil passions. Which did Christ mean? Both, but chiefly the moral, for he always struck
                            through the external forms of evil to the moral root from which it springs, and of whose
                            condition it is the general exponent. And he always passed on to the spiritual and to
                                which<pb n="199" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> external betterment points. He was no reformer, playing about
                            the outward forms of evil,�hunger, poverty, disease, oppression, giving ease and relief for
                            the moment. He does indeed deal with these, but he puts under his work a moral foundation,
                            and crowns it with a spiritual consummation. Dealing with these, he was all the while
                            inserting the spiritual principle which he calls faith. Unless he can do this, he is nearly
                            indifferent whether he works or not. If you cannot heal a man's spirit, it is a small thing
                            to heal his body. If you cannot make a man rich in his heart and thought, it is a slight
                            matter to relieve his poverty. At the same time, Christ will not separate the two, for they
                            are the two sides of one evil thing. Poverty, disease and misery mostly spring out of moral
                            evil. They are not the limitations of the finite nature, but the fangs of the serpent of
                            sin. To refer evil, physical or moral, to development, betrays clumsy observation. The
                            imperfection of development is a phrase the parts of which do not go together. In a true and
                            orderly development, every part and point are perfect. A half grown animal is never blind
                            because it is half grown, nor paralyzed because it is young, nor sick because it is
                            immature. In the natural order, evils come in when the development has been reached, and its
                            energies have ceased to act in full force. But those who contend that physical and moral
                            evils are the necessary attendant of what they call imperfect development, reverse the very
                            process from which they argue, placing them at the outset where they are never found in any
                            other order. Plainly we cannot reason from one to the other ; plainly there is a disturbing
                            element in human development, for which no analogy can be found in the physical and animal
                            processes. Human ills are not the sole products of ignorance, nor the chance features of
                            human progress, but the fruit of selfishness,� not an order but a perversion. And so Christ
                            sets himself as the deliverer from each, the origin and the result, the sin at the root, and
                            the misery which is its fruitage. Therefore let no man think that there is any gospel of
                            deliverance or helpfulness for him, except as it is grounded in the cure of whatever evil
                            there may be in him,�evil habits, or selfish aims, or a worldly spirit.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Gospel work like a river" TEIform="index"/> THE GOSPEL WORK LIKE A RIVER.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Whitcher, Mary" TEIform="persName"/> MARY WHITCHER.</byline><p TEIform="p"> The limpid stream rolls on O'er rocky beds and sandy plain-;.

                            Dorchester, ami at this time were anxious to get Lord Howe out of Boston. "On one Wednesday
                            night in March at about ten o'clock we took up our march over Dorchester Week M'ith one
                            hundred and fifty carts loaded with frames of forts, and bundles of brush. We planted three
                            forts on the hill that night, and at day-break we left the hill that the British might fire
                            at it. The. next night we went again and in the morning left only a guard. The third night
                            we went and kept the hill, and the next day which was Saturday they did their best with
                            their cannon from every battery, firing .all night and killing only four men. " He says they
                            did not fear the landing of the British as the Americans had seventy barrels filled with
                            sand, which would have broken their ranks if rolled down the hill. " On the Sabbath all
                            these war vessels left the place and on the next day the American troops marched into Boston
                            to take possession of what had been left by the enemy. A few horses nearly starved, and some
                            cannon spiked. The Churches had been used for stables and in which to train their light
                            horses. "We tben marched to New York. where we had another view of Gen. Howe; with his fleet
                            and red-coats on Staten Island.', The British through much bloodshed captured Long Island.
                            It was now thought impossible to defend and hold the city of New York and Gen. Washington
                            ordered the removal of all the continental stores to Kingston. " During some two weeks,
                            every night, these stores were silently conveyed to a place of safety. The transportation of
                            fifty cords of wood which remained in the upper part of the city was not considered
                            advisable, but was ordered to be given to the poor who lived in that vicinity. The zeal of
                            appropriation at this lime was commendable and in fifteen minutes the wood had passed into
                            as many divisions as there were poor people to accept it. Issachar now belonged to the
                            brigade commanded by Gen. Fellows. This was stationed in the Barracks three miles above the
                            city. In the latter part of August he accompanied these guards, as fifer, to the city and
                            expected to return in about twenty four hours. For two days they had no food and no one came
                            to relieve them. On the third morning eight British ships were under sail, three moved up
                            the North River and five up the East River. The three ships that sailed up the North river
                            each sent a broad-side as<pb n="201" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> they passed the guards. Two hours later
                            there was a fearful cannonading as the British poured their cannon balls into the city,
                            hoping to destroy the retreating American soldiers, Gen. Putman however reached the guards
                            and dismissed them with the word to take care of themselves. They then numbered four hundred
                            men, and these fled in all directions Issachar says, "For my parti took my little drummer,
                            Jpmes Elliot, a nice lad of fourteen years, and started up the North River to get our
                            clothes, hut we found neither barracks nor clothes, but we found a distressed body of men,
                            waiting to surrender themselves to the enemy. Small parties came running to us, that had met
                            the enemy, and everybody asks. " What is the news?" "We are all cut off and we have no
                            commander. " Soon after a Colonel of some regiment came to the place and-advised the men to
                            parade, rank and file. They now numbered some two hundred. For some time they stood in
                            position waiting the advance of the enemy. Several persons became uneasy and left their
                            ranks for the river, which they hoped to swim across and escape. " While we stood here
                            waiting for the ceremony of surrender, an Irishman stepped out of the ranks and addressed
                            the Colonel as follows ; Dear Colonel I am thinking it will be of no use to stay here and
                            wait to be taken, for I am thinking we will be taken fast enough if we go along. Very well
                            replied the Colonel. I will make a proposal. We will all march into that grove and lay flat
                            on the ground. Nothing will come there except a small flanking party and we can force our
                            way through that body. But no nankins: party came to disturb us and after the army had
                            passed along, we all up and ran away. " The happy thought of this poor Irishman in this case
                            saved some two hundred men from imprisonment, if not from death. After a run of one and one
                            half mile they halted, and were suddenly treated to some shot and shells from the British
                            ships then in North River. They then hurried on for a distance of nine miles till they
                            reached the American army. For three days Issachar and the little drummer boy were without
                            food, and then obtained a little by begging. After a night's rest in a barn atKingsbridge,
                            they moved on to another station, where they tarried several weeks. As the soldiers remained
                            but a few days in one place they were called The Flying Camp. As the stores and baggage were
                            moved these soldiers were sent to guard them. " At White Plains the British came upon us and
                            we had to fight to protect our stores. We held our place for three days, long enough to get
                            our stores out of their reach, although we lost a number of men. " These marches continued
                            till they had passed some forty miles from New York, This prudent retreat is worth a passing
                            notice. "All our stores and baggage covered more than an acre of ground. There were hundreds
                            of barrels of liquors, rum, brandy, wine, etc., also sugar, m61asses, pork, flour and other
                            articles bought in the city of New York. The whole of this underwent no less than twenty
                            removals, with the British at our heels. " The retreat occupied several weeks, and yet the
                            loss of stores was but a mere trifle. In 1777 Issachar was at the battle of Princeton and
                            Trenton, under Capt. Warner, and had enlisted this time for three months. He was next under
                            Capt. Stockwell at Bennington Vt. Then sent with some guards to look after the sixty two
                            British regulars, five hundred Hessians, and thirty seven tories captured by Gen. Stark; at
                            Bennington. A Church served for a prison. The tories were yoked together with ropes fastened
                            to their necks and driven to North Hampton jail. The other prisoners were guarded in this
                            place for some time. Issachar is next found at Saratoga guarding those taken from Burgoyne's
                            army. He was next at Fort Edward. Soon after this Gen. Gates issued orders for the guards to
                            return as Burgoyne had capitulated, and " you may be assured that we t ok a lively start and
                            lny fife seemed to produce a remarkably joyful sound. " The soldiers were now dismissed and
                            returned to their homes. (TO BE CONTINUED.) </p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Trust in God and do right..." TEIform="index"/>Trust in God and do right...

                            certain piece of work that day. I thought what are thanks worth ? They are simply an
                            expression of gratefulness to the donor for some favor received. The Bible teaches us in
                            every thing to give thanks and informs us that, whosoever is unthankful is unholy, but,
                            whosoever does any good deed with no higher motive than the thanks and praise of those with
                            whom they are associated, work for very poor pay and evidently love the praise of men more
                            than the praise of God. It was said of Jesu?, tw his reward is with him and his work is
                            before him. " He said, his meat and drink was to do his Father's will and his reward, in so
                            doing, was a continual increase in the resurrection, with a constant self-sacrifice of all
                            that constituted the world until he was able to declare, " my Father loves me for I do
                            always those things that please him. " He said fcnto his disciples, "be of good cheer I have
                            overcome the world." and to the Father he said, " I have finished the work thou gavest me to
                            do. " No praise, no thanks of mortals can take the place or be the reward of the rightful
                            heir whose whole soul's interest is in the household of faith and in all the consecrated
                            interests of whatever name or nature. The rightful heirs are not, cannot be hirelings, but
                            are joint heirs with their Lord and Master to an inhe: itance corruptible undefiled and that
                            fadeth not away. When an individual becomes a follower of Christ; all duly becomes a blessed
                            privilege for which they are thankful to do good continually. Canterbury, N.

                            the Jews�a natural people, were scattered through the nations of earth, yet remained a
                            distinct people, so will Shakers, a spiritual people, be distributed amongst all nations,
                            kindreds, :ongues and sects, yet not be numbered with any. In the First Appearing of the
                            Christ Spirit to man, ruling by might and power, their Representative, Jesus, said, "My
                                kingdom<pb n="204" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> is not of this world, therefore my servants will not

                            Representative, Mother Ann Lee, said, " Let the potsherds of the earth dasli against the

                            nor vote. Yet pray for the peace of the Nation whither the Lord hath cast your lot, for in
                            its peace ye shall have peace. " The Sovereign People should vote for Measures, not Party
                            nor Men. PLATFORM. 1. As Grant recommends, extend the Presidential term to seven years, with
                            no re-election. 2. Continue appropriations. 3. Allow the President to approve a part of any
                            bill. 4. Then add Woman Suffrage, Prohibition and land Limitation, with National
                            Arbitration. " liighteousness exalteth a Nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people."
                            Therefore make Women and Indians citizens. Work toward the equalization of property, thus
                            lessening poverty, removing the temptation to crime and putting war afar off. Do right. Let
                            the people have nothing to light for or fight about. Let men dig for bread, not walk for
                            money. Landless people are the . raw material of war. Make every man and woman a landlord or
                            landlady, thus ending wars. The work of righteousness is peace, and the effect of right
                            doing is quietness and assurance forever. Give us a Republic in fact, as well as in theory,
                            and all the Governments of earth will become Republics. Heretofore, men and women have been
                            held in speaking distance by blind instinct and physical passion. Hereafter, let them he

                            Apostle also says : " Without holiness no man shall see the Lord. " To be holy is to be
                            pure, even virgins. It was a virgin company that John saw standing on Mount Zion. If we
                            become defiled with sin, our virginity is gone, and we are not justified or saved, until
                            that sin is canceled, and the stain washed from the soul by true repentance, with confession
                            to God before his witnesses. This has always been the manner in which God has dealt with his
                            people ; the way by which they found forgiveness. Under the law they verbally, confessed
                            their r&gt;ins to the Priest, and brought offerings for atonement. Many came to John and
                            were baptized "confessing their sins. " When the apostles were gathered at Jerusalem on the
                            day of Pentecost, many came confessing and " showing their deeds." Further, we are exhorted
                            to bring our deeds to the light that they "may be made manifest that they are wrought in
                            God." It is said of some, that they will not come to the light " lest their deeds should be
                            reproved." As we cannot hide from God, this hiding must be from his chosen" witnesses. He e
                            it is that we " mortify our members which are upon the earth," even every earthly desire,
                            and thereby obtain the grace of true humility which is found in its fullness in no other
                            way. The gift is noticed with the peculiar blessing of God, for, "He resisteth the proud but
                            giveth grace to the humble. " In this spirit we find that true repentance,<pb n="205" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> which enables us to forsake sin and live a new life. Again we accept the
                            words of Christ when He .says ; " Except a man forsake all that he hath he cannot be my
                            disciple ;" also, "If any man will be my disciple, let him deny himself, take up his cross
                            and follow me. " We are required to hate fathers, mother's, brothers, sisters, husbands,
                            wives and children, more than all this, our own lives, also. Not that we are to hate the
                            individuals ; but rather that life which constitutes these relations. In order to hate our
                            own lives, we must practice self-denial until it becomes a pleasure to separate ourselves
                            from all sinful indulgences, where our dispositions would crave gratification ; thus prove
                            ourselves the servants of Christ according to his word, " Ye are not of the world, even ^ as
                            I am not of the world. " We must follow our Lord in the regeneration, not in the oldness of
                            the letter, which killeth, but in newness of life ; not in the course of this world, in the
                            gratification of any passion or lust. It is written, " They that are Christ's, have
                            crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts ;" and again, " There remaineth a rest for
                            the people of God. He that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
                            works as God did from his. " We believe the fall of man consisted in yielding to time
                            insinuations of lust, and this passion .has debased him below the brutes, for they keep the
                            order of nature. This, even the lust of the flesh, is that beast which " sitteth in the
                            temple of God," showing himself that he is God. " See that ye defile not the temple of God,
                            which temple ye are. " This shows us where the temple of God is. Who hath not bowed to the
                            god of lust in this temple? Paul said the married care for the things of the world, how they
                            may please their companion, while the unmarried care for the things of the Lord.�This
                            forgetfulness of God's law, being the state where man first fell from God, here the
                            resurrection must take place. As it was the spirit, not the body which died, so it is the
                            spirit that must rise again. Hence, we "turn the battle to the gate, " to overcome our
                            inbred foes. Under the reign of the Prince of Peace, we are not called to meet our fellow
                            mortals in deadly strife ; but to crucify our own inbred passions whence these enmities
                            proceed ; thereby gain the true love of God. This love enables us to speak words of peace
                            and comfort to all. It changes the warrior to a man of peace. It teaches us to love our
                            enemies and to pray for those w ho despitefully use us. Merely believing these things will
                            not save us ; but practicing this beautiful faith every day of our live-, brings salvation
                            from sin, and the full assurance of perfect redemption from the very nature and likeness of
                            the fall. Surely, with this prospect before us. we have a right to rejoice in the heavenly
                            songs of Zion ; for truly we have found the way of holiness and deliverance from the
                            servitude of sin. And now we ask, Where is the soul that is weary of sinful pleasures ?
                            Where the soul that hungers after righteousness? Are you willing to meet God's require-'
                            ment, and forsake all for the kingdom of heaven, for Christ's sake, and the gospel? To such
                            we would say, "Come, 20 with us, and we will do you good ; for<pb n="206" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> the
                            Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel," and concerning his Zion on earth. Here is found
                            the power to lay hold on eternal life and keep it constantly in possession, while dwelling
                            on the earth ; yet above earth's sordid plane. Here we find heavenly comfort in all the
                            trials of life, a balm for the wounded and sorrow stricken spirit. Yet we know that, "
                            Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that
                            find it. " Canterbury, N.

                            the seashore. Being overcome with fatigue, he sat down on a rock. He fell into a slumber,
                            and the following vision passed before his eyes. The Angel of Life stood before him, and
                            said, " Seest thou those muffled and veiled figures in human form coining out of the mist on
                            the distant shore of the sea?" " I see them, " replied the youth. " Watch them attentively,
                            " said the Angel. "They have a lesson to teach thee. It is a lesson of wisdom Be silent, and
                            obey. " The youth kept his eyes on the muffled and veiled figures. They approached the place
                            where he was sitting. There were twelve of them. They said not a word; but walked silently
                            along the shore. On their white, flowing drapery the youth saw inscriptions written in
                            characters of light, very beautiful. They moved mysteriously along, and silently glided into
                            the thick mist that lay stretched out before them. Tlie youth looked again; and saw twelve
                            other figures, muffled and veiled as the first had been, approaching him. They walked
                            silently along, with slow and pensive steps, and approached the place where the youth sat;
                            and he saw that their drapery was also covered with inscriptions ; but they were impervious
                            to the light; and they silently glided away, as they came into the thick darkness beyond.
                            The youth turned to the Angel beside him, and said, " 'Who are these muffled and veiled
                            figures, and why are some of them clothed in bright, shining raiment, covered with
                            characters of light; while the others are in darker raiment, and the characters on them are
                            also dark, as they move silently and pensively away ?" " The muffled and veiled figures, "
                            said the Angel, " are the hours of mortal life. The figures in white drapery which thou
                            sawest, are the hours which thou has spent in well-doing, and serving thy fellow men ; and
                            they bear the record, written in letters of light, on their drapery. The dark figures are
                            the misspent hours ; and they carry with them the record of hours spent in folly and
                            idleness. Be not surprised that thou shouldst meet them again ; for they are the mysterious
                            emblem of which time i� made; and they be.'.r on their garments the records of Eternity. ' "
                            Grod works in hours, " says the wise old proverb. The days are made on a loom, of which the
                            warp and the woof are present and future time. " Time is the warp of life, he said; O! tell
                            The gay, the young, the fair, to weave it well." Our moments pierce into eternity; and he
                            was a wise king who said, in those sad tones that have rung down to us through the ages, " I
                            have lost," not crowns and kingdoms, but " I have lost a day ! " The wisest of men have
                            always remembered that time is the warp of which life is made. "I have always been careful
                            of my time,' said Franklin. "Take care of the minutes and the hours will take care of
                            themselves. The sun does not wait for his hat and his boots, but gets up at once. " "You are
                            welcome to my library, my horses, the walks on my grounds, everv thing that I have the power
                            to bestow, " said a wise statesman, lately departed, to his guests ; " hut my time, you must
                            not ask me to part with that; it is all that has made me what I am; and if I have done any
                            good in life, it has been done by taking care of the hours, and by "setting a trap to catch
                            the minutes." Washington was one of the most punctilious of men with regard to time. He once
                            asked the French ambassador to dine with him, and said, " Sir, will you please to remember
                            that we dine precisely at one o'clock." The ambassador arrived at the more fashionable hour
                            of two; and Washington said to<pb n="208" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> him, " Sir, our dinner hour has past,
                            and our guests are departed, f believe I told you our dinner hour was at one o'clock. I
                            should have no other apology to make to the king himself whose ambassador you are. " The old
                            citizens of Philadelphia used to say that they always knew when the old clock on Liberty
                            Hall was going to strike two; for Washington would be seen making his appearance, riding
                            round the corner, on horseback, just at that moment, by the clock. His presence was clock
                            enough for the whole city of Philadelphia. " This is a picture of Sir Edward Lonsdale, "
                            were the oft repeated words of a woman who acted as guide to visitors to a famous country
                            house, in England. As they walked through the portrait gallery of the mansion. " He improved
                            his time, was successful in business, and, by prudence and industry, amassed a large estate.
                            Here is a picture of his son; who wasted his time, squandered his money, became a beggar,

" It is to the

                            value. To the Christian pilgrim on his upward march through life, faith is a reliable staff.
                            To the Mariner on the tempestuous deep when the angry surges roll and toss his little
                            barque, and every moment would appear to be the last; how in faith he throws himself upon
                            the mercy of a kind and beneficent Father, hoping through that faith, to be saved from the
                            perilous deep. So it ought to be with us that are young; who have just started the Christian
                            race, we ought to have a faith strong in God ; so that in the day of trial we could say with
                            our blessed Savior, " Get thee behind me Satan," I will have no part with thee. If we have
                            strong faith in God and in the principles of right, we are building a structure whose
                            foundation is solid and firm. Without faith it is impossible to please God. " It is not
                            given to one condition or age, and with held from another. It is for us that are young as
                            well as for those of riper years. By the forcing of small roots into the earth the towering
                            tree is firmly established to brave the tempest, and so faith grows with each individual
                            effort until it becomes a permanent indwelling principle.

                            of our souls and prevent its bright rays from beaming upon us, or shall we by divesting
                            ourselves from every thing impure allow it to shine with its benignant mildness and be the
                            ruling principle of our lives ? Oh ! could we, instead of indulging in the natural
                            propensities of a fallen nature which is death to the soul; contrast the difference between
                            love and hatred, could we realize how beautiful the one and how odious the other, we would

                            it is to love and be beloved. Pure love is a plant of heavenly origin, and shall we not
                            cultivate it with care, and repel the opposite? I believe there are oceans of love to bathe

                                interested, not only, in his own salvation, but also in the protection and salvation of
                                all men. To pass from sin into righteousness or from death into life is the work which
                                becomes manifest on the acceptance of life from God. All desire to be saved from that
                                which leads to unhappiness and to rest assured that salvation is the ultimate of life's
                                journey. Those who accept the :amc of Christian usually make earnest protestations of
                                their belief and confidence in the redeeming qualities of the work. It should not only
                                accomplish this but as the reward of obedience, "Save his people from their sins, "
                                rather than as many may teach�in their sins. If this became the established rule, to
                                destroy sin by a righteous life, this active working principle would then be a growth in
                                righteousness which could easily be made manifest. How very singular it is that the way
                                of the cross or the highway of godliness should present so many phases of discipline, so
                                many forms of belief and so many systems of sacrifice. Even though it may be of a very
                                diffusive quality and its particles may be caught up and appropriated, so that those who
                                have gathered, one, two or more grains are led to suppose that what they have obtained
                                is the best, and sometimes the only acceptable treasure, yet this fractional amount may
                                point toward the spirit of righteousness in which they incline to rest in perfect
                                satisfaction. St. Paul in his earnestness to maintain a just relation towards the wise
                                Master builder, speaks out boldly and clearly by the inspiration of God that wells up
                                from his own heart, " God forbid,&gt;T said he, "that! should glory save iu the
                                cross of our Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the
                                world. " What a noble declaration of faith I While so many were found to glory in the
                                Avorks of unrighteousness this faithful apostle becomes a witness for the Church of
                                Christ, a living member of the resurrection order. There was no mystery around this
                                cross that presented1 the least doubt to his mind. Ho very well knew that to be
                                spiritually minded Avas life and peace, and he quite as Aveli knew that to be carnallj
                                minded was death to the soul. For him to accept the spirit of regeneration, was at tlie
                                same time, to be crucified to the world, as a life in the spirit and a life in the flesh
                                could not be maintained at the same time. " For Avhat fellowship hath righteousness
                                Avith unrighteousness, and Avhat communion hath light Avith darkness." Whatever may have
                                been the views entertained by the apostle at a previous date, in respect to the Church
                                of Christ,, or the cross by which came salvation, he Avas now thoroughly decided
                                respecting the course he should take and Avas equally bold in proclaiming it to all who
                                would give a listening ear. The cross of Christ Avliich is the embodiment of the life of
                                Christ has for its mission,�"to make an end of sin and to bring in everlasting
                                righteousness.' Religious organizations with a bundle of creeds, or Avith a system of
                                ceremonies would fail to hold even a distant relation to the Church as known by the
                                disciples. Whatever may be the advantages ot<pb n="211" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> the world, it is an

                                the work has fared much better than many other papers that have been rescued from the

                                document can hardly be doubted. " That it belongs to the second Century and not farther
                                from the birth of Christ than one hundred and sixty years. We Avonder that such a care
                                should be exercised over those few pages of the octavo volume that was so fortunately
                                brought to the light, while the other articles are but feebly noticed. That the Apostles
                                teaching is a good moral lesson and well worthy of our attention, is readily admitted,
                                and whether written in the first, second or third Century may not be of so much
                                consequence as that it teaches the principles of righteousness. This passage in the
                                fourth chapter is peculiar, "My child, him that speaks to thee the word of God remember
                                night and day, and thou shalt honor him as the Lord ; for where that which pertaineth to
                                the Lord is spoken there the Lord is. " This harmonizes very pleasantly with the advice
                                that Paul gave to the P'phesians. "Children obey your parents in the Lord ; for this is
                                right. " Eph. vi., 1. This illustrates a consistent Christian separation between the
                                parents of generation and those of the regeneration. All may be teachers and demand
                                attention, may be faithful and honestly devoted to the order in which they belong, but
                                while one points toward the kingdom of God and its righteousness, the other gathers its
                                blessings among the earthly treasures. The attempt to serve two masters has not proved
                                conducive to spiritual interests. The only safe course for the Zion traveler is to "
                                seek first the kingdom of God, " and this instruction whether found in the New Testament
                                or in the supposed teaching of the Apostles will be quite safe to follow. We shall hope
                                that other writings may be found which will prove of value in making many wise unto

                                        moment you observe this, go to your room and stay there; keep it at such a

                                        hundred degrees of Fahrenheit. In addition, put your feet in water, half leg
                                        deep, as hot as you can bear it adding hotter water from time to time for a
                                        quarter of an hour, so that the water shall be hotter when you take your feet
                                        out than when you put them in ; then dry them thoroughly, and put on warm thick
                                        woolen stockings, even if it be summer, for summer colds are the most dangerous;
                                        and for twenty-lour hours, eat not an atom of food; but drink as largely as you

                                        to throw discredit on a Vegetarian diet is the statement that its impossibility
                                        is demonstrated by the formation of the teeth and other structural evidence.
                                        "Comparative anatomy," they say, " shows distinctly that the human teeth and
                                        intestines are constructed with a view to the digestion of flesh, and not of
                                        vegetables. " The answer to this very fallacious argument is simply a denial in
                                        toto. Flesh eaters are utterly mistaken in their rash assertion. Thej' have only
                                        to examine their authorities carefully to discover that the comparative anatomy
                                        to which they appeal establishes beyond doubt the frugivorous, not the
                                        carnivorous origin of man. "The natural food of man, " says Cuvier, "judging
                                        from Ms structure, appears to consist principally of the fruits, roots, and
                                        other succulent parts of vegetables. " This opinion is corroborated by that of
                                        Linnajus, M. Gassendi, Hay, Professor Owen, Professor Lawrence, and a host of
                                        other authorities. Even without scientific testimony, the fact that the apes,
                                        who are nearest akin to us in the animal world, are frugivorous, is a strong
                                        indication that flesh is not the natural food of mankind, </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Dietetic Reformer" TEIform="index"/>r-Dietetic Reformer.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sunshiny rooms" TEIform="index"/> SUNSHINY ROOMS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote"> We have heretofore spoken ot the great importance of pure sunshine. No

                                        every room in a dwelling should have the windows so arranged that some time
                                        during the day a flood of sunlight will force itself into the apartment. Never
                                        mind the fading carpets. Better lose the color of the caipets than the color of
                                        the cheeks. The importance of admitting the light of the sun freely to all parts
                                        of our dwellings cannot be too highly estimated. Indeed, perfect health is
                                        nearly as dependent on pure sunlight as it is on pure air. A sun bath is of more
                                        importance in preserving a healthful condition of the body than is generally
                                        understood. It costs nothing, and that is a misfortune, for people are deluded
                                        with the idea that those things only can be good or useful which cost money. But
                                        remember that pure water, fresh air, and sunlit homes, kept free from dampness,
                                        will secure you frorn many heavy bills of the doctors, and give you health and
                                        vigor which no money can procure. It is a well-established fact that people who
                                        live much in the sun are usually stronger and more healthy than those whose
                                        occupations deprive them of sunlight. And certainly there is nothing strange in
                                        the result, since the same law applies with equal force to nearly every animate
                                        thing in nature. It is quite easy ty arrange an isolated dwelling so that every
                                        room in it may be flooded with sunlight some time in the day, and it is possible
                                        that many town houses could be so built as to admit more light than they now

                            religious home, we have prepared the following brief summary. Further information may be
                            obtained by addressing any member of the order. 1. The form of government in the Society is
                            adapted to the different orders of which it is composed : its powers and authorities growing
                            out of the mutual faith, love and confidence of the members. 2. No one is excluded from the
                            privilege of becoming a member on account of poverty ; nor will they be accepted because of
                            wealth. 3. Plain and explicit facts will be laid before the investigator. To become a
                            member, is a voluntary concession of the individual. 4. Those who accept the privilege to
                            reside with us, as well as those who visit the Society as inquirers, are expected to regard
                            the rules of the family where they are entertained. 5. By the principles of this Society, no
                            believing husband or wife is allowed to separate from an unbelieving partner, except by
                            mutual or legal agreement. G. Parents that become members are not required to give up their
                            children : but they will be requested to see that the children keep the rules of the family.
                            Minors are never taken under the immediate charge of the Society, except bv the request or
                            consent of those who have the lawful right over them. 7. No corporal punishment is approved
                            in the government of the Society, nor any external violence exercised on any rational
                            person. 8. It is expected that the children admitted into the Society, will receive an
                            education suitable for the general management of business. !). Probationary members may
                            retain the lawful oAvnership of their property, but the interest accruing therefrom will be
                            devoted to the benefit of the Society, until by their own free will, and the consent of the
                            Trustees, they shall consecrate said property to the support of the family where they
                            reside. 10. The Society will not be responsible for debts contracted by persons, previous to
                            the time of their membership. 11. Those who dispose of their property to relations in the
                            Avorldly order, should remain with those relations. 12. A person Avishing to become a member
                            of the Society, must rectify all his Avrongs, and discharge all just and legal claims. 13.
                            Those who ask for admission to our Home are supposed to be in search of more truth and
                            light, hence, an important principle in the Shaker Church. j&amp; is the confession of
                            sin to God, in the presence of a Avitness. 14. Those Avho have dedicated their property, and
                            afterAvard Avithdraw from the Society,�according to the laAV of justice and equity, there
                            can be no ground for retraction. 15. To live as Brethren and Sisters in the gospel of
                            Christ, Ave can hold no private correspondence. All communications sent from or received
                            into the family, Avhether printed or Avritten, will be subject to the examination and advice
                            of the Elders of the family. 10. The leading authority of the Society is vested in a
                            Ministry, consisting of tAvo Brothers and two Sisters. Elders and Trustees are also
                            appointed. These orders constitute the general government, of the Societv, in all of its
                            branches.</p></div2><pb n="215" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/><div2 type="hymn" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Song of praise" TEIform="index"/> SONG OF PRAISE.</head><p TEIform="p"> Hancock, Mass.

                                Problem considered a priori. By William Hanson. Extra cloth, $1.00. Fowler &amp;
                                Wells Co., Publishers, 753 Broadway, New York. This is a bold attack by a clear-headed
                                observer and most candid writer on leading points and arguments made by Mr. Henry
                                George, in his well known "Progress and Poverty" atid " Social Problems." Mr. Hanson is
                                as radical as the Laud Reformer himself, in his views of the fundamental changes
                                necessary to true social progress, and has a warm sympathy for the purposes of Mr.
                                George, but his sharp logic brings into clear light the errors that mar the reasoning of
                                the books above named, and shows how inconsistent and impracticable are the methods of
                                reform advised therein. For instance, he analyzes Mr. George's theory of Interest, and
                                "Law of Rent," and also his remedy for landlordism, and points out their unsoundness and
                                injustice in a concise fashion that everybody can understand. The same vigorous handling
                                is marked in his consideration of the work of Mr. Henry Dunning Macleod, "Economics," a
                                powerful treatise in itself, but shown to be based upon assumptions that are
                                unscientific. " The Ethics of protection and Free Trade" constitutes one essay, in which
                                the principles of the two great parties that stand arrayed against each other on the
                                Tariff question, are reviewed in the light of political responsibility, and what
                                constitutes true national progress. The final essay, " The Industrial Problem considered
                                a priori," looks into the essential merits of the subject, that has to some extent been
                                considered in the preceding essays; but this time the argument is purely deductive, and
                                impartially points out wrong doing and mistakes on both sides�on the part of the
                                capitalist, and on the part of the work�and fearlessly admonishes both with regard to
                                their duty. The work is written for the people, from the point of view of the practical
                                man and Christian philosopher who is consciously radical, but seeks to make his every
