                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 8.</head><p TEIform="p">Union between the Brethren and Sisters. Having discussed quite fully the manifestations of
                            spiritual gifts, we "will cow make reference, more directly, to the course which was pursued
                            while establishing the Society upon its present foundation. The Church of Christ is a
                            spiritual body of Believers, who have consecrated their souls and bodies to God.. This
                            consecration was by no means a sudden, change. It developed in the hearts of the I'elievers,
                            from day to day, and from year to year, as they were able to accept the light of God into
                            the soul, and to. become crucified to the life of the world. To sacrifice the selfish
                            relations of the world to be a follower of Christ, was the breaking away from all that
                            claimed a union with the old inheritance of the flesh. Father Joseph, while organizing the
                            Society, was anxious to preserve a spiritual union which would make of men and women of the
                            world, a consecrated body of Brethren and Sisters. Through the teaching of the New Testament
                            he had learned that "The man was not without the woman in the Lord," and that the union
                            which was to be supported must be from a pure heart, and afford protection from every evil
                            result. In the business relations of the Society, the Brethren and Sisters had been united
                            in their interests for the peace and prosperity of the whole order. But the establishing of
                            "union meetings" did not take place fill the year 1793. These meetings consisted of some
                            half dozen or more of Brethren and about the same number of Sisters, who were free to
                            converse upon any subject of interest, that came within the boundaries of their religious
                            order. This season was limited, generally, to about one hour, and a part of this time was,
                            if desired, devoted to singing. Directors were appointed to take charge of these seasons of
                            "union," that a wholesome order might be preserved, and a blessing rest upon the Community.
                            In these meetings, the Brethren occupied a position in line, and the Sisters sat directly
                            opposite, at a distance of a few feet. The orderly character of the meetings, and the
                            general diffusion of intelligence became<pb n="26" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> so profitable and satisfactory
                            that they were continued for more than forty years. The children were sometimes admitted to
                            these meetings, or if their caretakers thought best, other forms were provided for them, in
                            which they could read or sing or make recitations of Scripture texts, as occasion offered.
                            This education was considered very essential as a foundational work for their future
                            membership in the Church of Christ. In the government of this unionprivilege, Father Joseph
                            was very careful to give the best protective advice, and as a rule, taught the Brethren that
                            no one was worthy to sit in conversation with his gospel Sisters, if he harbored hard
                            feelings, or was, in the least at variance with any of the Brethren. At an earlier date, the
                            experience of those who formed the Society was of a superior order. They had passed through
                            much tribulation, and many deprivations, that they might be able to accept the full cross of
                            Christ, which would so effectually harvest them from the elements of the world. They had
                            "tasted of the good word of God," and were qualified to make a good use of it. Whatever
                            changes might take place, they could not be so inconsistent, as to be thrown out. The gospel
                            to them was "the power of God unto salvation," and they secured it in hearts consecrated to
                            the gospel work. It became necessary, from time to time, to introduce changes into the order
                            of the family to meet the present conditions, and to secure the best results that might be
                            developed in a religious Community. But let the location or condition of individuals be what
                            it may, in respect to the external order of union, the true work of the gospel admits of no
                            selfish union between any members who have entered the Society of Believers. This has been
                            plainly taught as the uniform faith of the Church, and on its faithful maintenance, depends
                            our spiritual prosperity. FOOD. After having given an account of the formation of the
                            Society and an outline of the spiritual movement during several years, we will now turn to
                            the many departments that so essentially aid in the maintenance, and in the prosperity of a
                            Community. In the early history of the Society, the people were sometimes reduced to a very
                            simple fare, as their provisions were almost wholly the product of their own farm. Instances
                            are recorded when bread and broth formed the greater part of the meal, and indeed, when even
                            this frugal repast was reduced extremely low. At other times potatoes and bread, with a
                            small quantity of bean porridge was all that could be afforded. As the people increased in
                            financial prosperity, every other temporal blessing moved along in the same ratio. At this
                            early date a liberal use was made of swine's flesh, especially during the winter season. As
                            industrious farmers, they made every acre of land which they tilled, produce an abundance,
                            and in a very few years they were able to use all that was needed, and also to bestow much
                            upon the poor. Tea and coffee were freely used, and at noon a liberal sup-<pb n="27" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> ply of good cider. It might be quite difficult for us to judge those hardy pioneers by
                            what we may be able to do, as they had many advantages that have not fallen to our lot. As
                            we look back and view the road over which they traveled, we not only become interested, but
                            we wonder at their power of endurance, as the largest part of them walked upon the earth for
                            nearly a century, before they said their last farewell. The chewing and smoking of tobacco
                            were used wTith the same freedom as the cider and the pork. As this was the universal custom
                            of the people, it came with them into the Community, and remained with them till they
                            received more advanced light on the subject. Very little thought was given to the study of
                            Hygiene, and still less to the food which they ate from day to day. Hot biscuits and butter,
                            with meat, potatoes, cabbage and turnips were sometimes served for breakfast, while for
                            dinner, they had pork steak or beef, with the vegetables of the season. For supper, many
                            preferred bread and milk. Pies were on the table for breakfast and supper, but rarely for
                            dinner. Previous to the year 1823 the table was set with pewter plates, while the bread was
                            placed on plates made of wood. The supper on Christmas, and frequently on the Sabbath, was
                            the most sumptuous meal, as roast fowl, various kinds of pie, cake, preserves &amp;c.
                            were served, agreeably to the custom of the country in those days. Since the above date,
                            crockery made of porcelain has been more generally used. In the year 1841 a great change
                            took place in the preparation of our food. Swine's flesh was wholly removed from the table,
                            and the Society avoided the use of all kinds of meat or fish on the Sabbath. Butter and
                            bread and milk were not partaken of at the same meal. Cider, which had been used on the
                            table till the present year, was almost wholly abandoned. In these sacrifices there may have
                            been a deprivation to some persons, while at the same time it was a great advantage to the
                            body of Believers as a whole. Our table has not been wanting for variety in good
                            substantial, healthy food, and this prepared in the best and nicest manner. Simple though it
                            may have been when compared wdth those who abound in wealth, yet we know that it has
                            abundantly supplied all our needs, and for which we thank the Giver of all good gifts. Our
                            table now is set with some kind of meat or fish, or eggs, and all the vegetables of the
                            season, and these served in a variety of ways for taste or pleasure. With these come the
                            various sauces and condiments. The apples, cherries, plums, peaches, cranberries &amp;c,
                            &amp;c, are made into sauce or preserves and used as occasion requires. Although we may
                            have no rule to regulate the number of articles of food which shall constitute a meal, we
                            think it requires some caution on the part of the cooks, to see that they do not place
                            before the family too many kinds at one time. The use of foreign tea and coffee has been
                            dismissed several times, but after an interval of a few months has<pb n="28" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/>
                            returned in all its freshness, to its former place on the table. During these terms of
                            departure the family has used instead, a, tea made of sage, of strawberry leaves, cross-wort
                            or of Liberty tea, and a coffee of burnt crust or rye or of the root of the Avens. The
                            injurious effects of drinking strong tea or coffee have often been discussed, and Believers
                            have always considered it wrong to become the slave of any habit. If the use of cider and
                            swine's flesh were discontinued, as articles not condusive to the general health of the
                            individual, then why retain the tea and coffee which might be equally injurious. For many
                            years but very little tea was used at the last meal of the day, except by those advanced in
                            years, and the free use of either tea or coffee, at any time, by the younger class has been
                            much discouraged. As a substitute for this, some used milk and water, while others confined
                            themselves wholly to cold water. (to be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Walking with God" TEIform="index"/> WALKING WITH GOD.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Avery, Giles B."

                            and a Heavenly Mother, revealed by the Mother spirit of Christ,�A Heavenly Bride. All souls
                            who follow Christ, by denying themselves of alj. sinful pleasures, and, for Christ's sake,
                            lay down their worldly, sinful lives, thus, become the "Children of God." As a dependent
                            child of earthly parents walks with the parents for help and protection, so th? children of
                            God, feeling their dependence on their Heavenly Father and Mother, seek th^ guiding, helping
                            hand of God. The child of earthly parents cannot, with confidence, seek the guiding, helping
                            hand of its parents excpt it render obedience to their commands, even so the children of God
                            cannot, with confidence, look for aid, guidance and support from their Heavenly Father and
                            Mother, unless obedient to their commands. God's laws are purposes of good deeds done to all
                            the creation of G od; therefore the soul who walks with God, is devoted to do good, and good
                            only, to all of God's Creation* as far as the. limit1 d pow'/rs of th? chil 1 of (iod
                            extends. Thus, to walk with (iod leaves no room for the love of, and uplifting of self at
                            the expense of the oppression and injury of a feliowcreature of God's creation ! The
                            children of (iod, who walk with (iod, are led by th? Heavenly Parent's hand to heights
                            overlooking the narrow bounds of mere s�lfish possessions, to peer out upon the broad iields
                            of humanity, and scan human needs; they behold all phases of human suffering, the fruits of
                            disobedience to God's laws, and,- in heavenly sympathy, are ready to administer relief, to
                            the extent of their powers of body and soul. Souls who walk with God are freed from the
                            lusts of sensuality, for, in godly paths there is no room, no place for desires opposed to
                            godliness. God's laws are their life's guide, their love, their will and pleasure. The child
                            who walks with God sees<pb n="29" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> all the castles of sinful pleasure perish in the
                            using, and vanish as the morning dews before the rising sun ; and, in lieu thereof, behold
                            eternal mansions, reared in righteousness, in supernal glory, outshining the midday sun in
                            its midday splendor. To a soul who walks with God, the voice of the tempter is hushed, and
                            dumb is the tongue that would promise pleasure in unrighteousness ! While the sinner who
                            pursues selfishness and gain, at the expense of the loss of his brother man, and piles up
                            wealth upon wealth, pilfered from his neighbor's board, and pleasure adds to pleasure at the
                            expense of his neighbor's sufferings, the hand of God is weighing out a store of just
                            retribution, that will fill the sinner's cup of woe to overflowing. But the soul who walks
                            with God is led through the fields of Paradise, and from those grateful spirits who have
                            been blest by such soul's labors of love, mercy and charity, pour forth paeans of blessing,
                            thanks and love, thrilling the soul with bliss. It is as impossible for a soul who walks
                            with God, to wantonly or consciously injure a fellow-being, as for the sun to shine at
                            midnight, for God's love is manifest in goodness to all the objects of his creation!
                            Sufferings for violations of God's laws, are God's goodness manifest to prevent the
                            repetition of disobedience ! The soul who constantly walks with God, is ushered into the
                            magazine of the powers of the heavens, and can take therefrom, supplies sufficient for every
                            need. Such souls dwell in realms of heavenly light, and all their works are seen, by eyes
                            that are clairvoyant to the truth, to be in support of righteousness. Such heaven-born souls
                            have ears clairaudient to the enrapturing music of the heavenly hosts, and their beings are
                            thrilled and infilled with heavenly delights when associated with kindred spirits. They may
                            have errands of mercy to perform, when they must sorrow with the afflicted, mourn with those
                            who mourn, and weep with those who weep ; but, anon they return for recuperation to the
                            happy mansions of the blest! Oh Zion, Zion, a suffering sin-laden world lies blanching on
                            the barren plains of disappointment, and suffering of the inanition of the blessings of God
                            ! The cry of a class of semiawakened souls goes up to Heaven for aid. It is time for the
                            children of God to put on their laboring attire and go forth to lead them home to God. Zion
                            fellow-travelers, let us reach forth more eagerly to grasp the hands of our Heavenly
                            Parents, that they may lead us to the storehouse of God's bounteous treasures to supply the
                            wants of hungry souls, and draw therefrom to bestow upon the needy ! Let us be found walking

                            pathway of thy autumn days. Why should we wait until the earthly end, To blindly reach
                            across the jasper w all, The wealth, the blessing that should now descend, The benedictions
                            that should on thee fall? Affection's tokens fill each rolling year, They come like planets
                            fair to gem thy dome, The true, the just thy uprightness revere; But more than fame to thee,
                            is love of home. From east and west, from islands of the sea, From lands afar beyond the
                            belt of waves, Ccme messages of love and thanks to thee, For nobly sending forth the word
                            that saves. True to thy call to preach unto the world, That place of bondage and of spirit
                            needs, To show the serpent in the roses curled, And hurl swift thunderbolts against the No
                            fear, no tie, no favor could deter [creeds, Thy valiant spirit from the conflict strong,
                            Unflinchingly it faced the powers that were, And bravely used its sword on ancient wrong.
                            Integrity and zeal perhaps are stern; They are thine armor, warm the heart below; Up through
                            thine eyes we see its home fires burn, And in thy kindliness we feel their glow. The earth
                            demands such saviors as thou art; Myrrh and frankincense will not banish sin, Tis fire from
                            heaven that will cleanse the And consecration, life anew begin. [heart, 'Twas work, 'twas
                            battle that thy ardor taught 'Twas deep repentance where God's mercies flow, 'Twas Babylon's
                            confusions brought to naught Ambition, pride and selfishness laid low. 'Twas angel purity,
                            pellucid, bright, The word of life revealed, not man-construed, The dawning of the day, not
                            sunset light, The large unfathomed faith that still renewed. The hope that on the present
                            laid its balm, Healed the dull wound and soothed the rankling pain, To grief's wild tempest
                            gave the magic calm, And soaring, breathed a full triumphal strain. That hope, no
                            storm-glooms could obscure or dim, It cleft the darkness with its sabre rays, And gave the
                            future's broken, distant rim A coronet of jewels all ablaze. Dear Father, how we prize that
                            glorious hope, That cheiftain-spirit, that the hights would scale, That never stooped in
                            fallacies to grope, And never knew the coward's watch-word, 'fail!' Swift as the eagle's
                            glance o'er cloud or fen, Thine eyes discerned the work that was of God, And knew the
                            structure that was reared by men, And smote it with the angel's gifted rod. Whate'er of
                            Christ or holiness the claim, Lofty in whiteness, or in whiteness low, Thy test of purity
                            was still the same, For loathsome leprosy, is white as snow. The test was in thy soul, the
                            work it did Gave doctrines by the dual-Christ revealed, Henceforth in thee were treasures
                            shown and hid, Because thy call by sacrifice was sealed. What is the mountain's crest above
                            the storm, And what the sea-ward river's constant tide, Or mellow autumn sun diffused and
                            warm, Compared with lives by travail glorified? Think not our love has placed thy worth too
                            high, For thou art Zion's, none can swell the claim, And long as truth is blazoned in the
                            sky, Bright in her galaxy shall glow thy name With those of saints Mrho suffered. Earth may
                            pass, Andheaven be brought together like a scroll, Yet shall they shine above the sea of
                            glass, Within the deathless regions of the soul. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In this age of free thought, free speech and action..." TEIform="index"/>

O Union thou great source of strength ever abide with us, for
                            thou art our life, our all ! Union is the great keynote, which gives tone, life and zeal to
                            any undertaking. Have we not realized how harmoniously we progress when all are united in
                            heart and spirit for the interest of each other and the glorious cause in which we have
                            engaged ? Herein lies our success or defeat. If we are caretul to cultivate this heavenly
                            gift, we shall surely reap the increase thereof, Love, Joy aud Peace. Our journey in time is
                            too short to admit of needless strife and discord, a contending for petty rights, which
                            could so easily be banished by laying aside all selfish claims, aud bracing ourselves more
                            firmly against the graud, nobh; cross of self-denial, ''in honor preferring one another." In
                            this we find the entrance to the beautiful valley of humility, where flowers of hearts-ease
                            are always growing. The kind word and pleasant smile generally indicate that we are
                            traveling to this safe retreat. We can safely say that it behooves every Christian to let
                            their light shine in this respect. No matter how small our efforts may be to promulgate this
                            Union, we shall realize the truth in these few lines :� "Union brings increasing pleasure,
                            Union gives us life and zeal, Union fills as without measure, With the joys we love to
                            feel." Thus the fruition of each succeeding conquest over self is plainly discernable, not
                            only to us individually, but to all with whom we may come in contact. Kentucky's beautiful
                            motto, k"United we stand, divided we fall," should be engraved upou the tablet of every
                            heart. For a house divided against, itself cannot stand, but if it is strongly united with
                            the bonds of love and union to the Christ-life, there is nothing of earth that can prevail
                            against that house, for it is built upon a sure foundation. The motto of our great republic,
                            E pluribus unum, (one composed out of many,), gave rise to the term United States, denoting
                            that we as a nation, are a United people ;� and we, as religionists, following in the wake
                            of national reformation, style, or call ourselves, United Believers in Christ's Second
                            Appearing. Now the question arises to every sincere soul both Christian and Anti-Christian,
                            Are we being truly a united people? Are we harmoniously and practically uniting with God's
                            higher attributes, blending to the angelic life of purity, and divesting ourselves of all
                            inferior besetmeuts to obtain that celestial Paradise where all are united as one? Our Union
                            is our strength, and if we would be strong, we must seek our union with the true vine, for
                            Christ said, 'kI am the vine, and ye are the brandies." "lie thatabideth iu me, and I in
                            him, the same shall bring forth much fruit." So let us be wise, and not be cast forth as
                            useless branches, but be alive, cultivating this priceless boon ; for what we cultivate will
                            grow. Pleasant Hill, Ky.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Do the duty that comes first, as we know not..." TEIform="index"/>

                            whisper came soft and low and impressed these simple words upon my mind : Which are the two
                            surest things which you would choose for lights to your feet along the rugged road of life,
                            and at the end yield the most peace of mind and illume the dark "valley of the shadow of
                            death." The evening was calm snd beautiful, not a sound to disturb the spell; such seasons
                            being so few in this life, I bent my energies to improve so hallowed an hour, and decide as
                            did Solomon of old, this all-wise question. First I thought how much riches might do to help
                            us through this world ; it will buy all the natural heart could wish, but at the end I must
                            leave it all behind : but suppose I choose Wisdom for the helper to riches, will they not
                            prove the two surest things to possess? Surely Wisdom will guide me to a right use of
                            riches, and e'xpand my mind. And the breeze whispered softly, "God looketh at the heart."
                            "Riches take wings." Then came before my mind all the beautiful Virtues ; two by two I
                            compared them, but at the end I found they could not stand the test alone, until I came to
                            Faith and Hope. O ! these surely are the two, for faith is the gift many Christians base
                            their salvation upon, and what a bright star to the troubled mind is sweet hope ; and the
                            whisper came "Faith without works is dead and hope is passive," and I asked myself, "what
                            are the works that faith demands ? " and softly again came the whisper, "Forgive thy brother
                            as thou wouldst be forgiven ; give a cup of water to the sick, bread to the hungry, words of
                            cheer and courage to the sorrowful, and a kind word to the erring ; pray for your enemies ;
                            do good to those who persecute you, and learn to love all." These works, combined with
                            faith, make one perfect whole, and develop a true Christian at heart, and if these I
                            possess, I shall be filled with true religion. Now having found one of the brightest things
                            to possess in this life, I turn to sweet hope and to it add prayer, and it is no longer
                            passive. When we listen to these gentle whisperings, the mystery how simply, how easily
                            unraveled ! Nature seems also full of these low whisperings. The murmuring brooks, the
                            rustling leaves, the singing birds and humming bees, all tell of God's great love, and all
                            day long they praise his Holy name, and in twilight's tranquil hour, they seem to breathe a
                            prayer of gratitude and send up a petition that they may be blessed with yet another day to
                            sing his praises better. Shall I. be dumb while all nature praises Him unceasingly. I will
                            pray for language holy and pure to speak and sing his praise more and more perfectly day
                            unto day ; I will pray that love may so fill my heart, that I may be able at all times to
                            exemplify a perfect Christian character. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="I'll keep my own house clean" TEIform="index"/>

                            work is done. These orders that you keep so strict. I own are good and pure; But, are the
                            little ones for you? You, who are so secure? I think, and also think I'm right, They were
                            laid down for those Who had not yet much victory gained, Or conquered many foes. Confession
                            too does very well, That is for actual sin, But then, such very little things Are scarcely
                            worth a pin. You cannot for a moment doubt The truth of what I've said, And if you'll only
                            go with me And by my word be led, Sweet liquid music you shall hear. See lovely blooming
                            flowers, And roam in pleasant verdant groves, Repose in shady bowers. Art, science, dress
                            and literature, And poetry sublime. Yea, everything to please the taste Is found within my
                            clime. Religious service too I have Where you may sing and pray, And yet enjoy the luxuries
                            And pleasures of the day. Come now and take a walk with me Along this broad highway, Where

                            enough, Be gone! be gone I say! I know your artifice and wiles, The scepter that you sway. A

                            sophistry! Come boldly to my face. But nay, in dark mysterious ways You lurk me to beguile,
                            And on an open battle field You shrink from rank and file. A carnal nature, filthy, vile,
                            Which God hath doomed to die, To keep alive this earthly sense Your poisoned arrows fly. To
                            undermine the gospel plan How oft you've tried, in vain; God's power omnipotent and wise The
                            truth will e'er sustain. He sends his angels, cherubs bright, To guard his chosen flock, And
                            though hell's forces 'gainst them rage They're firm upon the rock. Your power, subtle though
                            it be, Cannot withstand the flow Of mighty truth and faith divine; God's work shall spread
                            and grow. And souls from every clime and tongue Shall yet the chorus swell,<pb n="34" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> 0 God, we praise Thee evermore, Thou doest all things well! Thy arm hath full

                                passed, and trying to forecast the horoscope of the future. As we take these glances,
                                how small the trials of life appear ; and how unsatisfactory is the recollection of the
                                moments spent in those shady arbors where we tarried to cull the flowers of
                                self-pleasure and folly, unmindful of the demands of our gospel call. 1 do uot believe
                                in needlet-sly regretting misspent hours, but find it profitable frequently to recall my
                                own failures, that I may have charity for those who, perchance, may find themselves on
                                the edge of the flower-crowned chasm and have uot even the power of resistance that I
                                possessed. Is not this one of the purposes of life that out of our own strength or
                                weakness, we gather that which serves some other life? Thus in part fulfill our mission.
                                As we are not called to bear the burdens of those on the natural plane, should not all
                                our strength be given in support of the higher life? I would rather be known as one who
                                stoops to raise the fallen, than to belong to the class whose attitude is, "Stand by
                                thyself, come not near to me for I am holier than thou." Dear Eldress J� I send you
                                these rambling thoughts, knowing that you will read between the lines and there find
                                that my courage is strong, my purpose true, to endure the testing and honor Z;on, as I

                                good and interesting Christmas letter which came duly to hand. Good, because of the
                                kindly impulse which prompted a si.-stcr's greeting to tin.- absent�interesting, as I
                                traced through every line, the comprehension ami consequent appreciation of tlie gospel
                                graces, so essentially requisite to all who are aiming toward the perfection of a
                                Christian character. The proper development and symmetrical giowth of mind, from the
                                plane of nature into the spiritual atmosphere of light and love, has ever been one of
                                peculiar interest to me. Th"re are many stepping stones by which the height attained can
                                be correctly measured ; and when the eminence is gained, even above one selfish
                                inclination, by obedience to the effective principle, which underlies all patient
                                effort, we are thankful to give the honor due. So with "Hope the anchor cast within the
                                vail," Faith combined with living works, Charity or Love, the greatest gift of all
                                    constitutes<pb n="35" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> the mainspring which coutrols the life purpose.
                                Whoever is blest with this incentive, paying no more tribute to worldly honor,
                                approbation or pleasure, cannot fail in duty. Their success is insured. This power can
                                only be gained by culture ; and as one writer aptly expresses it, "There is nothing by
                                which culture cau be wrought out and made effective, except practice. And practice,
                                though the steps be slow, can lead us to the accomplishment of almost anything." Then
                                let us keep the soil of our hearts uuder such cultivation, enriched by our life
                                experiences that we. can say with the poet, "My mind to me a kingdom is." This royal
                                kingdom even a peasant may inherit. Now my dear M� wishing you all the happiness that
                                the New Year can bring, and who can estimate its possibilities, by the fulfillment of
                                the beautiful promise conveyed in your letter, I close with the united love arid thanks
                                of our Order, for the entire household in our Valley Home. Kindly, Your Sister,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Kaime, J. J." TEIform="persName"/> J. J.

                                'Precepts and Testimonies of Mother Ann Lee and the Elders.' I am nearly through the
                                book and deeply interested. Poor woman, how terribly she was persecuted and what
                                sufferings she endured for truth and righteousness sake. It strikes to my heart�I feel
                                that she suffered for me. For without her faithful testimony I never could have pursued
                                my Alpha work openly and boldly for thirteen years. How much I owe to her Godly
                                inspiration and her steadfast faith and courage. How the world hates any truth that
                                rebukes its secret sins ! I have had a taste of its persecuting spirit, enough to know
                                its bitterness and its cruelty�But oh, my sufferings were not a flea-bite, to what that
                                blessed woman endured. I know something of the power of the Spirit of God, for I have
                                had experiences. I believe every word of the record I am reading. Tell Eldresses J- - -

                                inspired woman to preach that all sin and defilement must be purged from the heart,
                                before we can enter into our Eternal inheritance; and lust is the deepest and most
                                damning sin of all. Let us praise God continually for his mercies." Lovingly Yours,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Winslow, C. B." TEIform="persName"/>C.

                                instrumental music to our meetings for worship, I found on my return trom Boston,
                                Thursday eve. I have referred the matter to the Ministry Sisters, to the Elders, and
                                some of the leading members of this Society, and we are unanimously of the opinion that
                                instrumental music ought not to be introduced into our meetings for worship under auy
                                conditions; as certain conditions would soon mean all conditions! As you were anxious
                                for an early<pb n="36" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> reply, we have not referred the matter to the Society
                                at New Gloucester, as I was quite sure their views would be the same as ours. I shall
                                probably go to Gloucester in a few days, and if I find any of the older or leading
                                members with a feeling in favor of introducing instrumental music, I will inform you. As
                                we have not yet taken advantage of the liberty given to have organs for school purposes,
                                it may be said that we are not sufficiently informed, practically to give an intelligent
                                opinion on the subject. If our knowledge was bounded by our own experience, in most
                                matters, it would, indeed, be quite limited. Fortunately we are privileged to learn by
                                the experience of others ! One hundred years ago, there was hardly an instrument of
                                music admitted into an evangelical church in this country ; now, there are but few, if
                                any, without them. Tv hat is the result? In a large majority of the churches,
                                congregational singing is done away with entirely, and in the others, it is coufined to
                                the singing of one or two pieces, while an educated choir is relied upon to give such
                                music as will please the ear, and affect the nerves of the worshipers. In many cases,
                                the hired members of the choir make no profession of religion ; and what need is there
                                of it, if harmonious sounds are all that is desired? Who should say that the experience
                                of those churches would not be ours, after a time, if the door was once opened for the
                                introduction of instrumental music to our meetings for worship? The tendencies of human
                                nature are not changed by attaching to them the name of "Shaker !" The writer has always
                                considered singing to be an essential part of our worship, not merely listening to
                                singing or other music. Ofttimes the deepest emotions of the soul are voiced, while
                                singing the beautiful songs of Zion ; for that reason, all have been encouraged to unite
                                in the song when not exercising. Anything that would tend to deprive the body of
                                worshipers of their right to praise God in the song, and to confine the singing to a
                                select and educated few, should be discouraged. For this reason, singing in score, or
                                harmony^ should be confined to the narrowest limits. These ideas may seem to be behind
                                the times, and yet be correct. If they are extreme in one direction you will, doubtless,
                                get enough that are extreme in an opposite direction to balance them. The soul of tlie
                                writer is grieved over the drifting of Believers toward those things which the world
                                delight in ; and the christening it progression seems uone the less conforming to the
                                world, and, in most cases, the gratifying of that prido which the Gospel of Christ and
                                Mother was intended to crucify. But I forbear. You know that our feelings are as yours,
                                to have that only admitted into our families which will help to lift souls into a new
                                life, above the world, with its lusts and vanities. Anything that would pander to these,
                                delays that resurrection. With these few lines we send you our heart-felt love. And,
                                while we pray that you may be sustained under all your burdens, we ask your prayers that
                                we may be blest with wisdom to do that which will be for the best interest of our holy

                                not forgotten. Let us hang it up as a sort of chart, with its wisdom to guide and its
                                follies to avoid. There has not been such a year in the history of our race ; viewing it
                                externally, and if we could only see and read the spiritual history of 1889 we should
                                exclaim "wonderful, wonderful! beautiful and glorious." 1889 has had an awful baptism of
                                fire and flood, of disaster by sea and land, but the glory of God, the good that has
                                been accomplished, and is now in operation, eclipses it all. Just think of one hundred
                                thousand laboring men marching through the streets of London, carrying their banners,
                                holding their meetings, and dispersing, all in order, and that on an empty stomach. Then
                                the -dethroning of an emperor, and the establishment of a Republic in Brazil which is
                                nearly as large as the United States. Just these two events alone do show forth the
                                glory of God and the mighty power of good that is working on the earth. To really enjoy
                                life we want to have a high ideal; something we can look up to and be working toward ,
                                it is the inspiration of our lives. It is that which distinguishes man from the animal.
                                I love to have the Angel come down and trouble the waters ; it gives opportunity for
                                exercise, and the power to do good. Wise people, it is said, alter their purposes; and
                                sometimes they are otherwise in so doing. Well, after we started to make our second
                                fish-pond, a new idea floated to us; and as it was in accord with our vegetarianism, and
                                would also please everybody else, we caught it, and are acting upon it. We are making a
                                cranberry bed of about one-third of an acre; have a splendid opportunity to overflow it,
                                but it will take some time and labor to complete it. We had some four inches of snow
                                yesterday which gives the country a very wintry appearance. We were plowing on the 13th
                                ; a very rare occurence in our section. Thrashing has been going on, and we find that
                                the oats that were out in the rain, and which had to be turned over, yield a great deal
                                less than those got in without getting wet. We want a few inches more snow and it would
                                make nice sleighing. Winter goes much more pleasantly on runners than it does on wheels.
                                There is a great deal of talk about commemorating the discovery of America in 1892 ;
                                that will be the centennial of the gathering of the church, (our church) into order ;
                                into community relation. Would it not be appropriate for us to hold a grand meeting and
                                have representatives from every Society, assemble and exchange ideas on the past,
                                present and future ? Stir up our pure and holy faith, and prepare for a general

The
                            theme presented here, shows how true the gre;it Creator is to such as obey him, and, on the
                            other hind, how puuishment is justly inflicted upon ihose who fai' to keep his commandments,
                            for he who forgets God, must himself be forgotten. Yet they hope to escape the judgment,
                            because, they say, we are as good, if not better, than our neighbor, who pretend to be what
                            they are not, and we make no pretence to religion at all; thus judging heir neighbor by
                            themselves, for which crime our Lord declares they shall be punished ; inasmuch as we shall
                            bu judged, by the same judgmeut as we judge others. Saul, the tall and handsome king,
                            reigned one good year over the people ; then he began to grow vain and sinned against God.
                            He offered sacrifice as a priest which he had no right to do, and committed other offenses
                            for which Samuel rebuked him and the Lord rejected him as Israel's king. Let us learu that,
                            no matter how high our position may be, and how favorable our circumstances, except we be
                            humble and obedient we shall fall into sin ; and let us not forget, that though the Lord may
                            have appointed us unto a high place and tor high duty, we can only retain our place of honor
                            and service if we are true to the trust. "The people took of the spoil." It is easier to
                            blame others than to confess our own guilt; but that does not help us. In this case Saul,
                            willing to justify himself of the great sin of disobedience, laid it to the people.
                            Sometimes we are to blame for what others do. Saul had.control of the people anil could have
                            directed their conduct. When Aaron made the golde:i calf for the people to worship, (Ex.
                            xxxii., 22-24.) his answer was the same as Saul's, for his chief aim was to magnify the
                            faults of others and cover his own sin. "And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax
                            hot: thou knov&gt;e.&gt;t the people that they are set on mischief. And I said unto them,
                            Whosoever haih any gold let them break it off. So they gave it me : then I cast it into the
                            fire, and there came out this calf." Saul had professed faithfulness to God's word, but he
                            could not keep the sheep and oxen quiet. God had commauded their destruction, but Saul had
                            saved them, and their bleating and lowing betrayed him. We find this to be true with many
                            professing Christians. There is something in their walk and conversation that always
                            distinguishes them from trup Christians. Samuel had the word of God and Saul seemed willing
                            to hear it, but it was to bring condemnation to himself; his own words were to be his
                            judges. With pretence now, but in awful sincerity after a while will we speak our own
                            condemnation. Luke xix., 22. "He hath also rejected thee." This was the end of the whole
                            matter. He that rejects God must be himself rejected. Saul remained a long time king, but
                            only as an instrument of sorrow to himself and the sinning people, and at last he died in
                            dishonor and despair; but Samuel does not leave the people to rest in the tenderness of God
                            alone, lest they forget that only the obedient can expect kindness, for as he<pb n="39" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> showed by the old history the willful and disobedieut must suffer. Psa.
                            cxxx., 4. It is all summed up iu this : that if we will serve God we shall have peace and
                            plenty ; but if we rebel we shall suffer. In the end it will be ruin for the wicked, but
                            eternal life for the good. Then will we all realize the fact that "To obey is better than
                            sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."Troop I, 1st Cavalry, Fort Leaveuworth,

                            Burning," because it so aptly applies to the spiritual life which we are called to live. Our
                            individual light or lamp may be very small and inferior, a tallow candle even ; and yet we
                            are counseled, "Trim your feeble lamp my brother, Some poor sailor, tempest tossed, Trying
                            now to make the harbor, In the darkness may be lost." The light possessed by. some
                            individuals may be likened to an ordinary kerosene lamp; others present duplex burners, and
                            their light has a more extended radius. Some are equal to Rochester Burners, while others
                            still more gifted, may be said to resemble the electric light, which the Irishman said,
                            "beat the sun." Our success as Christians does not depend upon the size of the light
                            committed to our trust, but upon our faithfulness in keeping our lamp "trimmed and burning,"
                            that those within the radius of our light may be benefited. He who works by the light of a
                            tallow candle and is satisfied therewith, knows nothing of the mental and physical labor
                            required to produce the electric light, and therefore cannot even appreciate it. Let us all
                            be faithful and keep the "lower lights burning," and the work of the great Engineer will
                            thereby be made easier, and the light of truth be more broadly extended. Canterbury, N.

                            </head><p TEIform="p">Already we are entering the second degree of the New Year. The rapidity with which time
                                passes, should urge us into more active work, over which there need be no repenting. Our
                                only hope of spiritual success is to move as time moves, forward, on towards God. We
                                know most assuredly that, "Before us lies a fruitful field, Behind, a wilderness." In
                                this we may reasonably anticipate the beautiful fruition of our labors, if they are sown
                                in peace with the spirit that makes peace, while unfalteringly, we are walking with God.
                                Temporal prosperity demands unceasing watchfulness. To save the dollars, the dimes must
                                be held in security. Industry and economy must be stamped, indelibly upon everything
                                that we do. With this safeguard against poverty and against the loss of our temporal
                                home, we rest in comparative security, When Jesus remarked that the children of this
                                world were wiser in their generation than the children of light, he no doubt, wished to
                                impress this lesson of economy upon their minds. "Hold fast that which thou hast
                                gained." Worldly wise men have learned that even the fractional part of a small sum is
                                quite essential to their prosperity, and a carelessness here may soon involve them in
                                ruin. But why should he contrast the children of the world with the children of light?
                                To awaken their minds to the duty of their high calling and to seek first the kingdom of
                                God. It was, indeed, a direct reference to the life manifested by the two classes and
                                something that could be, easily, understood. The predominance of selfish interests
                                unfolds the whole story. Preservation of self. Jesus would teach his brethren to lay up
                                their treasure in heaven, and not be over anxious about what they should eat and drink.
                                A selfish man wishes to hold something in his grasp that is tangible. He can see his
                                estates ; he knows their boundaries and determines, at<pb n="41" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> once, their
                                greatest possible value among the money-changers, either in or out of the temple. This
                                knowledge to him is, however, for worldly gain, he sees it and feels it. Treasures in
                                heaven are spiritual, of which the worldly-minded can have but a faint conception. To
                                receive these one must believe that God is, and that He is a rewarder of those who
                                diligently seek Him. Through this work of Christian love and of faith toward God, these
                                heavenly treasures become of inestimable worth. To live righteously and godly is a
                                warfare against the interests of a selfish life, and even the children of light with
                                these greatest of blessings, so bountifully presented for their acceptance, often lose
                                the proffered privilege as they carelessly turn from the kingdom of God and from the
                                cross of Christ. Will the New Year that is dawning upon us, find the children of light
                                clad in the whole armor of God ? actively engaged in securing those treasures which are
                                so indispensibly necessary for their spiritual prosperity ? Will they be found gathering
                                of that wisdom that comes from above, which shall make them, first pure, then peaceable,
                                full of mercy and good fruits ? Will it find them filled with a zeal toward God, and an
                                assurance as loyal as that of the apostle when he declared to his brethren, "I am not
                                ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one
                                that believeth." Baptized into the spirit of this work, a large field for labor is
                                opened, and we will not, cannot remain inactive. Obligations increase on every hand. Our
                                lamp must be trimmed that our light from God may shine for the benefit of others as well
                                as for ourselves. If we are acting as faithful stewards, we must not only receive the
                                divine blessings, but with a corresponding faithfulness allow others an equal privilege.
                                Fully persuaded, with the apostle, we enter the second degree of the year, with greater
                                love for goodness and truth, and an anxious prayer that God's light may illumine the
                                whole world.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">(O^31 Please write the articles that are intended for publication on sheets of NOTE SIZE, 5x8

                                Sister Ehoda Hollister fell in the hall fracturing her hip. Some of our friends well
                                know the affliction that brings, and also the opportunity it gives for the exercise and
                                development of the beautiful virtue, patience. We have recently put up a private
                                telephone line through our village, and i\ aching to Canaan. All who will, (of the
                                families) can now, hitch on and make our bond of union stronger. I have been thinking,
                                that in the near fulure we should have a tangible line erected between this, our world,
                                and the summer land we sing about. Spiritualism is the science of sciences, and will in
                                due time unfold to our mortal vision some very wonderful things. No sleighing here, and
                                only a little snow. Have had a few cold days, but to-day it was just like spring.

Thirty hundred pounds were soJd last year.
                                The quality of butter depends more on the skill of the operator than on the plan of
                                operation. If choice butter can be produced more easily in one way than in another, and
                                at less expense, that is the way to adopt, regardless of the fact that the same butter
                                can be made in other ways. We shall begin feeding ensilage in February. We should learn
                                how to feed corn, including the stalks as well as the grain, to the best advantage. The
                                silo is teaching us this, whether we convert it into ensilage, or cure it and feed it
                                dry, after running it through the cutter. Care should be exercised in feeding poultry or
                                they will get over fat and lay softshelled eggs. Poultry-men often think softshelled
                                eggs come from a want of lime, but this is a mistake. Hens fed properly will not lay
                                soft-shelled eggs. If there is trouble of this kind, feed bran, hay, chaff and a few
                                oats. Squashes are excellent food for hens if given occasionally, with warm feed. The
                                fquashes should be boiled and mixed with ground oats and cob-meal. This should be tried
                                as it is something not generally fed poultry during the winter. D.

                                is profitable and pleasant to the pages of the Manifesto and thus fondly hope they are
                                "to be continued." As often as we read the local names even, with their accompanying
                                reports, we are reminded of a very beautiful custom practiced by the Alpine Shepherds on
                                their native summits. It is stated that they send friendly greetings daily from one
                                Alpine home to another, both at sunrise and sundown, either by the voice or through the
                                Alpine horn, which seems to be their only available means of communication. The question
                                naturally arises: Should we not send mutual greetings of good-will and gospel fellowship
                                from one Society to another as from so many moral heights, as often as<pb n="43" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> opportunity offers? We might substitute the Manifesto for the Alpine horn
                                perchance. At present date, Canterbury thus reports herself: Health with the majority,

                                mantled, (not vith snow,) but with good resolutions, from whence new energies are being
                                evolved, and new spiritual gains sought, judging from what we realized in our New Year's
                                morning service, after listening to various speakers. The leading sentiment to be
                                cherished was to rule out of memory, the worthless by-gones of the past, with the old
                                "frog-in-the-well" method of progress, spiritually considered, and substitute therefor,
                                a cheerful, active Christianity, the sincerity of which, no one can doubt. Let us note a
                                very pleasant item from Harvard. On Christmas day, Elder Elijah was able to be with his
                                people for an hour or more. Did not the visit of the good Brethren act as a healing
                                balm? God bless the Union I Many of our friends who have visited Canterbury may recall a
                                visit to the Worsted Church, so-called from the fact that the texts, mottoes and flowers
                                upon its walls were wrought out of worsted. Said Church needing repairs, a literary
                                entertainment was held and a little friendly aid asked from Shaker friends. Accordingly
                                we responded with musical exercises and readings, such as are usually given in our
                                family School. Good men and women as neighbors are a blessing which we can well
                                appreciate. On Jan. 9th inst., Funeral Services were observed in memory of our Mother in
                                IsraelSister Mary Whitcher, age 74 years. Our long-loved, noble Sister; noble we say,
                                because unselfish in every phase of life. The season was a very impressive one, as
                                �'Where the heart feels most, the lips move least." Appropriate pieces were sung, and
                                affectionate tributes written for the occasion were read, as in her presence, for no one
                                could think of her, as absent. In the peculiar inspiration of the hour, we were
                                comforted with the assurance that our mother, our Christian comforter, our nurse for the
                                afflicted or feeble, was with us in spirit and in truth as of yore. We view her as a
                                fair representative woman of the "Friend who never fails." May we, her survivors be so
                                duly impressed by her life and example, that we may "go and do likewise," is our

                            </head><p TEIform="p">To the Manifesto : � Hope is the morning star of life, shilling forth to illuinine our
                                pathway, and guiding us to scenes of- -future usefulness. It sustains us in all trials,
                                and under all circumstances, and ic an anchor to the soul. O beautiful harbinger of the
                                future, I love thee! When our Gospel Parents left their native land, and sailed over the
                                broad waters of the Atlantic in anticipation of securing a Home where they could enjoy
                                freedom of thought, -hope was exercised through all the hardships and perils they were
                                called to endure. And have they not experienced the full fruition of those hopes? Words
                                fail me to express my appreciation of its power and strength, for it, has blessings for
                                both body and soul. Thosre who are suffering from the stern hand of oppression, and
                                want, are comforted with the hope that the sun will soon break forth from beneath the
                                dark clouds, and they hear the command to hope on, and to hope ever. Without gospel
                                vision we could not see why we meet so many disappointments, and so many hopes are
                                thwarted. These we do not comprehend until "we open the vojume of inspiration. Time bids
                                his minstrels play continually the plaintive air of hope. And has not Divine goodness
                                made the flame to burn bright upon the altar of devotion and mount to the very gates of
                                the heavenly city? We plough in hope, we sow in hope, we reap in hope. Surely then is it
                                not an element of happiness, her soothing anodyne is always ready. Remove it and from
                                the mental -horoscope is expunged one of the brightest stars that illumines our pathway
                                which otherwise would be forever dark. God has given it to us, bidding us allow its

Shall we not take warning? Is there no danger in
                            the alarming truth that we as a people, as a nation, are last becoming slaves to a giant
                            evil, the monopolies and trust combinations with (heir iron heel ready to crush to earth all
                            they cannot control in their gambling board of trade down to the elevating principles of the
                            true Gospel which they think they do not need and are trampling under their feet. Is it uot
                            time that every known evil should be removed without time for argument? It is evident that
                            much of this giant evil is to-day with all its worldlv elements in the fashionable churches,
                            crowding out the Christ Gospel Spirit, putting the poor man under its feet; no gospel for
                            him, no Savior. Only a slave greater than ever the black man was would it proclaim,
                            forgetting what Jesus said,�What is a mau advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose<pb n="46" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> himself? Again,�"If any man will come after mo, let him deny himself
                            and take up his cross daily and follow me." Truly in vain have thousands and tens of
                            thousands of laborers, men and women, been looking for the emancipating light to come
                            through the legislative hall, and by the influence of their faith in a church which is equal
                            iu its grasp ; and of all laborers woman has been the most patient and made the greatest
                            sufferer to maintain the needs of this life and her virtue. No set of men would endure what
                            woman has without a riot. There can be no rest as long as ancient darkness of the past
                            centuries remain hovered over the present age. We who live in this blessed nineteenth
                            century should not be willing to go back to be guided by the theories of the past only in
                            the true Gospel light which was given to all mankind. Again, the educational systems are
                            much in fault; the rostrum, the pro fessioual teacher and the common school all desire to
                            cram the mind as if it was an elastic balloon never to collapse, but continue to stuff the
                            mind until it is stupefied, mind and body enfeebled ; and fail to develop the moral power
                            which is the great element of success and true happiness for the good of the people, and not
                            turning away from what is practical and simple. It is the grand mistake of the times to
                            foster an idea that we need not the Gospel truths now as ever. Because dark and dangerous
                            clouds are hanging over its false teachers who desire to be the shrine and will not give God
                            the glory nor look for the true Christ-life as is to-day manifested at all times in that
                            people who live in the second appearing of Christ and to-day are the chosen few faithful
                            ones. Where the door stands wide open for all who may come where there is no trust or
                            monopolies only iu the spirit of love and to carry out the teaching of Christ in all its
                            effects for the good of each other.

                                visit our office, we find that the R. P. Journal occupies a very appreciative pla,ce in
                                the mind. Spiritualism seems to be so thoroughly interwoven into the life of man that we
                                should find it extremely difficult to separate the one from the other. It becomes a
                                subject of such universal interest that every class is absorbed in its beautiful
                                revelations, its mysteries, and may be in its puerile manifestations. To be able to
                                encourage that which develops goodness of heart and manliness of character, and with
                                equal firmness to expose the work of charlatans and knaves, requires a high sense of
                                duty, both to God and man. We appreciate, most emphatically, the straight forward and
                                open manner in which the Editor deals with all the exhibitions, and exhibitors of
                                spiritualism while affording them every privilege to establish their own claim. � �</p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Among" TEIform="index"/>Among

Tennyson, notwithstanding his human sympathy and his power for expressing tender
passion, is chiefly the poet of abstract qualities. The struggle between con-cierce and
passion and doubt is a real enough one, but
the poet who devotes himself to its illustration is not and cannot be the champion of the
divine right of personality. He is rather
the defender of the eternal law of righteousness. We may go a step further- and cite
George Eliot as an illustration of another
modern tendency. Though she wrote so
little in verse, her lyric. "O may I join the
choir invisible," is a most characteristic expression of her deepest thought. It precisely and determinedly ignores the inexorable
demand of the spirit for a personal hearing,
and bids it find repose in the hope of an immortality of absorption into the Eternal
Love. Now Robert Browning is removed
from Tennyson and George Eliot and the
schools of thought they represent by a wide
chasm. He may write chk-fly of a remote
time and place, and he may speak with numberless dramatic intonation-. But this great
medern fact he never for one heart beat forgets : The true force which the ages' have
spent themselves in conserving, and which is
to be the sublimest product of the universe,
is found in the spirit of this man and that
man and the other man. It is the word
which Emerson spoke, but it is emphasized
by the poetic voice, and developed by the
thought of another genius.�From "Browning in America," by II. E. Ilersey in the
N. E. Magazine for Jan.

A NOVEL ENTERPRISE.
It is nothing unusual for newspapers to
print very full reports of extraordinary
events, but they seldom publish elegant
hooks. The Harrisburg, Pa., Telegram,
however, has in preparation an elaborate history of the great disaster at Johnstown, to
appear shortly in a sumptuous volume. The
work will be written by the editor of the paper, from personal knowledge and a thorough
acquaintance with the subject and the district It will embody various features necessarily omitted by earlier publications and
he the only accurate description of the terrible calamity that destroyed thousands of human lives. Many portraits and views, engraved by the most eminent artists from original drawings and photographs, will be a
t-pecial feature. Nothing will be spared to
ensure the highest literary and artistic elegance. Then the net proceeds from the
sales of the work will be applied for the benefit of the Printers, Orphan Children and
Aged Men and Women who suffered by the
ilood. � We heartily commend the project to
(he public, and bespeak an immense demand
for the book. It will be well for local canj vassers to secure an agency at once, as the
ok will be sold by subscription.

Society of America has, in one year, grown

If our articles of food in their multiplied
