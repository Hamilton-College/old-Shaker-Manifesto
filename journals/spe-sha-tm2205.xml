                            Continued. Now if it was the faith and order of the revival, to follow the truth of God
                            testified by man, it could not be exactly right for any to pretend that they were going on
                            in the spirit of the revival, and at the same time laboring to destroy all confidence in
                            every living teacher. Crying out, "Don't believe man, don't follow him, you need not believe
                            us, for we may and do err; you must just take the word of God and read that. There you have
                            the truth, and you may believe and practice it, precisely as expressed in the words of
                            Scripture." Yet the people were shut up to the necessity of believing somebody, and rather
                            than believe those who had been called liars by others, they gave credit to the opposite
                            character, who asserted concerning themselves that they were not to be believed, and in
                            obedience to that faith, learned first to call the Bible by a name which it never gave
                            itself; and according to that name, practice whatever was commanded or even permitted in
                            Scripture words ; assured that God immediately spoke to them in that Scripture, even though
                            it might have been originally spoken by a Pharisee or a Sadducee. Although I have heard the
                            abettors of the common Christian cause maintain that Gen. iii., 4, "Ye shall not surely
                            die," and Matt, iv., 6-9, "If thou be the Son of God, If thou wilt fall down and worship
                            me," were the words of God, and to be taken without any explanation; yet I have supposed it
                            was rather to avoid the force of truth, which they were unwilling to acknowledge. In nothing
                            short of this could the general principle find any consistent basis, and the implicit
                            believer of Bible words, must learn his duty from the following sentences as directly as any
                            others. "Rejoice, 0 young man in thy youth, walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the
                            sight of thine eyes." ' 'They say we must be saved by the works of the law. Their doctrine
                            leads into bondage." <pb n="98" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> They believe that every Jewish ceremony, which the
                            Apostles called works of the law, were abrogated by Christ, nor have they attempted to
                            revive any of them. But Christ in disannulling these dead works, made no provision for bad
                            works. The only alternative he left for any, was to follow him in the regeneration, or
                            continue under the law and under its curse. This doctrine never proposed any thing but
                            bondage to the Jew, who expected to be pardoned for Abraham's sake, and accepted on account
                            of his clean outside. Such an objection as made no distinction between good works, dead
                            works and bad works, came very improperly from those who contended so warmly for liberty to
                            continue in sin, as well as in the use of those works, which they themselves acknowledge,
                            were adopted in the room of circumcision and the passover. "They forbid to marry, and attach
                            criminality to that for which we have the express command of God." This, every Believer in
                            Kentucky and Ohio, has from the beginning, contradicted. Forbidding any thing implies
                            authority, and attaching criminality to any thing, belongs to a law. These men never
                            proposed any other than the law of Moses, and every man's conscience as a criterion to
                            distinguish between good and evil. What was thus already condemned, did not remain for them
                            to criminate. Upon the generous principle, that every free agent ought to be allowed,, in
                            matters of religion, to act according to his own faith, they have never, to my knowledge,
                            imposed any prohibition on an individual in relation to matrimony. It is true, that for the
                            kingdom of heaven's sake they choose to be even as Christ in that respect. But their
                            receiving a particular saying of Christ, and living precisely up to it, claims no authority
                            over the children of this world ; they have an indisputable right, according to their own
                            laws, to marry ; and every church may adopt such laws and forms of matrimony as they think
                            proper, and with any such laws or forms, the Shakers have never interfered. The Christians
                            have labored hard to establish the above objection, and not without some plausible pretext.
                            And had the witnesses against Christ no pretext for asserting, "We heard this fellow say, I
                            will destroy the temple of God?" Did he not say, "Destroy this temple" and "I will?" And
                            where was the great evil of transposing the words and putting "I will" before "destroy,"
                            when it was so essentially necessary to condemn the deceiver? But I suppose it would be
                            granted, even by the false witness himself, that he was not exactly right. Again, according
                            to their testimony, he was no friend to Caesar. Why? Did he not pay his taxes? True, but he
                            would not fight, he would rather turn the other cheek to the smiter; and spake of another
                            kingdom. If then Christ was plausibly and unjustly accused with aiming to destroy the Jewish
                            temple, and supplant the empire of Csesar, so were the Shakers with the above. It was in
                            fact the Christians who assumed the authority on the occa- <pb n="99" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> sion, and
                            set out to enforce a law given to man in a state of innocence, for the fulfilment of which
                            he wholly unfitted himself by the fall. Gen. i., 2S. That law or command as it respected
                            man, the Shakers supposed the Son of God had disannulled, and from it they conceived they
                            were redeemed by Christ, as well as from all outward ceremonies of atonement, that fallen
                            man had ever lain under in consequence of his disobedience. In claiming this right of
                            redemption, they had enough to do to answer the objections of their accusers, without
                            entering any accusation against others. Although in disannulling the commandment going
                            before, by which sin took occasion to work in human nature all manner of concupiscence, they
                            violated no existing law, either of God or man, except what St. Paul calls a "law in the
                            members, a law of sin and death." Rom. vii. Yet upon the authority of these Christian
                            ministers, they have been publicly condemned as the blackest of criminals, and treated
                            according to that character, as far as the wholesome laws of our state would dispense with.
                            How far must it appear from being right, for those wTho claimed the sole power of judging,
                            and whose judgment was not only sanctioned by the shouts of the multitude, but in many
                            instances severely executed, to represent as their unjust accusers, those who were judged,
                            condemned and punished according to their law. "The testimony of these men goes to part man
                            and wife, and even encourage men to beat and abuse their wives, and turn them away." How can
                            that be parted which is one 'i Did not God say, "they twain shall be one flesh ?" These men
                            have more understanding than to propose a separation of this kind. Therefore the testimony
                            they bear, takes no cognizance of man and wife. It came from that world where they neither
                            marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the Angels of God. The testimony cannot be
                            chargeable with evils to which it may indirectly give occasion, any more than the
                            proclamation of American Independence is chargeable with all the acts of outrage and cruelty
                            perpetrated by the British during the revolutionary war. That some of the Christian
                            brethren, have taken occasion from the testimony to beat and abuse a sister, a wife, and
                            drive her off, is matter of fact. But to charge any thing of the kind to the Shakers, is
                            exactly wrong. According to St. Paul, there is neither male nor female among them, yet I am
                            bold to say that since Adam fell, woman never was treated by man with tender kindness and
                            respect, superior to what is commonly manifested among the Believers. "They are a set of
                            worldly-minded, cunning deceivers, wiiose religion is earthly, sensual and devilish." These
                            are the words of Brother Stone in his letter of July, 1806. And the proof of this objection
                            was the noisy report, "The Shakers are come to take people's lands. Every one that joins
                            them must immediately give up his deed to the Elders !" The Christians were considered as
                            very near to the Shakers in their doc- <pb n="100" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> trine and worship, is one
                            reason why many things may have been imputed to the latter, which properly belonged to the
                            former. Some Christian fathers who had the general title of land vested in them, in which
                            others had a lawful partnership, refused to give separate titles according to their promise,
                            but dispossessed their former brethren by profession and nearest kindred in nature, from
                            their valuable and lawful possessions, merely on account of their faith. The Christian
                            church at Paint-lick, refused to make a title to brother Houston for land which he had
                            lawfully paid for, merely on account of his faith. But so foreign from this has been the
                            conduct of the Shakers, that upon land which they purchased and paid for, mainly for the
                            relief and benefit of others, not less than eight families are commodiously settled. This I
                            mention distinct from the daily stream of beneficence that flows from their threshold, for
                            which they receive nothing in return but love and thanks, much less the unlawful surrender
                            of a deed. Who then is the worldly-minded, cunning deceiver? "They prophesied that such as
                            rejected the testimony would lose their former life and power: "But," says Brother Stone,
                            "now the work of God goes on in spite of all the Calvinists, Shakers, and devils in hell.
                            Now we know your prophets are liars." (to be continued.)</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Seek thou in life's bright morning..." TEIform="index"/>Seek thou in life's bright morning...

                            no normal sleep; hence the increasing use of narcotics. The old adage "Early to bed, etc.,"
                            contains a goodly amount of wisdom. The members of our household usually retire by nine
                            o'clock, or earlier if they choose. The quietness and harmony of our surroundings enables
                            most persons to sleep well. We arise at five or half-past five A. M., the early chores are
                            done, such as milking, taking care of teams and furnaces by the Brethren, kitchen and dairy
                            work by the Sisters; some of us make it a rule to go out in the fresh air, breathe deeply
                            and take a little exercise before breakfast. As soon as we are up all the bed clothes are
                            taken off and laid across chairs and nicely aired. The windows are thrown wide open during
                            the breakfast hour, and if the weather is mild all the forenoon until half-past eleven, when
                            the rooms are put in order. No one sleeps on a feather bed; we have bedsteads on rollers so
                            they can be easily moved about; the footboard is low and the bed clothes hang loosely around
                            the sides, so the air can have free circulation. We use wire spring beds and have
                            mattresses. Great attention is given to drainage, so we do not have sewer gas to breathe.
                            Our bath-rooms and water closets are well ventilated. Labor.We have no allotted hours of
                            labor, as we are not the wage slaves of any soulless corporation; we all have a united
                            interest to build up our communistic home, where all share equally of the blessings of
                            existence. Formerly, Brethren had occupations that kept some indoors most of the time, such
                            as putting up seeds and broom making; competition has ruined their business, and they are
                            obliged to do what little they can in the line of farming, gardening and orcharding to get a
                            living. We have some carpenter- <pb n="101" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> ing and mechanical work that occupies
                            the time of a few. The Sisters make white shirts, by water power. The younger Sisters are
                            the operators; they run the machines eight hours a day and frequently change employments.
                            Those who are in places of care and trust usually work the hardest, and their hours of toil
                            are the longest, because there are many duties devolving on them. In a communistic home the
                            Scripture is fulfilled, "lie that would be greatest among you let him be the servant of
                            all." Clothing.The day of cloth weaving is pastan industry that was carried on for many
                            years in our Societies. Fabrics are procured more cheaply than we can make them by hand, but
                            none are so durable. We do our own tailoring and dressmaking, and knit our own hose,
                            especially for winter wear, from home-made woolen yarn. The clothing of the Sisters is more
                            uniform in style than that of the Brethren, and wre change our fashions only when we can
                            make a garment more comfortable and comely. The Sisters wear knit or flannel underwear in
                            winter, and our skirts are attached to waists. We do not encase ourselves in corsets,
                            believing that nature constructed the intercostal muscles and ribs to be self-supporting,
                            and that any artificial aid weakens the thorax and compresses the vitals to the detriment of
                            the health, besides destroying freedom of motion. We have good warm home-made shoes, common
                            sense and comfortable in every respect, so we can take a firm, elastic step, and are not
                            tortured with corns, bunions and chilblains, which come from wearing tight shoes and thin
                            stockings. Our light lace caps save us from wearing wads of false hair and hours of hair
                            dressing. Improvements.Great improvements have been made in the past few years in
                            labor-saving machinery. Our washing is done with much less drudgery. A good mill for
                            cleansing the clothes and a wringer, both run by water power, saves muscular strength. In
                            summer our clothes are dried out of doors on stationary galvanized wires around a well kept
                            lawn; in winter by hot air in a small room. We have a brother who is an excellent machinist,
                            to whom we are indebted for many conveniences. Recreation.We seldom leave home except on
                            duty. In summer and winter the family have a day's outing, and sometimes a company of
                            Brethren and Sisters visit other Societies, or spend a few days from home for a change and
                            recreation. The boys attend school in winter, the girls in summer, and when they are not in
                            school they are receiving an industrial education, mingled with innocent amusements. The
                            younger Sisters have an hour for music each day, and in the summer evenings take great
                            pleasure in playing croquet on the lawn, or taking a pleasant walk through the orchards and
                            gardens; they also have flower beds requiring their care and attention. Our evenings are
                            spent in reading, writing and knitting; we have some kind of meeting nearly every evening,
                            either for worship, general reading, singing or mutual improvement. We endeavor to keep well
                            informed on general topics of interest and reform; many papers are taken in the family, both
                            secular and spiritual, and as we do not believe in light reading or frivolous amusements, we
                            strive for ethical and se-sthetical culture on the higher planes of thought and life.</p></div2><div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Beloved Elder Henry:--We should be very much pleased..."

                            that part of the country lying along the western slope of the Taghkanic Mountains, rapidly
                            filled up with families from Connecti- <pb n="102" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> cut, Rhode Island and
                            Massachusetts. At the north of AVadharns, reaching to the county line of Rensselaer, were
                            the families of Noah Wheaton, Benjamin Perry, J. Sanford, E. Bennett, Thaddeus Patchen, and
                            two families named R. Treat and Davis. On the south and west were Eleazer Deming, Jarvis
                            Mudge and Gideon King. These last owned large tracks which had been procured by grants from
                            the General Court of Massachusetts for a mere nominal price. South of these lands was a
                            tract reaching to the line of Richmond, which was purchased by Charles Goodrich, of
                            Pittsfield, Mass., who obtained a grant from the General Court in 1761. "In 1765, a brother
                            of Goodrich, named Benjamin, settled on these lands with his sons, Daniel, Benjamin, Samuel,
                            Nathan, David, Ezekiel, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Enoch; Jeremiah and Hezekiah Osborn and Israel
                            Talcot settled there about the same time." These persons came from Ridgfield and
                            Wethersfield, Conn. Within the next five years several other families settled here, among
                            whom were Duncan McArthur, John Spier, Talmage Bishop, Aaron Kibbie, Caleb Shapley, Reuben
                            Wright, David Darrow, Matthewson, Jessup, Ives, Patterson, Grant and others. The lands on
                            which these settlements were made now constitutes that part of New Lebanon called Mount
                            Lebanon, or Shaker Village. Every one of those mentioned, with the exception of Ives,
                            Patterson and Grant, afterwards became Shakers. Noah Wheaton, Treat E. Bennet and E. Deming,
                            living in the northern part of the town, also became members of that Society. During the
                            Revolution eight of the persons who afterward joined the Shakers, were in the battle at
                            Bennington, and some of them did faithful service during the war. It is the boast of the
                            members of that Society that not one of them ever applied for a pension. Jarvis Mudge, Jno.
                            Gillett and Samuel Johnson, who were on the committee to draft resolutions instructing the
                            Representative in the Provincial Congress, June 24, 177(5, lived near the Springs.. The
                            children of Mudge sold out and became Shakers. Gillett was a lieutenant under Capt.
                            Sylvester Gillett, and was the father of Hon. R. H. Gillett. He removed to Vermont after
                            1800. Samuel Johnson was the first pastor of the Presbyterian church of New Lebanon. He died
                            among the Shakers, as well as Joseph M'eacham, the first Baptist minister in New Lebanon,
                            who was the first convert to Shakerism in that place. We have in this and previous
                            communications confined our early history of the settlement of New Lebanon to that part of
                            the town which, up to 1787, was considered to be a part of the province of Massachusetts.
                            The settlement of the line between New York and that State, transferred over a half-mile in
                            width to New York. The district, however, was claimed to be a part of the county of Albany,
                            and known as "Kings' Hamlet," subdivided into precincts, called New Lebanon, New Canaan, New
                            Britain and New Concord. The settlement <pb n="103" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> of New Canaan, it is claimed,
                            commenced as early as 1742, but that portion of the district called New Lebanon was not
                            settled until about 1762, except by a few hunters, who erected a block house on or near the
                            Kinderhook creek, in the western part of the district During the Revolution the district
                            took-an early stand in sympathy with the New England people, nine companies of minute men
                            were organized along the line between New York and Massachusetts reaching to Vermont. One of
                            these companies, under the command of Elijah Bostwick, was called the New Canaan Company,
                            while the New Lebanon Company were under Capt. Elisha Gilbert. North of New Lebanon was a
                            company commanded by Capt. Asa Douglass. Before the war all these companies made a
                            rendezvous at Capt. Douglass' place, where they were joined by a large party from Pittsfield
                            and Lanesborough, Mass. Between Lebanon Springs and the Rensselaer Manor there was but one
                            house, occupied by a wealthy farmer named Thaddeus Patchen. The Canaan Company on their way
                            north took possession of Mi. Patchen's horses, wagon and harness, and, notwithstanding
                            Patchen's protest, forced them into the service, and drove to Bennington. A grandson of Mr.
                            Patchen used to relate this circumstance as an outrage committed upon his ancestor. There
                            were tories residing in the district who were in the battle at Bennington, as well as Whigs.
                            But they fought on the British side. None of these last returned to their homes. Those not
                            slain made their way to Canada and never returned. A son of Capt. Douglass, going over the
                            battle field after the battle, found the body of one of his near neighbors. He cut out a
                            piece of his shirt with his knife, and on his return presented it to the man's mother,
                            saying, "I cut this out of the shirt of a dead tory at Bennington." As this woman had
                            manufactured the cloth of which the shirt was made, it is no wonder that she fainted at the
                            sight of it.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Home interest" TEIform="index"/> HOME INTEREST.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Russell, Asenath C."

                            renew their vows of consecration, and to return thanks for blessings received, but that the
                            question presents itself, what must I do, as one of their children while sharing the
                            benefits accruing from their upright lives? The answer is, give all as they have done, to
                            the cause in which you have enlisted. With advantages superior, in many ways, why should I
                            set bounds to my sacrifices ? I cannot expect the reward which they have for long service,
                            yet I would be so faithful to the duties of my day, that my treasure may be satisfactory
                            with this thought ever in mindI will make use of every opportunity for spiritual or mental
                            growth. As I give in daily service All I have, with willing heart; In these seasons for
                            improvement, I would take an active part. Why should not my strength be given, Though my
                            talents may be small; <pb n="104" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> To my home and dearest kindred Who have
                            consecrated all? Like the busy bee in summer, Culling sweets from every flower; As the days
                            are swiftly passing, Let me fill each golden hour. Wheresoever duty calls me, I would work
                            with mind and heart; Meagre service though I render, Act the Christian's noble part. Life is
                            one broad field of labor, Fraught with unremitting toil; Calling forth our best endeavors As
                            we cultivate the soil. I would not give all my service To sustain the mortal part; Rather,
                            grow the Christian graces, These, will sanctify the heart. Dear companions, in life's
                            pathway, We have journeyed, side by side; As the shadows round us gather, Naught our

                            write I am thinking how good it will be to have you recover your health. To me the house has
                            almost lost its rest, its quiet and social relation. But with these passing days, I can
                            think, think of the life I have left and of the life I am going to lead. As you know my
                            highest ambition is to lead such a life that I may be blessed of God. I feel that my mission
                            on earth is to do good. When you think of me let this be the thought; "There is a young man
                            who is trying to live a pure life." My ideal of a Shaker is a worker, a live worker for the
                            up-building of our Zion home both temporally and spiritually. ] believe these will be the
                            principles that will make this gospel increase. This is the kind of a man I wish to be. I
                            would be clothed in the full armor of true manhood in the gospel; cultivate pure thoughts,
                            sacrifice myself and always be working for the interest and welfare of my Brethren and
                            Sisters, who are my greatest treasures on earth, so said Father James and I want to be able
                            to say thfe same. Believe me, 1 am sincere. Perhaps the following words may please you: they
                            interpret my feelings. "So keep up heart and courage, friends. For home is just in sight,
                            And who will heed, when safely there, The perils of the night?" And so I look through all
                            the clouds I meet and the trials and temptations of life and think;"I have an aim in life

                            universe seems to be a rhythmic energy. Every thing in sight moves by pulsations. Some call
                            this motion and rest, but there is no absolute rest. If there were, there would be death,
                            but there is no death. If the least atom of the universe could experience "death the entire
                            universe could and would become annihilated at the same moment by the same law. Khythmic
                            energy <pb n="105" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> means more motion followed by less motion in everlasting
                            alternation. This energy in electricity is called positive and negative, and might as well
                            be so called in respect to every thing else. What other or better explanation can we make of
                            the ideas of good and evil, than that they are the positive and negative poles of the same
                            great Magnet? All energy is invisible, being hidden in the mysterious realm of cause. We see
                            only its effects. The visible result of rhythmic energy is perpetual evolution from
                            imperfect, toward more perfect conditions. A spider tried nineteen times to ascend a wall;
                            the twentieth he succeeded. The Church of Christ has always moved in subordination to the
                            great law of rhythmic energy. Immediately after Jesus' crucifixion the Church seemed almost
                            to come to a standstill and Peter concluded to "call it a half a day and go a fishing," and
                            Thomas and Nathaniel concluded to go along. But shortly the Pentecostal meeting came on and
                            away went Peter and all the disciples to the opposite pole of the magnet. Winter and summer,
                            day and nightseed-time and harvest are all so many illustrations of the great law of
                            rhythmic energy ; pulsations in the heart of the visible universe. The movements changes and
                            divers dispensations of the Church of Christ; her winter and summer, heats and colds,
                            sorrows and joysdefeats and triumphs, are so many positive and negative states, all
                            gradually wafting her along the great highway of evolution toward more and more perfect and
                            happy conditions. This divine impetus, in spite of our miserable misgivings in times of
                            comparative darkness, must, and surely will finally land every faithful believer in
                            invulnerable peace and unspeakable glory and at-one-ment with God. Now although "Jesus was
                            not yet come unto them and it was now dark," yet he was not far off and knew the exact
                            moment to appear in their midst and not let them perish. So it is, just at the present
                            crisis in the Church. The rhythmic energy of Christ's evangel is moving the Church calmly
                            along through this "winter of our discontent" toward a summer of beauty and a sweet
                            emancipation from the present cold and sorrow. Only let us abound in faith and good works
                            and shortly we shall bask in the sunshine of the song of the Judean Shepherd. "He that goeth
                            forth and weepeth .bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing
                            his sheaves with him." Let us all become optimists and cease hanging out blue lights. Let us
                            remember the comfortable saying of the rapt Seer of old. "For I know, saith the Lord, the
                            thoughts I have concerning Jerusalem, thoughts of peace and not of evil; to give her an
                            expected end." And who knows how soon "we shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves ?"

                            From an address by Frances E. Willard, before "The Woman's National Council.''</head><p TEIform="p"> In the sixteenth century lived St. Philip de Neri. Among his favorite pupils was a young man
                            who became a student in a famous Italian university. One day he went with joyful voice to
                            tell the saint of his successes and his hopes. " I have entered the law school," he said,
                            "and am delighted with my studies, in which I make great progress." The calm, gentle eyes of
                            the saint regarded him fixedly as he asked, "Very well, my son, when you have finished the
                            course, what do you mean to do then?" "Take my degree," was the answer, with an eager smile.
                            "And then?" quietly queried the saint. "Why, I shall attract great notice by my learning, by
                            my eloquence, by my acuteness, and gain a great reputation." Gently sounded the deep voice
                            of Saint Philip as he asked, "And then?" "Why, I sliallbe promoted to great office and grow
                            rich," answered his pupil, with enthusiam. "And then?" repeated the Saint. "Well, then I
                            shall marry and settle in life honorably and win great dignity and distinction." "And then?"
                            came the question once more. The young man was puzzled. "Thenwhy, then I shall die." In his
                            deep, sweet voice Saint Philip said, "And then?" The young man made no answer, but cast his
                            glances downward, and hurriedly went away. The same question is still in full force; we,
                            too, are swiftly carried onward with definite achievements in view, and when we have won all
                            that we sought, back comes the deep, rolling surge of eternity's question, "And then?" Its
                            answer waits; but that answer is as sure as God. Still I turn with gladness to the life that
                            now is and give to you in parting, those great words of Harriet Martineau's great brother
                            James, who, focusing his mind upon the problem of the passing hour, has said: "Of nothing
                            can we be more sure than this: that if we can not sanctify our present lot, we could
                            sanctify no other. Our heaven and our Almighty Father are he^'e or nowhere. The obstructions
                            of that lot are given for us to heave away by the concurrent touch of a holy spirit and the
                            labor of a strenuous will; its gloom is for us to tint with some celestial light; its
                            mysteries are for our worship, its sorrows for our trust, its perils for our courage, its
                            temptations for our faith. Soldiers of the cross, it is not for us, but for our Leader and
                            our Lord, to choose the field; it is ours, taking the station which he assigns, to make it
                            the field of truth and honor, though it be the field of death."</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Resurrection life" TEIform="index"/> THE RESURRECTION LIFE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Pick, Ernest" TEIform="persName"/>Ernest Pick.</byline><p TEIform="p">[Lovingly dedicated to the youth.] In Talmudic times a Gentile came to a Eabbi declaring
                            himself ready to be converted if the latter could tell him the highest principle of his
                            religion while standing on one foot. The Eabbi consented, and smiling, spoke: "Love thy
                            neighbor as thyself." If I should be asked for the briefest definition of the life and
                            doctrine of Believers my answer would be: "It is the Resurrection Life." Nothing else seems
                            to me to more fully embrace our faith and existence. It not only explains all to him who
                            discerns spiritually, but with scientific accuracy points out the place allotted to
                            Believers in this world of planes and spheres of evolution. From this stand-point we may
                            intelligently look <pb n="107" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> over and judge all the stages of life we have left
                            behind and compass the bright horizon of progress before us. It is the universal law that
                            all things must grow from lower conditions into higher functions and states of being and the
                            ultimate of all existence is to live as pure celestial intelligences. "Ye therefore shall be
                            perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect." Between the world pandering to the animal
                            nature in various forms, and the heavenly spheres of purity, beauty and love, there stands,
                            as a connecting link, all those who have outgrown the lower phase of animal nature, forsaken
                            and left behind all the enticing vanities in order to be born again in the image of God. The
                            existence of a virgin class of both men and women is not a single unconnected case, but
                            throughout the history of mankind we may trace an uninterrupted chain of virgin men and
                            women, proving the growth of all progressive nations towards a spiritual, God-like
                            condition. Whenever individuals combine this most sacred ambition with genius, talent or
                            knowledge then they shine as the brightest stars in the galaxy of the great and good and
                            their names are repeated from generation to generation and their immortal influence reaches
                            us through centuries, as the rays of the sun bring light and warmth to us through millions
                            of miles. Plato and Apollonius, the Grecian philosophers, Michael Angelo, the prince of
                            sculptors, Sir Isaac Newton, Florence Nightingale of philanthropic fame, Miss Frederika
                            Bremer, and John G. Whittier, the Quaker poet. These with many others are the most noble
                            fruits of an intellectual and spiritual life, preparing the way for the Resurrection Order.
                            The conception of a whole people on this plane of evolution is the greatest effort of a
                            divine creative power, and whilst crowned with success they are placed to be the aristocracy
                            of the land and the Levites of the nation. This is the privilege and responsibility of
                            Believers in the purest comprehension of their calling, untrammeled by the puny selfishness
                            or insufficiency of a fallen human nature. Hence the duty resting upon every one of our
                            people to live up to the standard of our faith, to be moving onward and upward and not to
                            settle down and remain stationary where we have been planted. It is our souls' travel; and
                            though in many a dark.or stormy hour our animal inheritance would fairly try to persist in
                            claiming part of us, the pure-minded and honest-hearted rest assured that they cannot perish
                            nor the least harm befall them. But after we have been shaped and modeled like clay in the
                            hands of the Potter and passed the cleansing of fire and water, and when the "battle days
                            are over" and the heat of the day has changed to the calm of life's evening and our vision
                            still clearer beholds fields of a higher life where we shall walk with loved and cherished
                            souls, how we shall praise and bless those who have pointed out the way, guarded our feet
                            from stumbling, or extended a helping hand to the weak and weary, through speaking of
                            courage and hope. We may well, even now bless the order that keeps us, often enough against
                            our will and feeling, in the strait and narrow way, and the roof that shields us from storm
                            and strife; the house of our Lord wherein we have a share to help with our hands and hearts.
                            For a work lits bef ore us to will and to do. Every day we must rise conscious of our new
                            life, filled with nothing but holiness and blessedness, our minds chaste and pure, our
                            hearts without fear and reproach if we want to be accounted worthy to attain to that world
                            and the resurrection from the dead. "Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching
                            forward to the things which are before, I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the
                            high calling of God." Mount Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Some folks think that their personal importantace fills a large space..." TEIform="index"/>

                                those very same things after which "the Gentiles do seek," there is great danger of
                                losing sight, more or less, of some of the features of our high calling in Christ.
                                Naturally, there is a strong gravitation toward the elements of the earth. It is the
                                rudimentary life of the whole creation of God. Beyond this, however, man has a better
                                hope. His attractions are toward a spiritual state which becomes in him a new life, a
                                life of holiness unto the Lord. Our religious profession has, also, an exaltation which
                                will most assuredly carry us beyond those qualities of the mind which are the life of
                                the children of this world. There may be duties which, imperatively, demand of us a
                                careful recognition, and which are so closely associated with others of a superior
                                quality that they can never be separated without an injury to the individual being. So
                                long as we hold an inheritance upon the earth, are dependent upon the blessings which it
                                may afford, and are responsible for the deeds done in the body, we must be consciously
                                or unconsciously influenced by its surroundings, and without the most careful watch over
                                every phase of this life we may, in an unguarded hour, be led captive to a state from
                                which it will be hard to become extricated. Whatever there may be in the world that is
                                influenced by religion, it must be a free-will offering of love and truth to the power
                                that is over and beyond us, and the manifestation of a corresponding spirit toward the
                                whole family of man. Led by the spirit of God and gifted as are the sons of God we may
                                become the chosen messengers of a higher power, the heralds of salvation. The beautiful
                                message of God has not been delivered to us through a special, personal recognition. Its
                                influence has not been by selfish <pb n="109" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> might nor by selfish power, but
                                by my spirit, saith the Lord. Abundant blessings have crowned all our efforts to do good
                                and we accept these treasures with thankful hearts. It is the promised hundred fold
                                which has been so liberally bestowed and which in return must be accounted for with
                                corresponding exactness. Jesus in enumerating the blessings which are conferred upon his
                                disciples, gave them to understand that among other things "the poor have the gospel
                                preached to them," and this gospel was the revelation of good news. Jesus knew that the
                                poor were a despised class, the slaves of the dominant power, and that this gift would
                                raise them from such a low estate. They suffered in multiplied forms, as well as from
                                the want of food and clothes, and all these the gospel of good news would provide.
                                Indeed it would provide for them food and clothing and a home in which to find shelter.
                                Is it any wonder that the poor heard him gladly? We have no reason to call in question
                                this wonderful advent, which proclaimed peace to all men, and then so lovingly
                                administered the needed supply for the blessing of to-day. And what is the outcome of
                                all this ? Happiness upon the earth, and in the world to come an assurance of life
                                everlasting. It was the gospel of receiving and of giving. The gospel for the poor, in
                                the things of this life as well as for the poor in spirit. Jesus extended to all of this
                                class, this kind invitation,"Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
                                will give you rest." Have we not been blest with these same good gifts, and have we not
                                heard the redeeming, gospel testimony? Most assuredly we have and in return are we
                                extending the same blessing to those less favored than ourselves? If we are able to say,
                                Freely ye have received, freely give, then we have touched the key note of success. It
                                may not be necessary for us to call the multitude together upon the mountain, nor go
                                with them into the synagogue to read the Law and the prophets. These were beautiful
                                forms in which to reach the ears and possibly the souls of the multitude that Jesus saw,
                                and he accepted the proffered opportunity, as in harmony with his divine mission. No
                                wonder the common people heard him gladly. It was affording them a superior privilege.
                                They had but very few books to read, and but very few persons among the thousands were
                                able to read, even though they could have the books. To-day in our land of promise,
                                everybody reads. Every man, woman and child has his book or paper, and it may well
                                deserve to be called the reading age. Thousands and thousands of homes are visited every
                                day with information that has <pb n="110" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> been gathered from all parts of the
                                world, and the influence of the good words that are scattered broadcast over the whole
                                earth are quite beyond our ability to estimate. Certainly there can be no excuse for any
                                one to remain ignorant. Even our little messenger is sent abroad into a few families
                                bearing this pleasant salutation, "on earth, peace, and to all men and women, ofood

                                were busy preparing for spring work, when lo! we felt the icy breath of chilling wind,
                                which warned us that one sunny day does not make spring. A few oats have been sown. We
                                had an unexpected visit a few weeks ago, from two very worthy and esteemed Brethren,
                                Benjamin Gates and Levi Shaw, of Mount Lebanon. We were very much pleased to see them and
                                regretted that their stay was so brief. We know the world moves, but Mount Lebanon and
                                other Societies would miss their talents. As all are not blest wit : the same number of
                                talents, yet we can lova and appreciate all our gospel friends, by kind words and
                                deserving praise while they are still in the body with us. Instead of jealousy let us
                                appreciate those who are blest with more talents than we are. So long as they will put
                                them to a godly use;crucify self, and build up Zion. This is Christian, not worldly. We
                                are pleased to say that our good and worthy Br. Chauncey Miller, who has been a sufferer
                                for some time, is slowly gaining strength. May he be spared to counsel and cheer us many
                                years, is the wish of his many friends. Our beloved Ministry arrived at the Valley on
                                the 30th ult., in usual health, our good Elder Daniel not being able physically to come.
                                We believe it is the first time during his long service in that Order, that he has
                                failed to come to Watervliet with the rest of the Ministry. We regret his absence very
                                much, but know with his present affliction it is the wisest course he could pursue. May
                                warmer weather and renewed health bring him in our midst again. He has always been a
                                minister of life and peace. While we are preparing the ground for earthly crops, let us
                                not forget to prepare the spiritual part of our being also, for if we sow not, neither
                                shall we reap, temporally; the same will apply spiritually. Has not the spiritual ground
                                lain fallow long enough?</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Shaker Station, Connecticut" TEIform="index"/> Shaker Station, Conn.</head><p TEIform="p"> South ITainily-. Spring has arrived once more, bringing duties which faithfully
                                performed give a present satisfaction and happiness to be constantly enjoyed. The more
                                perfect the plans of action carried on by united and harmonious effort for the good of
                                all, so much greater their attainment in loftiest virtue, and their exemplification of
                                godlike principles and spirit. The Creator has filled the material world with analogies,
                                which make an irresistible ap- <pb n="111" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> peal to the attentive observer;

                                anything belonging to itself: "God diffused through every part, God himself triumphant
                                in every heart." Spring has apparently come to stay, and we expect to commence farming
                                this week. A little gardening has been done in this vicinity. Our firewood is about all
                                housed and we are now thinking of the summer work. We have done a good deal of repairing
                                this winter, and are now fitting up a large shed for grain in an out lot. Spring
                                cleaning is rapidly advancing. But while laboring to be faithful in temporal things, we
                                feel the need of so laboring that temporalities may be subordinated and truly related to
                                the spiritual life. Our meetings are often scenes of spiritual satisfaction, where an
                                abundant flowing of divine love and power may be experienced. It may not be out of place
                                to mention the good ministration enjoyed by us on the occasion of good Elder Abraham and
                                Br. Franklin's visit with us a short time ago. The health of our family, good and of the

                                snow and ice. This has melted away* before the genial rays of the sun to j give place to
                                the beautiful green verdure that nature sends forth to invigorate and give new life.
                                What an inspiration we feel while breaking away from the indoor prison where old j
                                winter has held us with his icy grip. I With the music of the robins and the blue-!
                                birds we march out into the sunshine of God's goodness and shake ourselves from the
                                lethargy that has gathered upon us. O what a touch of inspiration old Sol has upon our
                                being, as he sends his cheery rays down to us. It seems to sweeten all the sour places,
                                ever telling us to cheer up and look above the clouds, where we shall find the sun is
                                still shining. What a lesson to learn for life. When the burdens press upon us and we
                                feel a little disposed to say so much and no more, how noble it is to look up into the
                                sunshine and put on the armor of God. Let our hearts be full of words of love which are
                                the brightest flowers of earth's existence. They make a very Paradise of the humblest
                                home. They are jewels beyond price, and more precious to heal the wounded heart than all
                                other blessings earth can give. To think kindly of each other is good; to speak kindlj
                                is better, but to act kindly is the best of all. Let us have this the work of the day.
                                Our thanks go out to Br. Daniel Orcutt for his words of wisdom to the young. None too
                                much, none too plain. Discipline is the greatest former of character, and when we learn
                                to bear the discipline that is necessary for a growth in grace and righteousness we
                                shall have far better conditions in Society. Spring's work has commenced, ploughing and
                                sowing. Our wood is all housed in good order with the expectation that some of us will
                                stay another winter on this side of the river. Work done for God goes with us into

                                inhabitants. The winter now about past, as the appearance of spring birds plainly
                                declares, has been somewhat of an unpleasant exception; in fact, we have had the most
                                unhealthy season remembered in a residence of forty-three years within her borders; but
                                one after another the invalids <pb n="112" id="p18" TEIform="pb"/> are taking their places at the

                                hope the gloom of winter and of the sick room, so far as they have prevailed, may pass
                                away together. To the soul dwelling in the light of God's love, there should be little
                                of gloom at any time, especially when favored as we are, with so many blessings,
                                temporal and spiritual, not the least among which may be reckoned the visits of dear
                                gospel relation from distant Societies. We have in this respect, been much blest by
                                calls from Elder Joseph Holden of the central Ministry, Mount Lebanon, N. Y. Also as in
                                several other Societies, by Elder Abraham Perkins and Br. Franklin Youngs, from Enfield,
                                N. H. Time has made its mark in the more than forty years since we first met Elder
                                Abraham, but the marks show a well ripened maturity in gospel travel toward the heavenly
                                goal, where we hope to meet him in the eternal sunshine. The Manifesto is always
                                welcome, freighted as it is, with many words of wisdom and encouragement, of which we do
                                well to take heed. We bless all who help to make it so interesting and instructive.
                                Would that many more might find that interest in the truths it teaches, that would lead
                                them to make the requisite sacrifice, to become honest defenders thereof, which can only
                                be done in lives truly devoted to its communal relationships. J.

                                appearances, and yet a large pile of fire wood well sawed and split should rather make
                                the heart glad than otherwise. In our door-yard we had not less than 250 cords of wood
                                that was sawed by steam power. It is gradually moving toward the wood houses, but warmer
                                days will come before it is all under cover. 250 more cords are hauled to the mill in
                                logs and sawed by water power. An excellent double splitting machine reduces this to the
                                proper size for burning. Several other forms of machinery will be brought into use
                                before all this great body of wood reaches its final abiding place. Br. Arthur Bruce who
                                has the charge of our garden, is so sure that spring is'marching right along, that he
                                has already some hundreds of beautiful tomato plants ready for transplanting. Several
                                bushels of potatoes are also all set in systematic order in a warmer temperature than
                                they have been in during the winter, which sends out the sprouts for early planting.
                                This is taking time by the f oretop, and insuring a good crop of potatoes although it
                                may cheat the potato bugs out of their anticipated feast. When the Bugg family arrives
                                the gardener has only to say; Sir bug, you are just a little too late. *</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Sabbathday Lake, Maine" TEIform="index"/> Sabbathday Lake, Me.</head><p TEIform="p"> April, 1892.

                                have music from a thousand tree-tops. The sawing of the wood has been going on for the
                                past week. Thursday we had a 'little fire" and a "big scare." The sparks from the engine
                                fell upon the roof of one of the woodhouses and ignited. The wind was blowing and it
                                spread with great rapidity while ladders were being erected, but by vigorous efforts it
                                was soon extinguished. Thus a good servant was prevented from becoming a hard master.
                                There has been a small maple harvest this spring. We are thankful for a little of this
                                rarity as we cannot be blest with an abundance. The saw-mill has been booming for the

                                by kind letters from our gospel friends whose homes are far away, and also by a

                                tempted to fall into a romantic frame of mind and spin out a yard or two of spring
                                poetry which on falling into your hands would find its way into the waste basket where
                                all such poetry belongs. The first fat robin dropped into town a few weeks ago and I
                                addressed him in a few lines from Irving's 'Birds of Spring.' "Oh, could I fly I'd fly
                                with thee!" etc. The furnace is now in good running order and the Office, Post Office,
                                Dwelling house, and Infirmary are heated by steam. A good story is told of the
                                difficulty with which anthracite coal was made to burn under a boiler when the attempt
                                was first made to use it as a fuel. The coal was put into the furnace on top of a large
                                amount of wood. It was raked and poked and blown all the forenoon, but the "black
                                stones" showed no signs of burning. At noon, utterly disgusted, the proprieter and his
                                men slammed the furnace doors and went home to dinner. When they returned at one
                                o'clock, they found every thing "red hot." All the coal needed was to be let alone. This
                                is just what any hard coal fire needs if the coal is to be consumed with economy.
                                Poking, shaking, raking down ashes, and all other means employed for disturbing the fire
                                only result in waste. The carpenters are busy this week i&gt;utting a partition through the
                                lower end of the dining room allowing two good sized rooms, one for the Brethren's
                                waiting room and one for the Sisters, which will be very convenient, having only to slip
                                out of the room into the dining hall. Hearing so much about our recent improvements, I
                                wonder if our Editor would not like to come and see us? You may take this as an

                                tub for boiling and bluing the clothes. We had August Frederick from White Water,
                                helping us put up the machinery and another Brother, John Tyler, came with him as a
                                visitor, but instead of visit, ing he went to work and helped us put up the machinery.
                                [Our best love to Br. John for his new style of visiting. Ed.] Brother Moore Mason is

                                company of the Brethren and Sisters very much and on the Sabbath had a very good
                                meeting. Elder Napoleon Brown preached an excellent sermon and several of the Brethren
                                and Sisters spoke. When we returned home, Elder Napoleon returned with us. The Ministry
                                were with us on the 15th of February and the Sisters returned on the 18th but Elder
                                Oliver stopped with us over the Sabbath. Our meetings are good, especially on Sunday P.
                                M. On Thursday evenings we have a singing school and a Sabbath school on Sabbath morning
                                and a prayer meeting in the evening. Good gospel testimonies are spoken and sung in our
                                meetings. The month of March was very rough and cold with a good deal of snow and rain.

                                anticipations of an early spring had been raised, but the cold wave now passingover us
                                has somewhat blighted our hopes. Nevertheless, relying on the promise that "seed-time
                                and harvest'' will come, we have commenced ploughing and trust that if we sow with a
                                liberal hand and exercise proper care thereafter, we shall be blest with a rich harvest.
                                The roads are in better condition than they have been in some former seasons at so early
                                a date, yet transportation over them has been somewhat impeded. Our worthy Leader, Elder
                                Bishop of the East family, has for some time past been in a low condition of health, but
                                we are pleased to note that he is gradually improving and that, although he has passed
                                the bound of years allotted to man, he does not purpose to leave for the Spirt World
                                yet. We hope he may be spared many years to come, to counsel, bless and aid those who so
                                much need his fatherly care. Eldress Lois of the same family is also very feeble. May
                                she receive the balm of healing and long live to guide the little flock now under her
                                charge, into paths of righteousness. Br. Ira is still an invalid and our united prayer
                                is, that the omnipotent Father who is cognizant of his sufferings and of our needs, may
                                bless him with renewed vitality and strength, and make his days many and full of
                                usefulness. We rejoiced so much in the cheering interview, (though entirely too brief)
                                with our loved and esteemed Father Elder Abraham, while on his late westerly trip, that
                                we cannot forbear mentioning it even now. Those worthy veterans of the cross will soon
                                be called hence to join the band of immortal heroes, who have "fought the good fight,"
                                won the laurels of victory and are now triumphing in their conquest. It is always a
                                satisfaction to read the kind words that are said in regard to our aged fathers and
                                mothers, and indeed it seems commendable to mention their worthy deeds and uprightness
                                of character <pb n="115" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> while they are yet with us, that they may know they
                                are loved and appreciated. Br. Franklin Youngs who accompanied Elder Abraham was truly a
                                welcome guest, and we hope he may bless us with his presence many times in the future.

                                write a few words. Our February notes it seems were too late and March notes were
                                neglected from a press of other duties. April has seemed more like March. It is true the
                                robins and some other of our singing birds have come but the cold nights, and cold,
                                windy days should think might give them the bronchitis. We cannot give as good a record
                                of health as at the North Family, Mount Lebanon. A disagreeable distemper prevailed
                                through the most of March, and but few in Society or the towns around us escaped it. In
                                many cases, there was a tendency to pneumonia. Our worthy Br. Richard Gilbert was so
                                attacked and it took him from our sight, but not from our memory. His twenty-five years
                                of earnest struggles had given him a degree of victory, and now he will be permitted to
                                complete the work he had so well begun. The ground freezes every night so no farming or
                                gardening is in order yet. Our Lebanon Sisters are ahead of us in the house-cleaning, as
                                Elder John is afraid of colds and other troubles if Sisters commence too early. Brethren
                                finished sawing wood and most 01 it is split. This too was delayed by the epidemic. When
                                next month's notes are written, it will seem more like spring and the promise old mother
                                nature will be giving of good things to come, will give us renewed hope and courage. Let
                                us look well to our spiritual sowing that the harvest may be abundant. F.

                                we wonder in amazement each Spring-time as if it were the first, what secret power

                                and degrees of travail, which furnishes the necessary friction for development. Let

                                be not some unseemly weed in the garden of the heart, which may be replaced by a thing
                                of beauty which is a joy forever, some dry and withered spot that may be made
                                moreproductive of good works, watered by the dews of charity, bearing in faithful

                                soul, as well as of the land." The maple harvest lias been small, and we doubt if even
                                the little folks had all they wished, on their annual visit to the sugar camp up among

                            book. They say: ''The true scriptures are twothe volumes of nature, and the natural ideas
                            implanted in the mind. The wisdom, power and mercy of the Creator are written on the
                            universe. All ideas about immortality and morality are primitive convictions rooted in the
                            constitution of man." They do not believe in divinity of Christ. They say: "God himself
                            never becomes man by putting on a human body. His divinity dwells in every man, and is
                            displayed more vividly in some. Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, and other great teachers appeared at
                            special times and conferred vast benefits on the world. They are entitled to universal
                            gratitude and love." Indeed our doctrines of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ, are
                            stumbling blocks to the native mind, and the Christian missionary often finds himself
                            involved in unprofitable discussions as to the comparative merits of the Hindoo triad and
                            the European Trinity, and the comparative evidence for the incarnation of Chrishna, and the
                            incarnation of Christ. The uneducated native prefers, if he is to have a triad and
                            incarnation, to keep his own. The educated native thinks that triads and incarnations,
                            belong to a stage of mental development which he has passed. This is the testimony of
                            scholars as well as missionaries who have lived longest in India.</p></div2><div2 type="lesson" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Give to the cause of Christ" TEIform="index"/> GIVE TO THE CAUSE OF CHRIST.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Settles, Lida B."

                            good Father has made it obligatory on all his children to give to others, or that He has in
                            some way made the salvation of men depend on their giving to the needy. "The poor you have
                            always with you," said Jesus. Why should it be so? Why does God, who is the owner of all,
                            allow his children to want for the necessaries or even the luxu- <pb n="117" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> ries
                            of this life ? Does the tender Lord have no sympathy for the sufferings of his beloved? Why
                            does He apparently so neglect them? He does not. He has given his poor into the care of his
                            Church, and his word is replete with instructions and admonitions to be tenderly careful of
                            them. This is much better than feeding them by miracles, for the rich need the poor quite as
                            much as the poor need the rich. Ministering to the poor with no stinted hand, as God gives,
                            and lovingly as Jesus gives, who fed his followers in the desert, is the very wisest and the
                            best means of keeping the hearts of the rich warm, and keeping them in remembrance that all
                            they possess they have received of God, and that they in the meantime are but "stewards," of
                            the grace of God; that they do not own their riches, but have themselves been bought with a
                            price. They are not their own, but the whole creation is dependent on God. This law of
                            giving is not confined to the wealthy; the poor must give ; nor must they hesitate because
                            the offering is small, for "He gives not best who gives most, But he gives most, who gives
                            best." If then the poor cannot give bountifully, let him give freely and what he wants in
                            his hand let him give in his heart. "He gives well that gives willingly." "The Lord loveth a
                            cheerful giver." Oh, the love that never faileth will always find something to give. Jesus
                            says, You should love one another, as I have loved you. This commandment, John says, we have
                            had from the beginning, yet it is essentially new in the measureless amplitude given it by
                            the Savior when he says, "As I have loved you," so love each other. Can we measure the love
                            of Christ? As well try to scale the heavens, or to grasp infinity; but one effect of that
                            love pertinent to our present inquiry, is "that though he was rich, yet for our sakes he
                            became poor." So poor that a tear starts unbidden from our hearts, when we read his own
                            description of it: "The foxes have their dens and the birds of the air their nests, but the
                            son of man hath not where to lay his head." A love so wonderful that it is willing to
                            sacrifice not only unbounded riches, but life itself for its object, can hardly be
                            exaggerated. Here then we have the example of our blessed Teacher, that we should love our
                            Brethren and Sisters to the extent of giving all we have to save them. May the Lord not only
                            teach us what is right, but may his holy Spirit inspire us to embody it in our lives. South

                                tribute to Cardinal Manning in the April New England Magazine. It is based upon a
                                newspaper paragraph, which in noting his beneficence said that, at his funeral the best
                                thing said of him was, " 'He was good to the poor.' This alone is a noble epitaph." Mr.
