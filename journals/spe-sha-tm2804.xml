                            guide and pattern for the entire Christian world to-day; it has been the stake to the
                            martyrs of old; and we believe that it will ever be the formula, by which all the
                            difficulties which beset humanity may be wisely and peacefully adjusted. This, then, should
                            be our primary study, as professed disciples of Christ. Much in the memoirs of Jesus
                            impresses us concerning his love, his sympathy, his tenderness for the children, his
                            forgiveness, and his charity; but there are sterner qualities, too, in the character of
                            Jesus, which should not be lightly passed over by the student of Christian biology. Let us
                            pause for a moment, and with careful scrutiny mark the bearing of our Savior, when
                            surrounded by the haughty Scribes and Pharisees. He has just left the presence of the
                            feeble, the halt, the leper, the blind; at his bidding the deaf ears catch the music of his
                            loving voice, and at his gentle touch the unclean spirit, reminded of its legitimate place,
                            instantly seeks it. In the hearts of the proud Pharisees rises the thought: ' 'Is not this
                            the carpenter's son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren * * * and his
                            sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things ? " The
                            stilled tempest, the resurrected Lazarus, the liberated ones who were but lately so
                            grievously afflicted, are not accounted for on these lines. Nay, the spiritual mission of
                            the Christ is as distinct from the personality of Jesus <pb n="50" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 50 THE
                            MANIFESTO. as is heaven from earth; yet how perfectly the heavenly manipulated the earthly
                            in his case! Ah, herein lies the secret of success ! "If a house be divided against itself,
                            that house can not stand," he said to his followers. With the majority of so-called
                            Christians to-day, the trouble comes from this division. Conscience demands what the
                            physical refuses to expresshence the discords, the failures, the sufferings, so world-wide.
                            The ties of consanguinity should lay no bias upon the soul. He who preached that eloquent
                            sermon on the Mount was not the "carpenter's son." Long years after the carpenter first
                            claimed him as son, came the voice of the Divine, which said, "This is my beloved Son, in
                            whom I am well pleased." After this spiritual relationship was established, Jesus ignored
                            the plane of nature, not as an evil, but as a stage from which he had risen, as a bud
                            forgotten in the full blossom, as the home nest to the bird that has plumed its wings and
                            taken its flight into the broad heavens of God's watchful provident care. He had been "born
                            again." Henceforth his parentage was in God ; his brotherhood, man; and this admitted no
                            circumscribed ministrations. "Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother,
                            and my sister, and mother." They who judged from nature's stand-point reiterated the
                            inquiry: "Is not this the carpenter's son? From whence hath this man these things? And what
                            wisdom is this which is given unto him ? " Enumerating the physical relatives of the
                            messenger, however, far from answering the questions, only added doubt to doubt concerning
                            the spiritual message, with which the soul of Jesus was burdened; but they who were
                            spiritually awakened, when asked by the Savior who he was, replied, "Thou art the Christ,
                            the son of the living God," and divine commendation sealed the truth. All through the career
                            of Jesus the line is distinctly drawn by him, disassociating the workman from the work. When
                            the tribute money was discussed, how wise was the reply : "Render to Caesar the things that
                            are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." The human, in obedience to human law,
                            must yield its own, but the spirit"against such there is no law." "Though ye believe not me
                            (the workman) believe the works." Among the sayings of Jesus, little may be traced to merely
                            human origin; when the physical gave utterance, how instantly were the words modified by the
                            superior! Even in the fearful agony of Gethsemane, when the human pleaded : "0 my Father, if
                            it be possible let this cup pass from me," unhesitatingly followed the spirit voice,
                            "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." In contemplation of this sublime phase of
                            the Christ character, the questioning arises, Are not we, as avowed disciples of the Savior,
                            oftentimes satisfied to see as "through a glass darkly?" Do we not, as Believers in this
                            Christian authority, too often confound the human with the spiritual? As <pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 51 the Christ matured, Jesus as a physical existence became less and less
                            prominent, as the "carpenter's son" was lost to view in the multitudes which flocked to
                            hear, how distinctly rose the Christ tones in that sermon of sermons upon the Mount! The
                            sacred Covenant which we have subscribed, is something more than a legal compact. The Virgin
                            Church is not a Shaker village, however perfectly the material environments may be adjusted.
                            However low and mean we, as workmen, may be when compared with the "carpenter's son"the
                            fruit of obedience to nature's lawour faith, our covenant, our call from the resurrection
                            heavens, bind us to the self-same spiritual mission, which actuated the life forces of Him,
                            who said, "I and my Father are one." The walls of our material homes will crumble as dust to
                            dust, but what of the mission entrusted to us? Any individual or community, whose life
                            currents move in parallel lines with the example and testimony of our Savior, is successful
                            in every sense of the word and at every bend of the way. The individual may be boycotted by
                            his associates, but it is "for my sake and the gospel's" and bitter becomes sweet in the
                            assurance. The community may be reduced in physical membershipis gold of less value because
                            it loses bulk by the subtraction of the dross? Is wheat the worse for the removal of the
                            chaff? Our persecutions as a people have done us goodthey have taught us and brought us
                            precious humility. Our seeming enemies, in passing from our midst, have proved friends in
                            disguise. Their vituperations have revealed pungent truths, perhaps unwelcome truths, which
                            our several Communities have been wise enough and brave enough, thank God, to embrace. In
                            the time of Jesus, the "love of man}7 waxed cold," but the Christian truth gathered
                            followers enough to perpetuate the testimony, which will live despite persecution and
                            obstacles of every name and nature. There are no dying qualities in the essence of the
                            Savior's mission, there are no short-lived phrases in the testimony of eternal truth. We are
                            bound, by our Covenant, as assignees of our suffering founders, to be the "salt of the
                            earth;" we hold in the grasp of our consecrated wills "the pearl of great price." With the
                            unobtrusive yet unflinching authority of the Christ, may we hold our rightful place among
                            the churches of this land! The silver lining of divine goodness gleams through the ebon
                            cloud ; Grod's workings are deep, his designs for us are as yet unfulfilled. Our holy faith,
                            as perfect as God is perfect, will yet be coupled with works, which will attract and
                            convince the whole world of our sincerity; then though they believe not in us, yet the
                            purity of our work shall lead them to glorify God. This is our mission ; who will be the
                            missionaries ? East Canterbury, N. H.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Duty faithfully performed..." TEIform="index"/>Duty faithfully performed...

                            Lord's." "I am, I'm your Savior, your friend and protector, I guard o'er my chosen with
                            peculiar care; So fear not, beloved, I'll guide you from danger And thou of my blessing may
                            most freely share. When deep tribulation like a flood is descending, And sorrow like waves
                            of the ocean doth roll, In the depth of affliction rely on my power, And I will preserve you
                            safe from all harm." # Who is the Savior that thus promises safety and consolation, and who
                            is the party addressed? Doubtless it was first given to an individual sufferer for Christ's
                            sake, but it stands equally good for every true disciple of the lowly Nazaiene. The party
                            speaking is evidently some one thoroughly identified with the Spirit of Truth, which is the
                            real Savior. Nothing but the Spirit of Truth can induce free rational beings to sacrifice
                            their own lives and individual interests in a straightforward, persistent, unselfish effort
                            to save and benefit others. It is true that individuals impelled by natural impulse, or
                            sympathy, or love of glory, have sacrificed their physical lives, for a friend, for their
                            country, for honor, ambition, affection or hate, but when such motives are traced to their
                            origin, we believe they will be found in part or wholly selfish. But the spirit which puts
                            by its own will and pleasure to serve not a narrow circle of related individuals, but many,
                            regardless of flesh and blood ties, in a life-long devotion to their highest good, is of
                            divine origin, and is divine. "We have the first and chief example of this in Jesus of
                            Nazareth, who rejected the will of his natural, inferior self, that he might make it his
                            pleasure to do the will of his Father in this respect. The Father loveth me, he says,
                            because I lay down my life for the sheep. His giving his life a ransom for many, did not
                            consist in his death on Calvarybut was given all along in serving, and in the daily cross
                            which he bore for his disciples' sake. Since his time, he has had many imitators, imbued
                            with the same spirit, and making the same sacrifices of self to carry on the good work by
                            him begun. He said, He that believeth on me, the works that I do, shall he do and greater
                            works than these shall he do, because I go to my Father. What does the term, greater works,
                            here signify? It means the growth and increase of the work, which in him was only in embryo,
                            to its mature, fruit-bearing culmination in organized communities of consecrated
                            individuals. There were twelve Apostles, concerning whom, we have the fullest record, by
                            Paul. It is a record which shows him to be a worthy disciple of him who said, I am the Way,
                            the Truth, and the Life. Paul gave his life for the <pb n="53" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 53
                            sheep, in the same manner as did Jesus, altho he received his gospel by revelation, after
                            Jesus had entered the Eternal World. If Paul, or any other disciple did greater works than
                            Jesus did, either they were not recorded, or they were not of the kind commonly supposed to
                            be miraculous. If Jesus was the truth, his Apostles were the truth. For he, or the spirit in
                            him, was the vine, and they, or the spirit in them, was the branches all of one substance
                            and mutual supports to each other and so the branches continued to grow one upon another in
                            regular succession, so long as he had any followers by the daily cross of self-denial. After
                            this cross ceast to be borne among those claiming Christ's name and authority, then came the
                            night which Jesus foretold. Walk while the light is with you, for the night cometh, wherein
                            no man can work, the works of God as he had taught them. This period is known in history as
                            the dark ages, because mankind in those parts of the world which claimed the greatest
                            enlightenment, were so ignorant, so barbarous, savage, lawless and corrupt, contentious and
                            vile, as to distinguish the period between five hundred and one thousand five hundred after
                            Christ, in the eyes even of natural men, from the ages before and since, for its
                            unparalleled brutishness and depravity of conduct. At the close of this distressful period,
                            the Spirit of Life from God, descended again to mortals, (Rev. xi., 11) and the character
                            and title of Savior was revived in Mother Ann, into whom the Spirit of Truth entered to
                            abide. That living Branch of Righteousness which was raised up in her, has put forth other
                            branches that have borne fruit and the succession of branches has been maintained through
                            Apostles to the present time. The life of the Savior is still given, inasmuch as they
                            manifest his spirit of self-sacrifice for the welfare of the body, to all the members who
                            are walking in his steps. We know we have this power, because by it we have been raised from
                            the death of nature and nature's darkness, to life and light and victory over the world. And
                            this is the time we read of in the Prophets,"Behold the days come saith the Lord, that I
                            will perform the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house
                            of Judah. In those days and at that time, will I cause a Branch of Righteousness to grow up
                            unto David, and he shall execute Judgment and Righteousness in the land. In those days shall
                            Judah be saved and Jerusalem shall dwell safely. And this is the name whereby she shall be
                            called the Lord our Righteousness."Jer. xxxiii. And so it is. David means beloved; Judah
                            means praise. This Branch grows up to the Lord's beloved ones, and He is their Savior,
                            operating through mortal instiuments, who have dedicated themselves to praise Him in this
                            service. In Christ's first appearing, this Branch was raised up only in the male order, as
                            proved by the male officered church, which claims to be the continuation, and sole heir of
                            the inheritance left by the Primitive Christians. Woman <pb n="54" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> 54 THE
                            MANIFESTO. has been entirely excluded from having any voice in her councils and assemblies
                            for worship, hence the miserable plaint that follows the Prophets description of the Branch
                            of which it is said,"He shall be called The Lord Our Righteousness."Jer. xxiii. This plaint
                            of the Prophet, applies to the church of Antichrist, which ruled after the apostacy from the
                            primitive faith and the cross of Christ, till the time of Christ's second appearing, or for
                            about one thousand three hundred years. After this, the Lord again caused a Branch of
                            Righteousness to grow up unto David and to execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
                            As the only fit sequel and support to the first, this Branch came forth to visibility
                            through Woman,"For this is the name wherewith She shall be called, the Lord our
                            Righteousness."Jer. xxxiii., 15, 16. This Branch being now establisht alike in both parts of
                            manhood, the counsel of peace is between them, and there is no longer any complaint of
                            dereliction from duty, nor of deviation from righteous rectitude and equity and brotherly
                            and sisterly love, but an affirmation of Jehovah, strong as the ordinances of heaven and
                            earth and the covenant between day and night, that the seed of this union plant shall be
                            multiplied as the host of heaven and as the sand on the seashore for multitude, and
                            prosperity shall attend them forever. If Judah was saved and Jerusalem dwelt safely in the
                            time of Christ's first appearing, it must have been chiefly in a spiritual sense. Literal
                            Judah and Jerusalem, were both under the dominion of foreigners. The nation was torn by
                            factions who were saved from shedding each other's blood, by the iron rule of Herod the
                            Edomite, their hereditary enemy. The Jerusalem alluded to, must be the "Jerusalem above,
                            which is the Mother of us all," and which is descending out of heaven, from God, for
                            Mother's children to inhabit, in the Dispensation of the Bridethe Dispensation especially of
                            woman clothed with the Sun of divine righteousness and revelation; shedding abroad that
                            light which makes the New Day perpetual wherever she abides. Compassing man, both masculine
                            and feminine, with light and knowledge of eternal things. Undoubtedly, literal Judah and
                            Jerusalem, what remains of them, when the justice and righteousness of the New Era shall
                            become so expanded in operation as to recover their ancient heritage, will share in the
                            general and mighty renovation. But where on the inhabited earth, after one hundred and
                            twenty years of prosperous growth of this Branch of Righteousness, can the praise of Godr

I learned of her life,
                            her character and her principles, during my associations with her in the Ministerial Order.
                            Whatever the circumstances and conditions which existed in our several Societies, requiring
                            the counsel or judgment of the Ministry, I always found her seeking wisdom to enable her to
                            do duty honorable to herself and as became a Christian leader and minister of our Church;
                            that in a case coming before the Ministry for judgment, or before her as a member thereof,
                            in a demand for a verdict, she might do justice and give no cause for suffering through
                            selfishness, partiality or error on her part; that in results there should be no cause for
                            accusation of injustice, and that Zion should not be dishonored by the weakness and acts of
                            its officers. The motto of her life was truth, justice and honesty,loyalty to her Christian
                            faith, to her Communal Covenant and covenantal relations, and just and honest dealings with
                            all people, whether friends or foes. The words of the Psalmist well apply to her life and
                            character, truly demonstrating her trust, her readiness and willingness to be known and
                            judged in the divine order of God, as portrayed in the Twenty-sixth Psalm, "In Thee, O Lord,
                            have I put my trust. Prove me, and judge me. Thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes. I have
                            walked in thy truth. In innocency I washed my hands, so would I compass thine altar. I have
                            loved the habitations of thine house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth. My foot
                            stood in an even place. In the congregations, I bless the Lord." Thus may it be truthfully
                            said of our departed Sister. For many years she has been confined to her room under
                            suffering. Disabled by infirmity of body, she was unfitted for active service, and deprived
                            of many blessings pertaining to the social and spiritual relations of our Church, all of
                            which she has borne with saintly patience. Realizing, as she did, that physical restoration
                            was impossible, she had long desired a passport to that realm and haven for which she
                            faithfully and unremittingly toiled for a fit <pb n="56" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 56 THE MANIFESTO.

                            her as Christian laborers and co-workers. With her I rejoice that her releasement has
                            come,that her reward is with her, and is such as we might all covet. East Canterbury, N.

                                    people. How often is it that we show some one a courtesy, do some friend a favor,
                                    only to find it past unnoticed. The intention of the recipient to say "thank you"
                                    may be of the best, but the fact remains that it is not said. An intention is a very
                                    laudable thing, but when it remains an intention, and nothing more, it becomes the
                                    reverse of being laudable. Too many intentions die with their conception. We mean
                                    well enough, no doubt. We say to ourselves, "I must thank So-and-So," and our
                                    resolution is undoubtedly good. Then something transpires, the "thank you" is
                                    delayed, and what is the result? It is never saidor, if it is said, it is said so
                                    long after the time when it should have been that the saying has lost all its flavor
                                    and acceptance. And yet these delayed "thank you"s, these unexprest thanks, this
                                    acceptance of courtesies, as our right, is fast becoming a fixt habit. It was only a
                                    few days since that a physician was askt by a friend to grant him a favor. The favor
                                    was granted, and the next day came a note of thanks. "There," said the physician to
                                    me, "that is the first time in thirty years of practice that I have ever received a
                                    note of thanks from a man to whom I have shown a favor. And yet in those thirty

                                and blizzards distressing We hail the young Spring, for we're sure it will bring The
                                musical birds, and to earth vernal dressing. At the close of the day, February 28, 1898,
                                we gave winter an obituary farewell. Its obsequies were performed with unalloyed
                                pleasure. It is the only death that has taken place worthy of note, for more than three
                                months Health, a prime blessing has been a boon companion attending us in the varied
                                duties of life, through the past winter. It would be a unique innovation of the common
                                methods of humanity, if there should not be any disturbance in the biliary secretions
                                that would produce a complaint. We strive to keep a watch over our spirits, that they do
                                not become incurably diseased with malaria of indifference or any maleficence, so as to
                                lose the divine protection of kind guardian spirits. It is the strife to keep alive our

                                heard of the higher call of Frances Willard, we grieved, for we could not say it was
                                well, as she had not reacht the halting place of inability to benefit humanity. Is not
                                her life one of the best testimonials in favor of the Christ work of human elevation and
                                the Christ-like spirit of purity and intelligence that graces our Nation's history of
                                illustrious Christians? She is of those who knew that they must pursue the way in which
                                they would lead others, and school themselves would they teach others how to devastate
                                the wilderness of sin and gloom, and transform it into fruitful fields of active
                                goodness and virtue. As nature contains no useless forces, communities to be garlanded
                                with the vine of success, can not. So we catch the echoes from nature's vast

                                and care, but if founded in virtue its worth will appear." As we turn the telescope of
                                mental sight upon the earth's surface, we see and hear <pb n="60" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> '60 THE

                                to quell the storms of evil about us. As we poise it higher, we see the glorious sun and
                                dome of white and blue, which teach us that the elements of heaven are lifegiving ; and
                                as we put on a spiritual lens we perceive a glorified host of the redeemed, who
                                sing,"Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God." Having
                                lost the work of putting together the Corn Planters, an industry for many years carried
                                on in this place, yet we lose not all profit, as through the successful manipulation of
                                the trade machine operated by Brother John Cummings, we will supply the new company with
                                the necessary lumber for their annual need. It is a general verdict that this winter has
                                been the worst experienced for ten years. The severity of the weather has not resulted
                                in sickness among us, yet we rejoice that soon a carpet of green will have replact the

Among the things which are of special value to the Southern states may be
                                mentioned the Japan persimmon, of which we have several trees that will come into
                                bearing this year. When ripe the fruit is of a scarlet red color and extremely luscious.
                                It can be depended on as an every year crop, fully equal in bearing to any of our
                                Northern apple trees. In the way of diversity we think the fig comes next in value. This
                                is a little more sensitive to the change of weather when young, but when fully matured
                                it will stand the temperature below freezing. We have quite a number growing on our
                                place. With these we can number six grape fruit, twelve orange, six pear, six apricot,
                                with three hundred peach trees. This with two thousand pine-apple plants sums up the
                                number of fruit-growing trees on our place. Sweet potatoes all through the South have
                                become the poor man's as well as the rich man's luxury, while Irish potatoes are as yet
                                somewhat of a rarity and but very little grown on account of the small yield to the
                                acre. We have on our place ninety-two head of cattle both old and young stock of our
                                own. One hundred and ninety-six head of our neighbors, which we take to pasture. For

                            man hast thou erred in an unguarded hour? Abused and dishonored thy God-given power, Made
                            home desolate, crusht paternal hearts, And trifled with time, as her days did depart? Then

                            gives, Erase from thy soul the dark deeds of the past, Or vanish from memory the lives thou
                            didst blast!. Or hast thou been swift with a slanderous tongue? The fame to deface of the

                                    One of the greatest demands for the article comes from the farmers, who consume
                                    thirty-five thousand tons annually upon the self-binding harvesters. Allowing five
                                    pounds to the mile, this would be equal to a string long enough to go more than six
                                    times round the earth. It takes a length of about three feet of twine to tie a
                                    bundle of straw. The farmer sits on his machine, drives alone through his grain
                                    field, and without any assistance cuts, bundles, and ties twelve acres of wheat
                                    grain per day. The twine used on the self-binder is generally made either of Sisal
                                    or Manila hemp. The Sisal is the cheaper material, but it is not so strong or
                                    durable as the Manila. In some twines a mixture of the two is employed. For binder
                                    purposes, the twine should have sixteen turns to the foot, and a length of three
                                    feet would have a breaking strength of not less than seventy pounds. The twine must
                                    be carefully made, free from swells or knots, or it will not run smoothly through
                                    the knotting device of the binder. The average consumption of twine on a binder
                                    harvester is two pounds per acre. About twelve hundred feet of twine per acre are
                                    required. It costs the farmer about twenty-five cents an acre for his twine. The
                                    Manila hemp makes much the better twine, being stronger, smoother, and more durable.
                                    The raw material costs more, and its twine sells for more than Sisal hemp, but the
                                    Manila twine goes further, and is actually cheaper in use for the farmer; but this
                                    fact, however, is not appreciated by him; and he sticks to the Sisal twine because
                                    offered a little less per pound than the better article of Manila. Then, again, the
                                    Sisal twine breaks much of tener while running through the binder than the Manila.
                                    At every break the farmer must stop his machine, and spend ten or fifteen minutes to
                                    fix up. He never thinks of charging his lost time <pb n="63" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> THE

                                    Tide may waft his bark away, Homeward turns his better nature, To his friends he
                                    longs to say, Words that burn within his bosom, Thoughts that daily, hourly come Of

                                    and plenty, Fit us for important ends, But the drive-wheel of promotion Is the
                                    recommend of friends. As the magnet of the compass Turns the needle to the pole, So
                                    the heart of friendship ever Nerves the impulse of the soul; Sends the warmest,

                                    Thoughts that live beyond to-day. What are riches, power and plenty, If to gain them
                                    all depends On the risk of health or honor Ever absent from our friends? Often
                                    tender words have fallen On a heart all worn and weak, Driving back the tide of
                                    sorrow, Waking thoughts that none can speak. And our thoughts will span the prairie,
                                    Or e'en fly beyond the sea, Touching tender chords of friendship, Keeping silent
                                    company. Then be brave and own your friendship, Press the hand of friends you see.

This may be true,
                                    and yet not be an adequate excuse, for it is a part of one's duty not to forget to
                                    do it. Carelessness and forgetfulness are grave faults in children, which ought to
                                    be corrected lest they grow into habits. They are grave faults because they
                                    represent a selfish disposition, heedless of the wishes of those who have a right to
                                    direct, and one so absorbed in selfish thoughts and aims that all other things are
                                    forgotten. The child forgets to perform some allotted task because he is at play and
                                    his mind is concentrated upon his pleasures. He is careless about his manner of
                                    doing work because he is thinking of something else and anxious only to be releast.
                                    His faults in this respect, tho they may be trivial in themselves, have within them
                                    the seeds of a character dominated by self. The child whose selfishness renders him
                                    careless or indifferent acquires a bad reputation. It is in the interest of the
                                    child to prevent the formation of such habits which may be regarded as, at first,
                                    alternately the results of selfishness and a potent force for the development of
                                    selfishness. Discipline of some kind should be employed to admonish the child that
                                    he must remember what he has been told to do and must do his work well, as otherwise
                                    he will be thinking all the time of his own plans of enjoyment, and grow up not only
                                    careless and forgetful, but selfish.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>�Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>Deaths.</head><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Angus, Ann Maria" TEIform="index"/>Ann Maria Angus

contributes an elaborately illustrated article
on the Episcopal Church in this country.   The
great interest displayed in the Alaska gold
fields makes particularly timely and attractive the paper on Gold Mining in British Columbia, which treats the subject from a geological as well as practical standpoint.   Other interesting articles are The Coastguard of
England, At the Foot of the Pyrenees, by
Maryde Morgan, and April Fool's Day.
There are some excellent short stories, a
striking installment of the new serial, Marie
Tremaine, an illustrated Easter poem, some
fiction for the young people, and a talk about
new books.Frank Leslie's Pub. House, New

Fairy Gold is the title of a new novel by
Christian Reid, publishtby The Ave Maria,
Notre Dame, Indiana.   It is an admirable story and ought to be of special interest to young
people.   It has a lesson of much value which
it will be sure to carry to all its readers, and
will bring a truer outlook over the great
things of social life, which are apt to be regarded as small and trifling by thoughtless
youth.   Certainly it is a very real story.   The
book is neatly bound and in every way very
attractive.   Ave Maria, Notre Dame, Indiana.
