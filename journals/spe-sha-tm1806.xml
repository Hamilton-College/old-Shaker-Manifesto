TEIform="persName"/>Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p"> Mother Ann felt extreme anguish from the cruel abuses of these men, and said to them, "Must
                            I give up my life ia your hands?" Regardless of her petition they thrust her into a room,
                            where she sat down and cried like a child. The mob immediately surrounded the house aud
                            refused to let any of the Believers enter. Elder William Lee insisted on going in, at the
                            same time declaring that Mother Ann was his sister. Two or three of the Sisters managed to
                            enter the house, and soon found their way to the room where Mother Ann was confined. In the
                            meantime Grant aud his wicked court consulted among themselves to know in what manner they
                            should proceed, and having settled the point, Mother Ann was brought back to the first
                            house. Elder James Whittaker, during the time of this trial had been kept under guard, at
                            the house, where the court was sitting. He was called in and a suit was entered against the
                            two Believers for a breach of peace. They were accused of making disturbance and breaking
                            the rest of the people, by singing and shouting at a late hour in the night. The Justice
                            inquired of thsm, "Did you not pass by Mr. A's house?" Elder James replied, " I never saw
                            the man in my life, that I know of; but I have sung and served God a great deal.'" They were
                            then asked, "Did you not pass Mr. B's house?" and received the same reply as before. Grant
                            then made a pretence of bind* ing them over to the County court, and said�" You must be
                            taken to jail or get bondsmen for your appearance." David and George Darrow immediately
                            offered themselves as bondsmen and were accepted. They then said, " The prisoners are ours,
                            and we have a right to take them where we please." It appears, however, that the prisoners
                            were not given up to their bondsmen, but all went out, and Mother Ann and two Sisters
                            stepped into the carriage. The Brethren who were bondsmen considering themselves as having
                            the right, attempted to lead the horse, but were prevented by the mob. The Justice of the
                            Peace, came to<pb n="122" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> the door and addressed them as follows;�u As a
                            magistrate of the state of New York I desire that there may be no mobs, nor riots ; " and
                            then added, ktLay hands suddenly on no man." These words he repeated several times, placing
                            peculiar emphasis on the last two words,�"no man." Grant returned to the house and was seen
                            no more that day. The speech was evidently intended as a cloak, while it held a license to
                            the mob to abuse Mother Ann at their pleasure as she was a woman. This was well understood
                            by the mob, for they took hold with increased zeal, and separated Mother Ann from the body
                            of Believers and would not suffer them to come near her. They now drove on with great
                            violence, towards Albany, still keeping the Brethren back and threatening and abusing every
                            one that attempted to go forward. Many of the Believers were inhumanly beaten and a like
                            cruelty exercised upon their horses. After driving about seven miles, over a rough and muddy
                            road, over stones and stumps and seeking the worst places, for Mother Ann's carriage, they
                            reached Rany's tavern. The landlord hearing the tumult, and understanding the cause, came
                            out and with authority of spirit and severity of language, reprimanded the mob for such
                            shameful abuse toward an innocent and civil people. He threatened them with the utmost rigor
                            of the law, if they did not immediately disperse. This severe rebuke from Ranv greatly
                            embarrassed the mob, and finding that they were near the boundary line of the town, and
                            night coming on, they gave this order ;�'' All who belong in Niskeyuna may pass on, while
                            those who live in New Lebanon must go back." The Brethren, however, would not consent to
                            this, but determined to keep the company of Mother Ami and the Elders. After much wrangling
                            among themselves, and the dealing o{' some blows upon the Believers they wildly dispersed.
                            Mother Ann was very much exhausted and passed the night under great distress and sufferings.
                            Several families of Believers lived on the road over which they had traveled during the day,
                            but the mob would not suffer her nor the other Believers to stop for any refreshment. It was
                            a long, sad and perilous journey. When daylight appeared, the Believers who had taken
                            lodgings where they best could be obtained, arose as sufferers in the affliction which the
                            cross of Christ is sure to bring. In all of this burden they made preparation for holding a
                            religious meeting. They kneeled and wept with great sorrow. Elder James Whittaker made this
                            remark, " If the Believers should hold their peace, I believe the very stones would cry to
                            God." At the close of the service a supply of provisions was brought to them by some
                            Brethren from New Lebanon, which was thankfully received, in a time of great need. Mother
                            Ann wept as she related the abuse she had suffered at the hands of these cruel persecutors.
                            ''So it has been with me, almost continually, since I left Niskeyuua day and night,�day and
                            night, 1 have been in sorrow and persecutions." In the P. M. they returned to the residence
                            of Nathan Farrington where<pb n="123" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> they remained about two days. At this place
                            Mother Ann said, "I feel now as though I could take some rest." But the enemies of the work
                            of God could never be at rest while Mother Ann was within their reach. In the evening
                            between thirty and forty heathenish creatures, surrounded the house and from the savageness
                            of their manners they were styled, "The Indian Club." They demanded in abusive language to
                            see that woman. Nathan inquired what they wanted of her. They said, " She is a witch and she
                            shall not stay here." Nathan replied, " She is a woman of God, and you shall not see her in
                            such a manner." The mob then threw stones and clubs at the house, and threatened to break
                            down the doors. Nathan commanded them to desist and threatened them with the penalty of the
                            law, if they attempted to break into his residence. This for a moment checked their rage.
                            Nathan endeavored to show them the wickedness and folly of such conduct. "I have lived as a
                            neighbor with you for several years in peace, but now because I have joined the people of
                            God, according to my faith, and confessed my sins, as you ought to do, you come here to
                            break into my house and abuse me and my family." But the mob were determined to break into
                            the building, and setting reason and humanity at defiance they continued with horrid oaths
                            and blasphemies, to throw stones and clubs. Mother Ann now asked John Farrington if he could
                            not go and send those men away. "Yea, Mother," replied John. "Go then and shame them, and
                            tell them if they will go away and come to-morrow peaceably, that I will see them." In the
                            strength of the gift John went down, and had no sooner passed out of the door, when he was
                            instantly seized by two ruffianly fellows. "Love" cried John. "Love" replied the men in a
                            sneering voice, and immediately griped him between them with such violence that it seemed as
                            though they intended to squeeze the breath out of his body. John held his breath, and as
                            they slackened their arms he cried, still louder, "More love!" At this they renewed the
                            grip, and cried out " More love ! " This was repeated several times till the men wearied
                            themselves while John received no harm. "Now, if you have got through," said John, " I want
                            to reason with you, as you are reasonable men or ought to be. Why do you come here in such a
                            manner, and in the night? It is a shame! I am ashamed of you, that men should behave so. Do
                            for the honor of man withdraw peaceably, and if you will come again in the morning, when it
                            is daytime, the woman that you are talking about will come and see you." These words, spoken
                            with such confidence, vanquished their rage. They immediately began to withdraw and soon all
                            were gone, so that the Believers enjoyed the night in peace. The next morning, six of the
                            company called at the house. John met them at the door and then introduced, to them Mother
                            Ann, and three of the Sisters. " This is the woman" said<pb n="124" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> John, " that
                            you was so anxious to see." "What can you want of me," said Mother Ann, " I am a poor, weak
                            woman, I do not hurt any one." The guilty men had not confidence to speak nor to look at
                            her, but hung their heads and soon excused themselves. John invited them to take breakfast,
                            but they declined.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Four queries about the Shakers. No.4" TEIform="index"/> Four Queries about the Shakers. No.

                            interest ? The divisions, parties and persuasions that exist in Christendom are a surprise
                            to every honest inquirer. That Christians are divided and at strife, each sect interpreting
                            scripture differently ; Christian nations warring against each other, by authority, from the
                            same God and Savior. It needs a religion other than this or it must go down. Good morality
                            is better. If Christianity does not produce a more equal and happy condition of society than
                            exists outside of it then it is a failure. If it does not administer to the wants of its
                            needy subjects and provide a home for the widows and orphans it does not fulfill its
                            mission. If in the churches are found all classes from the richest aristocrat down to the
                            poorest orphan in rags, then it is not the same gospel that was preached and planted by the
                            Apostles, nor the same which Jesus taught. Christianity is founded upon love. There can be
                            no true Christians save those who are brothers and sisters, sharers in all the spiritual and
                            temporal blessings of which the church is in possession. We know there are sincere hearts in
                            every church, praying for an increase of purity and brotherly love. We cannot ignore these
                            principles or be perfect Christians without them. When Jesus said to the young man one thing
                            lackest thou, " Go sell all thou hast, and give to the poor, he turned away sorrowful, for
                            he had great possessions, " but Jesus did not call him back and flatter him, but remarked,
                            "how hardly shall those who have riches enter the kingdom of Heaven. " He did not mean a
                            heaven away in the sky. Heaven is a union of pure, intelligent spirits in the body or out.
                            Such have the means to make and enjoy heaven anywhere. Jesus meant, as we suppose, how hard
                            it is for those who have riches to come into an association where all are equal; where all
                            is love. Not that a rich man, on leaving the earth, will be doomed to endless misery, but
                            riches are an obstruction to the man's spiritual travel. They give him opportunities for
                            selfishness, ease and worldly ambition. Jesus realized that his followers must be brothers,
                            therefore, he declared the impossibility of the case; but, he adds, with man it is
                            impossible ; with God all things are possible. Signifying that the kind Father would reveal
                            means to save all classes. Not because he was rich should he be a castaway, neither because
                            he was poor. Jesus understood that all should be made equal, that the rich should lay down
                            their substance for the support of the poor, in order to become one association. This was
                            the order of the Apostolic church. This mutual consecration will take place wherever the
                            same gospel is maintained. There is no<pb n="125" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> atonement short of a life of
                            righteousness. Between Lazarus and the rich man, there is a gulf, so long as selfishness
                            exists ; this must be sacrificed or we feel the flames of a guilty conscience more and more
                            both in this life and the other. Watervliet, N.

TEIform="persName"/>Nancy G. Danforth.</byline><p TEIform="p">" How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him,- -till seven times?" note the
                            reply ; "I say not unto thee, until ?even times; but, until seventy times seven." We
                            sometimes sing, "The power of our gospel is love;" love that forgives the erring, sorrowing
                            ones ; a love that will not only forgive but forget past mistakes and grievances. If we say
                            we forgive an offense, and then in after years refer to the same, can it be said that we
                            really possessed the spirit of Christian forgiveness ? Is that forgiveness, which says
                            without due thought, forgive, and then allows thought of the offense to fill the mind till
                            the feelings become soured, and the general character morose and sadly in need of that
                            charity, so grudgingly bestowed ? How lovely is genuine forgiveness. How it calms the
                            troubled waters and soothes the soul to sweet peace ; when, like the child resting in
                            parental love and care, all boisterous, conflicting passions are hushed to rest. This is the
                            mission of the gospel of Christ, in this his second manifestation, wherein a Mother's spirit
                            is plainly seen and felt. As wayward erring children, we may come near to that spirit,
                            wherever we find it placed for our salvation, freely unburdening our souls,�all our griefs
                            and afflictions, then how sweet and consoling the words, " Ye are freely forgiven !" It is
                            in such blissful moments that the enemy, who is ever on the alert, will seek to destroy
                            souls by lulling them into a fancied security ; making them believe that the whole warfare
                            is accomplished, the whole victory won, when the strife is not completed until the whole of
                            nature is met and conquered, step by step. Then we may say, "I have overcome the world."
                            Doing the best that we are able, we shall often stand in need of this forgiving love,
                            therefore, we should ever be willing to extend the same to others, and still heed the
                            injunction, "Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation." Canterbury, N.

                            night that clouds The mind of Saul the king. Philistia's hosts have come again With sword
                            and lance and shield; And Israel's war-like tribes have come To meet them in the field. 'Tis
                            night, dark night, but Saul does wake, For dark forebodings harrow, And make him fear and
                            doubt the fate And issue of to-morrow. The ancient oracles are dumb ; Dark is the mercy
                            seat; No prophet lives to raise his voice For victory or defeat. Behold a swiftly gliding
                            troop Of horsemen speeds away; For Endor are the horsemen bound, They ride without delay.
                            There, in a cavern dark and deep, Inspiring fear and dread, A woman often converse keeps
                            With spirits of the dead. To her the midnight riders come, Soon is their errand told; With
                            Samuel, the departed priest, They would communion hold. But fear constrains the seeress, Her
                            art she will not ply ; "I know thou art the king," she said, "Now must I surely die." "Fear
                            not," said Saul, "thou art secure, No harm shall thee befall, If thou but wilt obey my wish
                            The spirit forth to call." Then through the gloom, the awful gloom, A form is seen to rise,
                            And Samuel's face, stern and severe, Appears before his eyes. "What woulds't thou, Saul! to
                            call me thus, Disturbing my repose? " The trembling king bows low, and speaks His purpose to
                            disclose : "My spirit is in sore distress, The foe is all around, Jehovah has forsaken me,
                            No prophet can be found. 'Tis counsel and advice I seek Of thee, my friend of yore; What I
                            must do make known to me, As thou hast done before." "Why seek advice of me, when God Is not
                            upon thy side ; Thy deeds have ripened up and now Thy judgment must abide. Behold, thy
                            kingship slialt depart And Israel captive be ; Before to-morrow's sun shalt set Thou shalt
                            be here with me." Thus spoke the hoary spirit-priest And vanished in the gloom, But Saul in
                            mighty grief fell down Beneath his dreadful doom. The morning dawned, the battle raged, But
                            Israel could not stand; And Saul the king, in his despair Fell by his own high hand. Thus
                            learn, O man, that all thy plans Thy conscience can approve ; With God and Right upon thy
                            side, Straight forward be thy move.

                                surprised that, with your knowledge of men and things, the order of Shakers, consisting
                                of some seventeen Societies, was to you unknown until a day or two ago. It is because
                                the Order is " not of the world." It is not numbered with the sects, but dwells alone,
                                like Israel of old. It is the "kingdom of heaven," for which Christians have been
                                constantly praying for the last 1800 years. It has come ; but not as the orthodox
                                teachprs arranged it. The infidels, like Jefferson, Paine and Washington, came nearer to
                                the truth, in constructing a government securing "to the greatest number the greatest
                                good," than did Luther, Calvin, or the popes. The son, who said, "1 will not do your
                                will;" but went, and�unwittingly�did do it, was accepted and blessed. While the son, who
                                said, "Certainly, father, I will do your will;" and then proceeded, in Christ's name, to
                                establish Bible and Tract and Missionary Societies, and to encompass sea and land to
                                carry a gospel to aboriginal peoples�as in the Congo, introducing amongst them rum and
                                tobacco, and the syphilitic diseases, making those simple souls more the children of
                                hell than they were before, and ten times worse than are they themselves�has utterly
                                failed to do God's will. To them, in tones of thunder, comes the voice, from the Christ
                                heavens, "Depart from me, ye workers of human misery ; I know you not. While directing
                                the attention of your duped, fanatical followers to an imaginary heaven, ye take
                                possession, by means of your unjust laws, of the land upon which they stand, from which
                                they derive their food�their 'daily bread'� anr! thus constitute them your slaves�
                                either chattel or wages slaves. Verily, I know ye not." Dear friend, the above may be
                                too "strong meat;" or if it be that you have been taught of God�by his Spirit, and draw
                                towards the kingdom�as those had been to whom, when Jesus saw them, he simply said,
                                    "Follow<pb n="128" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> me," and they left their nets to become disciples ;

                                the kingdom of God." How are we to be born again? Shall we know when we are born again ?
                                Jesus explained the new birth to Nicodemus, but he did not understand it. Those only can
                                understand, who have experienced it. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou

                                so is every one that is born of the spirit. Jno. iii., 8. When the new and living seed
                                of the Son of Man, the word of God, is received into the heart, it strikes root and
                                grows, day and night, and we know not wherefrom it comes or where it goes. We see,
                                however, that it makes a great change in our lives, and we feel the spirit of it in the
                                heart. Our love to God grows stronger and stronger and is manifested in our thoughts and
                                acts, with the naturalness that children love their parents. True love to God comes by
                                the new birth. It increases as the new man grows, and makes us the children of our
                                Heavenly Father and Mother. In this love it will be our comfort and our joy to do those
                                things that olease God, and manifest a spirit of kindness and good-will to all our

                                Of course the writing was purely voluntary on your part, and no urging was given by
                                Sister Asenath, but she has sanctified it by a few words of her own and that makes it so
                                much better. Happy will you be if a good Sister like Asenath, can always, in the future,
                                endorse all your correspondence whether to persons in or out of our Society. It brings
                                such a comfortable feeling to know that we are in the light. It must make one feel so
                                wretched to have any sly or underhanded conduct, and particularly any written
                                correspondence that is concealed from the Elders. I do not believe you or I could feel
                                very happy in this way and wre will not try it. I would have all my dear, young Sisters
                                to be the soul-of honor, and to live su strictly and so honorable with each other that
                                no shame will blight sweet memories of the past. The rules of our Society forbid all
                                partial or private correspondence, and if we violate this rule we act a lie and are
                                untrue to our profession. Do you know why I am glad to have you write to me? I will tell
                                you one reason. I take it for granted that you<pb n="129" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> feel very resolute
                                in your faith, and are determined to become a "Rock Maple Shaker " and the Rock Maple is
                                a synonym of solidity and sweetness you know. This is so well understood that we need
                                not say much about it, and I only allude to it that you may see what confidence I have
                                in you. These older Sisters ask " How is' the little girl whom you took home with you
                                some years since ?" I reply, she is no longer a little girl, she has become very
                                womanly, she loves home, she loves her friends, and still better, she loves the pure
                                life of Believers. Her testimony in meeting is earnest and heartfelt, and we are
                                comforted in the thought that she will prove a dependence and a blessing. Now if I have
                                given too good an opinion of you, you must either write to these people and correct my
                                statements, or you must deserve this opinion by future endeavor. I can only reply to
                                them from my own impressions. I know, every body knows who knows any thing about it,
                                that you have " chosen that good part that will never fade away," and any other choice
                                will lead to bitter disappointment. The path to Heaven is not altogether a thornless
                                one, but it leads to Heaven and that is enough. But how about the thftrns? You have
                                friends who pray for and sympathize with you in all your troubles, yet they realize that
                                you must grow strong by experience, even as the child learns to walk by learning to
                                depend on its own strength. Thank you for writing. Love to all the good and those who
                                wish to be good. Ever your friend and Brother,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Briggs, N. A." TEIform="persName"/>N. A.

                            midnight, nor was it a misty dream that stole over me ; but in the calm, clear light of day,
                            before my inner vision appeared two platforms, suspended in the air, the material of which
                            seemed to be a delicate polished wood. The one to the right was filled with little brass
                            machines, which were spinning fine threads of various colors. These threads were gathered
                            into one above the platform, and being slightly twisted, formed a strong cable. Around this
                            platform moved with noiseless tread, the operators of these curious machines ; some were
                            oiling the little gudgeons, others with watchful care kept the tiny wheels bright and clean,
                            others often found it necessary to accelerate a tardy spindle, or slacken a too hasty thread
                            ; while anon some gentle hand occasionally straightened a kink, or removed unspuu material
                            from the ascending threads. Thus run the little machines, without jar or confusion, and
                            these many threads of various colors, formed a cord beautiful in its variety, strong in its
                            multiplicity. I now turned to contemplate the platform on the left, but what a contrast! The
                            machines were the same, and earnest operators were guiding them ; but instead of the busy
                            hum of the working wheels only grating sounds were heard ; and why? No careful hands were
                            lubricating the pivots, no guiding touches regulated the pensions ; but all thoughts of the
                                anx-<pb n="130" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> ioas spinners seemed centered in the color of their threads,
                            and as it was only individual bias which decided this, many a thread was broken off, and the
                            cord above grew thinner. Nor was this all; the threads so ruthlessly broken became entangled
                            with others and clogged wheels, wThich might have "run well." The wheels deprived of work
                            were pushed aside. To stop? Not so. It seemed their nature to run, and run they did; but the
                            little cogs once so nicely fitted in place, were now grinding themselves against the edges
                            of the platform and against each other, and destruction was the result. Mt. Lebanon, N.

G." TEIform="persName"/></byline><p TEIform="p">Seen by Elder J. G. RUSSELL. In the early part of 1888, while lying unconscious of
                            surroundings, I suddenly felt myself gently raised to such an elevation that I seemed to be
                            amid the stars, which appeared more brilliant even than on any beautiful starry eveuing I
                            had ever beheld. I continued to be thus borne upward by the same invisible agency till I
                            reached an indefinite height, where I stopped. Here, the stars appeared far brighter than
                            before, though I fancied that I still heard the hum of industry below me. Presently a voice
                            attracted my attention, addressing me as follows; "It appears that your work on earth is
                            done and perhaps you feel that you are now ready to enter your spirit home." I could not
                            respond audibly, but mentally pleaded thus :� "I was taken ill so suddenly that my work on
                            earth is left in a very unsettled condition, especially my books of account, from which I
                            fear much loss will be realized, unless granted a little more time. If I cau be permitted to
                            return to earth long enough to adjust my business affairs, I shall then be reconciled to
                            enter my final home." Response to this plea was not given and I remained in anxious
                            suspense. I was then lowered by the same gentle agency. The stars were lost fo view and I
                            was on earth ouce more ; after which I immediately heard a voice saying, '"Permission is
                            given you to remain yet longer on the earth." This was a comforting assurance. Here the
                            visi�u faded. ****** Several weeks subsequent to the vision mentioned, my mind seemed
                            suddenly forced into a direction so uncertain that; I could not define my position, neither
                            did I know my silent attendant. All was absolutely dark, until I reached a point where the
                            stars again came into view, and I then knew that I was in the same place that in my first
                            vision I learned was to be my spirit home. No sound greeted me here. Soon after realizing my
                            situation, the bright stars apparently vanished and I was again left in darkness. Meantime,
                            these solemn and forcible words came to my mind, "JN'ouebut the pure in heart can ever find
                            an abode in these heavenly mansions." Instantly a very bright light shone upon me and I saw
                            directly by my side my true oelf, which I knew at once portrayed my spiritual condition. I
                            compared my standard of purity with the assertion made in the solemn text noted, and found
                            that I was far from being wholly pure. After meditating awhile on this condition, these
                            words were forcibly impressed on my mind, "Whoever cherishes a spirit of revenge or even an
                                un-<pb n="131" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> kind feeling toward any individual, finds not an abode in the
                            mansions of the blest, until the sin is removed by personal sacrifice." I again reflected
                            and again heard, "None can enter in save those who have overcome the world." This caused me
                            to take a thorough survey of my spiritual attainments, and I found that I was indeed a "
                            child of wrath." I now sincerely promised my heavenly attendant that if I was permitted
                            strength and length of days, I would prepare for this lovely abode, by doing that work on
                            the earth which canuot be wrought in spirit life. This light then vanished and when I
                            returned to consciousness I was weeping. Permit me to add that after duly considering the
                            two visions narrated 1 commenced a review of my life, and have made a frank acknowledgement
                            of every error, whether of word or act that I did not consider worthy of the full blessing
                            of the light of God, as revealed to my understanding. I now feel the confidence of the
                            spirit and am sure I shall be able to complete my duties on earth or those connecting me
                            with persons whom I am soon to leave. I am strongly impressed by spirit influence that the
                            work which I have had time to do and do not finish on earth, cannot be as acceptably done in
                            the spirit world, also that I cannot dwell with those who overcame in the form, as did Jesus
                            the pattern, without fully acknowledging my faith in the present revelation of God and
                            leaving a record with some appointed witness that I passed out of this sphere with full
                            reconciliation and forgiveness with all. I wish to leave this testimony on earth and take
                            the spirit of the same with me as my passport to the next phase of life. Enfield, N.

                            limited, and were it otherwise, we are void of necessary information that usually
                            accompanies such productions. And again, it might seem to others who are more intimately
                            acquainted, rather a precocious proceeding on the part of the writer. Immature as they are,
                            we offer a few thoughts that may grow beneath the pen, even as the seed grows beneath the
                            sod, and be of some value to the reader. Impressions are imbibed in various ways, directly
                            and indirectly, by spirits out of the form and spirits in the body, as well as emanations
                            arising from one's own mind. It matters not, however, from whence they proceed, or whither
                            they take their flight, so long as they leave with us a salutary influence. It is now
                            eighteen years over a century since Mother Ann Lee received the most wonderful revelation
                            ever erven to mortals. " The my&amp;tery of iniquity" was made known to her by spirit
                            agencies, and in heavenly visions she was shown the root and foundation of man's loss from
                            God. The Christ in her testified against all filthiness of flesh and spirit and lustful
                            gratification of every name and nature, as the very source and foundation of human misery ;
                            and that these lusts must be crucified, and every sin confessed, one by one, as they had
                            been committed to a witness of God, who, imbued with divine unction<pb n="132" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/>
                            and power from on high, could help "unbar the prison doors and let the oppressed go free."
                            Interesting�biographical history of Mother Ann and the first founders of the Society are
                            given in full, in successive numbers of �' The Manifesto " by our able Editor, and are
                            highly appreciated. Ever since the establishment of the Order, as one after another has
                            passed on to higher realms, a successor, from Mother Ann down, has been appointed to fill
                            the vacancy : Thus, the Mediatorial chain remains unbroken to the present time. It can never
                            be broken, because it is of Divine origin, no more than the door of Revelation can ever be
                            closed. "Behold I set before you an open door and no man can shut it." We learn that on July
                            18, 1811, in Manchester England, was born the subject of our narrative, Eldress, Eliza Ann
                            Taylor�the youngest of six children. When only six weeks old her parents, William and
                            Elizabeth Taylor embarked for America. After their arrival to these shores they resided for
                            a time in New York City, and subsequently in the City of Hudson, N. Y. where they remained
                            until the year 1820 when they moved to New Lebanon. All came, save one son who was bound out
                            as an apprentice. In those days of home industry, the old-fashioned loom and spinning wheel,
                            like the old oaken bucket, were the chief essentials in a family. In this family, consisting
                            of eight members, not less than five looms were in daily use from morning till night, and
                            this little girl of five summers turned the quill wheel; thus we see the principle of
                            industry was early inculcated and observed. An interesting incident, and one worthy of note
                            occurred, that directed the father's attention to Believers, and was the first opening wedge
                            to an introduction. A brother, by the name of Eli Porter of New Lebanon, was owing one cent
                            to a merchant in Hudson, and went to pay it. With others present in the store was William
                            Taylor who, though an honest man, was amazed that so trifling a thing as a copper should be
                            taken into account; he noted it however, and resolved to become acquainted with such an
                            honest man that would turn out of his course for a penny debt; and this he afterwards
                            accomplished. From this important principle being literally carried out, of never running in
                            debt, and " owing no one aught but love and goodwill," a whole family were gathered, and
                            most of them remaiued to be useful and worthy members of Society. This should be an
                            incentive, to Believers, to pay promptly all just debts. As childhood blossomed into youth,
                            so industry bore its fruit, and maturer years developed faculties in Eldress Ann that were
                            adapted to the needs of a large family. She soon became a burden bearer. For a number of
                            years she was Deaconess in the Church Family ; from there she went to live with Eldress
                            Betsy Bates as assistant in the Order of Elders, aid in 1852, upon the removal of Eldress
                            Betsy to the Ministry, was appointed senior Eldress in the Church, where she served five
                            years as a faithful Shepherdess over a large flock. She was next called to supply a vacancy
                            in the Ministerial Order, and after serving ten years as an associate with Eldress Betsy,
                            was appointed and anointed as first in the Ministry ; Eldress Betsy having passed to her
                            spirit home. For thirty one years Eldress Ann has<pb n="133" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> stood as a true
                            representative of Mother Ann Lee, loved and beloved by her people far and near, who probably
                            know of her recent physical sufferings. Mental and spiritual sufferings are unavoidable ;
                            these will continue so long as there remains one soul to be redeemed unto God, and the
                            physical being so closely allied, the one affects the other. For a long time it has been
                            quite popular with the outside community, when a person has held, or is holding an important
                            place of trust, to issue bulletins, and insert short and lengthy articles in newspapers
                            concerning their physical condition, especially when health becomes impaired; as at preseut
                            with the Emperor Frederic of Germany, who is soon expected to follow his illustrious father;
                            seven of the most skillful physicians being unable to save him from the ravages of disease.
                            The query arises, why may we not issue something similar, when occasion demands, through the
                            columns of "The Manifesto?" Not because of existing custom for "Be ye not conformed to this
                            world ; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds unto God." Not because of caste
                            or nationalities, for we are Brethren and Sisters. Equality in all things being one of the
                            prominent rounds in the ladder of ascension from earth to heaven: and ''hath not God made of

                            "every valley be filled, and every mountain and hill be brought low?" Howbeit, our fathers
                            and mothers in the gospel, who have by selfabnegation and abasement humbled themselves to
                            that degree that the love o[ power to rule and reign over others is subdued, are exalted
                            above the highest hills, (the kings and queens, emperors and princes of this earth,) and
                            are, in the estimation of their spiritual offspring, bright examples, " guiding stars on the
                            journey of life, "�lighting this vale of mists and shadows with an illumination far
                            exceeding the sun in its meridian splendor. It is love based upon purity, respect for
                            virtue, reverence and veneration for godliness that calls forth this feeble tribute to one,
                            whom we are privileged to call, "Our Mother." We are happy to inform all our dear Brethren
                            and Sisters of the household of faith, though we have not been formally appointed, that our
                            beloved Eldress Ann is gradually recovering. Let us continue to pray for her full

                            with the great Maternal Soul in Deity, the Mother of the Universe. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            faith it is impossible to please God." lleb. The passages above quoted, beside many other
                            scripture texts in favor of this virtue, teach that this living, practical faith is so
                            essential to the development of a truly Christian character that it is impossible to reach
                            this desired eminence without its attainment.<pb n="134" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> "Faith is a gift of
                            God," said the beloved apostle James, and who that has received a small measure even, of
                            this precious gift can dispute its divine origin ? It is to the soul a manifestation of
                            infinite love. "Waters cannot quench it nor floods drown it." Emanating from God, it
                            partakes of his attributes in its omnipresence, as an undying, unfailing motor for
                            soul-guidance, shining above the pathway of the traveler like some fixed star never sinking
                            below his mental horizon, thus never lost to veiw; and blessed indeed is he unto whom it
                            proves a "savor of life unto life." If regarded, it shines a beacon light to the soul, if
                            disregarded, condemnation as the shadow of an avenging spirit. May I, with all others who
                            have been blest with this beautiful guide, have the genuine courage and willing obedience to
                            follow wherever it leads, until we arrive at that point where "faith is lost in sight," and
                            hope gives place to substance. There are many striking illustrations of faith recorded in
                            biblical history which inspire reverence for those ancient seers who proved so loyal to its
                            teaching. Good father Abraham, when called of God to slay "his son, his only son, Isaac,"
                            went seemingly without a protest to the sacrificial altar, sustained by faith alone; thus
                            proving his implicit trust in that God who had power to test his love to the utmost. With
                            what childlike wonder the youthful Isaac addressed his father, "My father, behold the fire
                            and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?" No human heart, not in
                            possession of this faith divine could have answered the harrowing question of the innocent
                            child with such apparent calmness and holy trust, " My son, God will provide himself a lamb
                            for the burnt offering" but God's mercy is ever manifest in life's severest trial, and at
                            this supreme moment it is stated that an angel called to him from Heaven, saying, " Lay not
                            thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him, for now I know that thou fearest
                            God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only sou, from me." As in this instance,
                            when obedience to faith triumphed, may I and we do likewise and likewise triumph. In
                            contrast to the perfect faith of Abraham was the fear and trembling displayed by Peter when
                            bidden by Jesus to walk upon the water. In his human weakness he cried out, "Lord save me !"
                            Jesus in fullness of faith, stretched forth his hand with this mild rebuke, "O thou of
                            little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" Both of these lessons are profitable for us to
                            consider and make application in our attempts to find progress in a spiritual life, which
                            are sure to prove a failure unless we come iuto possession of this active faith, by which
                            priceless gift, if combined with good works, we shall manifest that our choice is '' thy
                            will not mine be done." May future days give evidence that we have been guided by the spirit
                            of the humble petition we now sincerely sing. "Breathe on our souls, 0 Lord, we pray, The
                            strengthening power of faith, Arrest our footsteps in the way That leadeth down to death.
                            For what is life, without thy grace To mould each living act? And what is joy without the

                                negligent of his duty as to make no use of them, or to the man who in his poverty has no
                                seed to sow, and consequently can have no harvest to reap. Although it is ssid that the
                                diligent man may be worthy to stand before Kings, it is said quite as emphatically that
                                those who neglect their sowing in its proper season must be forced to beg in harvest. It
                                may not be so agreeable to accept this form of penance, but as it is in accordance with
                                the Divine Plan, it meets us in our own paths, and awards to us the sum of our daily
                                needs. It was a wise provision in the economy of nature that the law of compensation
                                should have a universal influence and through this stimulate to action the whole
                                creation of God. From the highest type as found in man, to that which is very low in the
                                scale of Creative energy there is to be found no change for this individual demand. The
                                apostle so fully eudorsed the protectionary law that he did ^not hesitate to say to all
                                his brethren, "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would
                                not work, neither should he eat." 2 Thes. iii., 10. Even the story of the journey
                                through the wilderness informs us that every man was obliged to gather the manna for
                                himself and for those of his family or suffer for the neglect. Although the foolish and

                                worker, otherwise than to stimulate him to renewed action, and to greater faithfulness.
                                Temporal duties which bear so directly on our happiness or misery in this life, are
                                often made of superlative interest and matters of personal comfort become the absorbing
                                theme upon which the mind so fondly dwells. Even for this a reason may be rendered, and
                                a ray of comfort afforded. Having, as we do, such a tenacity to life, which was
                                implanted in us by the wisdom of God, we are by nature impelled to make everything
                                consistent with our understanding of right, for prosperity and happiness while on our
                                earthly pilgrimage. It is not strange, under this influence, that so many fail to secure
                                the more imperishable treasures, in the heavenly home, "where moth and rust doth not
                                corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal." To build up and to establish
                                a moral or spiritual work, in the soul, a correTERMS<pb n="137" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> sponding zeal
                                and earnestness to succeed must be manifested, and the same untirino" efforts carried
                                forward in order to secure a permanent foundation, which may not be destroyed by the
                                corroding elements of the world. Jesus in his inimitable sermon informs us of the
                                blessings that shall attend the pure in heart, and no less those who thirst after
                                righteousness. Blessings which are so liberally proffered, in the goodness of God,
                                should claim our first and our highest attention. God giveth liberally to all, "He
                                maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on
                                the unjust." It is for us to tell of the advantages to be derived by accepting a
                                discipleship and by receiving into our minds the life and spiritual interest of the
                                Savior of men. We acknowledge with all meekness the temporal blessings, in which God
                                gives tfl us our daily bread, and in which be remembers the " birds of the air," and the
                                "lilies of the field." With all this merciful condescension to make our earthly home one
                                of love and joy and peace, we must also bear witness that the inspiration of the Christ,
                                urges us to seek first the kingdom of God. And of what use would the kingdom of God be
                                to us, or to any people, if we closed the door on entering or failed to publish the glad
                                tidings of peace on earth; to men and women, "good will." Of what benefit is the "seed
                                time" if there is no seed to sow? or having the seed, to fold it in a napkin and hide it
                                from sight? Could we not read the biblical story with profit? (see Matt. xxv., 14�30.)
                                These lessons that are given to us and the experience Ave have obtained while contending
                                for an existence on the earth, should be used to advantage in our acceptance of a
                                spiritual life. In both we share enjoyments and disappointments, sunshine and storm. We
                                contend with laudable zeal against every enemy to our prosperity, as we toil early and
                                late for our earthly possessions, and we must contend as zealously against every enemy
                                of our spiritual interests and peace of mind, if we ever expect to obtain a victory over
                                the world. If, in the one, there is danger in delay, as the season for ploughing and the
                                sowing of seed is passing, then it is equally true that the other demands corresponding
                                vigorous action, if we would wish to insure a spiritual prosperity, and establish upon
                                the earth the kingdom of God, in which shall dwell righteousness and peace.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Bathing and why we should bathe" TEIform="index"/>BATHING AND WHY WE SHOULD BATHE. </head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">Among all the appliances for health and comfort to mankind we may safely say

                                        The indoor laborer who gets but a scanty supply of fresh air, needs a bath to
                                        obtain those invigorating elements so common in the open air. The outdoor
                                        laborer�especially thfc. farmer�who works with heroic energy all day long,
                                        unavoidably gathers on the entire surface of his body a complete prison-wall of
                                        dust and thickening, gummy perspiration: and when his day's work is done, he
                                        needs then, more than any other thing, not only a wash, but a good, luscious,
                                        full bath to fit him for a clean bed and a refreshing sleep. The glutinous mass

                                        water are exceedingly desirable, and usually indispensable to health and
                                        comfort; consequently, every family should have a convenient bath� and a full
                                        bath too�of some kind, not only for general neatness of person, so desirable to
                                        every individual of taste and culture, but as a means of preserving health, and
                                        in many cases, especially under the advice of a good physician, as the safest,

                                        disease. Directed by good judgment and wise counsel, a bath is a valuable
                                        auxiliary to other remedies, and it can be used when internal remedies cannot.

                                        contain something for a complete immersion in water, and since convenient and

                                        distend the stomach and make it feel uncomfortable. From fifteen to thirty
                                        minutes may be consumed in drinking the hot water. A period of six months is
                                        generally required to wash out the liver and intestines thoroughly. Not more
                                        than half a pint of hot water should be drunk with the meals. To make the

                                        blossom, ginger, lemon juice, sage, salt or sulphate of magnesia are sometimes
                                        added. Where there is an intense thirst or dryness a pinch of chloride of
                                        calcium or of nitrate of potash may be added to allay the thirst and leave a
                                        moistened film over the parched and dry mucous surface. When there is diarrhoea,
                                        cinnamon, ginger and pepper may be boiled in hot water, and the quantity
                                        lessened. For constipation, a teaspooniul of sulphate of magnesia, or half
                                        teaspoonful of taraxacum, may be used in hot water. Inebriety has a deadly foe
                                        in the use of hot water. All thirst and dry mucous membrane disappear in a few
                                        days and a moist condition of the mucous membrane and skin takes place. The
                                        relaxing influence of the heat inside the alimentary canal relieves spasm and

                                        dilutes the ropy secretions of the whole body, and renders them less adhesive
                                        and tenacious. It dissolves the abnormal crystalline substances that may be in
                                        the blood and urine. It washes out the stomach and leaves it fresh and clean for
                                        eating. It promotes elimination everywhere. As we are 75 per cent water, to keep
                                        from stagnation we need continual renewal. The universal use of hot beverages at
                                        meal time is based on a physiological necessity. If hot water in due quantities

                                        so-called medicated soaps, says that the attempt to medicate soap is a perfect
                                        farce�a delusion and a snare to entrap the unwary and the uneducated. The soap
                                        is to cleanse, it is applied for a few moments, and washed off, and is incapable
                                        of effecting a cure of the skin. The assertion can be made with truth, he says,
                                        that itch, which sulphur will certainly cure if regularly used, has never been
                                        and can never be, cured by this remedy in the form of soap. The soap neither
                                        keeps the skin always well, nor cures it when diseased. Carbolic soap is useless
                                        and may be dangerous, because the carbolic acid may cover a cheap, poor soap.
                                        Respecting the soothing soaps, as glycerine, honey, oat-meal, almond and a host
                                        of others, at best they are only bland soaps, and no way superior to a perfectly
                                        pure soap without these healing properties. The safest soap to use, of those
                                        ordinarily employed, is undoubtedly very old, white castile soap." I have quoted
                                        this writer, not because I concur with him entirely in his views, but because I
                                        think they are in the main correct, and because I know that people are greatly
                                        imposed on by the high-priced and, in most cases, useless soaps, advertised. It
                                        reminds me very much of the practice in many parts of the country, of searching
                                        and digging for roots and "yerbs" to make a poultice, when cloths wrung out of
                                        hot water would answer every purpose. As to itch, it is certainly true that soap
                                        alone, especially strong home-made soft soap, will cure it, without any
                                        addition, if thoroughly and persistently used. The same may be said of tar and
                                        carbolic soap in other skin diseases, but these are better applied in the form
                                        of an ointment, the virtues being due to the tar and carbolic acid, and not to
                                        the soap, and these are more effectually used in the form above indicated.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Woman's work" TEIform="index"/>Woman's Work.</bibl></cit></p></div3><div3 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The presence of one corrupt person may cause hundreds to be suspected" TEIform="index"/>

                                        and the method of our creation may be interesting, but far more important is the
                                        fact that we are here, with the inevitable question, What can we make of
                                        ourselves and how develop all that we have? The theories of the theologian and
                                        the evolutionist are not unimportant, but more important is the work of the
                                        teacher and moral reformer. Our question, therefore, What shall the ideal man
                                        include? is very practical. Physiologically considered, man's life is built
                                        along an axis which we call the spinal column. Along this axis there seem to be
                                        three great centers : First, the reproductive organs, which we may call the
                                        passional center. Second, the stomach, which may be called the centre of
                                        appetite. Third, the brain, which may be called the center of thought and
                                        affection. For our present life, at least, we must believe that all these
                                        centers are necessary. But the ideal man will not be ruled from that center
                                        which lies at the base of the spinal column. The very life of the species
                                        depends upon these organs, while their overstimulation and abuse tend to its
                                        degradation and destruction. To-day society is alarmed at the rapid increase of
                                        sins against chastity; at the aggressive violation of the marriage contract. We
                                        ask for the cause ! Is church, State or home at fault? Perhaps all of them. But
                                        the real cause lies in the fact that men allow themselves to be ruled from the
                                        lowest center of their lifo, the base of the spinal column. Second�The ideal man
                                        will not be ruled from the middle center, or the stomach. Yet, from this center
                                        radiate all the appetites which minister to man's physical life; it is the
                                        center of all the vast industries of man,<pb n="140" id="p22" TEIform="pb"/> foi primarily it
                                        is appetite that prompts men to work. But while the normal use of these central
                                        organs is so necessary for the healthy life of man, who can estimate the misery
                                        that arises from their abuse. By a study of zoology we learn that there are some
                                        animals very simple in their organism; some are nearly all stomach. Well,
                                        judging by their actions we might well believe that some men were nearly all
                                        stomach ; they are literally ruled from that ce ter. Men begin to toil because
                                        they are hungry. Shall that be the end of toil? Oh, the pitiable cry of every
                                        worldly man, I must make a living! So must a pig. And if getting a living is the
                                        end of life what better is the life of man than that of the swine? Third�The
                                        ideal man will be ruled from the top of the spinal column. All three of the
                                        centers, intellectual, appetite and passional, will indeed be active; but they
                                        will be set in harmonious relations and ruled from the top. Here thought and
                                        affection will be found always in command. It will not be a blind, but an
                                        intelligent rule. Our prisons, almshouses, insane asylums are crowded full. They
                                        will never be relieved till men are taught to live above the ears ; till they
                                        are no longer dominated by the beast instincts, but ruled by the conviction that
                                        they are men. Let men be ruled from the head and the heart and we shall have not
                                        only the ideal man, but the ideal society, and we shall feel that that is in
                                        some sense the reign of Christ, and Paul's prophecy shall be fulfilled when we
                                        all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
                                        perfect man.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Boston journal" TEIform="index"/>Boston Journal.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Cruelty to birds" TEIform="index"/>CRUELTY TO BIRDS.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Evans, F.

                            disgusted. Instead of enjoying the sight of what are termed the better half of humanity. I
                            loathe their presence, whether on the street, in the cars, or in the boat. I keep thinking
                            of Bergh, and wondering if an action would not lie against any one of these "dead bird
                            women" for cruelty to animals. Are not birds, animals with wings? Is there not some
                            humanitarian, some person of means and leisure, who will help Bergh to abate ihis offensive
                            nuisance? In the "Tribune" of recent date, there was a notice of a society woman in London
                            who, intending to surprise her affianced husband, at her wedding, had a gown made of dead
                            cauary birds. She succeeded beyond her most sanguine anticipations : For, when he saw her
                            come before the altar thus clothed, he was horror struck, and broke off' the ceremony at
                            once, exclaiming "I am afraid to trust my life destiny with a murderess !" Now it is
                            announced that "a rich New York woman has sent two skilled hunters to Africa to kill 500
                            birds of paradise, with which dead birds she is going to have a garment made." When that
                            woman appears in public in that raiment of blood, every woman seeing her, who does not hang
                            her head in shame or raise her voice in indignation at the murderess, should be marked by
                            men. If married let her husband restrain his anger and not use '' a rod larger than a
                            broomstick in correcting her." Human life should not be endangered. Buddhists.�Are not the
                            Buddhists right in making the first article of their religious creed, "Thou shalt not kill
                            ?"� assuming that the killing of inferior animals leads to murder�to war�the killing of
                            human beings. Commission.�The presence in America of a Peace Commission, composed of
                            prominent Englishmen, is a sign in the old heavens and earth to be marvelled at. But
                            wherefore was the Com-<pb n="141" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> mission not half composed of women ? Were there
                            not enough, after omitting the "dead bird women," to fill out the Commission? Make woman a
                            citizen, give her the right to vote and the responsibility of office, aud she will soon
                            cease to befoul herself with dead birds or deform her body with bangs or bustles. Wars will
                            never "cease to the ends of the earth," except through the instrumentality of woman. But
                            woman must become more womanly by removing from herself the proximate causes of war, before
                            she will be endowed with power from on high to redeem man from the absurd and bloody art of
                            war. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                                    the marked signs of the rimes. It is a sort of reference book in the Sunday school,
                                    but the old time reading of it, the close familiarity with its stories, with its
                                    poetry and its history, with its language as the most beautiful use of English that
                                    has ever been known, with its great spiritual truths which always enkindle the soul,
                                    is passing away, and there is coming up a generation that is as ignorant of Holy
                                    Scripture as it is of the Choctaw alphabet. The religious newspaper is a poor
                                    substitute for the Bible, and the average modern book is poorer still. The sermons
                                    on Sunday are not disquisitions on Bible themes to any extent, and the people are
                                    turned out to pasture in spiritual fields, for the most part, where the grazing is
                                    not much better than it was in the country where the prodigal son staid till he was
                                    famished. People are in search of a religion which ignores sin, gives a man a soft
                                    creed to believe in, feeds him on pleasurable sentiments, and at length tosses him
                                    into the other world to come down he knows not where. The decay in religious reading
                                    of the bracing sort has had this effect everywhere. But this is only the symptoms of
                                    a much wider-spread dis ease. The Bible and the sermon and the devotional book are
                                    superseded by the prevalence of an easier feeling about life. People are in the
                                    backswing from a period when the severities of the divine law were set forth in
                                    sermon and book alike, and when the Bible was recommended chiefly because it was a
                                    sure revelation of the eternal doom of the vast majority of all mankind. The
                                    religious life of the people has been demoralized, and there has been altogether too
                                    much cheap and<pb n="142" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> simple re 1 gion�a religion that either
                                    frightened men out of their five senses in order to make them Christians or set
                                    before them such simple requirements for a consecrated life that they felt they were
                                    well enough off as they were. The one extreme has been as bad as the other, and both
                                    have tended to destroy the growth of a devout spirit which finds in Bible and sermon
                                    and book the nourishment of the spiritual life. Again and again the study of the
                                    Bible has brought out the stronger affections of the people into such reality that
                                    they became like the Hebrew and Christian saints whum they knew through imaginative
                                    sympathy, and rose to faith and trust and noble deeds like them. It is the
                                    presentation of this stronger life which is greatly needed to-day in the pulpit, in
                                    the Sunday school, in the family, in the channels of Christian literature. Where
                                    there is something to take hold of, where the thought of the average man is reached,
                                    whether through Bible or sermon or secular reading, the mind has been awakened and
                                    the spiritual nature is almost sure to be aroused. Much as the people are now
                                    distracted by their multiplied engagements, they will not shun the Bible when it is
                                    made interesting to them, nor will they turn away from religious reading when it is
                                    made to convey the true message of God to man in this generation.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Boston herald" TEIform="index"/>Boston Herald.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Juvenile" TEIform="index"/>Juvenile.</head><div3 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Story of grumble-tone" TEIform="index"/>THE STORY OF GRUMBLE-TONE.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Wilcox, Ella Wheeler" TEIform="persName"/>Ella Wheeler Wilcox.</byline><p TEIform="p">There was a boy named Grumble-Tone, who ran away to sea.

                                seething ocean billows failed to stimulate his mirth, For he did not like the vessel, or
                                the dizzy, rolling berth. And he thought the sea was almost as unpleasant as the earth.

                                or saw seemed just evactly right, And so he journeyed on and on, still seeking for
                                delight. He talked with kings and ladies fair; he dined in courts, they say; But always
                                found the people dull, and longed to get away, To search for the mysterious land where
                                he should like to stay. He wandered over all the earth, his hair grew white as snow. He
                                reached the final bourn at last, where all of us must go; But never found the land he
                                sought. The reason would you know? The reason was that North or South, where'er his
                                steps were bent, On land or sea. in court or hall, he found but discontent; For he took

                                        looks like "prevarication" is therefore not less, but more heinous than others ;
                                        and yet parents make light of these offenses and call them "romances." Truth is
                                        the regenerator by which human nature is to be restored. </quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="To pretend not to care what others think of us..."

                                reading the "Editorials" they are very valuable. When the April No. came I was delighted
                                with it. It does seem as if it grows better every number. Dear Br. Alonzo Hollister, I

                                but I presume I never shall, as my home is in "the land of steady habits," and yours so

                                in April No. coincide with mine. I am striving for the "one thing needful," and am
                                refreshed in my daily walk to and from my labor by the beauties of Grod.

                                at Two Hundred Years Ago." Besides E. P. Roe's popular serial story of southern life at
                                the end of the war " Miss Lou," there is a notable short stoiy of the Stevenson type,
                                entitled "Dr. Brendt's Wife," which is a strong piece of work. Mathew Arnold's memory is
                                embalmed in a sonnet by his friend Joel Benton. Other poetic gems in the same number are
                                by Danske Dandridge, Anna Vernon Dorsey, and Edith Sessions Tupper. </p></div3><div3 type="book notice" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Woman; her power and privileges" TEIform="index"/>Woman; Her power and

CHRONIC DISEASES.
From the earliest historic times there has been
more or less discussion as to what constitutes a
chronic disease, as distinct from an acute malady.
The plainest presentation of this subject that we
have met with is contained in " Plain Home Talk,"
commencing on page 333. Dr. E. B. Foote, the
author of the book, has been engaged for thirty
years in studying, treating and writing about chronic diseases, and he has well earned the reputation of
being the most expert specialist in practice, as well
as being regarded a high authority in theory. The
doctor sti 1 invites and receives consultations from
the sick in ail parts of tlr; civilized world, either in
person or by letter, at his office in New York, 120
