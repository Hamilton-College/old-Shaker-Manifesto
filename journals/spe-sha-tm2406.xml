                            their way to Bowling Green. This sight was of common occurrence. The cars were sometimes so
                            heavily laden that many of the soldiers were obliged to get out till the train could pass a
                            steep up grade. During this exhibition the crowd would become so excited that the air was
                            filled with their cheers and wild screams. This evening twenty-one Cavalry called to stop
                            over night. They all received supper, shelter and breakfast. Jan. 2. Five armed men called
                            at the Trustees' Office. Three were in a buggy and two on horseback. They said they wanted
                            to buy some cloth, and a roll of twenty-four yards was brought forward. This they seized and
                            hurriedly made off, saying; "as we have to fight your battles, we must have some clothing."
                            From the mark on their hats we supposed they were Texas Rangers. Whether or not they were
                            soldiers, we could not tell; but we did know that they were robbers. Jan. 3. Four soldiers
                            called for dinner and were accommodated. For this attention they expressed many thanks. Jan.
                            8. We note this as a remarkable instance. Forty Cavalry passed through our village and made
                            no demands. In the evening two Cavalry men called for supper, lodging and breakfast. As this
                            burden was so light it gave us but little anxiety. Jan. 9. This evening forty Cavalry called
                            for supper, lodging and breakfast. We treated them as kindly as we could and on leaving they
                            manifested a very pleasant spirit, JUNE, <pb n="126" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> 126 THE MANIFESTO. Jan. 10.
                            Five soldiers were provided with a dinner at the Trustees' Office. Jan. 12. Sixty army
                            wagons passed through our village. A guard of two or three soldiers accompanied each wagon.
                            Only five horses were to be seen while it required two hundred and thirty-eight mules to
                            haul these heavy loads. Jan. 14. This morning five armed men called at the Trustees' Office
                            and asked to see some cloth, or handkerchiefs or anything we had for sale. From our former
                            experience we had grown to be careful and did not present much for them to buy nor to take
                            by force of arms. The Brethren kept a close watch and followed them as they went toward the
                            Sisters' new brick shop. We informed them that we could not allow armed men to enter the
                            Sisters' rooms. We then persuaded them to go and see the cistern and then invited them to
                            take dinner at the Post Office. In this building they saw a free man, of color, who was
                            quite feeble. They seemed quite anxious to know to whom he belonged, and where his master
                            was at this time. They made enquiry of Elder Solomon Rankin about the number of persons that
                            lived in the large dwelling. Elder Solomon informed them that not less than ninety Brethren
                            and Sisters lived in that house. At this reply they seemed much surprised, and remarked, uIf
                            so many of you live in one house you would tight and kill each other." Elder Solomon told
                            them that the good man, Jesus the Christ, had taught us not to fight nor kill. One of the
                            company remarked, "We do not know him; he does not live in Texas." In the com*se of the
                            conversation Elder Solomon spoke of the case of Ananias and Sapphira. "Yes, we are well
                            acquainted with them ; they lived on the right side of the style." Another said, "If you do
                            not swear, nor fight, nor kill, nor drink whiskey, we do not see what you can do." Elder
                            Solomon replied, We work for our living, that we may have something to eat and to wear and
                            to give to the poor. But said they ;�"What do you do on Sundays?" We improve our time in
                            reading and writing and in attending Religious service. "Well," said they, "this must be a
                            heaven of a place, and you are certainly a very good people." At 9 o'clock p. m. we were
                            disturbed by the noise and tramp of Cavalry horses in the street, in front of our buildings.
                            The Brethren on making enquiries, learned that they wanted supper for two hundred and
                            twenty-five <pb n="127" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 127 men. As it was so late we urged them to
                            go to the hotel about a mile distant. At this they threatened to break into our buildings
                            and help themselves if we would not provide for them. As we did not wish to awaken too much
                            of their anger, we concluded to do the best we could and informed the Colonel that it would
                            be two hours, before they could have the food. An officer by the name of Keep then said that
                            his men must have some rest. The Brethren conducted the soldiers to the West family, which
                            had been vacated for some months, and then provided hay for the horses. The men were ordered
                            to rest till three o'clock in the morning, when they would be called to breakfast, instead
                            of being called to supper. The Brethren who acted as night watch, said the soldiers were
                            cold and hungry, but were obliged to lie down on the floor or on the ground, and many of
                            them were soon fast asleep. A part of this company under Col. Scott went on to Yost's tavern
                            and remained there over night.

                                and paradoxes. We are indeed complex beings, not only in our own individuality, but as a
                                part of the great cosmos. We embark on life's sea, all unconscious of the dangers that
                                lie around us, yet there is an invisible hand that guides and directs, and each day as
                                the surges beat around us, we feel safe in the line of our life work. How fully the
                                present claims our attention ; truly we strive in vain to pierce the misty future, which
                                is wisely veiled from our sight, lest we become oblivious to, and neglectful of the
                                duties and obligations that claim our ever active service. We have not much time to
                                dream or philosophize, but in dealing with matter of fact realities, we have great need
                                of sublime patience and heroic fortitude, lest we become weak and vacillating. The firm
                                soul doubts not, the true soul wavers not,and the upright in heart despair not. The
                                hidden forces that continually urge us to grander, nobler striving, make continuous
                                existence possible. It is pulsating life that holds us to the centre of being, and
                                unites us to the great Over-soul from whence we came, and whither we are tending,
                                through evolutionary processes of development. Life is action and motion, the still pool
                                grows stagnant. The sapless branches die; so with individuals and bodies of people, if
                                they cease to move or grow, they cease to exist, for the want of accretive and
                                concretive force. As a people should we not be quickened anew, and awake to a
                                realization of the great truths committed to us, feeling a yearning desire that others
                                    <pb n="128" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> 128 THE MANIFESTO. may share of the power of salvation found
                                under the ministration and baptism of the Christ spirit? When we look abroad in the
                                world and see the chaotic conditions there existing, and know of the misery, vice and
                                crime, that keep human beings on the lower plane of animal existence, we feel an
                                impulse, and a strong desire, that as we have been lifted up we want to draw all mankind
                                to us. Though all are not prepared to receive the truths of the higher life yet every
                                good thought and desire is helpful, and above all, the loving service of unselfish
                                devotion, sustains the home, where all who seek, shall find the bread and water that
                                faileth not. These are strange times, destitution and suffering on every hand, the great
                                rush of emigration to our shores especially to the large centres of civilization, helps
                                to increase the present misery. It may be of interest to you to know that we have made
                                up a contribution, and sent to the head quarters of the Salvation Army in New York; it
                                consisted of three barrels (tightly packed) of clothing, one bale of bedding, two
                                barrels of assorted beans, one of dried apples, and twenty-five sacks of potatoes. By
                                applying to the railroad companies, they were taken free. One of the officers of the
                                Army, who has charge of distribution, expressed much gratitude, and said they had great
                                need of every thing in the line of food and clothing, to keep the needy poor from
                                freezing and starving. All charity organizations were taxed to their utmost. In looking
                                over an old record dating back to the establishment of the Church, we find that
                                Believers held strictly to the injunction of Mother Ann and the first Elders to live
                                temperately and practice economy, that they might have something to give to the poor. We
                                found it recorded, that in several instances, when there were great calamities, they
                                responded liberally to the call for help. I copied the following: "Wed. July 16. In
                                consequence of the late distress of the poor inhabitants of New York City occasioned by
                                yellow fever, the Churches and Societies of New Lebanon and Hancock made a collection of
                                money to the amount of two hundred and thirty-six dollars, and various kinds of
                                provisions for their relief, which were transported to the city of Hudson in
                                twenty-three wagons to go by water to New York, with a letter addressed to the Mayor and
                                corporation by the Trustees of the Society; a copy of this letter and the Mayor's answer
                                is preserved." Our good Brother Benjamin sent a box of clothing to another quarter of
                                the city, and I have no doubt, but other families and Societies would have increased the
                                contribution if there had been a general appeal. I presume our friends of Enfield have
                                many callers, especially at the Office, "The sons of rest," as the tramps are politely
                                called, make their way to Shaker Villages where their neighbors usually send them, or
                                they come a long distance over the mountain. A Sister once said that every one was
                                hungry as soon as they stepped on Shaker ground. If people felt their spiritual needs as
                                keenly as they realize their physical necessities how gladly would we give of the bread

                                home, where true equality reigns, and unselfish love renders mutual service. We have
                                several Sisters who have not been in the family a year. Brethren are greatly in need of
                                help and we hope to see their ranks filled before long, some men are writing and many
                                are '^almost persuaded," but fear they will have to practice just a little too much
                                self-denial if they come in our Order. We hear that you have been gathering some in your
                                family from the South family, you must have had a busy time moving. In sending our love

                            to me, Tells me of our God in heaven By whose hand all gifts are given So abundantly. He who

                            lower, selfish desires. We find ourselves placed in this world, with strong impulses and
                            propensities, <pb n="131" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 131 the enjoyment of which may produce
                            momentary pleasure, "but the end thereof is death." How natural it is, especially with those
                            of inexperienced years, to follow the guidance of these impulses, and consequently reap the
                            bitter fruits of self-indulgence, the effects of violated law, and instead of a life filled
                            with promise and nobilit}7 of purpose, make of it disappointment and sorrow. Some time
                            since, I was standing on a street corner in one of our large cities, waiting for a car;
                            while there, a number of children of the lower strata of society gathered around ; such an
                            accumulation of rags and dirt I never before witnessed. As I looked into their young faces,
                            and saw depicted, even at their tender yjars, the marks of that triune monster�poverty, sin,
                            and suffering,�I realized with deep anguish their deplorable condition; their homes, instead
                            of being homes in the protecting and endearing sense of the word, are hovels of drunkenness
                            and vice; associated with like companions, they become acquainted with every conceivable
                            form of crime; their feet, thus placed on the steepest declivity to sin, how can they, under
                            such conditions, unfold the higher powers of soul and glorify God by living a true life.
                            AVith this sad picture before me I could but pity, where otherwise I would condemn; I could
                            not throw the first stone of reproach, no matter how high I may estimate virtue ; if placed
                            in like circumstances, the results might be similar. Never, in the history of mankind that
                            we have any record of, was there a time when so many souls have devoted their powers of mind
                            to philanthropic movements for the uplifting of the unfortunate. Society is greatly to blame
                            for the many w rong conditions that exist; when justice is done, and all have their
                            God-given rights bequeathed to them, much of the sin and suffering will be averted. Humanity
                            is composed of many incongruities ; owing to our preconceived opinions on religious
                            subjects, the diversity of education, and the various circumstances of life that form our
                            characters more or less, it would seem difficult to prescribe the limits for a true life;
                            and yet, when we look at it from a practical standpoint, it is easy of solution. Goodness of
                            heart is not produced by beliefs nor opinions; it is a growth through obedience to
                            principles that are eternal. "We find within ourselves diverse natures; the voice of one
                            cries, "live for pleasure and the enjoyments of this life;" the other says, "deny thyself,
                            thou wert made for higher purposes than the beasts that perish ; thou wert made to subdue
                            the earth in thine own soul, to conquer and bring into subjection to the law of Christ�by
                            the stronger God-given faculties of the mind�all the elements that are of the earth, and to
                            reign triumphant over all the appetites and passions of the body; thus develop that angelic
                            life that is eternal." The grand work of redemption lumes up to our minds like an ideal
                            vision ; it comes to our souls as an inspiration from that radiant throng who stand <pb n="132" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> 132 THE MANIFESTO. transcendent in victory; but, unless each one
                            strives for that redemption we can not realize its blessedness. "It is well to think well,
                            it is divine to act well;" it is not aspiration and noble thinking alone, that constitutes a
                            true life, but noble action and right doing; they that do the most good, who embody in their
                            daily lives the precept of Jesus,�"Do unto others as ye would have others do unto you," who
                            are pure and true and honest in all the relations of life ; these are they who make of life
                            a success; they connect themselves with all good, and are thus brought near to God where
                            they can feel the warmth of his beneficent sunshine in their hearts, illuminating the
                            darkest way and lifting the heaviest burden. It is in the power of us all to attain to this
                            altitude of goodness. It does not require extraordinary talent nor genius. It is not for the
                            recluse nor the religious devotee who counts his rosary, or repeats the most prayers. No
                            matter what our belief, we may pray with our faces to the rising or setting sun, or towards
                            Mecca, if our faith so directs. These things count for but little, compared with that
                            practical life of righteousness we are all called to live. If we love God, and through our
                            love to Him are striving to make the world brighter and better by improving our own lives
                            and doing all the good we can for others, then we shall feel that we have not lived in vain.
                            Life comes to all with its burdens and crosses; its temptations to be resisted. By bearing
                            whatever it has for us cheerfully, bravely and nobly, we make of it a triumphant success;
                            this, God requires of us, and our own conscious integrity demands it. Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            think, say or do. It originates in his nature and circumstances, and is as early in its
                            manifestation, as constant in its character, as universal in its influence, as are sentiment
                            or principle of action marking the history of man. No better illustration can be given of
                            this, than a reference to the life of Jesus. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
                            lay down hi� life for his friends." The selfish interest in this case is lost from sight,
                            and man becomes interested in the peace and prosperity of his brother man. Every class of
                            reformers, even though their work is but a slight advance beyond the mass of mankind, find
                            it difficult to obtain those who will work in the interest of their special cause. It is
                            sometimes astonishing to see how slowly the world moves in a moral reform, even in the ranks
                            of the reformers, themselves, while they are making a loud noise against those whom they
                            consider on the wrong track. A man's habits, and they may be either good or bad, seem to
                            become in many cases as a part of himself, and to break from the bad, even when admonished
                            by a higher light, is like tearing the flesh from his body. Indeed, these bad habits
                            sometimes become so strong that the powers of the mind have not force enough to resist them.
                            The Methodist church a few years since had reached the conclusion that the chewing and
                            smoking of tobacco was an unclean habit for a minister, and ventured to ask the ministry to
                            lay it aside. All classes of Christians, at an earlier date, had poisoned the air with the
                            fumes of tobacco, and while they were urging the people to be saved from the wicked habits
                            of the world, they were not able to take up their own crosses against this filthy habit and
                            help to save themselves. Now a methodist minister comes forward with his pipe and tobacco
                            box and <pb n="137" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> THE MANIFESTO. 137 wants the privilege of chewing his tobacco
                            while he reads this word of God to his people ;�"Let him that is filthy, be filthy still."
                            Among the Rules of propriety for our Community, we have published the following :�"The
                            chewing or smoking of tobacco should not be practiced by any Christian Believer." Others are
                            made to suffer in respect�to health, through this expensive and unnecessary indulgence. The
                            rebuke of the lady in the western wilds was to the point. The traveler drove up to a log
                            house in a storm and asked for shelter. The lady objected for lack of accommodations, but
                            the man persisted and brought the Bible to his aid, that possibly by doing good to a
                            stranger she might be entertaining an angel unawares. This was a case where ignorance was
                            bliss, as she said, "You can't make me believe that. No angel would come down here with a
                            cud of tobacco in his mouth." Every phase of a religious life suffers more or less in this
                            same way. Christianity is an exalted term, and those who embrace it are expected to become
                            resurrected from all that is not admissible in the kingdom of heaven. The ltevelator says
                            that nothing can enter the Holy City that defiles or makes a lie. Temperance people are
                            strong in their denunciations against the use of intoxicating drinks, while at the same time
                            they are using a liberal supply of tobacco. A consistent Christian thinks that cleanliness
                            conies very near to godliness, and yet many of the self-styled saints, keep company with the
                            great unwashed. While the race of mankind is on the upward march, and a wonderful progress
                            has already been made in many ways, there is still more room for improvement. It is sad to
                            know that even one individual is willing or is forced to fall into unclean or corrupting
                            influences, and far worse when a family or a tribe is found to be below the beasts of the
                            field. When Col. Samuel Baker made his journey through Africa, and had men in his own
                            company who might have made slight reforms in neatness without harm to themselves, he at
                            that same time found tribes of the natives whose huts were ankle deep with filth. If a score
                            of persons from these families should enter any large church, the stench would be such that
                            a general stampede would be made for fresh air, and the Bible be closed for that day. This
                            however, is only one degree. The more cleanly wish to be excused, and yet in the face of
                            these drawbacks the march is always upward toward God and toward the Holy City where nothing
                            can enter that defiles. Deny yourself daily, said Jesus, and take up your cross and follow
                                <pb n="138" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> 138 THE MANIFESTO. me. This is so simple and plain that it needs
                            no special illustration. Nothing can ever do away with the discipline that is demanded. To
                            follow Jesus on his march toward God, is a daily practice of self-denial, and it bears its
                            own leward. It is like the water that was offered to the woman of Samaria. "Whosoever
                            drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall
                            give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."</p></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p"> are informed by the Post Master at Harr 3burg, O., that The Manifesto sent to Loy Libbey, is

                                G. Reed. May 7, 1894. Beloved Elder Henry;�It is such a busy time I thought you would
                                accept the Home Notes this time from a little girl twelve years old: and besides we have
                                taken note of some things of interest we would like to tell you about, which perhaps
                                older people would overlook. Having so early a spring, we thought we would write the
                                date of the arrival of the birds as they came, that next year we might compare dates and
                                see if the early coming of the birds denotes an early spring and then we shall know what
                                to expect. Bluebirds were first heard the sixth of March, robins the eleventh, song
                                sparrows the fifteenth. A pretty little brown singing bird which I have not yet learned
                                the name of, came the second of April, phaebe birds the fourth, the hair bird or
                                chipping sparrow the tenth, and the martins the nineteenth. The beautiful oriole came
                                yesterday, the sixth, but the swallows, yellow birds, mocking birds and many others are
                                yet to come. We picked the first little yellow coltsfoot flower on the eighth of April,
                                and dandelions peeped out from among the green grass in sunny places the third week of
                                April. Cherry trees were in blossom on the thirtieth of April and now the plum, pear,
                                peach and even apple trees are in bloom and it is but the seventh of May; earlier,
                                people say, than since the year 1878. On the tenth of April we had a pleasant flowery
                                entertainment. Our family dwelling being heated by steam, plants can be kept in any of
                                our windows without freezing, so there are flowers in the sunny windows all winter. This
                                spring some one thought it would be pleasant to gather them together before putting them
                                into the ground for the summer, so that all could enjoy their beauty. The young Sisters
                                arranged them in the form "of a bank eight feet high, nine feet wide and seven feet
                                through. There were callas, six kinds of roses, fifteen kinds of geraniums, fuchias,
                                oxalis, begonias, Zanzibar balsam, feverfew, ageratum, besides several foliage plants.
                                In the evening the Brethren and Sisters gathered into the well lighted chapel where they
                                were, and many said it seemed like heaven. We had singing, reading, and speaking of
                                sentiments suitable for the occasion. Katie Wells. TERMS. <pb n="141" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> THE MA

                                to the season Brethren sometimes fail to appear with their most excellent themes in the
                                department of "Home Notes" as was the case last month. There is something wholesome and
                                cheery in the intercommunication thus established between our Societies, it serves as a
                                mental visit "around east" and "out west;" and in our growing relation and acquaintance,
                                it seems suggestive of a more thoughtful and helpful means of stimulating one another to
                                higher aims and nobler purposes along the lines of mental, moral and spiritual culture.
                                It is so natural for us to settle down in our own cozy homes, content in the performance
                                of our daily duties and the acquisition of creature comforts. What of our efforts in the
                                missionary line? What of our social and ethical improvement and the giving of our minds
                                to study the principles and doctrines of the Church to which we profess membership? Are
                                we reaching out in prayerful aspiration, to help souls who are seeking to know and
                                practice the truth? and are we prepared to minister to such, the power of salvation, and
                                give them sure guidance in paths of purity and virtue? Coming in contact with the world
                                we should let our light so shine that they may see our good works, and be convinced that
                                we are closely following the Master, instead of being influenced by the elements that
                                savor of the generative life. Souls are awaking to a knowledge of the benefits of
                                association on the plane of altruistic love and purity. It is interesting to learn of
                                the movements on the Pacific coast, in Australia and in other places which tend toward
                                the gathering of the saints together, those who are willing to make a covenant with God
                                and with each other, by the sacrifice of all selfish desires and worldly gains for
                                mutual benefit and growth in the divine life. It is the religious element in human
                                nature combined with enlightened reason, that builds up and sustains the communistic
                                home, where equality, justice and peace are maintained. It is according to Elder
                                Frederic's prophecy, that the next movement and awakening of the spirit would not result
                                so much in the accession of members to the older Societies, as it would lead to the
                                forming of new associations, with the same basic principles as a sure foundation on
                                which to build, but with the increase and progress belonging to our own day and time.
                                Yet when there is "a call or cry from Macedonia, come and help us," shall we send two or
                                more disciples to prepare the way and make straight paths for their feet to walk in? It
                                hardly seems probable at present, that the labors of a hundred years will be sacrificed
                                for any great exodus of the faithful to foreign lands, or even to far off coasts of our
                                own beloved continent, as is frequently suggested. We have only the fruits of our hard
                                earned labors, as no funds are poured in our coffers with which to build "The New
                                Jerusalem," or any other impossible venture, and above all let us not run in debt, for
                                aught we have, or aught we attempt to do. We are interested in all that tends to
                                ameliorate wrong conditions among mankind. In the Peace Movement we recognize a quiet
                                but potent influence surely working for the abolition of war. In Hygienic Reform, a
                                testimony against disease and animalism, which is sure to benefit and uplift the race.

                                direst curses. In the Social Purity and White Cross associations, one of the most

                                enables one to niore fully understand the trying times that our dear Brethren and
                                Sisters in the South passed through; but fortunately now can be recorded as history. The

                                of the little family at the North who, since their removal to this Society have been
                                anxiously, and with a prayerful spirit laboring to bring order out of the seeming
                                necessary confusion incident to moving. Thanks to willing hands and loyal souls the
                                consummation of their desires has been largely realized. While feeling some tribulation
                                in moving from the old home, we fully believe that there was a spiritual gift in the
                                move, and that the closer communion of Believers will result in a fuller and deeper
                                spiritual ministration that will go forth to those who are honestly and earnestly

                                seed time has come, and the gardeners and farmers have been busily employed in the work
                                of sowing and planting. The vegetable garden is receiving all due attention from the
                                interested laborers, and we may well look forward with hope for the blessings that the
                                earth will send forth. Already many varieties of plants are representing themselves
                                above ground, very much to the pleasure of the gardeners. At the North family we saw, a
                                few days since, a bed of beautiful strawberry plants and learned that some of the
                                varieties were as early in fruitage as are those that grow in the fields. Elder Nicholas
                                Briggs has also a nicely arranged trellis for grape vines, and has been very successful
                                in obtaining many beautifully large and well ripened clusters in former seasons. An
                                extended bed of onions attracted our attention, as their tops had reached an inch or
                                more above the ground. This was specially interesting, as in former years so much labor
                                has been expended unsuccessfully in the cultivation of this valuable plant. The panacea
                                has come at last, in the liberal application of tar water, and with this the onion
                                thrives beautifully, as all its ills and enemies are wholly destroyed. That nice lot of
                                potatoes that wei-e taken into a warm room quite early in March, have sent out sprouts
                                from one fourth to one inch in length, and to preserve these from harm, while being cut
                                and planted, has required the utmost care. Now if the Weather Bureau looks upon them
                                favorably for a few weeks, a bountiful crop may be anticipated so sure as day follows
                                day. The Post Master at this Village, (Eldv r Nicholas Briggs,) has very kindly arranged
                                with the officers of the Weather Bureau, so that we are now furnished with daily reports
                                giving us reliable information of what the weather may be for the forthcoming day. This
                                is one of the wonders of the age, and the knowledge becomes of great practical value,
                                especially to those who till the land. This scientific statement which is brought to us
                                every day, places the "Old Farmers' Almanac" at quite a discount, as it does a multitude
                                of self-styled weather prophets. Our pear, plum and cherry trees are now in full bloom
                                and this wonderful outburst of blossoms is a beautiful sight. Even the flowers in the
                                garden are asserting their rights at this early date and rivaling in beauty the tinting
                                of the rainbow. The great and good Creator of the beautiful flowers, evidently saw from
                                the beginning the great pleasure which the blending of these lovely colors, would give
                                to the mind of man. God bless the flowers!

                                light that would inform the unregenerate soul as to a better mode of life and what would

                                glory of a true Christian character. Can we look upon maturing nature and fail to learn
                                though the seasons come and go, its fruits grow and decay, that there are ever-existing,
                                unchangeable life-giving elements that create the bud, leaf and fruit? and with this
                                knowledge is it not reasonable to believe that the immortal part of man will be
                                sustained by eternal powers? If so, than how important that our lives be devoted to
                                works that sanctify and gladden souls, that in the "march of life" we fail not to assist

Culver.] A Washington special to the Atlanta Journal recently quoted some internal revenue statistics
                            showing that in spite of the hard times we have wasted enough money in the past year to make
                            everybody in the country comfortable. The Americans, who were howling about the financial
                            depression, spent in the past twelve months $609, 000, 000 for whiskey! The same crowd spent
                            in that period $617,268,4(50 for beer! For cigars and tobacco they spent $275, 750,000! The
                            grumblers and growlers who talked economy to their wives and children and prayed for the
                            return of good times, managed to scrape up about �1,600,000,000 for their common drinks and
                            their cigars, and what their wines and brandies cost we may imagine! This enormous sum, the
                            correspondent says, is more than our entire volume of circulation. It is $27 per capita more
                            than the present per capita circulation. It is 195 for each head of every family in the
                            United States! This money would pay all the appropriations of a billion-dollar congress and
                            leave enough to more than half pay the <pb n="146" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/> 146 THE MANIFESTO. expenses of
                            another such congress. It would pay six times over for our annual cotton crop. It would pay
                            the cost of a long foreign war. It would feed and clothe in a plain fashion every family in
                            the union! We do not present these startling figures with the hope that they will bring
                            about an economic revolution, but we believe that they can not fail to influence thousands
                            of thoughtful readers and create a prejudice against extravagance and waste.. This is not a
                            temperance editorial. It is simply a statement of facts which must open the eyes of men to
                            the true explanation of most of the poverty and suffering now prevailing. The American
                            liquor and tobacco bill would be frightful enough in a period of prosperity, but what shall

                            pamphlets which you have been so kind as to send me, have awakened in my heart. This I can
                            assure you, that since I am acquainted with the principles which govern your Community, I
                            believe there is no Society that I love and respect as much. I have read the "History of the
                            United Society of Believers," The Manifesto of Jan., Feb. and Mar., all of which I found
                            very interesting; and I learned that those who are making the greatest noise about Justice,
                            Equalitj and Communism, are least prepared for it. It requires very good men [and women]
                            first and always, to form a good society like yours. The timber necessaiy for such a
                            purpose, as far as my observation extends, seems to be very scarce. The Religion of Christ
                            is communism perfect, and to ameliorate society, the only way is to get nearer and nearer to
                            him. Me and my family, and as many of my neighbors as I can get under my feet for our
                            personal comfort, and to have our heads as near to heaven as possible, is what society is
                            to-day. At least, there is one consideration I have now; to know that there is a people who
                            practice the only true "Religion of Christ," where a man can do unto his neighbor as he
                            wishes to be done by, and live with good-will to all and malice toward none, without running
                            the risk of passing for a fool. As I have grown older I have rejected a great deal of what I
                            was taught in my younger days. I have always believed in those examples of Christ, as
                            everlasting truths. If you should publish anything in the line of pamphlets, I hope that you
                            will think of me. I shall be glad to send you the amount of their price. The seeds which I
                            have gathered from your writings will bring forth good fruits, if nothing more than to make
                            a better man of me, and consequently, a happier man. Hoping to hear from you again if my
                            writing has not proved too tedious to you, I remain forever, A Friend,</p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="S., G. J." TEIform="persName"/>G. J.

                            particular that seemed so im possible that many visitors would not believe in its reality,
                            and came away with the impression that they had seen a clever feat of legerdemain; whereas
                            the fact is, it was a genuine, natural phenomenon, which will doubtless be put to use in the
                            arts. We refer to the experiment shown in the electrical building, where a bar of iron was
                            raised to a welding heat by plunging it into a bucket of water. Several persons have asked
                            our opinion of this astonishing performance and perhaps an explanation of it would be
                            interesting. Most of our readers know that water is composed of two substances, oxygen and
                            hydrogen, which are both gaseous when they exist separately, but which condense and produce
                            that familiar liquid when they are united chemically. This may be <pb n="147" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/> THE
                            MANIFESTO. 147 proved by mixing one volume of oxygen with two volumes of hydrogen, and
                            applying a light to the mixture. It explodes violently, and for this reason, the experiment
                            must be performed in a strong vessel. When proper precautions are taken, it is found that
                            there is nothing in the vessel after the explosion but water and steam. The original gases
                            have entirely disappeared, and the new substance (i. e. the water) does not bear the
                            slightest resemblance to either of them. The composition of water may also be proved by
                            analysis. For example, if the two terminal wires of a galvanic-battery be dipped into a
                            glass of water, it will be found that bubbles of gas are given off at the negative wire (i.
                            e., the one connected with the zinc end of the battery,) and if these bubbles are collected
                            they will be found to consist of hydrogen. If the positive wire is of platinum or gold, or
                            some other non-oxidizable metal, bubbles of gas will appear there too; and upon collecting
                            them we shall find that they consist of oxygen. (If the positive wire is copper, bubbles
                            will be obtained, for the oxygen will unite with the copper as fast as it is liberated,
                            forming oxide of copper.) In the experiment referred to above, the bar of iron was connected
                            to the negative pole of a powerful dynamo, the other pole of which was connected with the
                            bucket, or with a plate of copper in the bottom of it. The water in the bucket immediately
                            began to decompose, and hydrogen was deposited all over the submerged surface of the iron
                            bar. In a few moments, the bar became covered with a film of hydrogen that protected it from
                            contact with the water around it. If the dynamo were not very powerful, the electric current
                            would then cease to flow, because the continuity of the circuit was broken. But as the
                            experiment was arranged at the Fair, the dynamo was so powerful that it overcame the great
                            resistance of the film of hydrogen, and sent its current right through it. Now it is a
                            general fact that heat is produced wherever an electric current encounters a resistance,
                            just as heat is produced in the bearings of an engine when the journal resists the motion of
                            the shaft owing to roughness or grit or bad alignment. Hence' the electric current from the
                            dynamo generated great heat in passing through the resistant film of hydrogen that was
                            deposited on the surface of the iron bar; and the dynamo used in the experiment was so
                            powerful that it could produce heat enough to make the bar white hot in a few moments. The
                            water did not quench the bar, because the hydrogen film prevented the two from coming into
                            actual contact with each other. It wras a remarkable and instructive experiment, and will
                            never be forgotten by those who saw it performed. Shaker Station, Conn.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="The late W. H. Howland..." TEIform="index"/>

                                    little children all about heaven, became a nun. In six weeks she was ready to return
                                    to her father's home. She was home sick. There is a time in the life of most girls
                                    when the humdrum, everyday home existence seems not worth living. Commonplace tasks
                                    seem unworthy of such consideration as her mother requires of her, if she is a good
                                    housekeeper. The girl longs for a more spiritual existence; thinks to find it in
                                    talking with poor little outcasts about God. It usually takes more than six weeks,
                                    however, for her to find that life upon this earth is likely to be a pretty
                                    practical one in whatever sphere it is cast. Before a Little Sister of the poor can
                                    consistently talk of the better life beyond to a ragamuffin she must wash its face,
                                    probably with her own hands, and provide clean garments for it also with her own
                                    hands. Then she may have to go from house to house asking for food for it. Into the
                                    busv business offices these women go, and gladly accept small sums of money, for
                                    which they literally beg. Somebody has to do such work, and all honor to those who
                                    are faithful in it, yet it is pre-eminently a practical life, full of the petty
                                    disagreeable duties which are so hateful to the girl who goes away to be a "Little
                                    Sister" because her work at home is too earthly.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Selected" TEIform="index"/>�Selected.</bibl></cit></p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Obituaries" TEIform="index"/>Deaths.</head><div3 type="obituary" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hanks, Burdett" TEIform="index"/>Burdett Hanks
