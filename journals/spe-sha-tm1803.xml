The extremely hisrh prices at
which the IXL inks have been sold
ever since their introduction into
this country has hitherto limited
their use to the most critical or what
may be termed " gilt-edged " consumers. It is proposed now to so
reduce the prices as to make them
accessible to the masses.

It may seem increditable that any
ink used in fountain pens actually
contains as much solid matter in one
gallon as can be obtained by evaporating the water from 50 gallons
of the IXL Violet or Red. And
yet the fact may be easily demonstrated by  any one.   This explains
' why 9 out of lOof all Fountain Pens

TEIform="persName"/>Henry C. Blinn.</byline><p TEIform="p">Mother Ann and the Elders arrested and tried before a court of Justices. The board of
                            justices met in the church at Richmond. It consisted of Samuel Brown, J. WoodbrMge and James
                            Gates. These judges were to try Mother Ann and her little company upon the charge of
                            blasphemy and disorderly conduct. Many evidences were produced against them, and readily
                            heard, but few witnesses that were brought forward in their defense could scarcely obtain a
                            hearing. The riotous and abusive conduct of the mob, which created the disorder, was by a
                            strange perversion of coincidences, charged upon the Believers. This was a manifestation of
                            the spirit that governed this court. To prove the charge of blasphemy, it was testified that
                            Samuel Fitch had declared that, '' In Mother Ann dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
                            Samuel replied in his own defense, "We read in the Scriptures that the fullness of the
                            Godhead dwelt in our Lord Jesus Christ bodily," and said he, "Except Christ be in you, ye
                            are reprobates." The inference was at once perceived by the judges who found themselves
                            unable to proceed with the charge, which must, in the issue, prove themselves reprobates.
                            Samuel then took the liberty to warn the judges as follows ; "Take heed what you do to this
                            Christian people, for they are God's annointed ones, whom he hath sent to America." This
                            admonition was highly offensive to the judges, and they privately consulted what they should
                            do with these Shakers. It was admitted that they appeared conscientious and acted upon
                            religious principles, yet they deluded the people, and disturbed the inhabitants of the
                            town, and they must be taken care of, or they would turn the world upside down. After a long
                            deliberation it was decided that Mother Ann and the Elders should be fined the sum of twenty
                            dollars as disturbers of the peace, and then leave the state. The money was immediately
                            advanced by the Brethren, so that they might be set at liberty ; but as to leaving the
                            state, they chose to obey God rather than man, and accordingly continued their labors among
                            the people. Samuel and Dyer Fitch and Elizar<pb n="50" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Goodrich, being inhabitants
                            of the town, were required to give bonds for their good behavior and for their appearance in
                            the county court in Barrington. These Brethren, however, insisted that they had not
                            trespassed, but had a right to worship God in their own homes, without molestation. They
                            could not consent to give bonds, as they might be charged by their adversaries, with
                            breaking the peace whenever they attempted to worship God. They were therefore, committed to
                            Barriugton jail, to be tried by the county court. Mother Ann and the Elders moved on to
                            Hancock, and remained over the Sabbath with Nathan Groodrich. The assembly that came to the
                            worship on the Sabbath was so large, that they were obliged to hold their religious services
                            in three several places. The gospel was preached by the Elders and others and the meetings
                            were attended with manifestations of the holy Spirit. Some persons were present who "
                            breathed out threatenings," but it fortunately ended wholly in words. Mother Ann and the
                            Elders now arranged to make a visit to the Brethren who had been committed to prison in
                            Barrington. On reaching the place of their confinement they made this salutation, "We have
                            come to see Christ in prison." The Elders remained two days, and ministered comfort to their
                            Brethren in bonds, and then passed on to West Stockbridge, to the residence of Elijah
                            Slosson. The whole family had accepted the faith of Believers, and at this time were very
                            solicitous that the Elders should call and see them. They reached the place on Saturday and
                            remained over the Sabbath. On this last day a religious service was held and a large body of
                            Believers attended. These came from New Lebanon and Hancock and other places. Many not of
                            the faith were also in attendance, and listened attentively to the services. On this day not
                            less than two hundred persons were provided with food by Elijah's family, so that the
                            Believers said, " The Lord blessed the family of Elijah, and all that pertained unto him."
                            More than one hundred horses were turned into a field of seven acres and the grass was
                            entirely eaten away. Elijah for this free will offering was made the jest of the neighbors
                            who laughed at him, and then asked, " What will you do now, after the Shakers' horses have
                            eaten up all your pasture ?'� "Trust in God," replied Elijah, and this trust brought the
                            blessing to his family. His field was not, in the least, injured, and his prosperity was
                            more abundant. The Believers were always made welcome to share in his hospitality, and if
                            any poor per-on came to his door, he was never sent away without some aid in food or
                            clothing. Od the next Sabbath the Elders were at the house of Nathan Goodrich and held a
                            public service. A large company of Believers were present, and at the same time several men
                            who were disturbers of the peace. The Elders spoke to this unruly class with an authority
                            which they regarded, and falling into confusion among themselves, they drove off' without
                            creating any marked disturbance. During the time that Mother Ann and the Elders continued in
                            Richmond and Hancock, they were visited by many Believers, who were fed and nourished by the
                            power and gifts of God, from their gospel Parents. A large share of<pb n="51" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> the
                            time was spent in religious service and some one expressed it in these words, " We could
                            hardly distinguish the days of the week, as every one seemed like the Sabbath." While this
                            company was rejoicing in the powe" of the resurrection, the spirit of opposition was not
                            asleep. The preaching of the testimony of Jesus Christ produced a disturbance in the kingdom
                            of darkness, and the sons of Belial were determined to redouble their efforts and drive the
                            Believers out of the place by violence. A mob collected on Friday, and came on like drunken
                            madmen. Arriving at the house, they cried out, " Bring out those Europeans." Mother Ann and
                            the Elders were now ordered to leave the place, and this was accompanied with threats and
                            abusive language. The Elders had arranged to go from the place the next day, and so informed
                            the mob. Some reckless characters proposed to use violence, while others objected. This
                            difference of opinion created confusion in their company, and the majority insisted that no
                            violence should be used. The mob then dispersed and the Believers enjoyed the night in
                            peace.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Maternal spirit" TEIform="index"/>MATERNAL SPIRIT.</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="White, Anna" TEIform="persName"/>Anna White.</byline><p TEIform="p">Oh, Mother! hear our earnest prayer; We look to thee for strength and care.

TEIform="persName"/>Alonzo G. Hollister.</byline><p TEIform="p">The angels are deeply engaged in the preparatory work for the new Dispensation, operating in
                            the spirit and power of Elijah, who is the Lord's messenger going before ; turning the
                            hearts of the fathers to draw the children, and the hearts of the children to the
                            righteousness of the fathers, which causes a revival of the spirit of obedience to the light
                            of the closing Dispensation, as a<pb n="52" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> prelude to the one about to enter. The
                            preparatory work, is like the twilight that precedes the dawn of day. John the Baptist was
                            the most noted visible agent in this work at the time of Christ's first appearing. The
                            Society of James and Jane Wardley stood in the same relation to his second appearing. But as
                            the final harvest of the world has commenced, and the field is very extensive, embracing all
                            conditions, classes and nations of people, and as Christ's coming is still future to all who
                            have not received him, the preparatory spirit is not limited to one time or locality, but
                            continues to operate in such places and with such persons as are nearest ripe for the
                            harvest work, and will thus continue to the consummation. It may be likened to preparing the
                            earth in the Spring to receive seed. Until Christ, the Divine seedsman, appears (in his
                            witnesses,) the seed of "'the Kingdom" cannot be sown. Or it may be likened to clearing the
                            ground of rubbish, preparatory to founding a building, which cannot be erected in the Order
                            of the New Dispensation, until Christ the builder, or architect, appears to direct.
                            Therefore if souls commence to build in this light, and cease to look forward to that
                            increasing and perfect work which it preludes, they will either fail and fall into a darker
                            state than whence they rose ; or if they succeed in forming a system, become a dead body in
                            the streets of mystic Babylon, and the result be the same. For if it be inconsistent to
                            expect for a system established in the greatest light and power of the first Christian
                            Dispensation, a better fate than that of the Primitive Church, which was supplanted by
                            mystic Babylon, what should be expected of a system formed near its close, after its
                            succeeding dispensation has commenced. The call now issues, "Come out of her my people, that
                            ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Therefore to
                            persist in sinning after hearing the warning, is to cleave to the plagues of old Babylon.
                            Hence, sincere seekers must advance by the light and call of the spirit into increasing
                            self-denial; a criterion taken in connection with its fruits, by which the salvation work
                            may be certainly known. For as the flesh is lawless, and ever contrary to the Spirit, so the
                            work of God is necessarily, ever opposed to man's carnal will, and eventually undermines and
                            destroys all pride and vain glory. Yet it leaves the volitions free. ''Souls shall be
                            willing in the day of my Power," and "The willing and obedient, shall eat the good of the
                            land." If there should appear to be a cessation of the work, let none turn aside from the

                            admitted to talk a little while with dear spiritual kindred ? They need not fear that I have
                            any stray, morbid, or even metaphysical notions to communicate, for I would say to my fellow
                            travelers that of all people, Believers have the least to do with the vague and ambiguous.
                            The Gospel is God's perfect plan ; but, have we not all seen the shining mists that cover
                            the rocks where many a noble and rudderless barque has foundered? Our Elders with untiring
                            and unflinching bravery, bear their powerful testimony against the very nature of sin;
                            against waywardness and alluring imagination, that would lead from duty and from safety.
                            They know what it is to receive ingratitude for this devotion. My soul is bowed in pain and
                            unutterable sorrow, when I think how easy it is for the heart to "give heed to lying
                            vanities and forsake its own mercies." If any of us transgress a law, we expect to pay the
                            penalty, but they who are called to be the High Priests and Priestesses� the Saviors�must
                            suffer where they have not sinned. Surely, God has some great compensation for this
                            inexorable law, that takes effect upon all who would benefit our race. There is a
                            perverseness in humanity that thwarts the good. Looking down the history of the world, we
                            can see where the Gift of Revelation descended to the simple and sincere, and for a time the
                            work of redemption progressed ;� '' But hearts fell off that ought to twine, And man
                            profaned what God had given, Till som^ were heard to curse the shrine TVhere others knelt to
                            heaven." But they who cursed did not always cease to kneel. They might not always be seeking
                            evil, bat they found it. They at least failed to achieve the designs of God, or they turned
                            from the grand, straight road of truth, into the flowery vistas of vain philosophy, that led
                            down to the unknown sea where their hopes were wrecked on the shores of infidelity and
                            sensuality. Their sweet spiritual aspirations were no more. The seductive influence like a
                            perfume laden miasma, had taken the hearts that once drew life from heaven ; they settled
                            into ease and said, :' There is no evil. All is peace and joy. Behold the sun shines, the
                            dew and the refreshing showers descend." And so they did. But the roots of bitterness, the
                            thorns, the thistles and the poisonous vines came up, and desolation was there. This we have
                            seen over and over again in the past. Oh ! shall we see it in the future? Will we demand
                            that our leaders shall "cry Peace where there is no peace?"�that they shall nurture the
                            seeds of disintegration wherever sown, and daub with untempered mortar the structures that a
                            selfpleasing nature would try to erect on the sand? Shall the messengers shrink from
                            delivering the Word because it is strong and has the power of salvation in it? Shall the
                            captains of the hundreds or of the fifties go forward timidly because there are giants in
                            the way ; battles to fight; furnaces of affliction or cleansing floods to pass through? God
                            forbid; and may the faith in our own hearts forbid it also. True leaders of the armies of
                            the Lord do not waver in<pb n="54" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/> duty through fear, favor or affection An influx
                            from the unseen world comes to help them with the honest, however feeble, while trembling
                            and coufusion are sent upon the hypocrite, however bold. Zion is the last hope of the world.
                            Her foundations wrere laid in tribulation. Her altars were built in the agony of prayer and
                            sacrifice, and the fires of heaven lighted them. There must we take our all, and feel the
                            fire, the blessed fire. There we can hear the voices parental from over the Mercy
                            Seat,�voices of love that will sustain, voices of thunder that will shake not only our
                            deeds, but the intents of our hearts. How are we awed by the magnificence of the work of God
                            in its power, when the tempests of heaven come down to our souls to break the dry branches,
                            and purify the atmosphere ; when the brightest and best of our number press for more glory,
                            being far from thinking that it is all attained ! There is no room for an old Believer or
                            far traveled sense. The gift of repentance is a boon to be shared by the most advanced, as
                            well as by the least of the household. The weak can make new resolves and take courage,
                            while the strong are inspired, and all like students seeking mundane knowledge, can feel
                            that whatever is gained or not gained, great is the wealth that lies before. Then when the
                            Divine approval comes, it is love, and balm, and sunshine that briags growth, such as the
                            skies of June bring to the earth. From the depths of our souls we may be thankful for the
                            flaming sword that is raised against the flesh by the few witnesses for God. What minister
                            or public teacher�who is not lost in its depravity�does not se� its hideousness ; jet they
                            must all preach smooth things, or if they venture beyond the prescribed limits, it is only
                            to urge that the blight shall blossom. As well put a putrid carcass into a bed of white
                            lilies expecting to have it change to life aud beauty, as to seek to mingle generation with
                            the purity that belongs to the resurrection heavens. Are we not all children when we stand
                            before the Ages, and before the work that Almighty God has for the soul? Even they who have
                            anchors are not secure iu gliding on the dark current ; and the youug in faith should turn
                            from the sight of its treacherous waters, that we may all make a safe journey and that none
                            may be lost through dreaming aud drifting away from the heart given protection of our
                            faithful guides. Mt. Lebanon, N.

Isa. lii., 10. There is a great
                            diversity among mankind, as to what the salvation of God is. Some regard the woi d of Jesus
                            as a hard saying1. "Be ye, therefore, perfect even as your Father in heaven is perfect."
                            Matt, v., 48. They take the same course the man did unto whom wras committed one talent.
                            Others believe that they can sow to the flesh and not reap corruption, although the apostle
                            has said, "Be not deceived. God is not mocked. What a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
                            If he sow to the flesh he shall reap corruption, but he that sowetli to the spirit shall of
                            the spirit reap life everlasting."<pb n="55" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> Some who are enemies of the cross of
                            Christ profess to believe that they can avoid reaping what they sow. They sow through the
                            merit3 of Jesus, and their greatest desire is not to be saved from sin, but from the
                            punishment due the sinner. This class profess to believe in the blood of Jesus. "The blood
                            of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin," John, i., 7. The blood is the life that he
                            taught and lived. Except a man deny himself daily, and take up his cross and follow me, he
                            cannot be my disciple. 1 have overcome the world. What constitutes the world? The works of
                            the first Adam find no admittance. It was said of Jesus, He shall save his people from their
                            sins. This is plain to be understood. " If any man will do the will of G-od, he shall know
                            of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. " '' He that followeth
                            me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." Any professedly religious
                            order whose principles and religious tenets if lived to, strictly, do not save its adherents
                            from sin, it is good evidence that their order is not of Christ, for in his order, he saves
                            his people from their sins. The apostle says, "For as much then as Christ hath suffered for
                            us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind, for he that hath suffered in
                            the flesh, hath ceased from sin." If we would be partakers of his salvation, we must be
                            partakers of his sufferings, in deed and in truth. The Lord has promised that there should
                            be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and
                            uncleanness, which would be in its fulfillment the antitype of what was required of the Jews
                            under the Levitical Law, whereby they in obedience thereto were accepted of God according to
                            their day and time. Paul says, These all died in faith not having received the promises, but
                            were persuaded of them and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
                            pilgrims on the earth. St. Paul says those laws made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of
                            a better hope, did, whereby we draw nigh unto God. Sin is all that separates the soul from
                            God. He promised to give his people the valley of Achor for a door of hope. Achan had stolen
                            and dissembled. Joshua stood as the representative of God, to the people, though not of the
                            order of the priesthood. He said unto Achan, '' Give glory to the Lord God of Israel snd
                            make confession, and tell me what thou hast done." By the law, the penalty of such an
                            offence was death. Joshua said, "Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee."
                            They brought Achan and his household into the valley, and all Israel stoned them to death.
                            Achan was a type of the man of sin. Then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
                            consume with the spirit ot' his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his coming. "He
                            that covereth his sins, shall not prosper, but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall
                            have mercy." "Confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that ye may be
                            healed." But, says the objector, I confess my sins to God, alone. This, however, does not
                            agree with the type, wherein the valley of Achor was to be a door of hope. Who could
                            reasonably suppose they could cover or hide anything from God, before whom all worlds, all
                            created things, all thoughts, words and actions are open to view.<pb n="56" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/>
                            "There went out unto John all the land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem and were baptised of
                            him in Jordan, confessing their sins." Jesus came also, and was baptised of John, in Jordan,
                            and at the same time he received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. John said of him. "He that
                            cometh after me, is mightier than I ; he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with
                            fire." This is the antitype of the former baptism, as the Revelator saw it. The river of
                            Judgment, "Water of Life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
                            Lamb." Agreeing with the vision of Ezekiel; the risen water which no man might pass over. In
                            the Pentecostal Day, many that believed came and confessed and showed their deeds, and the
                            apostle says, "Ifwe confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to
                            cleanse us from all unrighteousness." The confession of sin, before the apostles, was the
                            first step to take to gain admission into the Pentecostal Church. The Lord had said, by the
                            prophet, that he would stain the pride of all glory of man, and bring into contempt all the
                            honorable of the earth. "If ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
                            live." It would seem that God had designed, from the time the Law of confession was gi^en to
                            the Israelites, that it should restrain them through mortification and sacrifice, from evil
                            and lead them by the eye of faith, to look forward to the gospel day, wherein they would be
                            required, as Jesus said, to forsake all they had, even their own generative lives also.

TEIform="persName"/>Jason B. Pool.</byline><p TEIform="p">Revelation is given to lead and direct where reason and experience in humanity fail. Hence it
                            becomes necessary to distinguish between true and false revelation. When the Dutch traveler
                            revealed to the King of Siam that at certain seasons of the year the rivers and lakes in
                            Germany became so hard that an elephant could in safety walk over them, the king would not
                            believe in the revelation but banished the traveler from his presence. In this case the king
                            had no means of distinguishing between true and false revelation ; and as frozen water was a
                            condition contrary to his uniform experience, the king rejected the revelation as false.
                            Suppose the king with all his subjects had been suddenly removed to New England in the month
                            of June ; he would still believe that water would always remain a liquid. We will now
                            suppose that it should be revealed to the king or one of his subjects by a spirit that soon
                            the country would be bound in the adamantine chains of the frost king and that it was
                            necessary for the people to prepare for such a state of things by making garments of fur and
                            also they must lay up a good store of provisions for the dearth of Winter. In a natural
                            condition it would be impossible for the people to put any confidence in the revelation and
                            therefore it would be necessary that<pb n="58" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> some state or condition should be
                            brought upoa the people by which they would be forced to believe. I take the impression that
                            whenever God or the spirit world sends a revelation to the people, an inspired feeling is
                            made to rest on the people which causes them to believe. The sa /red Scriptures have been
                            believed in for many centuries and there is some cause for the belief. Now the question
                            arises what is the cause of this belief. The materialists try to make out that the priests
                            have duped the people to believe in the Bible, but a careful investigation of the nature of
                            humanity will convince any reasonable mind that scriptural faith could not have been derived
                            from that source. Men naturally are not prone to believe in the Bible and if they had been
                            left wholly to themselves it would have been out of date long ago. There evidently has been
                            an inspired feeling among the people for ages which has given the impression that the book
                            is an inspired work. The Bible contains much that is incomprehensible to man and
                            consequently some have tried to make out that it is a nonsensical man-made-work and not to
                            be respected. Such become as " sounding brass and a tinkling symbol." Others again have
                            endeavored to explain the mysterious parts of the scriptures ; these also as a general thing
                            are as sounding- brass. Leaders of churches who have been makmg deductions outside of
                            inspiration in regard to the Bible are likewise like " sounding brass and tinkling symbols."
                            As revelation is founded on reason which is higher than human reason or what human reason
                            has been, there must be an intelligence in the spirit world far greater than what cau be
                            found among mortals. Human reason is of a progressive nature and man has been growing in his
                            powers of comprehension ever since his advent on earth. Perhaps he has arrived at a stage in
                            which he can see quite clearly in regard to spiritual matters but it is not his province to
                            make deductions unless he feels called on to do so. It is an easy matter for many a one to
                            feel competent to make deductions in regard to spiritualism and the Bible, but he is not to
                            be the judge. The case has got to be decided by a superior intelligence. It has been
                            observed that when God has a great work for any one. to do He gives him a peculiar training
                            for that work and that training is what no earthly friend would choose for him, and it is
                            sometimes so long continued that there would seem to be but little time left for work. As
                            all God's works are progressive� commencing small and growing larger� so with respect to the
                            individual who is called to commence the work of making deductions : he will not be much of
                            a demoustrator, he will deal largely in hypothesis and theories but demonstrators will
                            follow in his wake. Hancock, Mass.</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="In memoriam.

                                approaching and the sun gleamed over the hill-tops, with a radiant smile to fie snow
                                clad earth, a pure spirit awakened in the glory of its Eternal Home. What a releasement
                                from all physical suffering, from the agonizing pain and torture of a diseased body, for
                                of late years our dear brother was a great sufferer; but at all times bore his
                                affliction with marked patience and resignation. He bore evidence of a living faith,
                                founded on the Rock which wrought �'peace, patience, experience and hope.'' Hope that he
                                would soon traverse the golden portals of heaven, where sorrow, sickness, pain and death
                                are unknown. We believe that his hopes are at last realized, and that he is mingling
                                with that innumerable host that have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb. Our
                                beloved Brother, Marcus Gregory, was born in Shelby Co., Ky. (see page 72.) His parents
                                united with the Society of Believers of Pleasant Hill in 1813, with eight children; all
                                of whom remained steadfast to their first faith except one- Pleasant Hill was not much
                                more than a wilderness then, and many years of toil and severe hardships passed before
                                its beautiful and substantial buildings arose. Through all those years of hardships,
                                when he was blest with youth and health, the world's brightest prospects and gilded
                                charms beckoned to him, and the siren voice tempted, yet he kept the even tenor of his
                                way. Like adamantine rock he withstood the Summer's heat and Winter's chilling blast.
                                His feet were shod with the gospel of peace. He was armed with the shield of faith,
                                wherewith he was able to parry the fiery darts of the wicked, and with the helmet of
                                salvation and the sword of the Spirit. Clad in this holy armor he went forth with his
                                trust in God and "pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
                                Christ Jesus." He was quiet and reserved, but always had a smile and pleasant word<pb n="60" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> for every one. Faithful in every duty until disease and infirmity
                                could no longer be resisted. Without any reserve he consecrated his time, and his
                                talents, his body and soul to the great God that discerneth the intentions and motives
                                of the heart. O I may we all be wise and strive to imitate this shining example and "
                                scatter the roses instead of the brier." After his long life of usefulness he was ready
                                to say in truth, " I am now ready to be offered up. I have fought the good fight, I have
                                finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
                                righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day ; and not
                                to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing." Go, worthy veteran go ! and
                                reap the fruits of thy labors, and receive thy glorious crown of life. Dear Father, we
                                miss thee from our midst, most deeply; and how sad our hearts, as we bid adieu to the
                                last of our early Fathers of Pleasant Hill, and in our sorrow we fain would bring thee
                                back; but we know that thou art happy, thy journey over and safe home at last! We feel
                                that the heavens are re-echoing the gladsome welcome. " Well done thou good and faithful
                                servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."

                            the 14th verse, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth. "
                            This I could never understand. I have read many an explanation but none seemed to satisfy my
                            mind. How did the Word become flesh? How did it dwell among us? How did we behold its glory,
                            as the only begotten full of grace and truth? It seems to be the word sent by the Angel to
                            the Virgin Mary, that produced the Holy Son of God, as he was the first born in the new
                            creation, lie was also the first one that preached the new birth. If he had been conceived
                            in sin like the rest, how could he then preach the Kingdom of God? It has never been seen or
                            heard that any oue could preach the Gospel without being born of the living word of God.
                            Christ was the true living seed of the kingdom or new heaven. Any one that is born of the
                            same seed he can both live and preach the new birth, and he could no more commit siu than
                            Jesus could, because the seed of God remain eth in him And he loves God above all, and his
                            fellow man as himself. This is the fruit that appears ia Jesus Christ, and the same fruit
                            appears in all his followers. So we behold the glory, and beauty of that holy seed produced
                            wherever it finds good ground. It produces Holy men and women progressing from one glory to
                            another.

                            Brethren and Sisters according to the order of nature in the old creation ; and believing
                            that the time is coming, and is now begun, in which every individual soul of all the human
                            race, will be waked up by the resurrection power of God, and come forth to receive their
                            reward, according to their works, either in mercy or judgment, as they obey or disobey the
                            will of God ; I therefore feel it my duty to bear testimony to that blessed way of God which
                            is dearer to me than life, and which I have proved by long experience to be the way of
                            salvation from sin, having been thereby saved from the pollutions that are in the world, and
                            in which mankind are sunk and lost from God, through the lusts of the flesh. Some time in
                            July, 1780, I went to Watervliet, to visit the little family of people who had then begun to
                            be greatly " wondered at" by the world around them, on account of their strange religion. I
                            went well guarded, as I supposed against deception, having already seen enough of that among
                            professors, to put me on the watch. I had likewise experienced much of what is commonly
                            called religion ; having had great convictions of sin, and passed through many scenes of
                            religious exercise of mind. In the fifteenth year of my age, I had joined a society of very
                            zealous New-Light Baptists, and for six years had supported the name and character of a
                            Christian without reproach or rebuke from the society, or from any other quarter except my
                            own conscience. During this period, I had been sufficiently acquainted with people who made
                            a great profession of religion, and who, I knew, lived in wickedness more than people in
                            general who made no profession : and therefore I thought it necessary to be on my guard. But
                            when I came there, I found my fears were groundless. I found as much difference between the
                            professors I had formerly been acquainted with and these people, as to the nature of their
                            religion, as there is between dead carcasses and living souls ; and the power of their
                            testimony differed as much from that of the<pb n="62" id="p16" TEIform="pb"/> former, as flames of fire
                            differ from the stagnant waters of a muddy pond. The fire soon began to burn my carual
                            nature, of which I was as full as a pine knot is of pitch, and I cried out like the prophet
                            Malachi, "Who can abide the day of his coming?" I found that it was indeed, " like a
                            refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap." I was searched like ��Jerusalem, with candles," and
                            all my dark works, which had before been hid from my own sight, were brought out of their
                            secret hiding places, and exposed before the Lord and before the eyes of his people. Lord
                            what is man ! A lump of pride, lust and vanity ; for such I found myself in the light of
                            divine truth, and exposed to view. The serpent was no longer able to hide; my pride was
                            stained ; my lust was mortified, my vanity was blown away like the smoke of a dunghill; and
                            my good Christian name, which I had cherished so dearly, alas ! it was like chafif before
                            the wind, or a dry brush-heap before a flaming fire ; it was consumed by the truth, and all
                            my religious notions and imaginations were blown away at once. Then, for the first time, I
                            began to understand the words of the prophet Isaiah : " The lofty looks of man shall be
                            humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down ; aad the Lord alone shall be
                            exalted in that day." And also of the prophet Malachi; " Behold the day cometh that shall
                            burn as an oven ; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, (whether professor or
                            profane,) shall be as stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of
                            hosts, that il shall leave them neither root nor branch." Such was the spirit and power of
                            that gospel which Mother Ann preached. It exalted the work of Christ alone, and swept away
                            the corrupted religion of Antichrist, and the religious inventions of fallen man. The way
                            being thus prepared, my soul began to be baptized into the spirit of the g&amp;spel, and
                            to receive the pure and heavenly gifts of God. Then I was able to say in truth, and testify
                            with confidence and bolduess before all men, that I knew it to be the way of God ; because
                            it purged me from my sins. I knew it to be the power of the resurrection ; because it raised
                            my soul from the death of sin to a life of righteousness. 1 can say in the sincerity of my
                            soul, I feel thankful to God that I have lived to see the day in which I have the privilege
                            to testify these things for the benefit of my successors iu the gospel, and of all honest
                            enquirers after truth. Some people who visited Mother Ann and the Elders, and heard their
                            testimony against all sin, and especially against the lust of the flesh, went and spread a
                            report that these people forbid to marry, and applied to them all the hard names and heavy
                            charges contained in the first epistle to Timothy against apostates, Chap, iv., 1, 2, 3.
                            Mother therefore told me not to go and repert that they forbid to marry ; "for," said she,
                            "we do not. But all that cannot or will not take up their crosses for the Kingdom of
                            Christ's sake, and that only, I would advise them to marry and live after the flesh, in a
                            lawful manner, and be servants to their families : for that is natural, and less sinful in
                            the sight of God than any other way of gratifying that nature." As to temperance, regularity
                            and good order in the management of their affairs, these people exceeded all that I had ever
                            seen. I was<pb n="63" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> brought up in New England, among good farmers; but such
                            neatness and good economy as was here displayed in the wilderness I never saw before. After
                            spending two days with them, I returned home to Pittstowu, where my parents lived, and I saw
                            Mother no more till after hsr return from Poughkeepsie jail. I then visited her, and found
                            the same godliness and purity, with an increasing testimony against all sin. 1 saw nothing
                            but what was every way perfectly consistent with modesty and chastity ; indeed quite too
                            much so to suit the feelings of a carnal nature. This was the great stumbling stone and rock
                            of offence, and the mighty cause of contention between ''Michael and his angels, and the
                            Dragon and his angels." 1 always found in her the same powerful testimony against all
                            unrighteousness and every evil work, and a corresponding example of godliness and purity. I
                            also visited her in Harvard. Her appearance there seemed to me more heavenly than I had ever
                            seen it before. Her soul was filled with love and joy, peace and purity ; and the gifts and
                            power of God, through her, to all that believed and took up their crosses, were ministered
                            in great abundance. I was then but a babe in Christ; yet I had my little measure full, which
                            raised me above the carnal delights of the flesh and the mind. I could never feel the least
                            sensation of impurity from her; but all she said and did, seemed to come from a spirit of
                            perfect purity. Her enrollment was with the Lamb on Mount Zion, where souls are redeemed "
                            from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit." TO BE CONTINUED.</p></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Respect for legitimate authority shows self-respect" TEIform="index"/>

                                unrighteousness, and glory in their own shame, as we have with those who already name
                                the name of Christ, as well as with those who have accepted a few degrees in morality
                                and are moving along toward the place where man shall regard his fellow man. The good
                                prophet found those at his own home who had ears but would not hear and who had eyes but
                                would not see. Does not this experience accord wonderfully well with our own? The truth,
                                however, should be proclaimed by every consecrated messenger of our Father and
                                Mother�God ; and in doing this duty we should not fail to put on the whole armor of a
                                pure Christian, lest in our zeal for others we carelessly expose ourselves to the wiles
                                of the adversary. There has been a time when the conversion of souls was made on heroic
                                principles. They were felled to the ground ! They were dragooned to the baptizmal fouut
                                at the poin t of the bayonet ! ! Men had forgotten that in an earlier age of the world
                                it had been said in the name of the Lord, "Come now and let us reason together. " No
                                better form for the good of humanity could be advocated at the present time. Strong and
                                even harsh words often fall quite short of their mark and the intended shock spends
                                itself on the air. There is a satisfaction in appealing to the better qualities of the
                                mind, and for this the beatitudes are a beautiful example. "Blessed are the peace-makers
                                for for they shall be called the children of God. " A relationship which we all covet
                                and for which we devoutly pray. " Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after
                                righteousness, " as they have the promise of full fruition in this inestimable blessing.
                                It can have but slight impression upon the true disciple to find that he has been
                                denominated an ascetic, as unnatural or as being over religious. It has been the same
                                story from age to age when referring to those who had forsaken the elements of the world
                                and had accepted the cross of Christ. Let us "stand fast therefore in the liberty
                                wherewith Christ hath made us free." Those who are able to walk in the glorious light of
                                God's love are confident of the strength they possess. They entertain no fear of the
                                frowns that may arise from personal prejudice, nor are they elated at the smiles of
                                approbation. If to be a Christian is to be a direct follower of the Christ, then we have
                                only to make a careful, analytical investigation and ascertain the points of resemblance
                                and then the points of diversity. Christians of every hue and shade are TERMS.<pb n="65" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> not backward in asserting the advantages of the plan of salvation which
                                they have accepted. Their cross is the cross of their Christ, and their worship the
                                worship of their God. All disputations on the subject, however, are indicative of
                                dominant rights and are quite sure to end in confirmed self-righteousness, by both
                                parties. A war of words is but a slight remove from a war of weapons. This seems to
                                differ from the heavenly Spirit that so kindly recognized the baptized Jesus and which
                                has said to us, "Hear ye him," and in turn Jesus has said as plainly and as kindly,
                                "Follow me," "where I am there ye may be also." There may be those who take the liberty
                                to assert that our Christian form of life is unnatural, but they must at the same moment
                                admit that the gospel of Jesus teaches a corresponding form to his followers. Jesus and
                                his disciples thoroughly forsook the order of the worldly life and then organized one
                                based on communistic principles. Everything passed from the selfish into the more open
                                and free system of brotherly love. Houses and lands were sold and the proceeds placed in
                                the treasury of the little, consecrated church of Christ where it could be used for the
                                universal good. It may seem to us to be a large sacrifice to part with our fraction of
                                selfish interest, as it was, undoubtedly, to Peter when he left his boat and fishing net
                                to follow the divine Teacher. His repining at a later dak would give us the impression
                                that he considered his sacrifice of some magnitude, as he takes the liberty to remind
                                Jesus of this fact. " Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee, what shall we have
                                therefore?" Jesus very kindly enumerates the many temporal and spiritual blessings that
                                would be certain to follow in accordance with the promise. Peter may not have realized
                                at this time the advantages to be derived from the united efforts of the Brethren. A
                                longer experience, no doubt, afforded him all the information on this subject that could
                                have been wished. And as with Peter so with all others who seek to become disciples of
                                the Lord. Let them say, " Behold we have forsaken all and followed thee," and the time
                                will not be very far distant before they will begin to realize the Lord's promise. They
                                need not be afraid of the lo here and lo there as the manifestation of the spirit must
                                be within one's own heart. What our duty should be in this case bears no mystical form
                                and the wise admonition of the apostle may have a salutary effect upon our daily life.
                                "Ye are the children of light. Therefore let us not sleep, but let us who are of the
                                day, be sober, putting on the breast plate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope
                                of salvation."</p></div3></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Health" TEIform="index"/>Sanitary</head><div3 type="health" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hygiene for singers" TEIform="index"/>Hygiene for Singers

                            invitation, though there were some God-fearing, devoted souls among the Jews who looked for
                            the consolation of the coming Messiah, and there are devoted souls all over ihe land in the
                            churches, and they are all praying God to send us along. They see, they feel the dreadful
                            need. Sons, daughters, husbands and wives daily coming to death's door without a ray of
                            hope. Oh, 'for God's sake, for your own souls' sake, my comrades, look as God looks at these
                            things. Think of these sin-bound slaves. We profess to believe that through the coming of
                            our Jesus, who was born to work, God has put in our hands a lever that can hoist the singer
                            from the lowest depths of sin and woe. If this is so, and thank God it is, woe to you and me
                            if we let friends, money, health or creature-comfort stay our hands. The blood of brothers
                            dying daily in sin must indeed go up into the ears of Him who so loved the world as to lay
                            down his life for it. Woe to you, woe to me if we use not this lever of love to take right
                            down to the lowest pit in which humanity lias sunk the glad tidings of deliverance. Nowhere
                            in the Bible are we told to open doors, and if the people will come and hear us, very well.
                            But the voice cries louder to day, "Go! go! go! go!" Will you go, Major? will you go,
                            Divisional Officer? will you go, Captains, Lieutenants, Cadets, fellow soldiers? Will you go

                            go. " Heed not the soulless tongues that say people will not like it. Will you like it when
                            the Savior points you to a sinner doomed to hell, and says, "That was your brother, lived in
                            your town, worked in your mill. I gave you talents, I gave you pardon for the asking, but
                            you never took him by the hand Your warm tears of entreaty never fell on his cheek. That man

                            work in that manner that affords the best spiritual satisfaction. We can however, as much as
                            wish them peace and prosperity in their self-denying work. We can do as much as to pray for
                            them, that God in his merciful kindness, would guide and protect, as they march on their
                            perilous journey. Some of us think it is a filthy act when a man throws his tobacco on the
                            floor, of a dwelling, but what shall we say of men, belonging to a Christian nation who in
                            their filthiness can throw their tobacco at those who are engaged in prayer? Indeed, we need
                            the Salvationists. We need those determined, zealous soldiers to do that work and to present
                            those truths of God which so many churchal Christians are ashamed to do.

Cannibalism is in
                            existence worse than among the Heathen. In a recent speech on the evils of the times Col.
                            Robert Ingersoll makes the following astounding assertions : In the days of savagery the
                            strong devoured the weak�actually ate their flesh. In spite of all the laws that man has
                            made, in spite of all advance in science, the strong, the cunning, the heartless still live
                            on the weak, the unfortunate and foolish. True, they do not eat their flesh or drink their
                            blood, but they live on their labor, on their self-denial, their weariness and want. The
                            poor man who deforms himself by toil, who labors for wife and child through all- his
                            anxious, barren, wasted life�who goes to the grave without ever having had one luxury� has
                            been the food for others. He has been devoured by his fellow men. The poor woman living in
                            the bare and lonely room, cheerless and fireless, sewing night and day to keep starvation
                            from a child, is slowly being eaten by her fellow men. When I take into consideration the
                            agony of civilized life�the number of failures, the poverty, the anxiety, the tears, the
                            withered hopes, the bitter realities, the hunger, the crime, the humiliation, the shame�I am
                            almost forced to say that cannibalism, after all, is the most merciful form in which man has
                            ever lived upon his fellow man. It is impossible for any man with a good heart to be
                            satisfied with this world as it now is. No one can truly enjoy even what he earns�what he
                            knows to be his own�knowing that millions of his fellow men are in misery and want. When we
                            think of the famished, we feel that it is almost heartless to eat. To meet the ragged and
                            shivering makes one almost ashamed to be well dressed and warm�one feels as though his heart
                            was as cold as their bodies. In a world filled with millions and millions of acres of land
                            waiting to be tilled, where one man can raise the food for hundreds, yet millions are on the
                            edge of famine. Who can comprehend the stupidity at the bottom of this truth? Is there to be
                            no change?<pb n="69" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> Are "the law of supply and demand, " invention and science,

                            healthy man must earn the right to live? Will they finally say that the man who has had
                            equal privileges with all others has no right to complain, or will they follow the example
                            that has been set by their oppressors? Will they learn that force, to succeed, must have a
                            thought behind it, and that anything done, in order that it may endure must rest upon the

                                    for four days through a region where had newly fallen a remarkable deposit of
                                    heavenly Bread, as the natives sometimes call it,�manna. There were extensive
                                    forests of scrubby oaks, and most of the deposit was on the leaves. Thousands of the
                                    poor peasants, men, women and children, were out upon the plains gathering the sweet
                                    substance. Some of them put into kettles of boiling water the newly cut branches of
                                    the oaks, which washes off the deposit until the water becomes so sweet as to remind

                                    pressed into cakes for use. The manna is in great demand among these Oriental

                                We have just received a beautiful large calendar from the old and reliable house of
                                Williams &amp; Clark Co., Cotton Exchange Building, New York, who put out the purest
                                and highest grade fertilizers now found on the market. They derive their raw material
                                from the large slaughtering and packing houses wherein are killed the cattle, hogs, and
                                sheep for the New York Markets, the waste all being utilized in making Dried Blood,
                                Tankage, and Bone Meal; from these materials their fertilizers are made. The source of
                                the raw material being thus constant, farmers are sure of getting the same kind and
                                grade of material each year, as the formulas are not varied to suit the market price of
                                different kinds of raw materials. Their Americus Brand is used largely in all the New
                                England and Middle States. An important part of their business, also, is the preparation
                                of High Grade Special Fertilizers for each particular crop. Farmers can make no mistake
                                in buying these fertilizers; send to their address above for this almanac and circular.

Dobbins' Electric
THE BEST FAmILY SOAP
IN THE WORLD.
It is Strictly Pure, Unifori in Quality,
mHE  original formula  for which we paid $50,000
11 twenty years ago has never been modified or
I    changed in the slightest.  This soap is idenI    tical   in    quality   to-day   with   that
I    made twenty years ag'O
-I         |T contains   nothing- that can   injure
4 the finest fabric.   It brightens colors
and bleaches whites.
IT washes flannels  and blankets  as no other
soap in  the world does�without shrinking �
leaving them soft and white and like new.
READ  THIS   TWICE.
THERE is a g-reat saving* of time, of labor,
of fuel, and of tin- fabric, where Dobbins' Electric Soap is used according'to directions.
OBJE trial   will demonstrate, its great merit.
It will pay you to make that trial.
LIKE  all Hest thing-s, it is extensively imitated and counterfeited.
Beware of Imitations.
INSIST upon I�oM�ins' Electric. Don't take
i Magnetic, Electro-Magic, Philadelphia Electric,
or any other fraud, (-imply because it is cheap. They
will ruin clothes, and are dear at any price.   Ask for
- - - - -BOBBI1S'  KIECTBIC- - - -and take no o:her. Nearly eve ry grocer from Maine
to Mexico keeps it in stock. If yours hasn't it, he
will order from his nearest wholesale grocer.
READ carefully the inside wrapper around each

on each outside wrapper.    You cannot all ord to
