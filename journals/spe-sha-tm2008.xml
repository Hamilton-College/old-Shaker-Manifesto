However attractive may be the hillside,
the passer-by is sure to pay more attention to the house, and often strangers
pause to inquire about its age and history
and of late artists have travelled long distances to sketch the building or parts of
the interior. Here Ennekin found a model
for his "Old Kitchen" with huge beams
and rafters, where the golden sunlight falls
through the small western window, resting on the floor near the fire-place
with its andirons and pewter dishes, and the steep winding stairs are
seen through the doorway. Oh, it is a
charming place, with deep window-seats,
closets, port-holes, attic, and additions
here and there full of hiding-places, and a.
deep, dark cellar divided into several
apartments, into one of which a party
may enter through a narrow passage and,
after closing the door, pile against it the
very rocks taken there long, long ago, to
be used if necessary in keeping out the terrible "redskins." For this is the old "garrison" built by Joseph Peaslee more than
two hundred years ago, probably between
the years 1669 and 1675.
********
Reviewing thus the history of this old
house, we almost hear again the slow and
solemn tread of the long procession of
staid and stately Quakers, followed by the
dignified Elliots; the patter of little feet,
and the music of childish laughter; the
impassioned pleading of Harriet Livermore, and the sighs of the young physician; the echoes of the meetings and funerals of the Friends, and the "memo
strains" of the violin of "King David,"
who furnished music for the dancing-school
held here in the days of Ephraim Elliott,
Jr. We listen to the whoop of the Indian,
and the Sabbath evening hymns of James
Elliot, accompanied by time-beats on the
air-tight stove with the poker. Again we
hear the clatter of dishes and the hum of
voices at the entertainments of the Second
Baptist Society. But the roar of the wintry wind through the branches of the
great elm dies away, the oriole sings its
sweetest roundelay, and boyish shouts upon the green recall us from the far-off past
to the fresh beauty of the present. From

                            continued for a great many years. The uppers were generally made of cloth, while the heels
                            were formed from blocks of wood and neatly covered with leather. The shoes were secured to
                            the feet by straps and shoebuckles. In 1787 a hat braided of straw and styled a "Chip Hat"
                            was generally worn by the women of the country and continued in use till 1805. It was
                            covered, inside and out, with black silk. The crown was about one inch deep, covered with a
                            band of silk of the same width, wThich was formed of fine plaits across the band. Silk
                            ribbons were attached to the crown and brought down over the brim and tied in the rear of
                            the neck. The brim of the hat was not less than six inches wide. From the Chip Hats, the
                            change was made to simple bonnets, similar to those worn by the Friends or Quakers. These
                            were made of pasteboard and covered with light colored silk. The crown was made wholly of
                            cloth and fitted to the head by plaiting, but were made without capes. In 1827 the bonnets
                            were made of palm leaf, and trimmed with a small silk cape and ribbons. There are many items
                            of less importance about the fashions, forms and colors of dress, quite too numerous to
                            mention. The subject of dress has always absorbed a great deal of attention, time and money.
                            Our dress is of great expense to us and much more, no doubt, than real necessity demands.
                            CLOCK MAKING. This occupation has been followed in the Church from its origin, sufficient
                            for the use of Believers. At first the knowledge, as well as the machinery and tools were
                            very limited. When the Society wras organized only three clocks were in use in the church
                            family. In 1796 the number had increased to seven. The first alarm clock wTas made in 1812,
                            in the Society at Watervliet, N. Y., and one was sent to New Lebanon as a present. There has
                            been a gradual increase in the number of clocks till at this date, (1858) we have some
                            eighty-five in the first family.<pb n="170" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> As the manufacture of clocks increased
                            in this country, the business became quite unprofitable, and the Believers chose rather to
                            buy them and use their time on � some other branch of business. Watches were not admitted
                            into the Society for many years after its organization, but began to be introduced about the
                            year 1835. In 1838 watches were wholly laid aside and for several years no covenantal member
                            was known to have one in possession. One of the objections made to the use of watches, was
                            on account of the great expense that would be brought upon the Society. As time moved on,
                            however, there was an anxiety growing for a time-piece that could be carried from place to
                            place. This was partly relieved in 1849 on the introduction of spring or balance clocks. As
                            watches became more abundant in the country, and at prices more reasonable for the masses,
                            the Believers again urged their introduction and in 1860, six were in use in the Church
                            family. Branches of Business introduced at a later date. The preceding occupations went into
                            operation at the time the Society was organized as indispensable for the support of the
                            members. HAND CARDS. The making of hand cards, for the carding of wool was introduced in
                            1793. The business nourished for several years, but gave place to the introduction of
                            machine cards at the close of the last century. During the continuation of the business, ali
                            the available help of the first*family was secured. Even the farmers and teamsters would
                            eagerly catch every spare opportunity to assist in the setting of the card teeth. All the
                            family were very much interested in the work, and their mornings and evenings and even the
                            few minutes while waiting for their meals were utilized in this employment. Through this
                            means there was a surprising amount of labor performed and the return for this was so much
                            needed in the Community home. In 1815 a man by the name of Whitmor3 invented a machine which
                            made ti;e teeth all at one process, which soon rendered the hand work of the Believers quite
                            unprofitable. Wire drawing for the use of the teeth of cards became a necessary branch of
                            business. At this date there was a great scarcity of wire in this country, and most of it
                            must be obtained from England. When the war broke out between England and the United States
                            in 1812, the Society was induced again to manufacture their own wire, but the attending
                            difficulties and the cheapness of the machine cards caused the business to be wholly laid
                            aside.

TEIform="persName"/>Alonzo G. Hollister.</byline><p TEIform="p">"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." La Salle, in a recent number of The World's
                            Advance Thought, says "Years ago it was communicated<pb n="171" id="p5" TEIform="pb"/> to me by High
                            Intelligences, that perfect chastity in thought and act was an absolute requirement to those
                            who would overcome earth conditions ; that the physical sex relations were of the generative
                            plane, and belonged to lower conditions of consciousness. There is a higher, purer sex
                            relation for those who can live above the physical sex plane. "The higher law is affinity of
                            mind and soul, which has nothing to do with physical sex, but has to do with qualities of
                            mind, and may unite two men or two women, or any number of men and women, in a common
                            purpose for the good of others. Only when cured of the love of carnal pleasures, can we
                            realize what true happiness is." Physical, worldly sense pleasures are as husks that are
                            food for swine, but never can satisfy the soul. Many witnesses are rising up in different
                            parts of the world, among advanced minds, who testify both in precept and practice that
                            virgin chastity and continence is the only path to the perfect and cheeriest life. This
                            discloses the "narrow way" of Jesus' teaching, both to occult wisdom and to immortality. A
                            way too narrow to admit selfishness and sensuality, but leading through straitness into
                            spaciousness and unbounded freedom�a freedom which is to that of the sensualist, as the
                            freedom of earth and sky is to a treadmill. A freedom to possess and enjoy the truest and
                            grandest things in earth and heaven�to soar among the stars of intellectual and spiritual
                            light, and gather the rarest jewels and richest fruits produced by every race and every
                            clime, impossible to corrupt or decay. A freedom to dispense all good things to the needy
                            and appreciating, as fast as they will clear themselves of sensual mud, and make place to
                            receive and retain them. Because few are willing to be undeceived by the experience of
                            others, mankind mostly feed on illusions, and must try every conceivable way, and invent
                            every possible device to shun the "narrow door" and grasp the coveted prize of eternal peace
                            and rest, without parting from their delusions, and without divesting themselves of the
                            environing protoplastic mud which imprisons and enslaves while it gratifies their love of
                            pleasure. Immortality means deathlessness. It is not a- product of ' nature nor of
                            evolution, but is the life from above, proclaimed by Jesus and his Apostles, and which it is
                            the mission of all true disciples of his to communicate. They teach the "secret doctrine"
                            openly, together with the moralities, to all who will listen�to a mixed multitude of any and
                            every degree of perception, and of understanding, well knowing that only those prepared and
                            "drawn by the Father" and Mother of spirits, having eyes and ears to perceive, and hearts to
                            understand the truths of the perfect life, will be thereby induced to exchange an earthly
                            for a, heavenly inheritance and eternal abode. Such will be drawn inward and upward to one
                            primal center. They teach that God is light, and in Him is no darkness, and that direct
                            light is life. Consequently, all who would come to Him, must come<pb n="172" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> into
                            the light, works and all, that is focussed in his messengers in whom He dwells. For there is
                            nothing covered that shall not be uncovered, neither hid, that shall not be known and come
                            abroad. That which is spoken in darkness, shall be heard in the light, and that which ye
                            have spoken in the ear in the inner chamber, shall be published on the house-tops. This with
                            reference to the hypocrisy of men in professing great outward sanctity before the world,
                            Avhile within, they are full of extortion, excess, and all manner of uncleanness. "For every
                            idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in a day of judgment." "And
                            this is the Judgment, [Gr. kn'ms, turning point, separation,] that light has come into the
                            world. And men loved darkness rather than light, because their works are evil. Every one
                            doing vile things, hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his works .be reproved.
                            He that doeth the truth, comes to the light that his works may be made manifest that they
                            are wrought in God." Here is shown the affinity between evil works and darkness, and their
                            inhering antagonism to light, the presence of wiiich, produces separation between precious
                            and vile, evil and good, falsehood and truth. Jesus speaks of a harvest at the end of the
                            age, when the tares will be separated from the wheat. He will send forth messengers, and
                            they will gather out of his kingdom all scandals and them that do lawlessness ; then shall
                            the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their Father. The kingdom of Christ,
                            is in the hearts of his people, the same who, before they hear the gospel, 'constitute the
                            world, or field of the householder, in which the good seed was sown, and afterward, the
                            tares. "The tares are the children of evil." No one can reasonably deny that the sins which
                            men commit, such as lying, thieving, adultery, fornication, murder, slander, fraud,
                            lascivionsness, also, evil dispositions, such as, lust, envy, malice, lawlessness and
                            revenge, and all false doctrines taught for true, are tares of the enemy, that have come
                            from an evil source. These are gathered out in the harvest, which is tie krisis, or turning
                            point and period or "separation" from all that mars or hurts�from all that is rudimental,
                            tentative and provisional, including the matrix of matter into which spirit is cast for a
                            time, to gain experience and discipline and develop its powers. This is the season of
                            judgment which comes in due time to every spirit that has matured its fruits in the psychic
                            or astral body, and ultimately to nations, and the world composed of individuals. "The
                            reapers are the messengers." The aonian gospel is preached in the season of judgment, to
                            every natioa, kindred, tongue and people dwelling on the earth, by messengers that go forth
                            from the midst of the one hundred and forty-four thousand who stand with the Lamb on Mount
                            Zion. Rev. xiv., 7. This gospel of the harvest exemplified in the character of the "redeemed
                            from among men," is for all who hear it, the rule of the perfect life about to become
                            theirs, and<pb n="173" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> the criterion by which all are judged, both dead and
                            living. "For this cause the gospel was preached to the dead, that they might be judged truly
                            according to men in flesh, but live according to God in spirit." (Fetor.) And all who thus
                            live, write their names in "another book, which is of the life" that abides forever. This
                            judgment and preaching the gospel is on the programme of a thousand years, or day of the
                            Lord, for the conversion of the kingdoms of the world to One Lord and his Anointed, as
                            announced in Rev. xx., 4, and chap. xi., 15, where "the end is declared from a beginning."
                            This is particularly affirmed to be the first resurrection. Blessed are they who have part
                            in it. "Over these the second death has no power." Let Christianity be expounded by those
                            who have entered "the narrow door" and walked in the strait way of the judgment that removes
                            the tares, and it will be found that only the moralities which constitute but the merest
                            rudiments thereof, can be received or understood by those who continue the life and
                            practices of the world. No matter how subtile their reasonings, how expansive their
                            intellects, how soaring their imaginations, how versatile their talents, nor how fine their
                            perceptions, they cannot rise above their chosen element or state, only as they make room
                            for a higher to enter and elevate them. "Whatever doctrinal matter they absorb for
                            nutrition, will be either transmuted or translated so as to conform it to the life they are
                            living, or it will be extruded and rejected as intractable, for this is the law of all
                            living organisms. Hence the necessity of fixing our thoughts on the higher, endless and
                            perfect life, and rejecting the lower with all its feeders, if we would escape its
                            limitations and irritations, its immoralities and disappointments, its losses, fatigues and
                            disease, and rise to that pure, emancipated state to which the whole truth in Christ, is the
                            way. It is something more than a veneer and outside polish, or a set of rules for conduct
                            that leaves the core of rebellion in the heart untouched, to "accuse before God day and
                            night" his would-be servants of sin and unfaithfulness. It is a remedy which if truly
                            applied, penetrates to the most secret cause of evil, turns the light upon every dark
                            corner, discloses every hidden transaction and the motives thereof, and floods the mind with
                            the light of the new and endless life. After the covering is voluntarily removed by honest
                            confession before a witness, a true messenger of Christ, and the cross of daily self-denial,
                            which is the yoke of Christ, has been assumed, the Divine uplifting life thenceforth ever
                            flowing from the inmost sanctuary within, like a spring of clear water pouring forth,
                            carries all corruption, and soil and stain before it, purifying desire and cleansing the
                            heart from carnal taint. Hence the Apostle testifies, "If any be in Christ, he is a new
                            creature. All old things [old loves, old desires, selfish motives, old social order and
                            relations,] have passed away, and all have become new, and all of God." Mt. Lebanon, N.

                            11, 12. Have we not as a nation experienced all of these? The wind, the earthquake, and the
                            fire, yea and Hoods also ? Shall we say the Lord was in none of these? "The Lord passed by."
                            He was near yet suffered these things to be, that the attention of the people might be
                            enlisted to note that which should follow. While in this attitude of rapt attention the}*
                            would more readily perceive the whisperings of the "still small voice," which manifests
                            itself not in an audible sound to the outward senses, but in upheavals and changes in the
                            realm of thought and mind. All old systems of science and theology are being overturned by
                            this inward voice; new degrees of light are springing up in every department of life. This
                            silent voice is even now teaching many truths of the "resurrection order" and spreading the
                            knowledge of the true way of life and salvation. It teaches that this way is only found by
                            following Him who was meek and lowly in spirit, who never builded with natural selfish
                                ties,<pb n="175" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> but taught both by precept and example that these must all be

                                    which are active at the close of this nineteenth century is this mighty wave of
                                    spiritual thought which, rising like the fabled phoenix from the very ashes of
                                    decaying empires, even back to the dim mists of eastern antiquity, but now freely
                                    breathing through the spirit of civil and religious liberty, sweeps majestically
                                    across our western republic, bringing new inspirations and aspirations to hundreds
                                    and thousands. This wave of living thought finds expression through the principles
                                    of Vegetarianism, Christianity, Temperance, Theosophy and Hygiene, as well as other
                                    true reforms and elevating movements which if you please, are like so many beautiful
                                    rivers, each from a seemingly different source, yet all bearing their draughts of
                                    intellectual refreshment toward the one infiuite ocean of uuity and truth. Dark and
                                    sad is the blot on this fair western civilization of the horrible cruelty and
                                    suffering inflicted in slaughterhouse and stock-pen, upoif the lower, but sentient
                                    creatures, and it reflects its debasing influences upon the inner natures of those
                                    engaged in performing the degrading details of revolting work. Is not this carnage
                                    for a needless purpose, when nature so lavishly repays the labor bestowed on her
                                    peaceful gardens with fruits, grains and vegetables, as the most harmonious blending
                                    of her four great elementals, earth, air, sun and water, the highest expressions on
                                    the plane of the vegetable kingdom, and the perfect food of man ? The Infiuite often
                                    furnishes the means with the opportunity to shape all human ends, and noble,
                                    thinking men and women are awakening to these truths all over our broad land from
                                    Maine to California, and from Canada to Florida and Texas. I believe that,
                                    co-existent with the development of the finer sensibilities, there is an almost
                                    unconscious loss of the desire for flesh foods ; and many are almost vegetariaus
                                    without knowing it. This may account for the popularity of those excellent
                                    dairy-restaurants in large cities. All is ready for this new form of truth ! Who
                                    will sow the seed by precept and example ? for as goes the West, so goes America ;
                                    and as America goes, so goes the future world. Let us for a moment glance backward
                                    far across the mystical bridge of time, and behold man in his ideal home, the Garden
                                    of Eden ; for reli-<pb n="176" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> gion, tradition and philosophy will agree
                                    that the primitive home of mtui was in a garden,�certainly not the slaughterhouse.

                                    celestial and earthly, with the attributes of an angel, and the tendencies of a
                                    brute, holding the temporary balaftce of individual to evolve in either direction.
                                    Disobeyiug the divine injunction which whispered to his psychic conscience, he was
                                    not content to subsist on fruits and grains (simple and primitive fare which nature
                                    offered unsullied by blood) but slew fowl and brute to minister to his perverted
                                    appetite, as if to destroy the ladder of life by whicli lie attained his superiority
                                    as lord of creation, entailing thereby misery on posterity, and being himself
                                    eventually driven from his beautiful garden home. This allegorical, yet truthful
                                    picture of man's tirst conditions affords a beautiful lesson, ibr as the first and

                            Room" in the land with the Manifesto so that those who would read may learn more of the true
                            faith for which all Christian men and women should earnestly contend, as was once delivered
                            unto the saints To do this is to manifest a love for all that is go^d, as all good comes
                            from the same and only fountain head, from which comes all our blessings. God is Love and
                            his children who dwell in his kingdom should be of love and light to those in darkness. We
                            cm never gain those who do not see as we do by heaping abuse upon them Because they cannot
                            or do not see as we do. It is evi dent to me that the first true followers that Mother Ann
                            and the Elders gathered with her into this blessed gospel, were such Christian men and women
                            as there are still tens of thousands in the laud seeking for the same blessed gospel. But if
                            we abuse such light as they may have and yet are not giving them any that is better, we will
                            not be able to gain them to the true light, as human nature to-day is as it was then. We
                            must teach them in love that the "meek only shall inherit the earth," and "those who do
                            hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled," and that "the merciful shall obtain
                            mercy," and that "the pure in heart only shall see God." We may learn a lesson from what
                            John said to the Master,�"We saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him,
                            because he followed not with us." To which Jesus said ; "For-<pb n="177" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> bid him
                            not for he that is not against us is for us." Again we learn that on another occasion Jesus
                            said, "other sheep I have which are not of this fold ; them also I must bring aud they shall
                            hear my voice, and they shall be one fold and one shepherd." The sheep of that other fold
                            are in the churches and are the oues to reach after. They should be taught the new and
                            living way, and we should give unto them the Mother,� Christ's gospel in love and meekness.
                            We should not make light of nor abuse what they may have. We must ktiow there is much
                            corruption and depravity of morals in and out of the churches of the land. So there is some
                            good and many noble principles of charity. Let us see more of the good and thank God for it
                            and labor to help them to promote the same. And as good ;-&gt;amaritans having compassion on
                            fallen humanity, stoop down to lift up the blind and weary and weak, sin-sick soul. Let us
                            have compassion on our fellow laborers in other portions of the Master's vineyard. They are
                            of that other fcld. Aud Jesus said;�"I am the good Shepherd and I know my sheep and they
                            follow me. And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish neither shall any
                            man pluck them out of my hand."

                            what inspiration he sings, Unaided by science, unskilled in art, 'Tis the voice of God in
                            his soul that sings And is more than a harp of a thousand strings." A question arises among
                            a certaiu class of utibelievers, Why is it that Shakers object to insti-umental music in
                            their religious worship? A query which is very readily answered, and, we think, may be
                            satisfactorily received. We are called to be a peculiar people, separate and distinct from
                            the world, in dress, in manners, and in language. Instrumental music is not peculiar, it is
                            commou. With this call comes a peculiar form of worship, given through divine revelation,
                            and, iu a measure, retained, which is indicative of the inner workings of the spirit of God
                            upon the individual. Where there are iu operation divers gifts, such as shaking, speaking in
                            tongues, turning, bowing, prophesying, and a variety of gifts, but all of the same spirit,
                            we will find place, though not with instrumental music; that would have a direct tendency to
                            check the flow of the spirit. The Quakers, who were once the chosen people of God, were
                            convinced of this, and were led by the spirit, to reject vocal music, as well as
                            instrumental, with all other forms and ceremonies existing in the orthodox churches. No
                            wonder they despised the steepled houses, with their costly cushioned pews, stained windows,
                            and elaborate ornaments, to attract the worldly minded, when the means for so doing were<pb n="178" id="p12" TEIform="pb"/> wrung out of the hard earnings of the poor laboring man and woman.
                            And not less, the priesthood, learned divines, made fat by their high salaries, whose
                            inspiration is drawn from colleges ; and a well paid choir, trained in musical science, who
                            can gracefully touch the notes of the pleasant sounding lyre, the melodion, piano, or the
                            organ, to the delight of their hearers, even though the player were a prostitute. We may
                            well sympathize with the early friends, in their disgust of all these usele.-s external
                            things, and for the great sacrifices they made for the advancement of the truth, and return
                            "honor to whom honor is due." They were martyrs ; their work is measurably done, but the
                            fruits of it remain never to be obliterated ! Believers are emanations from the same root,
                            with increased revelation. While the Quakers sat in the valley of the shadow of death,
                            waiting for the movings of the spirit, and for the guidance of the "inner light," the
                            silence iu Heaven "was broken," the Bride emerged from her closet, "in raiment clean and
                            white" and, "with the voice of a great thunder" shook the earthly elements in men and women
                            and revealed the hidden mystery of what, and wherein consisted man's loss from God, and how
                            he might return to native Edenic conditions. Earth could not then produce instruments only
                            in "earthen vessels," that could pour forth the sponta neous soulful strains of music, as
                            did our Mother Ann, and her little company, for their deliverance from the bondage of the
                            flesh ! Even could they have afforded it, how insignificant, how absurd, how out of place
                            would any sort of an instrument been to portray their joy ! As we look at it fallen human
                            nature is the same now as then ; it is cursed, cursed from the beginning, "above all the
                            beasts of the field." Aid we canuot rid ourselves of it in any other way than did Mother
                            Ann. "Dust shall be the serpent's meat." We need to find humiliation and mortification to
                            the perverse elements of the world, whereas instrumental music greatlv tends to attract and
                            please the serpentine nature, and cause it to lift up its haughty head from the dust, where
                            it needs to be trampled upon until bruised, and that will take a lifetime. In the meanwhile
                            we are exultant, aud glory in its death throes. Our thankfulness and joy find utterance in
                            song, corresponding to our manner of worship. Father Joseph realized a fulness of this when
                            in vision, he saw the armies of heaveu going forth in worship, attuned to heavenly songs. He
                            saw the order and beauty of the ranks of the redeemed, and rested not, day nor night, until
                            he had learned of them the step aud the measure ; this he committed as a legacy to his
                            people. In relinquishing some of the forms of exercise in worship, there is danger lest the
                            pendulum swing too far world-ward, aud we adopt customs and fashions that belong more to the
                            old creation, than to the new. In dress, in the furnishing of our houses, in eating and
                            drinking, in address, and especially in worship, let us be as unlike the wart ing,
                            generative world around us, as possible ! Mother's testimony causes souls to "worship God in
                            spirit and in truth." And we have no more use for a machine to grind out a tune for us, than
                            for a hireling minister to preach to us ; the two belong together, let them forever be
                            without the court!<pb n="179" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> Very many, not included in the fold, who are
                            spiritually illumined, find nothing but dry husks to feed their hungry souls, in the
                            orthodox churches, and, as they express it, "their worship is a dead form, without the
                            spirit; a sham, a hollow mockery ! Finely framed speeches, with a million dollar organ,"
                            they say, "cannot buy a passport to heaven, nor feed us with the bread of life. Your singing
                            is beautiful, because it is spiritual, there is an inspiration in it,' that gives life, and
                            touches the heart. Our fashionable music is so dressed up it does not find its way to the
                            soul." Oh, let us heed the cry of suffering humanity, and retain a v. orship that will meet
                            the demands of those seeking life that when they call for bread, we may not give them a
                            stone. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Give us this day our daily bread" TEIform="index"/> "Give us this day our daily bread."</head><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Calver, Amelia J."

                            kuees.' Thus said Victor Hugo, and thus we all feel, when day after day, some earnest prayer
                            so possesses our minds that wherever we turn, we see it in letters of gold, and with every
                            breath, we feel it emanating from the depths of our souls ; and words which before, may have
                            seemed meaningless, now speak volumes. This is the light in which I place these few words of
                            "Our Lord's Prayer :" "Give us this day our daily bread." It seems to me that the whole of
                            that beautiful prayer radiates, as from a common center from that impressive intercession.
                            Having bread the soul is nurtured, thus able to fully appreciate the trusting reverence,
                            submission, and the claim on forgiveness and protection, which the prayer contains. Taking
                            it in a material sense there is no one cry of suffering humanity, which so stirs the world
                            to its foundation, and which produces the commotions and revolutions, as when the famishing
                            multitude clamor for their daily bread ; and no entreaty, when misfortune deals out the
                            dreadful paugs of starvation, which is so promptly responded to by those able to give
                            relief. If then as said our Savior, "ye, being evil know how to give good gifts, how much
                            more shall our Father which is in heaven, give good gifts to them that ask Him." Observe the
                            strength, the breadth, the depth, of that simple prayer. "Give." O the trust. We ?.sk as if
                            expecting to receive. "Give us." No narrow limits bound that generous bounty. It is not
                            "Give me" but "Give ms." And we are so different in our needs. H&amp;w great the variety
                            of demands for natural food. The substantial repast for the travel-worn, and the laborer ;
                            the nerve-healing elixir of life for the wasting frame; the acid for the fever burnings, and
                            the bitter for the dissipated. Is it not thus with the spirit's food ? When we ask "Give
                            us," O the variety demanded. And still each kind is essential ; for one's needs cannot
                            supply the longing which fills the heart of another. The untiring worker craves the
                            substance, for work wearies and wears. The fainting and discouraged need the all-healing
                            power of love, to permeate the whole soul, regardless of, in their weakened condition, their
                            power to appreciate it; the restless, and<pb n="180" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> fever-excited by worldly
                            pleasures, are best checked by the acid of silent reproach, while the sin-sick gratefully
                            accept the bitterness of reproof. Again : "Give us this day." Here is an assurance of a
                            constant renewal; new food, ''sufficient for the day." Not a feast, and then a period of
                            hopeless starvation, but we are taught to ask every day. And "Give us this day our daily
                            bread," teaches us there is for every one an ever ready supply in our Father's storehouse,
                            which all have the right to claim. O blessed prayer ! May we ever treasure this as our hope,
                            our comfort; and whatever our needs, whatever our frailties, may we with a trusting
                            childlike confidence, ask : "Give us this day our daily bread," and find our souls supplied
                            with that bread of life, which "Our Father" through the ministration of the gospel can give
                            us. Mt. Lebanon, N.

TEIform="persName"/>Oliver C. Hampton.</byline><p TEIform="p">Well, here I am, and this is the year 18yO. What is my standing? For about th^ee score years
                            I have faithfully and strenuously abjured all worldly pleasures. Through much tribulation
                            and strong cries and tears I have so far fully triumphed over all sin and impurity and have
                            lived a self-sacrificing, communistic life. And what of all that? Nothing at all, if I
                            propose to stop there. I have gained a victory over an impatient, irascible and very high
                            temper. But if I am to do no more than that, I might as well never have begun a pilgrimage
                            to Heaven. For how about that sublime charity "that suffereth long and is kind, that envieth
                            not, vauuteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her
                            own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in
                            the truth. Beareth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things?" Surely when I look
                            over this bright constel* lation of perfections I feel that all boasting is not only utterly
                            excluded, but that I have scarcely commenced to walk in the way of holiness, and the words
                            of the rapt poet fill me with unspeakable solemnity� "The gospel now salutes mine ear, Like
                            thunder from the skies; Bids me commence my journey here, And to perfection rise."
                            Nevertheless, "This bright, this pure, this holy way, For ages hid from mortal eye, I'm
                            thankful I can walk this day With saints of the Most High. For prophets, Kings, and Holy
                            men, Did long to reach this light, Yet lingered out their days in pain, And died without the
                            sight." In view of all this what remains to me but the most profound humility? Surely
                            nothing. So let me now set out to be a follower of Christ and Mother, commencing the present
                            year to fill up that amazing hyatus between myself and that glorious state required by the
                            Holy Savior (viz.) "to be perfect even as our Heavenly Father is perfect." So long as any
                            motions of self remain I am far from having filled up the sufferings and discipline in
                            Christ which are yet behind, and which when completed will enable the spirit to say as Jesus
                            did, "I and the Father are one." So long as any injury, neglect or unjust estimate by
                            others, has the least tendency to afflict me, I am far<pb n="181" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/> enough from a
                            heavenly state, of atonement with God. So long as the least mite of unforgiveness remains iu
                            me, I lack just so much of being forgiven of God or my own conscience and caunot be in a
                            state of at-one-meut with Him. So long as I fail to recognize the lowest scullion in
                            creation just as worthy as myself of salvation and peace, 1 am still ''in the Gall of
                            bitterness." Because Jesus came eatiug and drinking they said '"he had a Devil" aud so he
                            had, but he subdued aud overcame it, ''being tempted in all points as we are and yet without
                            sin" and "'who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications
                            with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to save him from death, was heard in
                            that lie feared." So I solemnly and sacredly resolve, this new year to re-commence the work
                            of self-abnegation and devotion to the good of others more faithfully than ever before
                            "forgetting the tilings which are behind and pressing on to the prize of my high calling,"
                            iu God's service aud all human weal ; remembering for my consolation that "He that goeth
                            forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing
                            his sheaves witht him." P.-. cxxvi., 6.

                            </head><p TEIform="p">It would be quite unreasonable for us to sit in mourning and whine away the precious
                                hours of our life, because we were not in Jerusalem with Jesus, and privileged to hear
                                and enjoy the loving words which he gave to his disciples. And yet, some people will
                                fret away many hours of their precious lives over some things quite as foreign from the
                                duties of the present hour. They have the idea, "If I had lived, if I had seen, if I had
                                heard," and a score or more ifs, they would have been just right and not the unwilling
                                and unhappy resident of the earth in these last days when men are lovers of their own
                                selves, covetous, blas[)hemous, unthankful and unholy. The apostle could have no
                                hesitancy in saying that such a state of Society should exist in the latter days, for
                                the days in which he lived were designated as the latter days, and the apostles had
                                informed the church that anti-christ had already made his appearance. From the days of
                                Cain, men had been disobedient to parents, covetous and blasphemous. These states seem
                                to have exercised a predominant influence in the crude, selfish man, and even at this
                                late date, there are strong indications that such a state will exist for some time to
                                come. Better conditions can be formed, only by a better discipline over our own selfish,
                                worldly lives. If the kingdom of heaven is like the sower who went forth to sow some
                                seed, then for us to be in harmony with that kingdom, as children of light we must be in
                                active service, and engaged in the same occupation. While the sowing of seed is a matter
                                of such special importance to those who look forward for an anticipated harvest, it
                                might be advisable to give careful attention to the kind and quality of seed we are
                                sowing. Not all who are apparent heirs of salvation and include themselves among the
                                children of light are so discriminating as to be positive of the seed they sow even in
                                this vital, Christian work. The two disciples in their zeal for the teacher were led to
                                ask that fire might come down<pb n="183" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> from heaven, as it came down in the
                                days of Elijah, and destroy those men who were healing the sick, simply because they
                                were not engaged in the name of their little church. And yet these two disciples were
                                children of the light, heirs of the promise of salvation. They were evidently good men
                                and zealous in good works, but in this instance they were sowing some of their old seed
                                of selfishness and ignorance. Jesus palliated their error as well as he could, and then
                                gave them a consistent rule for their future guidance. It may be very much to our
                                advantage that our race takes the precedence of all others in the creation of our God.
                                We glory in having progressive and inventive minds. We can determine what may be and
                                what should be. Although we have accepted a standard by which to act there is often a
                                strong inclination to interweave something that bears a close resemblance to our own
                                individuality. If we carry with us the good seed of the kingdom, the spirit power of
                                God, it will be that of the pure in heart, of the meek, of the merciful and of the
                                peace-maker. In our labors for God and his kingdom much of this may fall on stony ground
                                or among those who are absorbed in the interests of this world, and fail to return
                                anything that may prove valuable in the time of harvest. But that which may chance to
                                fall on good soil and, indeed much of it must, will bear an abundant harvest of good and
                                precious fruit. There: can be no failure to-day of the promises of God, any more than
                                there has been in the past if we work in his love and in his spirit. The encouraging
                                gift of inspiration which the prophet received, is well worth our attention. There was a
                                blessing for the man that kept his hand from doing any evil and for those who should
                                honor the Lord, ''not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
                                thine own wTords." Although this was not particularly acceptable to the people of th it
                                day, any more than it would be to the present generation, the prophet, in order to
                                confirm them in the spirit value of his advice, added these emphatic words :�"Behold the
                                Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save ; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot
                                hear." The difficulty was not on the side of God and his promises, and indeed, it never
                                can be. If our union with that which is pure and holy is by walking uprightly before God
                                and man, then our separation from that which is pure must be by our departure from an
                                upright life. In this there is no mystery, for the gospel of Christ is a savor of life
                                unto life, to all who abide in it.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="saying" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Is it not a sin to discourage any branch of God's work..." TEIform="index"/>

Lebanon, N. Y.</head><p TEIform="p">North. Family. July 10; 1890. The July Manifesto came smiling along, bright and early,
                                iind renewing our interest at home and abruad. Mother's counsel was very wise, to do
                                everything in its season; to heed this we have no time to lose. The seasons roll round
                                so close one after another that it requires constant diligence to keep up with them. We
                                no sooner get through with seedtime, than we have to commence harvesting. To have every
                                set of tools all in readiness for the season, is arming ourselves beforehand; and saves
                                a great deal of fret and worry. The best way, we find, is, at the close of each season
                                to put the machines and tools all in working order before they are stored away. We shall
                                attend to this, or try to, in the future better than we have sometimes in the past. Old
                                Time is everlastingly working away, taking the polish off, and using the influence of
                                the elements to bring all man-made things down to one general level. A few years ago we
                                painted and fixed up till we thought we were pretty nice; but now when we come to look
                                round we find we are getting quite dingy. So with the help of angel Sisters we have
                                started to polish up again. Are now engaged painting our buildings ; righting up
                                chimneys, fences and things in general. This necessitates the hiring of extra help;
                                which always brings additional burden. We are trying the plan of hiring by the day, and
                                have them board themselves. It may cost a little more one way, but I think we gain it in
                                another. It pays well to look after the interest of our sisterhood. They can then the
                                better look after the interest of the brotherhood. Are now in hay harvest; which is
                                excellent where the land is rich. Potato bugs, and weeds call, and have to be attended
                                to. Br. Charles Greave's fertilizer machine is a grand affair for putting plaster with
                                paris green, on potatoes. I wish we were situated as are our good friends at Alfred,
                                down in Maine; that is be able to do our own work. And I also wish that every man had
                                land of his own to work upon. Our forefathers in the gospel were very zealous in their
                                day, and wanted to do all in their power to redeem the earth; thinking that all the land
                                Believers owned was being redeemed by consecration, they tried to buy all that joined
                                them, as far as possible, and consecrate it to the Lord. But alas, in many cases it has
                                become a burden grievous to be borne. We have recently had the privilege of seeing the
                                beloved Ministry from Maine and some of our gospel friends from Groveland. I wish we
                                could see more of them from near and afar. Who can tell the great amount of good that is
                                imparted and received by the visiting of gospel relation one with another? I can tell of
                                much good I have received, and I know many who have been blest in this way. If we have
                                really forsaken the natural, according to the example of Jesus and the founders of our
                                order, we have a right to cultivate the spiritual; and is it not our duty so to do? It
                                was said of Jesus "for the joy set before him he endured the cross." For the joy with
                                his heavenly Father, and sweet communion with angels did he forsake his earthly kindreds
                                and relationships; so with us ; if we have no joy set before us of our Heavenly Mother,
                                and communion with the household of faith, will there not be some danger of our turning
                                earthward. "We'll waft a waft of love thro' Zion, To our kindred everywhere. We'll shout
                                a shout of gospel blessing, That angels on their wings will bear. Over mountain over
                                valley, Over plain and flowing rill, Wf'll extend the gift of union, Till our kindred it
                                doth fill." In kindest love, Daniel Offord. Center Family. Beloved Elder Henry :�Our
                                cherry crop which is nearly all gathered proved better than we expected and prices were

                                market beside what Shaker Village produced. Brethren expect to finish haying (weather
                                being good) to-morrow, the crop is very heavy and of good quality.<pb n="185" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/>
                                Our Society Meeting commenced the second Sabbath in June and was opened to the public
                                for the first time this season last Sunday. We had a select audience who were very
                                respectful and attentive an.l why should they not be? Health of family and Society quite
                                good, the weather is warm and dry. Potatoes are suffering for want of rain and will be a
                                light crop unless we get some pretty soon. Fraternally yours, T. Kayson. Soixtli
                                ITa-mily. Dear Editor :�Time is money just now, but we must boil down a few lines for
                                you, or the blessed Manifesto. Since writing before, our people have painted two hundred
                                windows so will not have that bill to pay but have not finished yet. Last week good
                                brother Henry Mantle and two of our Sisters returned from Watervliet with a great deal
                                of love and were very much refreshed ; well tried Elder Alexander Work, and two Sisters
                                from Groveland were there at the time which made it very pleasant all around. The
                                Manifesto reminds me of a good dinner it takes longer to prepare it than to devour it
                                but we get hungry and want more. We at Mt. Lebanon do not know how to be thankful enough
                                for the large supply of water we have had, since hearing Elder Alexander tell of the
                                scarcity at Groveland. They came here to take the Census last week, and they wanted more
                                than we could give. We are picking cherries, but have a small crop. S. A. C.</p></div3><div3 type="shaker-report" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Hancock, Massachusetts" TEIform="index"/> Hancock, Mass.</head><p TEIform="p">July, 1890.

                                and some Bible Class papers; also answers to Bible question No. 8, but they must have
                                gone astray or been mislaid, as our Society was not mentioned in the answers. But I do
                                not mean to be discouraged, you perceive, but "try, try again.'' Bible question No. 9,
                                requires much .thought and research, but several have p-epared answers which I enclose.
                                We thank you for providing this nice plan, inciting to the study of the Scriptures. The
                                young people all feel an interest in it, and look fur the column devoted to the Bible
                                Class as soon as the Manifesto is received The Ministry from Alfred, Me., arrived here
                                early in the afternoon of June 25th. and remained with us till near the close of the
                                next day, when they crossed the mountain to beautiful Mt. Lebanon. Their stay, though so
                                short, was greatly enjoyed by us. The next day we were pleased to welcome Sisters Ella
                                Winship and Elizabeth Sidle with whom we spent two very pleasant days. I wish I could
                                tell you something more interesting, but one day is much like another, as mine are spent
                                in the school-room, which is�oh, so warm these summer days. Sometimes of an afternoon,
                                when we can endure it no longer, we ta'ke our books and sit for an hour in the grove
                                near by. The children learn quite as good lessons and enjoy it very much. Our first term
                                of school will close in two weeks. Br. Ira is having an addition built on the East end
                                of the Office barn, thirty-six ft. long and twenty- four ft. wide and three stories
                                high. It is now nearly completed. It is the intention, I think, to lay a bridge over the
                                brook opposite the barn which will prevent the necessity of passing before the office
                                with loads of hay, etc. I will send three Bible Class papers in another envelope Please

                                make the best of everything, and not be cast down by frequent trials and burdens. A
                                beautiful rule to govern our lives is to look only on the bright sidi.' of life. Many of
                                life's sorrows are just as dark as we make them, and no darker. A good way is to do no
                                more than we can do well. It is the best work that pays best in the end. Weeds rob us of
                                the results of our work and the fertilizer we have used to help the crop that we want,
                                and farming is a struggle against them. We must not weary in well doing, but keep
                                courage to fight them to the end. Plant food costs too much to let it go to waste. Spare
                                the weeds and spoil the crop. Our field of ten acres of cabbage looks well, and there
                                will be some cabbage to sell. The Rubicon carrot is well worthy of cultivation. Our
                                Eureka mower, with six feet cutter bar, does good work. Coal ashes sifted in the

                                few words! Who realh lives up to the injunction? We do not understand the counsel to
                                mean literally that one must do all he sees to be done each day, as this would be an
                                impossibility, but to make the proper selection of duties each day which shall exclude
                                indolence and procrastination will be satisfactory. We spoke in our last of too much of

                                Here let us ask the Sisters who read the Manifesto if they have tried the nice way of
                                saving rhubarb for the early season of 1891? Before the stalks have grown to form an
                                objectionable skin, cut the flesh in small, say inch pieces, and place in perfect<pb n="187" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> self-sealing cans, filling them to the brim with ice-cold water.
                                Screw the tops down immediately and you will find at the close of a twelve month, if
                                your experience is like ours, that you have a nice article which you may stew and
                                sweeten for the table, as though fresh from the garden. Among the singing birds that
                                visited Central N. EL, this season, we had one family of the Purple Grosbeak, Carpodacus
                                purpureus. In some localities this is known as the Purple Linnet. Its sweet song and
                                beautiful plumage, would make it a great favorite, among those who are interested in the

                                with valuable instruction, making clear to any thoughtful mind, that the Communistic
                                principle, consequently the celibate life, (as the "my and mine" element could not exist
                                there,) must be the foundation of the true Christ life. These vital points are discussed
                                too little, and we suggest that the basic, essential principles upon which our faith is
                                founded be concisely formulated, and make a standard article in tjie Manifesto every
                                month, as it i&amp; constantly passing into new hands. We have admired the
                                Universalists' plan in thus doing and why should not our Church do likewise? It is true,
                                people who cannot execute their plans, should be slow in suggesting, yet, we are always
                                pleased when any one attacks a principle, and elucidates for the benefit of our young
                                people, as well as strangers to our Order. Our Society enjoyed a pleasant and profitable
                                open air meeting on July 4th. Remembering that Jesus very aptly said on an appropriate
                                occasion, "Render unto Ceasar the things that are Ceasar"s," we tried to render unto the
                                Fathers and Mothers of this great free country, the honor due them, and it proved very
                                interesting. The children gave extracts from History relative to the struggle for
                                freedom, with music and singing interspersed, and they, no doubt, received a lasting
                                impression, that liberty of conscience was bought with a price, and that through this
                                Declaration of Independence, and separation of Church and State, it was made possible
                                for the founders of the Shaker church to obey their convictions of duty. Supper was
                                served under the trees, afu-r which we sang America and adjourned, with the firm
                                conviction, that notwithstanding it costs something to arrange for such a gathering, in
                                discipline and change of thought it pays. E.

                                ill report and storms of good report and storms of electric report. A high storm of the
                                aforesaid character passed by this way on a June night, snuffing out the life of an old
                                and reliable cherry tree of nineteenth century fame. After completing its mission of
                                destruction the storm thundered" on its way with lightning rapidity and soon we were
                                ushered into the music of silence that immediately followed. We are again encountering
                                another fruit famine year. It is now evident that our apple produce will prove a
                                universal failure. A few bushels may be procured, may be not that, and may be again a
                                little more. Yet all seem blighted, turning brown And falling daily to the ground. With

                                and the best methods for accumulating the greatest profits from hen enterprise. We know
                                just a little about their peculiar requirements of diet, etc., etc. so will tell it to

                                descending upon us of late? From the 21st. to the 24th. ult. we enjoyed a rich feast of

                                Spirit. In our services on the 22nd. these impromptu lines were deeply impressed on the
                                mind of the writer.<pb n="189" id="p23" TEIform="pb"/> It is heaven's choicest blessing, To meet with

                                the importance of the day, were addressed to a large audience. Elder Napoleon Brown was
                                on the list of speakers, and many of the audience were deeply impressed as he told of
                                his travel "Out of darkness into light." Also some choice recitations were spoken by the
                                children and Br. J. W. Pilkington and children sang some pretty songs. We enjoyed a
                                bountiful lunch spread in a shady grove overlooking the Kentucky r.ver. In this siciun
                                there seems to be quite a revival in S. S. work. Sister Eliza Carpenter and her busy

                                        that should not be forgotten. We say all fruit, and the statement must be
                                        understood to include the pellicle of kernels and nuts of all kinds. The edible
                                        part of fruit is peculiarly delicate, and liable to rapid decomposition if
                                        exposed to the atmosphere : it is, therefore, a wise provision of nature to
                                        place a strong and impervious coating over it, as a protection against accident,
                                        and to protect insect enemies from destroying the seed within. The skin of plums
                                        is wonderfully strong compared with its thickness, and resists the action of
                                        water and many solvents in a remarkable manner. If not thoroughly masticated
                                        before taken into the stomach, this skin is rarely, if ever, dissolved by the
                                        gastric juice. In some cases, pieces of it adhere to the coats of the stomach as
                                        wet paper clings to bodies, causing more or less disturbance or inconvenience.
                                        Raisins and dried currants are particularly troublesome in this way, and, if not
                                        chopped up before cookine:, should be thoroughly chewed before swallowing. If a

                                    if they contain soap all other ingredients are useless except for the purpose of
                                    making their taste agreeable. Among the soaps the white castile soap of the English
                                    market is especially to be recommended. Testing the composition of them, we find
                                    that about 90 per cent are not only unsuitable for their purpose, but that the
                                    greater part are actually harmful. All the preparations containing salicylic acid
                                    are, as the investigations of Fernier have shown, destructive to the teeth. He who

                                    Upon a, Street Urchin. Several winters ago, says the Congregationalist, a woman was
                                    coming out of a public building when the heavy door swung back and made egress
                                    somewhat difficult. A little street urchin sprang to the rescue, and as he held open
                                    the door she said, "Thank you," and passed on. '�D'ye hear that?" said the boy to a
                                    companion standing near by. "No; what?" "Why, that lady in sealskin said 'thank ye'
                                    to the likes o' me." Amused at the conversation, which she could not help
                                    overhearing, the lady turned round and said to the boy : "It always pays to be
                                    polite, my boy; remember that." Years passed away, and last December, when doing her
                                    Christmas shopning, this lady received an exceptional courtesy from a clerk in
                                    Boston, which caused her to remark to a friend who was with her : "What a great
                                    comfort to he civilly treated once in a while�though I don't knew that 1 blame the
                                    store elorks for being rude during the holiday trade." The young man's quick ear
                                    caught the words, and he said : "Pardon me madam, but you gave me my first lesson in
                                    politeness a few years ago." The lady looked at him in amazement, while he related
                                    the little forgotten incident, and told her that the simple "thanfc you" awakened
                                    his first ambition to be something in the world. He went the next morning and
                                    applied for a situation as office boy in the establishment where he was now an
                                    honored clerk. Only two words dropped into the treasury of a street conversation,
                                    but they yielded returns of a certain kind more satisfactory than investments,

                                    money. She spends for what she believes to be beauty�for raiment, books, jewels,
                                    decoration, furniture, pictures, marbles� rarely for what does her serious harm. He
                                    spends most for his vices, for the things that hurt him greatly. He is apt to
                                    gamble, to speculate, to bring evil to others from his love of pleasure or of gain.
                                    He will get rid of more money in a month than she would in years. She would, however
                                    ignorant of it be appalled by the sums he dissipates. She is constitutionally
                                    conservative; big statements of any sort a.re likely to alarm her. Unless desperate
                                    or frenzied, she invariably stops short of extremes. She trembles and turns pale
                                    where he, in the flush of egotism, moves undisturbed. Nearly all the talk of woman's
                                    carelessness of money is really idle. The opinion cannot be sustained. It is mainly
                                    the echo of misapprehension. Where she is even partially enlightened on the subject,
                                    she is prone to be very cautious in its use. Her temperamental tendency is to the

                                    may be made somewhat uneasy when they learn of the methods to which the missionaries
                                    resort to maintain their foothold and push tin ir propaganda, but it appears to have
                                    come to be a question of life or death with the mission stations, and few persons
                                    would go so far, probably, as to blame them for employing carnal weapons to defend
                                    their helpless charges against their slave-hunting adversaries. It does seem a
                                    little strange, at first, to read that the missionaries at Lake Tanganyika have
                                    built a fort and surrounded it with thorn-bushes and barbed wire, and scattered
                                    broken bottles on the ground to make things interesting for hostile savages. That
                                    certainly was not one of the objects specified when the funds were raised to send
                                    the missionaries to the Dark Continent. But it should be remembered that the
                                    missionaries have no one to protect them. England and Germany are too busy just at
                                    present trying to outdo each other in trade and politics to give much attention to
                                    such impracticable persons. The indignation of the missionaries at finding that the
                                    Arab slavecatchers are armed with guns of English manufacture is safely pardonable.
                                    This English practice of putting weapons into the hands of the enemy is somewhat
                                    akin to the habit our frontier traders had some years ago of furnishing Indian
                                    warriors with the latest things out in the way of repeating rities,�these rifles
                                    frequently figuring thereafter in raids and skirmishes to the discomfiture of the
